5|$|On 29 November 2014, the admin of {{the page}} {{announced}} his retirement on Facebook. He stated that he was leaving the page for personal reasons, but that Valor por Tamaulipas would continue under new management. That person, he said, had some relationship with law enforcement. The admin believes {{that this would be}} of benefit for the cyber community because it would allow for citizen reports to reach law enforcement directly. The admin also announced that the pages Responsabilidad, Fortaleza, and Valor por la Huasteca would go under new management too. The new management would be composed of people who he deemed trustworthy given their long history of support or because they had suffered a loss {{as a result of the}} violence. In a <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> he bid farewell by thanking God for bringing happiness to his personal and professional life. In the comment section of the Facebook post, many people thanked the admin for his support. Some of them, however, expressed their concerned with the new administration given his/her relationship with the government.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{tried to}} get {{surviving}} members of the crew to admit they were in Kentucky only to photograph poor people, asking if they intended to photograph more prosperous parts of the state. The defense also {{wanted to know how}} much money they had been paid from the filming. Ison's lawyer used his <b>closing</b> <b>statement</b> to speak more about the intrusiveness of reporters than his client's actions. Nevertheless, the only legal issue was Ison's sanity. A psychiatrist testifying for the defense identified Ison as a paranoid schizophrenic, but a prosecution psychiatrist contradicted this.|$|E

25|$|A {{debate between}} John Howard and Mark Latham was {{televised}} commercial-free on the Nine Network at 7:30pm on Sunday 12 September. In {{a change from}} previous election debates, which involved a single moderator, the leaders were questioned by a five-member panel representing each of the major media groups in Australia. There was a representative from commercial television (Laurie Oakes), the ABC (Jim Middleton), News Limited (Malcolm Farr), John Fairfax Holdings (Michelle Grattan) and radio (Neil Mitchell). After an opening address, Howard and Latham responded to questions posed by the panel and {{had the opportunity to}} make a <b>closing</b> <b>statement.</b> The Nine Network permitted other television organisations to transmit the feed, but only the ABC chose to.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, January 29, {{the prosecution}} delivered a 40-minute closing argument. Blagojevich then delivered his 47-minute closing arguments in defense. Among Blagojevich's statement were continuing reminders {{that he believed}} the process to be tainted {{because it did not}} allow him to call witnesses or challenge the evidence (although, as the Chicago Tribune reported two days earlier, the process did in fact allow the governor to call witnesses and challenge the evidence, but Blagojevich had done neither by the deadline). The prosecution then made a 12-minute rebuttal. Blagojevich did not remain in the Statehouse for the prosecution's rebuttal speech or the vote on his impeachment. After giving his <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> Blagojevich immediately left Springfield to return to his Chicago home aboard an official state aircraft. Had Blagojevich remained in Springfield for his impeachment, he would have been immediately ineligible to be transported on state aircraft as he would no longer be Governor—he would have been stranded in Springfield, responsible for his own transportation home.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the attack}} {{had taken place}} on Federal property, Wise ordered that Brown and his men should be tried in Virginia in Charles Town, the nearby county seat capital of Jefferson County just seven miles west of Harpers Ferry (perhaps to avert Northern {{political}} pressure on the Federal government, or {{in the unlikely event}} of a presidential pardon). The trial began October 27, after a doctor pronounced the still-wounded Brown fit for trial. Brown was charged with murdering four whites and a black, with conspiring with slaves to rebel, and with treason against Virginia. A series of lawyers were assigned to Brown, who included Lawson Botts, Thomas C. Green, Samuel Chilton, a lawyer from Washington D.C., and George Hoyt, but it was Hiram Griswold, a lawyer from Cleveland, Ohio, who concluded the defense on October 31. In his <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> Griswold argued that Brown could not be found guilty of treason against a state to which he owed no loyalty and of which he was not a resident, and that Brown had not personally killed anyone himself, and also that the failure of the raid indicated that Brown had not conspired with slaves. Andrew Hunter, the local district attorney, presented the closing arguments for the prosecution.|$|E

500|$|In the United States, {{following}} {{independence from}} Great Britain, the phrase was not commonly used. However, {{when the first}} death sentence was passed in Taos County, New Mexico, the judge used the phrase but immediately followed it with a statement that the court would not be responsible for asking [...] "an all wise providence" [...] to do something the jury could not do due to the American principle of {{separation of church and}} state. In the 19th century, due to American law moving away from moral judgments based on Christian principles towards the principle of a judgment that was [...] "beyond reasonable doubt", the phrases [...] "not having the fear of God before your eyes" [...] and [...] "may God have mercy upon your soul" [...] were the very few remainders within the American court system of the British colonial morality-based trials. Despite this, [...] "may God have mercy on your soul" [...] {{has been used as a}} <b>closing</b> <b>statement</b> in modern times by American judges when passing a sentence of death. Sometimes as it is mandated by state law, other times as a result of legal tradition. For example, in 2011, it was used when a judge sentenced a murderer to death in South Dakota. A version of the phrase was used by [...] a Florida judge when Aileen Wuornos was sentenced to death, the judge in this case stated [...] "and may God have mercy on your corpse".|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the novel}} have been {{generally}} positive. Gilbert Cruz of Entertainment Weekly gave the novel an [...] "A" [...] rating, commenting {{that the novel}} shared with great zombie stories {{the use of a}} central metaphor, describing it as [...] "an addictively readable oral history." [...] Steven H. Silver identified Brooks' international focus as the novel's greatest strength and commented favorably on Brooks' ability to create an appreciation for the work needed to combat a global zombie outbreak. Silver's only complaint was with [...] "Good-Byes"—the final chapter—in which characters get a chance to give a final <b>closing</b> <b>statement.</b> Silver felt that it was not always apparent who the sundry, undifferentiated characters were. The Eagle described the book as being [...] "unlike any other zombie tale" [...] as it is [...] "sufficiently terrifying for most readers, and not always in a blood-and-guts way, either." [...] Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club stated that the format of the novel makes it difficult for it to develop momentum, but found the novel's individual episodes gripping. Patrick Daily of the Chicago Reader said the novel transcends the [...] "silliness" [...] of The Zombie Survival Guide by [...] "touching on deeper, more somber aspects of the human condition." [...] In his review for Time Out Chicago, Pete Coco declared that [...] "ending horror to the form of alternative history would have been novel in and of itself. Doing so in the mode of Studs Terkel might constitute brilliance." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to the previous debate on CNN running over three hours in length, the top two highest-polling candidates - Donald Trump and Ben Carson - teamed up in a threatened boycott of the CNBC debate. They demanded that the debate be limited to no longer than two hours, and also that opening and <b>closing</b> <b>statements</b> be included in those two hours; otherwise, if these conditions were not met, both Trump and Carson would withdraw from the debate. On October 16, CNBC announced that it had accepted the demands of Trump and Carson, setting the two-hour maximum and allowing for opening and <b>closing</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The debate {{consisted}} of separate confrontations involving only two leaders at a time, therefore not all candidates {{were asked to}} address every issue. [...] The leaders made opening statements in French and <b>closing</b> <b>statements</b> in English. The first 30 minutes were almost entirely in French.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the debates}} can feature the {{candidates}} standing behind their podiums, or in conference tables with the moderator on the other side.

2500|$|The three Republican {{candidates}} met for {{a debate}} at the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville on June 29, 2006. [...] All three candidates expressed skepticism regarding {{global warming and}} recent publication of scientific consensus on the issue, supported continued American involvement in Iraq, opposed income tax increases, and [...] "showed varying degrees of interest in replacing the federal income tax with a national sales tax," [...] prompting Corker to state in his <b>closing</b> <b>statement</b> [...] "here's not any difference, that I can tell, on the issues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Irving also subpoenaed the {{diplomatic}} historian Donald Cameron Watt {{and the military}} historian John Keegan to testify in his case against Lipstadt; both men had refused an earlier offer to testify for Irving {{on their own and}} appeared to be very reluctant on the stand. Rather than focus on the defence's evidence against him, or on whether or not Lipstadt had defamed him, Irving seemed to focus mainly on his [...] "right to free speech". In his <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> Irving claimed to have been a victim of an international, mostly Jewish, conspiracy for more than three decades.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final day}} of {{testimony}} came on June 18.

[...] Other portraits, photographs, and documents were introduced in an attempt to prove the existence of Don Miguel and his family. [...] Closing arguments were presented the next day. [...] The government waived the right to a <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> feeling the presented evidence was strong enough to prove their case. [...] Reavis used the opportunity to introduce a bill of 52 objections.|$|E

5000|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the {{introduction}} of this new terminology was to make the system easier for programmers. It isolated them from a lot of the underlying technology.

2500|$|Bradford was put {{on trial}} in 1988, during which he fired his lawyer, opting to act as his own counsel. During the phase of the trial in which Bradford acted as his own attorney, he offered no {{evidence}} or arguments as to his innocence. The prosecution identified Bradford as a serial killer {{during the course of}} the trial, but offered no information on murders aside from those of Miller and Campbell. In his <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> Bradford implied that he had murdered several other women in addition to Campbell and Miller: [...] "Think of how many you don't even know about. You are so right. That's it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dax, {{who was a}} {{criminal}} defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial. The trial however, is a farce, and can accurately {{be described as a}} kangaroo court where the rights of the accused are violated. There is no formal written indictment, a court stenographer is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his <b>closing</b> <b>statement,</b> Dax challenges the court's authenticity, and requests mercy, saying, [...] "Gentlemen of the court, to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die." [...] Nonetheless, the three men are sentenced to death.|$|E
2500|$|The trial {{lasted from}} 1–23 April 1913.

The New York Times {{reported that she}} had uttered 210,000 words and had asked 20,000 questions of 34 witnesses. The case apparently broke records {{for the number of}} words. The judge, Mr. Justice Bucknill, said Lind af Hageby had cross-examined as well as any barrister could have done. [...] "Her final speech was a very fine one," [...] he said.
