40|$|The Upper Silesian Agglomeration is {{the most}} industrialized area in Poland {{and one of the}} most in Europe. It is {{situated}} in the eastern part of the Upper Silesia and covers nearly 1500 km 2. This region is highly diverse in terms of the spatial structure. There are lots of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> besides built-up areas and industrial facilities. Many of them have also significance for nature. <b>Water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Upper Silesian Agglomeration function under anthropogenic conditions. <b>Water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have a different size and the genesis. This kind of occurrence conditions influences the water reservoirs` state. There are mainly <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of anthropogenic character in a study area. A lot of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are strictly connected with coal exploitation in this region. Unfortunately, the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the cities of the Upper Silesian Agglomeration has lately decreased. Reservoirs are eliminated as a result of changes in industry, progressive land development, changes in environmental conditions. In this paper we present the results of the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> analysis in Katowice, Sosnowiec and Chorzów over the period 1993 - 2014. Field studies and analysis of topographic maps show a decrease in the number of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in this region by tens of percent...|$|R

40|$|The paper resumes the {{investigation}} of transformation of watershed flow off caused by retention volumes of small <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (SWR) in landscape. Based on our work experience {{in the field of}} <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> design and research, we know that simple system of even small fishponds disposes of nonnegligible free retention volume. We decided to verify this assumption with aid of exact determination of discharge transformation within the basin containing realized system of small <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The input <b>water</b> management data for design of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are represented by water discharge in existing stream related to the point of designed SWR. In the Czech Republic, the data are provided by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI), however the data refer to an unaffected discharges, i. e. without consideration of transformation effects of existing small <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> within the basin. Although the total available volume for transformation purposes of investigated SWR system is relatively small, the results show the transformation effect of such reservoirs is not insignificant. Furthermore the transformation effect is raised by proper design and functionality of the whole system of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs...</b>|$|R

For the first time, the presence of lysozyme - antilysizyme system of the hydrobionts {{in the formation of}} the water biocenoses has been justified. The system of lysozyme - antilysozyme microorganisms has been used in the bioindication of the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> condition.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{weighted}} linear combination (WLC) and fuzzy logic (FL) models in identifying the most suitable location for a <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the area of Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia. First of all, parameters important to a <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> for the studied area were identified. Then maps of the study area were prepared and integrated. The main criteria selected for this study are pipe line, elevation, rive, land use, road network, water supply network, and slope. Suitable locations for the <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> were selected using each model. The results of this study indicated that the FL method in the early stages had better decision-making powers for locating <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> sites when compared to the WLC method. The appropriate places for <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> construction based on two models were located to the northwest and west of the study area. The two models are validated using the Kappa index. According to the results of the validation method, the map produced by the FL method exhibits satisfactory properties in the study area. Thus, it can be concluded that the results derived from two models (WLC and FL) integrated in ArcGIS can be a useful tool in GIS analysis for the determination of suitable locations for <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the study area...|$|R

40|$|The {{high-capacity}} tensiometer {{developed by}} Ridley and Burland in 1993 is {{a milestone in}} experimental unsaturated soil mechanics. This device, which relies on development of tension in an enclosed water body, permits direct measurement of negative water potential. Many tensiometers have been built since 1993, all being {{based on the same}} principle although the design may differ slightly from the original. In particular, the common characteristic is a very small <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> that {{is believed to be the}} location of bubble nucleation, a phenomenon referred to as cavitation that impedes the sensor from functioning properly. Many have studied cavitation and different explanations or cavitation mechanisms have been proposed. However, all the considerations put forward were derived without being able to capture what happened inside the <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> at cavitation. This is now achieved with the new tensiometer specifically designed to “see” inside the <b>water</b> <b>reservoir</b> during suction measurement. For the first time, cavitation has been captured via high-speed photography and the mechanisms of cavitation can be explained using physical evidence. The first outcome is that it is possible for a high-capacity tensiometer to function to its full range with a large <b>water</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Then, the analysis of high-speed photographs reveals that the bubbles triggering cavitation are nucleated in the ceramic and make their way to the <b>water</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Cavitation occurs only when the air phase reaches the <b>water</b> <b>reservoir...</b>|$|R

40|$|The abrupt {{changes in}} the streamflow and {{sediment}} load at nine hydrological stations of the Pearl River basin were systematically analysed by using the simple two-phase linear regression scheme and the coherency analysis technique. Possible underlying causes were also discussed. Our study results indicated that abrupt {{changes in the}} streamflow occurred mainly in the early 1990 s. The change points were followed by significant decreasing streamflow. Multiscale abrupt behaviour of the sediment load classified the hydrological stations into two groups: (1) Xiaolongtan, Nanning and Liuzhou; and (2) Qianjiang, Dahuangjiangkou, Wuzhou, Gaoyao, Shijiao and Boluo. The grouped categories implied obvious influences of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on the hydrological processes of the Pearl River. On the basis of analysis of the locations and the construction time of the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and also {{the time when the}} change points occurred, we figured out different ways the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> impacted the hydrological processes within the Pearl River basin. As for the hydrological variation along the mainstream of the Pearl River, the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have considerable influences on both the streamflow and sediment load variations; however, more influences seemed to be exerted on the sediment load transport. In the North River, the hydrological processes seemed to be influenced mainly by climate changes. In the East River, the hydrological variations tended to be impacted by the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The study results also indicated no fixed modes when we address the influences of <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on hydrological processes. Drainage area and regulation behaviour of the <b>water</b> <b>reservoirs</b> should be taken into account. The results of this study will be of considerable importance for the effective water resources management of the Pearl River basin under th...|$|R
