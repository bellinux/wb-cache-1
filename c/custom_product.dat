HP’s calculator engineers, who wanted a similar but more robust product for the 9800 series calculators, contributed IC fabrication experience from their 4-kbit ROM project to help improve Intel DRAM’s reliability, operating-voltage, and temperature range. These efforts contributed to the heavily enhanced Intel 1103 1-kbit pMOS DRAM, which was the world’s first commercially available DRAM IC. It was formally introduced in October 1970, and became Intel’s first really successful product.|$|E

40|$|Product {{recommendation}} {{system has been}} widely used in industry especially for e-Commerce companies {{to solve the problem}} of information overload. Nonetheless, information overload is also a severe issue in <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> development practice. Sometimes customers can easily get overwhelmed by the vast number of product varieties and it is hard for them to make choices. However, the established product recommendation approaches are primarily for off-the-shelf products, adaptation for custom products has been difficult due to the different scenarios of <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> design. In this paper, a new recommendation method for <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> design is proposed based on probabilistic relevance model. The idea is to calculate the probability that each product meets an active customer's specifications based on partial product specifications given by the customer. Then the recommendation is presented according to the ranking of probabilities of relevance. Experiments are carried out and the result shows that the presented approach can improve the recommendation efficiency significantly comparing with random recommendation. © 2009 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Computer-aided Design (CAD) and Computer-aided Manufacturing (CAM) play an {{important}} role during the design and production phase of a product. CAD allows for generation of two and three-dimensional models of the product with the help of solid modelers and CAM allows for production planning of the product using tools such as a CAM package. Both CAD and CAM tools are highly specialized in nature {{and at the same time}} expensive to own. Large industries can afford to own such systems and experts to operate them but small and <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> industries cannot afford these benefits due to high design and manufacturing costs involved and complexity involved in using these systems. This has led to less popularity of CAD and CAM systems in <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> industries. A web based design tool can offer the functionality of a CAD system to <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> industries by allowing them to create and design three-dimensional models over the web. This method helps in simplifying the complexity involved in solid modeling by automating the commonly performed design operations using design algorithms. At the same time a web based manufacturing tool can allow for automatic generation of tool-paths for machining using a CNC machine. Although a web based design tool offers the required benefits to <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> industries, offering just the functionality of a CAD system may not be useful to the users of the web-based system who are usually carvers and artisans with minimal or no knowledge of CAD. An alternative method and its implementation are presented in this thesis. The method allows for creating user-defined parametric features using simple tools that can be offered in a web based application. The system takes advantage of the built-in API tools in a solid modeler and advanced web-based technologies to integrate them into a simple and easy to use web based design system. Identification of key elements in designing user-defined features and a framework for implementing them are discussed. Also different types of user-defined features that can be offered in a web application with examples of their implementation in a real world application for designing custom wooden signs are presented...|$|E
40|$|How can a {{standardized}} product {{survive in a}} mass-customized world? This requires understanding that consumers often experience problems predicting their future hedonic reactions to new experiences (such as custom products), leading to feelings of regret. This form of regret occurs not because the <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> differs from specifications, but because consumers miswanted the design they ordered. Our analytic model shows that regret aversion induces consumers to design custom products to reflect the attributes of the available standard products. Consequently, regret-averse consumers may choose the standard product rather than place a custom order. The number of available standard products, however, moderates both these effects. Two experiments empirically substantiate the key predictions of the analytical model: (a) the custom product's resemblance to the standard product grows with regret aversion associated with miswanting, (b) there exists a segment of “regretfully loyal consumers” for the standard product in a mass-customized world and it expands with regret aversion, (c) both the above effects are weakened {{by the presence of}} a second standard product, and (d) the <b>custom</b> <b>product</b> can increase its market share when the number of standard products increases. customization, standard goods, preference uncertainty, regret...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{issues at}} a {{manufacturer}} of customized- and standard messenger bags, we develop an iterative two-stage framework (involving marketing and operations models) to determine {{the conditions under which}} a firm benefits from production spackling. With spackling, the firm uses flexible capacity to produce <b>custom</b> <b>products</b> as demanded each period, and then fills in, or spackles, the production schedule with make-to-stock output of standard products to restock inventory. Spackling broadly addresses market preferences, while mitigating the effects of "bumpy" demand for <b>custom</b> <b>products</b> by smoothing production, thereby improving capacity utilization as compared to a focused approach, where standard items are made with efficient capacity and <b>custom</b> <b>products</b> with flexible capacity. The marketing model employs logit-based choice and, given product costs and customer preferences, identifies optimal pricing, expected demand, and demand variability. Interestingly, we find that, under certain assumptions, the firm should price all products to achieve a constant absolute dollar markup. The resultant demand parameters are fed into an operations model, which specifies optimal efficient and flexible capacities (and decides between spackling and focus), thereby determining product costs, which are fed back into the marketing model to solve iteratively. That is, we link operations decisions regarding capacity to marketing decisions regarding price, and vice-versa. We examine conditions under which convergence of the two models is achieved, and illustrate our framework with data from the messenger bag manufacturer...|$|R
