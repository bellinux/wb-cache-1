Both are characterised by proactive rather than reactive responses.

As well, compliance and enforcement are important in both WHS and road safety, and their hierarchies of control share many commonalities. A literature review {{and a series of}} workplace interviews identified where various aspects of WHS policy and practice could be reviewed in relation to the road safety experience, particularly in relation to how compliance and enforcement approaches work best, the use of rewards and incentives, making fuller use of violation data, establishing <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and looking beyond regulatory solutions.

This paper examines the current process of commissioning building services within the traditional procurement route.

A best practice flow chart for managing the commissioning process is presented, tested and confirmed, identifying an auditable <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the commissioning process. Key conclusions include the need to recognize that the commissioning process requires planning and managing from the earliest possible stage; the need to appoint a commissioning manager — preferable someone in-house, or a member of the design team; the need for better end-user documentation and training; the requirement for a more formalized approach and the requirement for clarification on the terms of engagement for the services designer.

50|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> is {{a policy}} concept used in Australian {{transport}} legislation to place legal obligations on parties in the transport supply chain or across transport industries generally.

30|$|In general, the {{relationship}} <b>of</b> “power, <b>responsibility,</b> and interests” mostly includes the integration or the asymmetry <b>of</b> right and <b>responsibility.</b> The integrated relation mainly means {{the right and}} the responsibility need to adapt to each other, otherwise the unintegrated relation that leads to bureaucratic irresponsible behavior will. The integration <b>of</b> right and <b>responsibility</b> is therefore the basis to protect public interests from erosion (Qi 1988; Wang 2000). In other words, once endowed with public power, these public departments have to implement their responsibility for the realization of public interests. Therefore, it is proved that public interests have become the important bridge to connect public power with public responsibility. Meanwhile, public responsibility also has another function: to protect public interests from infringement of public power or to prevent abusing public power to seek private interests. These explanations amply demonstrate that public power and public responsibility should be unified in public interests. The asymmetric relation figures out that power is divorced from responsibility. If this asymmetry becomes much more serious, it will be harmful to public interests, which will cause the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> power and <b>responsibility</b> to become much more fragile (Wei and Chen 2005; Guo 2009). The relationship between “power, responsibility, and interests” proclaims that the unification of public power and public responsibility is the key influence to maintain public interests, or else it will be damaged by the erosion of private interests.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Human gross anatomy {{is one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{a medical}} curriculum and cannot be performed without adequate cadaver procurement, which is a particular challenge for medical schools with a large student enrolment. The authors present the situation in a country with a low public awareness for willed body donor programmes and the prior absence of adequate legislation. AIM: Against this background, a comprehensive proposition of a whole-body procurement procedure was elaborated in the health-care law. RESOLVING THE PROBLEM: The main goals of the proposition were: (a) identification of options for cadaver procurement (body bequeathal programme, unclaimed bodies and body donated with the permission of the next-of-kin); (b) defining the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> order and <b>responsibility</b> <b>of</b> institutions in informing the medical school of the possible candidate for body procurement; (c) body storage and related procedures; (e) confidentiality of the deceased's personal data; (f) burial procedure of the deceased's remains. CONCLUSIONS: The authors are convinced that the willed programme for whole-body donation is a definite aim of such a legislation. However, we suggest that the acquisition of unclaimed bodies is maintained as a temporary solution, until a satisfactory level of public awareness of the problem has been reached...|$|R
40|$|While {{scholars}} and journalists have focused important {{attention on the}} recent militarization of intensive policing and imprisonment policies in the United States, there is little reciprocal recognition of how militarized versions of these policies were also exported {{for use in the}} occupation of Iraq. Intensive policing and imprisonment enabled the American-led and Shia-dominated Iraq Ministries of Defense and Interior along with U. S. forces to play significant roles in the ethnic cleansing and displacement of Arab Sunnis from Baghdad neighborhoods, and in their disproportionate detention in military- and militia-operated facilities, of which the Abu Ghraib prison is only the best known. The failure of American authorities alone and working with Iraq’s government to intervene in stopping the use of police and prisons as places of torture is a violation of U. N. -invoked and U. S. -ratified treaties, and thereby subject to prosecution. Such prosecutions have imported into international law the concept of “joint criminal enterprise” anticipated by the criminologist Donald Cressey and incorporated in the American Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statutes used to convict organized criminals. We elaborate how the concept of joint criminal enterprise can be used to understand and possibly prosecute a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> command <b>responsibility</b> for the use of policing and prisons as sites of torture in Iraq.
