The SM obtained was given to obese/diabetic KK-A(y) mice and wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. SM supplementation significantly increased fecal lipids paralleled with a decrease in non-HDL cholesterol levels in the serum and neutral lipids and in cholesterol levels in the livers of KK-A(y) mice. The reduction of liver lipid levels also resulted in {{a decrease in the}} total fatty acid content of the KK-A(y) mice livers, while n- 3 fatty acids derived from the conversion of a-linolenic acid (18 : 3 n- 3) increased due to SM supplementation. In contrast to the KK-A(y) mice, little change in the serum and liver lipids was observed in wild-type C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The present study suggests that SM may be effective only in subjects with metabolic disorders...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} an {{analysis}} of factors influencing Australia's dairy product exports to Thailand. To the author's knowledge, such an analysis has not been conducted so far. The research consists of literature reviews of the theories and empirical studies of comparative advantage and export demand, the econometric estimation of Thailand's demand for Australia's exports of dairy products to analyse the determinants of Thailand's demand for Australian dairy products, and an investigation of experience of selected Australian exporting companies in exporting dairy products to Thailand based on the interviews of export managers. Australia exports dairy products such as, milk dry (skim milk powder or SMP and whole milk powder or WMP), butter, cheese and curd, and whey products to Thailand. SMP is the principle ingredient of Thailand's milk processing industry. Australia's main competitors in Thailand for exports of dairy products are New Zealand, the EU {{and to some extent}} the U. S. A. Thailand has heavily protected its local dairy industry by high tariffs and regulation. The Thai government promotes local dairy production and the use of local milk products. However, the dairy sector of Thailand is still incapable of meeting the demand from the domestic dairy processing industry and consumers. Hence, Thailand has to import a large volume of dairy products each year. The Australia-Thailand free trade agreement (FTA) started to operate in January 2005. Thailand's import tariffs on Australia's dairy products will decline to zero to 32 per cent, and be phased out by 2010 or 2020. The quotas on Australia's exports of milk powders and milk and cream to the Thai market will be increased by 2025. The analysis of revealed comparative advantage and revealed competitive advantage identify that among the dairy product exporting countries, Australia has comparative advantage and competitive advantage of all of the dairy products (milk evaporated, milk dry, whey preserved and <b>concentrated</b> <b>butter</b> and cheese and curd). Thailand has comparative advantage and competitive advantage only in milk condensed and evaporated. Thailand has comparative disadvantage and competitive disadvantage in the other dairy product categories. Australia's competitors in the Thai market (New Zealand, and the selected EU countries) have comparative and competitive advantages in most of the dairy products. These results suggest that Australian dairy exporting companies and policy makers could focus on increasing the volumes of all of the dairy products exported to Thailand, except milk condensed and evaporated. The results from the estimation of econometric models of Thailand's demand for Australia's exports of milk dry shows that in the short run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand declines when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries increases, while it is not responsive to Thailand's real national income. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand declines when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries' price increases. The estimated long run price elasticity of export demand is - 2. 76. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's milk dry exports demanded in Thailand does not change significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. In the short run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand falls when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries increases, but it is not responsive to Thailand's real national income. The quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand declines when the Thai baht depreciates against the Australian dollar. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand decreases when Australia's export price relative to that of competing countries' price increases. The estimated long run relative price elasticity of demand is - 1. 13. In the long run, the quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand does not change significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. The quantity of Australia's butter exports demanded in Thailand declines when the Thai baht depreciates against the Australian dollar. The estimated long run exchange rate elasticity of demand is - 6. 34. In the short run, the quantity of Australia's cheese and curd exports demanded in Thailand is not responsive either to the relative price of exports or to Thailand's real national income. In the long run the quantity of Australia's cheese and curd exports demanded in Thailand changes significantly in response to changes in Thailand's real national income. The estimated long run income elasticity of demand is 1. 84. During the interviews, the export managers of Australian dairy export companies agreed that Thailand is a significant importer of Australia's dairy products, particularly for SMP, WMP, whey powder, butter and cheese. Thailand's stable economic and political environment {{is one of the reasons}} that they are attracted to the Thai market. The principal factors that make Australia's products successful in the Thai market are competitive price and 'clean, green and natural' products. However, limited Australian dairy product varieties and distribution channels are major factors that contribute to Australia falling behind New Zealand and the EU in the Thai market. The Australian dairy Corporation (ADC) is not involved in promoting Australian dairy products in the Thai market at present, but has done so in the past. Thailand's tariff and import quota protection and support to local dairying industry is one of the barriers encountered by Australia's exports to Thailand. All the managers are hopeful of expanding opportunities for their dairy exports in the Thai market. These findings imply that Australian dairy export companies could expand the dairy product varieties they export and offer for sale in the Thai market. They could also take advantage of the established sales distribution network in addition to exploring the possibilities of setting up their own distribution channels. They could be looking into the possibilities of setting up of joint ventures with local dairy processing companies in Thailand so that their dairy exports could be expanded. The Australian dairy export companies as well as the ADC have to actively promote in various ways the Australian dairy product exports in the Thai market in order to take advantage of the window of opportunities open to them within the trade liberalisation framework of the Australia-Thailand free trade agreement (FTA) ...|$|E

Similar to cheese and fluid milk, dairy processing {{of these products}} can be energy intensive. In this paper, we analyzed production and energy data compiled through extensive literature reviews on <b>butter,</b> <b>concentrated</b> milk, milk and whey powder processing across various countries and plants. Magnitudes of national final and primary specific energy consumption (SEC) exhibited large variations across dairy products; in addition, the final SEC of individual plants and products exhibited significant variations within a country and between countries. Furthermore, we quantified national energy intensity indicators (EIIs) accounting for dairy product mixes and technological advancement. The significant variations of SEC and EII values indicate {{a high degree of}} likelihood that there is significant potential for energy savings in the global dairy processing industry. Based upon the study samples, we estimate potential energy savings for dairy processing industry in selected countries, and estimates annual reduction of 9 - 14 million metric-ton carbon-equivalent 1 could be achieved if measures are implemented to lower SEC values by 50 - 80 % in half of global dairy plants. The paper calls for publication of more energy data from the dairy processing industry. Dairy process Energy savings Greenhouse gas...|$|R
50|$|Creamed coconut (also {{known as}} coconut cream <b>concentrate</b> or coconut <b>butter)</b> is a coconut product. It is the {{unsweetened}} dehydrated fresh meat of a mature coconut, {{ground to a}} semi-solid white creamy paste. It is sold {{in the form of}} a hard white block which can be stored at room temperature. The block is generally packaged in a sealed plastic pouch and some separation of the pure fat and the coconut flesh can be seen. In cookery, it is chopped into pieces or grated before it is added to dishes. By adding warm water it can be made into coconut milk or coconut cream. Adding water to creamed coconut in the ratio 5:2 gives coconut cream, 5:1 coconut milk.|$|R
40|$|Functional {{properties}} of surfactants contained in dairy products, like emulsifying, foaming and wetting properties, result from {{their capacity to}} reduce the surface tension by adsorption and formation of cohesive films at the interface. A wide variety of techniques {{have been developed to}} determine surface tension, but those that give dynamic measurements, rather than equilibrium measurements of surface tension, are more suitable to study functional properties. Furthermore, the surface activity of surfactants depends on the mechanical {{properties of}} the films that are formed at the interface, which are strongly influenced by the intramolecular interactions established.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma thesis was to {{determine}} the influence of different kinds of fats on the content of aromatic active compounds and total flavour of processed cheese analogues. Samples of the cheese were produced by Tomas Bata University in Zlín from <b>concentrated</b> milk fat, <b>butter,</b> palm fat, coconut fat and sunflower oil. The aromatic compounds were isolated from samples of fats and processed cheese analogues via HS-SPME-GC method. A fibre with polar stationary phase CAR/PDMS was used for capturing of aromatic active compounds. In different contents, total of 32 aromatic compounds were determined. The cheese from concentrated milk fat and butter had the highest content and cheese from sunflower oil had the lowest. For determination of acceptability and flavour, the cheese analogues were sensory evaluated at the same time. Ordinal test, evaluation via scale and profile test were used. Cheese made from concentrated milk fat and coconut fat were always evaluated as the best, cheese made from sunflower oil were evaluated as the worst. Finally results between SPME-GC and sensory analysis were compared. It was stated that the kind of fat used for production of processed cheese analogues significantly influences the content of aromatic compounds and thus influences flavour of the cheese analogues...|$|R
