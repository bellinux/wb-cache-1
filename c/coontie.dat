5|$|Cooley was {{appointed}} as an appraiser {{of property and}} slaves for Union Bank of Florida. His ally, Richard Fitzpatrick, purchased his <b>coontie</b> and citrus plantation on the Miami River for $2,500. Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for Monroe County to the Territorial Legislative Council. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the Key West Inquirer. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret balloting. In Key West, Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.|$|E
5|$|Richard Fitzpatrick, by {{that time}} the owner of a {{successful}} plantation with coconut and lime trees, plantains, and sugarcane, pressed for the appointment of Cooley as Justice of the Peace in 1831, making Cooley responsible for adjudicating disputes of persons and property, punishment of minor offenders by fines and whippings, and oversight of the activities of wreckers. Serious offenders were jailed in Key West. By that time, Cooley owned a schooner and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade <b>coontie,</b> sugarcane, and tropical fruit with Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West and Havana.|$|E
25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (nopal) fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and <b>coontie</b> (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} <b>coontie),</b> and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for <b>coontie</b> use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E
25|$|When the Second Seminole War {{started in}} 1835, the Seminoles {{attacked}} the few European-American settlers in southern Florida. In January 1836 the Seminoles massacred {{the family of}} William Cooley at their <b>coontie</b> plantation on the New River, {{in what is now}} Fort Lauderdale.|$|E
25|$|The Florida {{subspecies}} of this butterfly (Eumaeus atala florida) was at {{one time}} believed to have become extinct due to over harvest of its host plant, <b>coontie.</b> It was not collected in Florida from 1937 until 1959. The Atala is now common locally in southeast Florida rebounding to some extent as it has begun to use ornamental cycads planted in suburban areas. In Palm Springs, Florida, the G-Star School of the Arts has been contributing the regrowth of the subspecies.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 1836 {{a band of}} Seminoles {{attacked}} the <b>coontie</b> plantation of William Cooley on the New River (in present-day Fort Lauderdale, Florida), killing {{his wife and children}} and the children's tutor. The other residents of the New River area and of the Biscayne Bay country to the south fled to Key West. On January 17, volunteers and Seminoles met south of St. Augustine at the Battle of Dunlawton. The volunteers lost four men, with thirteen wounded. On January 19, 1836 the Navy sloop-of-war Vandalia was dispatched to Tampa Bay from Pensacola. On the same day 57 U.S. Marines were dispatched from Key West to help man Fort Brooke.|$|E
500|$|By 1913, the Seminole in the Everglades {{numbered}} no {{more than}} 325. They made a living by hunting and trading with white settlers, and raised domesticated animals. The Seminole made their villages in hardwood hammocks or pinelands, had diets of hominy and <b>coontie</b> roots, fish, turtles, venison, and small game. Their villages were not large, due to the limited size of the hammocks. Between {{the end of the}} last Seminole War and 1930, the people lived in relative isolation [...] from the majority culture.|$|E
500|$|The Cooley {{property}} in New River {{had a house}} that was [...] "twenty feet by fifty feet , one story high, built of cypress logs, sealed and floored with 1-1/2 inch [...] planks". At least three black slaves and several Indians cultivated sugar cane, corn, potatoes, pumpkins and other vegetables on the twenty-acre (eight-hectare) property, which also had a pen with eighty hogs. The <b>coontie</b> watermill was twenty-seven by fourteenfeet [...] Cooley's Key West holdings included a factory, two storage houses, kitchen and slave quarters; coconut, lime and orange trees; and domesticated and wild fowl.|$|E
500|$|Cooley's main {{occupation}} was gathering, processing and shipping Florida arrowroot, a starch {{made from the}} root of the <b>coontie</b> plant. Arrowroot was used to make bread dough, wafers and biscuits; its resistance to spoilage made it especially favored for use on ships. Pulp remaining after processing was used as a fertilizer or for animal feed. Favorable conditions for arrowroot cultivation contributed to the presence of several hundred Indians in the area—arrowroot being a staple of their diet. The market price for the starch was [...] (between 17¢ and 35¢ per kg), and the geography of the river and the good performance of his machinery—the output was close to —brought Cooley great prosperity. His good fortune allowed him to dedicate much of his time to exploration of the area as far north as Lake Okeechobee and brought him increasing political influence. It is likely that he married Nancy Dayton, a former Indian captive, on December 2, 1830.|$|E
500|$|The Third Seminole War {{lasted from}} 1855 to 1859. Over its course, 20Seminoles {{were killed and}} 240 were removed. By 1913, Seminoles in the Everglades {{numbered}} no more than 325. They made their villages in hardwood hammocks, islands of hardwood trees that formed in rivers or pine rockland forests. Seminole diets consisted of hominy and <b>coontie</b> roots, fish, turtles, venison, and small game. Villages were not large, due to the limited size of hammocks, which on average measured between one and [...] In {{the center of the}} village was a cook-house, and the largest structure was reserved for eating. When the Seminoles lived in northern Florida, they wore animal-skin clothing similar to their Creek predecessors. [...] The heat and humidity of the Everglades influenced their adapting a different style of dress. Seminoles replaced their heavier buckskins with clothing of unique calico patchwork designs made of lighter cotton, or silk for more formal occasions.|$|E
2500|$|Eumaeus atala, the Atala or <b>coontie</b> hairstreak, {{is a small}} {{colorful}} butterfly in {{the family}} Lycaenidae.

2500|$|The Atala is a {{great example}} of aposematic (warning) {{coloration}} throughout its life cycle. The brightly colored larva or caterpillar feeds on cycads which contain a toxic secondary plant chemical (cycasin) which it retains in its body for life. [...] Birds, lizards, and other animals may attempt to prey on the larva, pupa, and adults, but find them distasteful and learn to avoid these brightly patterned insects. In Florida, the larvae feed on a native cycad, Zamia pumila, commonly called <b>coontie</b> or arrowhead, as well as introduced ornamental cycads. In Cuba, the cycad Cycas revoluta is eaten.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 Dade County leased {{the land}} from the State of Florida and began making plans {{to turn it into}} a passive {{recreation}} facility. Clean-up crews appeared, and construction started on a small museum and nature study center. A nature trail was constructed in the hammock area by the Youth Conservation Corps. In addition, they planted over 500 trees. The Arch Creek Park was formally dedicated on April 25, 1982. Today, Arch Creek is an [...] site at the junction of N.E. 135th Street and Biscayne Boulevard, and offers many opportunities for botanical, historical and archaeological study. It has a museum/nature center modeled after an early Florida pioneer home, displaying Indian artifacts dug from the grounds, and live animals from the nearby hammock. Remains of the original <b>coontie</b> mill are still visible across the creek, and the Park exists as the only preserved archaeological site in the County.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Seminole {{culture that}} took shape after 1800 was a dynamic mixture of African, Native American, Spanish, and slave traditions. Adopting certain {{practices}} of the Native Americans, [...] maroons wore Seminole clothing and ate the same foodstuffs prepared the same way: they gathered the roots of a native plant called <b>coontie,</b> grinding, soaking, and straining {{them to make a}} starchy flour similar to arrowroot, as well as mashing corn with a mortar and pestle to make sofkee, a sort of porridge often used as a beverage, with water added— ashes from the fire wood used to cook the sofkee were occasionally added to it for extra flavor. They also introduced their Gullah staple of rice to the Seminole, and continued {{to use it as a}} basic part of their diets. Rice remained part of the diet of the Black Seminoles who moved to Oklahoma.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{authors have}} argued that the Calusa {{cultivated}} maize and Zamia integrifolia (<b>coontie)</b> for food. [...] But, Widmer argues that the evidence for maize cultivation by the Calusa depends on the proposition that the Narváez and de Soto expeditions landed in Charlotte Harbor rather than Tampa Bay, which is now generally discounted. [...] No Zamia pollen has been found at any site associated with the Calusas, nor does Zamia grow in the wetlands that made up most of the Calusa environment. Marquardt notes that the Calusa turned down the offer of agricultural tools from the Spanish, saying that they had no need for them. The Calusa gathered a variety of wild berries, fruits, nuts, roots and other plant parts. Widmer cites George Murdock's estimate that only some 20 percent of the Calusa diet consisted of wild plants that they gathered. However, no evidence of plant food was found at the Wightman site. There is evidence that as early as 2000 years ago, the Calusa cultivated papaya (Catrica papaya), a gourd of the species Cucurbita pepo, and the bottle gourd, the last two of which were used for net floats and dippers.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} {{critical}} {{importance to the}} Eumaeus atala butterfly. The butterfly, thought extinct until recently, is dependent for its survival on the Zamia integrifolia, {{as well as several}} other species of Zamia. At the larval stage, the Eumaeus atala caterpillar exclusively eats the leaves of the <b>coontie.</b> A half dozen caterpillars can completely strip a <b>coontie</b> bare and a large <b>coontie</b> population is needed to sustain the Eumaeus atala population.|$|E
