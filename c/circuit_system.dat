UVC-TV 19 is part of the University's Housing Cable Services Network and airs on channel 19 to over 11,000 viewers on campus via a closed <b>circuit</b> <b>system.</b> UVC began as the Student Video Project in 1974, and was renamed the Union Video Center in 1978 after growing into a full-fledged television station. Today, UVC-TV 19 serves as an educational training facility on campus for full-time undergraduate students.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} gas needed on a dive {{depends on whether}} the scuba {{equipment}} to be used is open, semi-closed or closed circuit. Open circuit diving exhausts all respired gas to the surroundings, regardless of how much has been useful to the diver, whereas a semi-closed or closed <b>circuit</b> <b>system</b> retains most of the respired gas, and restores it to a respirable condition by removing the waste product carbon dioxide, and making up the oxygen content to a suitable partial pressure. Closed and semi-closed circuit scuba sets are also known as rebreathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressurized}} air {{comes from an}} air compressor in the locomotive and is sent from car to car by a train line made up of pipes beneath each car and hoses between cars. The principal problem with the straight air braking system is that any separation between hoses and pipes causes loss of air pressure and hence {{the loss of the}} force applying the brakes. This could easily cause a runaway train. Straight air brakes are still used on locomotives, although as a dual <b>circuit</b> <b>system,</b> usually with each bogie (truck) having its own circuit.|$|E

25|$|Under {{automatic}} operation, the on-train computer instructs {{the train}} what to do. The underlying {{protection and control}} system is called TBTC, which stands for Transmission-Based Train Control. The computer does everything except opening and closing the doors, starting the train at every station, mending faults and dealing with passengers. If ATO fails but TBTC is still operational, the trains can still be manually driven at line speed under PM (Protected Manual) conditions. Due {{to the fact that}} the train receives lots of updates in a short time, it is considered impossible for the driver to drive in this mode in regular service, and the train will be taken out of service and moved off the line as quickly as possible. If TBTC fails on an individual train then it would be put into Restricted Manual mode, which means that the train operator can drive the train at 5–10mph (8–16km/h) to the next station, where the train would be taken out of service until the fault is mended by technicians. If the whole TBTC system fails the line can still operate at a top speed of 16km/h using an auxiliary signal and track <b>circuit</b> <b>system.</b> The signals and track circuits only activate when the TBTC system has failed, and are normally dark.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the other}} {{recommendations}} in the report was {{the introduction of the}} ring <b>circuit</b> <b>system</b> (often informally called a [...] "ring main"). [...] In this arrangement a cable connected to a fuse, or circuit breaker, in the distribution board was wired in sequence to a number of sockets before being terminated back at the distribution board, thus forming a ring final circuit. In the ring circuit, each socket-outlet was supplied with current by conductors {{on both sides of the}} 'loop.' This contrasts with the radial system (which is also used in the UK, often in the same installation) wherein a single cable runs out radially, like a spoke, from the distribution board to serve a number of sockets. [...] Since the fuse or circuit breaker for a ring circuit has to be rated for the maximum current the ring could carry (30A or 32A for a breaker), additional protection is required at each socket-plug connection. [...] Theoretically, such protection could have been designated either within the socket or within the plug. [...] However, to ensure that this protection has a rating matched to the appliance flexible cord fitted to the plug, a fuse rated between 1A and 13A is incorporated into each plug. Wired connections may also be connected to the ring, and these are also required to include a suitably rated fuse. The ring circuit in the UK requires the use of BS1363 plugs and sockets, but the BS1363 system is not limited to use with ring circuits.|$|E

40|$|As CMOS {{technology}} scales down to nanotechnologies, reliability {{continues to}} be a decisive subject in the design entry of nanotechnology-based <b>circuit</b> <b>systems.</b> As a result, several computational methodologies have been proposed to evaluate reliability of those <b>circuit</b> <b>systems.</b> However, the process of computing reliability has become very time consuming and troublesome as the computational complexity grows exponentially with the dimension of <b>circuit</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, being able to speed up the task of reliability analysis is fast becoming necessary in designing modern logic integrated circuits. For this purpose, the paper firstly looks into developing a MATLAB-based automated reliability tool by incorporating the generalized form of the existing computational approaches that {{can be found in the}} current literature. Secondly, a comparative study involving those existing computational approaches is carried out on a set of standard benchmark test circuits. Finally, the paper continues to find the exact error bound for individual faulty gates as it plays a significant role in the reliability of <b>circuit</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
