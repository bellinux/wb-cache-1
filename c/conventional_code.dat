I know {{perfectly}} well that all this about her being a liar and a bully and a coquette and so forth is a trumped-up moral indictment which might be brought against anybody. We all lie; we all bully {{as much as we}} dare; we all bid for admiration without the least intention of earning it; we all get as much rent as we can out of our powers of fascination. If Ann would admit this I shouldn't quarrel with her. But she won't. If she has children she'll take advantage of their telling lies to amuse herself by whacking them. If another woman makes eyes at me, she'll refuse to know a coquette. She will do just what she likes herself whilst insisting on everybody else doing what the <b>conventional</b> <b>code</b> prescribes. In short, I can stand everything except her confounded hypocrisy. That's what beats me.|$|E

"Mr. Wheelock," [...] he said, [...] "as {{you have}} no doubt guessed, I never had much faith in the <b>conventional</b> <b>code</b> of morality, but since you seem {{determined}} to marry Anthea, I am in one respect glad that you evidently have, though that is perhaps not a very logical admission. I was out after money, and allowed no other consideration to influence me. It is probable that I should have accumulated {{a good deal of}} it had not everything gone against me lately. Well, if I showed no pity, I at least seldom allowed any rancor to betray me into injudicious action when other people treated me as I should have treated them; but, after all, that is not the question, and we will be practical. You will not see or write to Anthea for six months from to-day, and then if neither of you has changed your mind you can understand that you have my good-will. She will advise you of her address--in Toronto--in the meanwhile. It is not a great deal to promise." ...|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the WZ coding mode is competitive. The SSWZ codec outperforms <b>conventional</b> <b>coding</b> with zero motion vectors at most rates. The gap between <b>conventional</b> <b>coding</b> and WZ coding, with similar {{encoding}} settings, is larger at high rates. However, as {{can be seen}} in the Mother and Daughter CIF sequence, the WZ mode may outperform the conventional H. 264 at low rates. In fact, the SSWZ can potentially yield better results for low rates in low motion sequences, than <b>conventional</b> <b>coding.</b> This can be explained because the SSWZ uses multi resolution encoding that can be seen as an interpolative coding scheme which is known for their good performance of low bit-rates. Other interpolative coding schemes have been used in image compression with better performance than conventional compression for low rates [33]. Therefore, it is possible to have a WZ codec operating with a 40 %– 50 % reduction in encoding complexity (see encoding time for <b>conventional</b> IBPBP <b>coding</b> mode and SSWZ IbPbP coding mode in Table 1), and still produce better results than <b>conventional</b> <b>coding</b> for certain rates. Also, the SSWZ is not using a feedback channel, the correlation statistics are estimated [28]. Thus, a more robust estimation may significantly improve the performance. A specially designed entropy codec can encode the cosets more efficiently.|$|R

6000|$|Alan Merrick strode {{from his}} father's door that day stung with a burning sense of wrong and injustice. More {{than ever before}} in his life he {{realized}} to himself the abject hollowness of that <b>conventional</b> <b>code</b> which masquerades in our midst as a system of morals. If he had continued to [...] "live single" [...] as we hypocritically phrase it, and so helped by one unit to spread the festering social canker of prostitution, on which as basis, like some mediaeval castle on its foul dungeon vaults, the entire superstructure of our outwardly decent modern society is reared, his father no doubt would have shrugged his shoulders and blinked his cold eyes, and commended the wise young man for abstaining from marriage till his means could permit him to keep a wife of his own class in the way she was accustomed to. The wretched victims of that vile system might die unseen and unpitied in some hideous back slum, without touching one chord of remorse or regret in Dr. Merrick's nature. He was steeled against their suffering. Or again, if Alan had sold his virility for gold to some rich heiress of his set, like Ethel Waterton--had bartered his freedom to be her wedded paramour in a loveless marriage, his father would not only have gladly acquiesced, but would have congratulated his son on his luck and his prudence. Yet, because Alan had chosen rather to form a blameless union of pure affection with a woman who was in every way his moral and mental superior, but in despite of the conventional ban of society, Dr. Merrick had cast him off as an open reprobate. And why? Simply because that union was unsanctioned by the exponents of a law they despised, and unblessed by the priests of a creed they rejected. Alan saw at once it is not the intrinsic moral value of an act such people think about, but the light in which it is regarded by a selfish society.|$|E
6000|$|On {{the whole}} I think {{a man or}} woman who is no longer a fabric of pure emotion may, if there is indeed the passion for truth and the clear sight of things to justify research, venture upon this {{sinister}} seeming wilderness of speculation, and I think, too, it is very probable the courageous persistent explorer will end at last not so very remote from the starting-point, but above it, as it were, on a crest that will give a wider view, reaching over many things that now confine the lower vision. But these are perilous paths, it must always be remembered. This is no public playground. One may distrust the <b>conventional</b> <b>code,</b> and one may leave it in thought, long before one is justified in leaving it either in expressed opinion or in act. We are social animals; we cannot live alone; manifestly from the nature of the question, here, at any rate, we must associate and group. For all who find the accepted righteousness not good enough or clear enough for them, there is the chance of an ironical destiny. We must look well to our company, as we come out of the city of the common practice and kick its dust from our superior soles. There is an abominable riff-raff gone into those thickets for purposes quite other than the discovery of the right thing to do, for quite other motives than our high intellectual desire. There are ugly rebels and born rascals, cheats by instinct, and liars to women, swinish unbelievers who would compromise us with their erratic pursuit of a miscellaneous collection of strange fancies and betray us callously at last. Because a man does not find the law pure justice, that is no reason why he should fake his gold to a thieves' kitchen; because he does not think the city a sanitary place, why he should pitch his tent on a dust-heap amidst pariah dogs. Because we criticize the old limitations that does not bind us to the creed of unfettered liberty. I very much doubt if, when at last the days for the sane complete discussion of our sexual problems come, it will give us anything at all in the way of [...] "Liberty," [...] as most people understand that word. In the place of the rusty old manacles, the chain and shot, the iron yoke, cruel, ill-fitting, violent implements from which it was yet possible to wriggle and escape to outlawry, it may be the world will discover only a completer restriction, will develop a scheme of neat gyves, light but efficient, beautifully adaptable to the wrists and ankles, never chafing, never oppressing, slipped on and worn until at last, like the mask of the Happy Hypocrite, they mould the wearer to their own identity. But for all that--gyves! ...|$|E

Using the idea of compute-and-forward to decode sums of codewords, our scheme improves considerably upon the <b>conventional</b> <b>coding</b> schemes which treat interference as noise or decode messages simultaneously. Roughly speaking, the novel scheme asks the decoder to decode “just enough ” interfering signals and use it for extracting the desired information.

30|$|The DVC {{paradigm}} {{offers a}} number of major differentiations when compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>coding.</b> First, it is based on a statistical framework. As it does not rely on joint encoding, the content analysis can be performed at the decoder side. In particular, DVC does not need a temporal prediction loop characteristic of past MPEG and ITU-T schemes. As a consequence, the computational complexity can be flexibly distributed between the encoder and the decoder, and in particular, it allows encoding with very low complexity. According to information theory, this can be achieved without loss of coding performance compared to <b>conventional</b> <b>coding,</b> in an asymptotical sense and for long sequences. However, coding efficiency remains a challenging issue for DVC despite considerable improvements over the last few years.|$|R

Essentially, the logical flow of the program (at least at the highest level) was simply a given for the system, simply invoke the inference engine. This also was a reason for the second benefit: rapid prototyping. With an expert system shell it was possible to enter a few rules and have a prototype developed in days rather than the months or year typically associated with complex IT projects.|$|E
