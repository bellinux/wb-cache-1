40|$|Two {{issues of}} <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> from the Troad with the {{monogram}} AX (late 4 th/early 3 rd c. BC) {{have traditionally been}} attributed to Achilleion. However, excavations of Achilleion show that it was never more than a small fort. These coins should therefore be attributed to Achaiion, known to us from Strabo as the chief town of the nearby Tenedian peraia. In addition to the issues with the AX monogram, Achaiion also produced <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> in the 2 nd c. BC. It is argued that these two periods of minting probably represent periods of independence from Tenedos and thus prompt questions {{about the significance of}} the peraia to the Tenedian economy and the importance of <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> in reconstructing the political history of the Hellenistic Troad...|$|R

5000|$|Internally, {{the empire}} faced {{hyperinflation}} caused {{by years of}} coinage devaluation. This had started earlier under the Severan emperors who enlarged the army by one quarter and doubled the legionaries' base pay. As each of the short-lived emperors took power, he needed ways to raise money quickly to pay the military's [...] "accession bonus" [...] and {{the easiest way to}} do so was by inflating the coinage severely, a process made possible by debasing the <b>coinage</b> with <b>bronze</b> and copper.|$|R

Besides a limited emission of <b>coinage</b> in <b>bronze</b> and silver, several Roman gold coins were minted with Orbiana's visage, including a coin which sold for £26.00 in 1897. She was the only wife of Severus to be featured on coins.|$|R
25|$|A new <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> was {{introduced}} from 1848. The Second Republic Monetary Authority minted a 1-centime copper coin with a 1795 design. 2, 5 and 10-centime coins were issued from 1853. The quarter franc was discontinued, with silver 20-centime coins issued between 1849 and 1868 as the smallest silver coin produced in France.|$|R

50|$|Intending {{to give a}} bold {{relief to}} the designs on the new bronze coins, Wyon {{engraved}} the original dies so deeply that they were liable to fracture after relatively few pieces had been struck from them.

50|$|During the Republic, the as {{featured}} the bust of Janus on the obverse, and the prow of a galley on the reverse.

50|$|Some authors {{state it}} {{to be based on}} the Phoenician drachmae instead on the Attic drachmae weight standard. Most common is the small <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> of between 5-25 mm in diameter, which was in use at the same time as the coins of Judaea.

5000|$|The divinity {{sometimes}} {{appears as}} Aeternitas Imperii (the [...] "Eternity of Roman rule"), where the Latin word imperium ("command, power") points toward the meaning [...] "empire," [...] the English word derived from it.

New <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> was issued at this time, on which various virtues were represented.|$|R
50|$|Trade was {{facilitated}} {{by the fact that}} Manching had its own mint. A local system of coinage, including small silver coins (quinarii) and impure bronze ones served mainly internal trade. External trade relied on coins of gold and (from the early 1st century BC onwards) silver. Like much Celtic coinage, the gold coins minted at Manching are distinctively concave, even cup-shaped, (in German, such coins are traditionally known as Regenbogenschüsselchen or rainbow cups, a term derived from the belief that they are connected with the treasure to be found {{at the foot of a}} rainbow). False <b>coinage,</b> e.g. <b>bronze</b> coins with a thin gold covering, has also been found. Fine weighing scales were used to monitor the authenticity and value of coins.|$|R
50|$|Demetrias was a Hellenistic city in Assyria, near Arbela.

It was located {{at the bank of}} Tigris and minted its own <b>bronze</b> <b>coinage</b> with the inscription ΔΗΜΗΤΡΙΕΩΝ ΤΩΝ ΠΡΟΣ ΤΩΙ ΤΙΓΡΕΙ, (of the Demetrians by the Tigris), with the figures of Tyche and a tripod.|$|R

As a result, the image was subsequently utilised on Octavian’s gold and silver AEGVPTO CAPTA <b>coinage,</b> the <b>bronze</b> Nemausus <b>coinage,</b> and the coinage of Juba II of Mauretania, all of which either alluded to, or directly referred to, Cleopatra Selene...|$|R
