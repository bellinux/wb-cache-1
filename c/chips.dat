40|$|With the {{expanding}} use of automation in machining technology, the modern manufacturing aims toward achieving high productivity without close human supervision. This aim requires reliable machining processes. The <b>chip</b> control {{is one of}} major concern in automated machining system. It {{is essential for the}} safety of the machining operation, the maintenance of good surface finish on the machined parts, the convenience of <b>chip</b> disposal, and the possible power reduction. This thesis major deals with theoretical modelling for the 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling process, including geometry and mechanics consideration. These models are then used to develop a computer animation system to simulate the process of <b>chip</b> curling in 3 -D metal cutting. Hence the work described in this thesis is devoted to developing an effective theoretical technique for <b>chip</b> control in automated machining systems. Firstly, a new method to describe the development process of 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling is developed in accord with the mechanics and kinematics characters of <b>chip</b> curling in 3 -D machining. This analysis divided the process of 3 -D <b>chip</b> development into different stages based on the deformation mechanism and characteristics, i. e. <b>chip</b> forming stage, <b>chip</b> curling stage, <b>chip</b> breaking stage, and the kinematical characters according to whether the curled <b>chip,</b> after leaving the rake face, hits the backwall of breaker/groove, or/and workpiece, or/and backface of tool, or/and extends along the <b>chip</b> breaker. Then new basic <b>chip</b> curling forms, up-curling, side-curling and twisting, are proposed based on the continuum mechanics theory. It reveals that a 3 -D curling <b>chip</b> body m a y undergo longitudinal bending, transversal bending and torsional deformations. The analysis provides the fundament for the theoretical modelling of the 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling and breaking. Secondly, a general geometric model of 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling generated by typical <b>chip</b> breakers is developed by introducing the three-dimensional deformation state of the <b>chip</b> curling. The model, so developed, can be used to predict the 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling forms. The prediction includes a group of criteria for the effects of ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηo on the <b>chip</b> forms/shapes. The varying tendency of the <b>chip</b> radius and <b>chip</b> pitch with varying ωx, ω ʸ, ωz and ηO is further discussed based on a sensitivity analysis the results of which are summarised graphically. The sensitivity analysis provides a quantitative assessment of the significance of three basic <b>chip</b> curling forms, namely up-curling, side-curling and twisting to the general helical <b>chip</b> form. Thirdly, a set of 3 -D mechanics models of <b>chip</b> curling with <b>chip</b> breaker for the internal resisting forces is developed for the 4 basic <b>chip</b> deformation cases of <b>chip</b> curling process based on the structural mechanics theory, These internal forces, in particular the bending moments and torques are expressed as variations along the length of the curled <b>chip.</b> The set of models considers a spatial force system including the longitudinal bending moment, transversal bending moment and the torsional torque. Then the distribution of the bending moments and torques along the <b>chip</b> body are discussed based on graphically presented calculated results. The models reveal, in theory, new insights into the <b>chip</b> breaking mechanisms. More importantly it provides a new approach to theoretically asses the curling <b>chip</b> breakability. Notably it is shown that the bending moment and torque are the main causes of <b>chip</b> breaking. Furthermore the bending moment and torque in the <b>chip</b> body are caused by the <b>chip</b> breaker and the obstacle the curling <b>chip</b> contacts. Finally, a computer animation system for 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling in machining process is developed based on the 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling developing process, geometry model and mechanics models of 3 -D <b>chip</b> curling presented in the research work. The 3 -D <b>chip</b> animation integrates the <b>chip</b> flow equation, <b>chip</b> curling patterns, <b>chip</b> geometrical features and mathematical expressions for the 3 -D helix surface. Based on the input conditions (namely <b>chip</b> breaker parameters and cutting conditions), a computer program is developed to convert the parametric prediction into a series of dynamic graphs demonstrating the <b>chip</b> formation process. Then the animation results are analysed and compared with the experimental observations. The methodology presented will provide assistance for machine operators to select machining conditions or for process planning designers to confidently and thoroughly plan the cutting process, control <b>chip</b> breakage and evaluate the <b>chip</b> control effect...|$|R

40|$|In {{continuous}} cutting operation, {{the use of}} <b>chip</b> breakers {{has become}} virtually important and much effort has been put into {{the development of a}} wide range of breakers to suit a wide cutting condition. Unexpected <b>chipping</b> will occur on the minor cutting edge, when as insert that has proper <b>chip</b> breaking performance is under optimum cutting condition. Then, the effect of <b>chip</b> breakers on the wear and <b>chipping</b> of inserts have been experimentaly investigated. The progress of crater wear is studied in details with the contour observation of five different <b>chip</b> breakers. The main results obtained are as follow; (1) The <b>chip</b> breaker patterns of tool face affect feed force and thrust force. In the case of the grooved <b>chip</b> breaker, the thrust force is larger than the obstruction type breaker. The <b>chip</b> breaker patterns do not affect the side flow angle if the cutting conditions are the same. (2) The forms of crater wear minor cutting edge <b>chipping</b> are significant influenced with the <b>chip</b> breaker patterns. If the projection of <b>chip</b> breakers is properly worn away with the progress of cutting time, the center of crater of the tool face moves away from the major and the minor cutting edges.

40|$|AbstractIt is a {{challenging}} task to avoid ploughing effects in micro-milling. When one tooth of {{the cutting tool}} crosses the minimum <b>chip</b> thickness boundary, the tool would enter into the ploughing zone with no <b>chip</b> formation. Therefore, it is significant to predict the ploughing volume and forces in micro-milling. In this work, the ploughing mechanism for micro-milling is proposed by considering the minimum <b>chip</b> thickness effects. A 3 D <b>chip</b> geometry is developed to calculate <b>chip</b> thickness, ploughing volume and ploughing forces in micro 5 -axis flat-end milling with a flat-end mill. The local parallel sliced tool based method is then applied to get cutter-workpiece engagement domain where the cutting flutes entry and exit the workpiece, minimum <b>chip</b> thickness and depth of cut are required to predict ploughing forces. Local parallel sliced method divides the cutting tool into several slices that are perpendicular to the tool axis along the local coordinate system. On each layer, the removal <b>chip</b> area is dividing into ploughing zone and shearing zone by the minimum <b>chip</b> thickness. Ploughing zone is the area as <b>chip</b> thickness {{is less than the}} minimum <b>chip</b> thickness. In the shearing zone, <b>chip</b> thickness is larger than the minimum <b>chip</b> thickness. The total <b>chip</b> ploughing volume is obtained by adding all ploughing area along axial direction...|$|R
