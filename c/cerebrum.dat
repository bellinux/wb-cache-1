5|$|The name {{cerebellum}} is {{a diminutive}} of <b>cerebrum</b> (brain); {{it can be}} translated literally as little brain. The Latin name is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek παρεγκεφαλίς (parencephalis), which {{was used in the}} works of Aristotle, the first known writer to describe the structure. No other name is used in the English-language literature, but historically a variety of Greek or Latin-derived names have been used, including <b>cerebrum</b> parvum, encephalion, encranion, <b>cerebrum</b> posterius, and parencephalis.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded <b>cerebrum,</b> {{the part of the}} brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their <b>cerebrum</b> only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, {{the part of the brain}} responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is probably due to the great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminal}} nerves, olfactory nerves (I) and optic nerves (II) {{emerge from}} the <b>cerebrum</b> or forebrain, and the remaining ten pairs arise from the brainstem, which is {{the lower part of}} the brain.|$|E

A stillborn male crossbred lamb with diprosopus, craniorachischisis, and arthrogryposis was examined macroscopically and histopathologically in this study.

Micrencephaly, brachygnathia superior, and cleft palate were present in the right head. Cerebellar agenesis and spinal cord hypoplasia were observed. The <b>cerebrums</b> and the spinal cord were covered with a tapering membranous structure. Neural and dermal tissues were noted to intervene upon microscopic examination of this structure.

40|$|Abstract Deletions in the {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) of Balb/c mouse <b>cerebrums,</b> resembling deletions {{found in}} elderly humans or {{in patients with}} certain disorders, were detected by PCR. Analysis was carried out on mice of various ages and on mice in which the bilateral common carotid arteries had been incompletely ligated to reconstruct cerebral ischemia. A 3, 867 bp mtDNA deletion was present only in old or ischemic mouse groups. Among the non-ischemic groups, it was found in 0 of 12 weaning, 0 of 12 young, and four of eight old mice. Among the ischemic groups, it was found in 12 of 17 young and 11 of 11 old mice. Moreover, the percentage of total mtDNA containing deletions was 22 % for the old non-ischemic group, 37 % for the young ischemic group, and 69 % for the old ischemic group. In addition, PCR analysis detected two other deletions of 3, 726 bp and 4, 236 bp in 4 of the 11 old ischemic <b>cerebrums.</b> The results indicate that mtDNA deletions are associated with aging, that ischemia increases the incidence of mtDNA deletions, and that mtDNA deletions resulting from ischemia {{are more likely to}} occur in old mice than in youn...|$|R
5|$|In {{the fifth}} century BC, Alcmaeon of Croton in Magna Grecia, first {{considered}} the brain to be {{the seat of the}} mind. Also in {{the fifth century}} BC in Athens, Hippocrates believed the brain to be the seat of intelligence. Aristotle, in his biology initially believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence, and saw the brain as a cooling mechanism for the blood. He reasoned that humans are more rational than the beasts because, among other reasons, they have a larger brain to cool their hot-bloodedness. Aristotle did describe the meninges and distinguished between the <b>cerebrum</b> and cerebellum. Herophilus of Chalcedon in the fourth and third centuries BC distinguished the <b>cerebrum</b> and the cerebellum, and provided the first clear description of the ventricles; and with Erasistratus of Ceos experimented on living brains. Their works are now mostly lost, and we know about their achievements due mostly to secondary sources. Some of their discoveries had to be re-discovered a millennium after their deaths. Anatomist physician Galen in the second century AD, {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire, dissected the brains of sheep, monkeys, dogs, and pigs. He concluded that, as the cerebellum was denser than the brain, it must control the muscles, while as the <b>cerebrum</b> was soft, it must be where the senses were processed. Galen further theorized that the brain functioned by movement of animal spirits through the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebrum</b> {{contains}} the ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the pituitary gland. At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebrum,</b> {{consisting}} of the cerebral hemispheres, forms the largest {{part of the brain}} and is situated above the other brain structures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the project is to explore the {{functional}} asymmetry extents of the <b>cerebrums</b> with aging and innate mechanism. So the basic assumptions of the project are:(1) The factor of gender will cause the functional asymmetry heavier with aging process;(2) The effect of handness is significant. The experiment indicated the cerebral modulated mechanism in the motion-cognition process is affected by multiple factors. It can be assured the handness and aging have significant impacts in this process.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} pre- and {{postnatal}} maternal dietary fatty acid composition on neurodevelopment in rat pups was studied. Timed pregnant dams were fed, beginning on d 2 of gestation and throughout lactation, either nonpurified diet (reference) or a purified diet whose fat source (22 % of energy) was either corn oil or menhaden fish oil. On postnatal d 3, pups were randomly cross-fostered among dams {{of the same}} diet group and culled to 10 pups per dam. Milk was removed from stomachs of culled pups for fatty acid analyses. From postnatal d 4 to 30, pups were assessed daily for the appearance of neurodevelopmental reflexes. Auditory brainstem conduction times were measured on postnatal d 23 and 29. Pups were killed on postnatal d 30, and <b>cerebrums</b> were removed for fatty acid analyses. The fatty acid composition of maternal milk and pup <b>cerebrums</b> reflected maternal diet {{with higher levels of}} (n- 3) and (n- 6) fatty acids in the fish oil and corn oil groups, respectively. The time of appearance of auditory startle was significantly delayed (P 0. 004), and auditory brainstem conduction times on postnatal d 23 and 29 were significantly longer in pups of the fish oil – than corn oil–fed dams (P ¡ 0. 05). A delay in the appearance of the auditory startle reflex and longer auditory brainstem conduction times in pups of dams fed fish oil–supplemented diet may be due to negative effects on myelination of the auditory brainstem pathway.

40|$|Neuropathologic {{and brain}} imaging studies have {{produced}} evidence of brain abnormalities in schizophrenic patients, often within the <b>cerebrum's</b> limbic lobe, and, less frequently, within basal ganglia. In {{the present study}} we used magnetic resonance imaging morphometric techniques to estimate volumes of specific cerebral structures in schizophrenic patients and age- and sex-matched normal controls. Estimates {{of the volume of}} mesial temporal lobe structures were reduced and estimates of the volume of the lenticular nucleus were increased in the schizophrenic patients. There was also evidence of reduced cranial volume in some schizophrenics. The magnitude of the lenticular abnormality, but not the temporal lobe abnormality, was associated with age at first psychiatric contact; earlier onset was associated with larger lenticular nuclei. The possible relevance of these results to neurodevelopmental hypotheses about the pathogenesis of schizophrenia is discussed. © 1991, American Medical Association. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The sperm whale's <b>cerebrum</b> is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in {{absolute}} and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|Though it {{had large}} {{nostrils}} and a fleshy snout, Nigersaurus had an underdeveloped olfactory region of its brain and thus {{did not have}} an advanced sense of smell. Its brain-to-body-mass ratio was average for a reptile, and smaller than those of ornithischians and non-coelurosaurian theropods. The <b>cerebrum</b> comprised about 30% of the brain volume, as in many other dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as hagfish, sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the <b>cerebrum</b> in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{implications}} for adaptation when billions of human <b>cerebrums</b> are considered weak conductors immersed {{within the same}} medium, the geomagnetic field, are examined. Quantitative solutions indicated that {{the intensity of the}} “transcerebral ” field produced from all human brains within the geomagnetic field is the same order of magnitude as the values associated with cognitive processes and altered expressions of proteins within the individual brain. This convergence could meet one of the criteria for a holographic-like phenomenon. The transition from 6 to 8 billion brains would be associated with shared energies within individual cerebral space whose frequencies increase across the visible electromagnetic wavelength from infrared to ultraviolet. Magnetic diffusivity indicates all brains could be influenced within about 10 minutes. Implications for induced ubiquitous genetic changes, shared modifications in protein sequences associated with memory during dream sleep, and limitations upon the proliferation of the species are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} Nardosinone, a bioactive component in Nardostachys root, on the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. The neural stem cells were isolated from <b>cerebrums</b> of embryonic day 14 CD 1 mice. The proliferation of cells was monitored using the cell counting kit- 8 assay, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cell cycle analysis. Cell migration and differentiation were investigated with the neurosphere assay and cell specific markers, respectively. The results showed that Nardosinone promotes cells proliferation and increases cells migration distance in a dose-dependent manner. Nardosinone also induces the selective differentiation of neural stem cells to neurons and oligodendrocytes, {{as indicated by the}} expression of microtubule-associated protein- 2 and myelin basic protein, respectively. Nardosinone also increases the expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phospho-cAMP response element binding protein during proliferation and differentiation. In conclusion, this study reveals the regulatory effects of Nardosinone on neural stem cells, which may have significant implications for the treatment of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
50|$|The {{cerebral}} cortex {{is the human}} <b>cerebrum's</b> outer layer and is composed of neural tissue. An MRI study compared cortical thickness in various brain regions of homosexual men, heterosexual men and heterosexual women. It found that homosexual men had thinner cortices compared to heterosexual men in the right hemisphere's lateral orbitofrontal region, {{as well as in}} regions located in the visual cortex (lingual, pericalcarine and cuneus). The same regions also showed thinner cortex in heterosexual women than in heterosexual men, whereas no differences were found between heterosexual women and homosexual men. Homosexual and heterosexual men did not differ in total brain volumes and it was determined that the reported differences in cortical thickness were not affected by the subjects' years of education or brain volume. As the aforementioned regions exhibit sexual dimorphism, the authors speculated that biological processes frequently proposed to underlay sexual dimorphism, such as gene-dependent and sex hormone-dependent mechanisms during prenatal and postnatal development, may interact with the cortical architecture in visual areas resulting in different cortical thickness in homosexual versus heterosexual men.|$|R
5|$|The <b>cerebrum</b> is {{connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected}} to the brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the <b>cerebrum</b> is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the basal forebrain structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebrum,</b> brainstem, cerebellum, {{and spinal}} cord {{are covered by}} three {{membranes}} called meninges. The membranes are the tough dura mater; the middle arachnoid mater and the more delicate inner pia mater. Between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater is the subarachnoid space, which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. In the cerebral cortex, close to the basement membrane of the pia mater, is a limiting membrane called the glia limitans; this is the outermost membrane of the cortex.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the <b>cerebrum</b> that has three branches, and an interior network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
40|$|Store-operated Ca 2 + entry (SOCE) {{channels}} {{are the main}} pathway of Ca 2 + entry in non-excitable cells such as neural progenitor cells (NPCs). However, the role of SOCE channels has not been defined in the neuronal differentiation from NPCs. Here, we show that canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) as SOCE channel influences the induction of the neuronal differentiation of A 2 B 5 + NPCs isolated from postnatal- 12 -day rat <b>cerebrums.</b> The amplitudes of SOCE were significantly higher in neural cells differentiated from proliferating A 2 B 5 + NPCs and applications of SOCE blockers, 2 -aminoethoxy-diphenylborane (2 -APB), and ruthenium red (RR), inhibited their rise of SOCE. Among TRPC subtypes (TRPC 1 - 7), marked expression of TRPC 5 and TRPC 6 with turned-off TRPC 1 expression was observed in neuronal cells differentiated from proliferating A 2 B 5 + NPCs. TRPC 5 small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked the neuronal differentiation from A 2 B 5 + NPCs and reduced the rise of SOCE. In contrast, TRPC 6 siRNA had no {{significant effect on the}} neuronal differentiation from A 2 B 5 + NPCs. These results indicate that calcium regulation by TRPC 5 would play a key role as a switch between proliferation an...|$|R
40|$|Lactate {{has been}} {{identified}} as an alternative fuel for the brain in situations of increased energy demand, as following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study investigates the effect of treatment with sodium lactate (NaLac) on the changes in brain energy state induced by a severe diffuse TBI. Rats were assigned to one of the eight groups (n= 10 per group) : 1 -sham, normal saline; 2 -TBI, normal saline; 3 -TBI, hypertonic saline; 4 -TBI, 100 mM NaLac, 5 -TBI, 500 mM NaLac; 6 -TBI, 1280 mM NaLac; 7 -TBI, 2000 mM NaLac and 8 -TBI- 500 mM NaLac+magnesium sulfate. <b>Cerebrums</b> were removed 6 h after trauma. Metabolites representative of the energy state (ATP, ATP-catabolites), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), antioxidant defenses (ascorbic acid, glutathione), markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, ADP-ribose) and nicotinic coenzymes (NAD(+)) were measured by HPLC. TBI induced a marked decrease in the cerebral levels of ATP, NAA, ascorbic acid, glutathione and NAD(+) and a significant rise in the content of ATP-catabolites, malondialdehyde and ADP-ribose. These alterations were not ameliorated with NaLac infusion. We observed a significant reduction in cerebral NAD(+), an essential co-enzyme for mitochondrial lactate-dehydrogenase that converts lactate into pyruvate and thus replenishes the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These results suggest that the metabolic pathway necessary to consume lactate may be compromised following a severe diffuse TBI in rats...|$|R
40|$|Six {{hours after}} heat {{shocking}} 2 - to 3 -month-old {{male and female}} Sprague-Dawley rats at 42 degrees C for 15 min, we analyzed tau protein immunoreactivity in SDS extracts of <b>cerebrums</b> and peripheral nerves by using immunoblot analysis and immunohistochemistry with the anti-tau monoclonal antibody Tau- 1, which recognizes a phosphate-dependent non-phosphorylated epitope, and with 125 I-labeled protein A. In the cerebral extracts, we found altered phosphorylation of tau in heat-shocked females, characterized by a marked reduction {{in the amount of}} nonphosphorylated tau, a doubling of the ratio of total (phosphorylated plus nonphosphorylated) tau to nonphosphorylated tau, and the appearance of the slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptide (68 kDa). Similar, but milder, changes were observed in male rats. These changes progressively increased in females from 3 to 6 h after heat shocking. In contrast, both phosphorylated tau and nonphosphorylated tau were reduced in peripheral nerves after heat shocking. In immunoblots of SDS extracts from Alzheimer disease-affected brain, the two slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptides (62 kDa and 66 kDa, respectively) were detected by Tau- 1 after dephosphorylation and by Tau- 2 (an anti-tau-monoclonal antibody that recognizes a phosphate-independent epitope) without prior dephosphorylation only in regions that contained tau immunoreactivity in histologic preparations. In addition, quantitative immunoblot analysis of cortex and the underlying white matter with Tau- 1 and 125 I-labeled protein A showed that the amount of phosphorylated tau progressively increased in the Alzheimer disease-affected cerebral cortex, while concurrently a proportionally lesser amount of tau entered the white matter axons. The similar findings for the rat heat-shock model and Alzheimer disease suggest that life stressors {{may play a role in}} the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease...|$|R
5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the <b>cerebrum</b> {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|Niccolò Massa {{discovered}} in 1536 that the ventricles {{were filled with}} fluid. Archiangelo Piccolomini of Rome {{was the first to}} distinguish between the <b>cerebrum</b> and cerebral cortex. In 1543 Andreas Vesalius published his seven-volume De humani corporis fabrica. The seventh book covered the brain and eye, with detailed images of the ventricles, cranial nerves, pituitary gland, meninges, structures of the eye, the vascular supply to the brain and spinal cord, and an image of the peripheral nerves. Vesalius rejected the common belief that the ventricles were responsible for brain function, arguing that many animals have a similar ventricular system to humans, but no true intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Size, however, is not {{the only}} difference: there are also {{substantial}} differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is {{the part of the brain}} that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the <b>cerebrum</b> is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the pallium. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called neocortex or isocortex. Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and amygdala, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.|$|E
40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} offspring of vitamin D 3 depleted rats have enlarged ventricles and altered neurotrophin profiles (reduced NGF and GDNF). These findings enhance the biological plausibility that low prenatal vitamin D may be {{a risk factor for}} schizophrenia. Our recent behavioural studies have found that adult rats with developmental vitamin D deficiency (DVD) have a subtle increase in baseline locomotor activity and a heightened response to dopamine (DA) antagonists. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate brain DA neurochemistry in the DVD model. Methods: We examined <b>cerebrums</b> and striatal tissue from neonates and a variety of brain tissues from the remaining littermates at adulthood. DA, DOPAC, HVA, serotonin and 5 HIAA were analysed by HPLC. Single point comparisons for DA 1, DA 2 and NMDA receptors were also assessed in these tissues. Results: Significant increases in DA and HVA were found in brains from DVD deplete neonates (P= 0. 01). However, DA and its metabolites were not increased in either the neonate or adult striatum, however there was a trend towards increased DA and its metabolites in the accumbens (P= 0. 1). Receptor densities were unaffected by prenatal vitamin D levels. Conclusions: Although the effect of maternal diet appears to increase DA production and turnover in neonatal brain, this does not persist into adulthood. Thus other factors must underlie the increased locomotor activity noted in these animals. Future experiments will concentrate on monitoring accumbens and striatal DA release and turnover using microdialysis in pharmacologically challenged behavioural paradigms.

5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the <b>cerebrum</b> was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods.

5|$|The <b>cerebrum</b> is {{the largest}} {{part of the human}} brain. It is divided into two {{cerebral}} hemispheres. The cerebral cortex is an outer layer of grey matter, covering the core of white matter. The cortex is split into the neocortex and the much smaller allocortex. The neocortex is made up of six neuronal layers, while the allocortex has three or four. Each hemisphere is conventionally divided into four lobes – the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The frontal lobe is associated with executive functions including self-control, planning, reasoning, and abstract thought, while the occipital lobe is dedicated to vision. Within each lobe, cortical areas are associated with specific functions, such as the sensory, motor and association regions. Although the left and right hemispheres are broadly similar in shape and function, some functions are associated with one side, such as language in the left and visual-spatial ability in the right. The hemispheres are connected by nerve tracts, the largest being the corpus callosum.|$|E
5|$|The <b>cerebrum</b> has a {{contralateral}} organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
