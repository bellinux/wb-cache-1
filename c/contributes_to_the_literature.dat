50|$|Speaking of Abortion <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> about women's {{reception}} {{of television and}} the feminist literature {{about the relationship between}} the abortion debate and female morality and identity. Whereas most studies of media and public opinion overlook the political, moral, and social content of entertainment television, this book adds a dimension to the debate about the way media content is used by viewers as they interpret, understand, and formulate their views. Second, extant views of the separation of public and private spheres in modern American life ignore the particular experience of women, who are often identified with the private realm and dismissed as public actors. Press and Cole argue in this book that the public sphere for women is not absent, but exists in realms largely unexamined by current scholarship. They address the way the private realm often serves as a setting for formulating and expressing contending views about public issues, the role of television in that forum, and the particular form this debate takes for women. In this respect, the study expands the theoretical tradition established by the many feminist scholars who have challenged traditional definitions of the public/private distinction (Philosopher Nancy Fraser, historians Joan Scott and Linda Gordon, and political theorists Iris Young and Jean Elshtain, to name just a few). Finally, the feminist literature about abortion has either focused on activist women only in two polarized opinion camps (Luker, Ginsburg) or falsely generalized reasoning processes about abortion and other moral issues to all women based on samples composed primarily of middle-class women (Gilligan). In this study, Press and Cole focus on non-activist women, many of whom do not fall neatly into either opinion camp, or into the conventional definition of political actors; and, building on Press' earlier study, they emphasize the social class differences which divide the interpretations and self-conceptions of women.|$|E

40|$|This thesis <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on {{corporate}} cash holdings. The {{aim of the}} thesis is {{to shed light on}} the precautionary and agency motives of Indian firms’ cash holdings in their transition to integrating with the world economy. Three elements of India’s capital market transitioning phase are empirically investigated with respect to firms’ cash holdings and related financial policies. The first chapter of the thesis is concerned with the increasing presence of foreign institutional investors in Indian capital markets. It investigates whether and how foreign institutional ownership restricts the ability of corporate insiders to derive private benefits from firms’ cash holdings. This work <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> which studies corporate governance advancements in emerging markets. The second chapter of the thesis examines Indian firms’ sources of funds conducive to cash holdings. It investigates to what extent firms issue outside finance in order to save proceeds as cash. This work <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> which studies firms’ liquidity management under uncertain financing conditions. The final chapter of the thesis examines India’s capital market institutions. It investigates whether and how deepening domestic capital markets can relieve firm-level financial constraints. This work <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> which studies firm investment and growth in the context of developing market institutions. Collectively, these chapters examine the evolution of firm-level outcomes, including cash holdings, investment and firm values {{in the context of an}} emerging economy undergoing significant changes in its institutional architecture...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the recent turn in strategy research to practice-based theorizing. Based on a data set of 51 meeting observations, the paper examines how strategy meetings {{are involved in}} either stabilizing existing strategic orientations or proposing variations that cumulatively generate change in strategic orientations. Eleven significant structuring characteristics of strategy meetings are identified and examined {{with regard to their}} potential for stabilizing or destabilizing existing strategic orientations. Based on a taxonomy of meeting structures, we explain three typical evolutionary paths through which variations emerge, are maintained and developed, and are selected or de-selected. The findings make four main contributions. First, they <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on strategy-as-practice by explaining how the practice of meetings is related to consequential strategic outcomes. Second, they <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on organizational becoming by demonstrating the role of meetings in shaping stability and change. Third, they extend and elaborate the concept of meetings as strategic episodes. Fourth, they <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on garbage can models of strategy-making...|$|R

40|$|Pricing, hedging and {{investment}} are arguably the three fundamental problems in quantitative finance and asset pricing. Naturally, {{the problems are}} closely connected. The present thesis consists of three chapters. Each chapter <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> dealing with aspects of the fundamental problems. Special emphasis is put on volatility and jump risk. According to the literature on empirical asset pricing we investigate the connection between market volatility and the risk premium. This connection crucially impacts the design of (near-) optimal investment strategies. Following the classical robustness definition that mother nature plays against the investor, we study robust strategies in market environments exposed to volatility and jump risk. Another interesting aspect is the joint influence of volatility and jumps on inter-temporal hedging demands. Accounting for the hedging demand, an investor protects herself against changes in the investment opportunity set. Volatility and jumps also {{play an important role}} in the literature on option pricing. The thesis <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> by introducing a pricing and hedging method for high-dimensional basket and basket spread options. The method applies to a very general class of continuous-time pricing models comprising stochastic volatility, stochastic correlation, or jump diffusion models. Methodically, the thesis <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> on econometric modeling (Chapter 2), numerical solutions of partial differential equations (Chapter 3), and Fourier analysis (Chapter 4) ...|$|E
