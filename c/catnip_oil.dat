5000|$|Another good {{strategy}} is to recognize the chigger habitat to avoid exposure in the first place. Chiggers in North America thrive late in summer, in dry tall grasses and other thick, unshaded vegetation. Insect repellents containing {{one of the following}} active ingredients are recommended: DEET, <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> extract (nepetalactone), citronella oil or eucalyptus oil extract. However, in 1993 issue a study reported on tests of two commercial repellents: DEET and citrus oil: [...] "All chiggers exposed on the filter papers treated with DEET died and did not move off the treated papers. None of the chiggers that were placed on papers treated with citrus oil were killed." [...] It was concluded that DEET was more effective than citrus oil.|$|E

40|$|Evidence of {{repellent}} {{properties in}} catnip, Nepeta cataria L., to flies and cockroaches {{was observed in}} preliminary studies. This study compared <b>catnip</b> essential <b>oil</b> from steam distillation and elemol, a major constituent of osage orange essential oil, to current commercial repellents. These comparative studies found both the catnip steam distillate and elemol to be as good, {{and in some cases}} better, at repelling house flies, Musca domestica L., and American cockroaches, Periplaneta americana L., than N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or citronellal. Both short-term and long-term repellency bioassays were used to assess repellency. <b>Catnip</b> essential <b>oil</b> showed greater repellency than DEET and citronellal in the short term. Extended repellency bioassays showed elemol to be more repellent than catnip steam distillate, citronellal, and DEET. Nepetalactone, the major constituent of <b>catnip</b> essential <b>oil,</b> is present as two isomers, and previous studies have shown the E,Z-nepetalactone [2 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -methylethenyl) - 5 -methyl-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid delta lactone] isomer to be even more repellent to cockroaches than the dominant isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone. This study examined the seasonal variation of the two isomers, Z,E- and E,Z-nepetalactone, in catnip. Samples of fresh catnip mature leaves, immature leaves, and stems were steam-distilled separately, and isomer composition was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography (GC). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences by week. The mature leaf essential oil samples were tested in a repellency bioassay and exhibited significant repellency to German cockroaches, Blattella germanica L. The catnip floral volatiles were sampled using solid phase microextraction, and analysis with GC/mass spectrometry showed the presence of Z,E-nepetalactone, E,Z-nepetalactone, and β-caryophyllene as the major constituents. Phytophagous insects and potential pollinators present on sampling dates were recorded...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{presented}} here represent my efforts {{over the last}} several years to identify naturally occurring insect repellents. Two plants are reported here, catnip and the osage orange. The first study confirmed repellency of osage orange extracts to the maize weevil, but found that repellency to two components, osajin and pomiferin, was not significant. A second study evaluated the effects of <b>catnip</b> essential <b>oil</b> on German cockroaches. Extracts of the plant and isolated compounds were more repellent than diethyl- m-toluamide (DEET). One isomer of nepetalactone was more active than the other was. We determined that the chemoreceptors responsible for the repellent response were located on the antennae. A third study reexamined some of the activity we saw in osage orange extracts in the first study. We examined the essential oils of the fruit, and identified several sesquiterpene compounds. We tested the repellency of essential oil components to German cockroaches, and found several of them to be repellent. In the last study we examined the repellency of catnip and osage orange extracts to the yellow fever mosquito. We determined that <b>catnip</b> essential <b>oil</b> significantly reduced the number of insects near the treated area...|$|R

A triple cage olfactometer was used to bioassay each substance and to assess its attraction inhibition (spatial repellent) attributes when combined with the following attractants: carbon dioxide, acetone, a blend of L-lactic acid and acetone, and human odors. Repellent tests were conducted with each substance against female Ae. aegypti, Anopheles albimanus Weidemann, and Anopheles quadrimaculatus Say. <b>Catnip</b> <b>oil</b> and deet were both weakly attractive to Ae. aegypti, <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> was the better spatial repellent, whereas deet was a more effective contact repellent in tests with all three species of mosquitoes...|$|E
40|$|The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most serious biting flies of confined and pastured livestock. The economic losses caused by the stable fly to the cattle industry in the United States exceed 2 billion annually. Current practices for managing stable flies using insecticides provide only marginal control. Insecticide resistance has also been recently reported in stable flies. The present study reports the use of plant-based insecticides, for example, essential oils, as alternatives for managing this fly pest. The toxicity of several plant essential oils and selected ingredient compounds was evaluated by contact and fumigant toxicity bioassays. <b>Catnip</b> <b>oil</b> (20 mg dosage) showed the highest toxicity against stable flies, the shortest knock-down time (∼ 7 min), and the quickest lethal time (∼ 19 min). Toxicity levels similar to <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> were found among three insect repellent compounds (N,N-diethyl- 3 -methylbenzamide, 2 -methylpiperidinyl- 3 -cyclohexene- 1 -carboxamide, (1 S, 20 S) - 2 -methylpiperidinyl- 3 -cyclohexene- 1 -carboxamide). No differences in knock-down and lethal times were found among the <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> and its two active ingredient compounds. Similar stable fly mortality was observed using a 20 mg dose of <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> in a modified K 2 ̆ 6 D system and a fumigant jar.

40|$|Stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), {{are one of}} {{the most}} serious {{livestock}} pests, which cause significant economic loss in the cattle industry. Current practices for managing stable flies are limited to costly sanitation techniques and unsustainable insecticide applications. The present study reports the initial efforts using catnip essential oil as a spatial repellent and the results of field trials using a wax-based formulation to repel stable flies in the cattle feedlot. Electroantennograms showed that <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> and its ingredient compounds elicit significant antennal responses from both sexes of stable flies. <b>Catnip</b> <b>oil</b> and ZE- and EZ-nepetalactone showed repellent activity in a single cage olfactormeter study. No behavioral activity was observed from another ingredient compound, caryophyllene. A laboratory dispersal bioassay also showed that stable flies avoided areas treated with <b>catnip</b> <b>oil.</b> Using a solid phase microextraction (SPME) method, the atmospheric concentration of catnip active ingredient compounds (nepetalactones) absorbed by SPME fiber in treated areas was detected at 4 times higher than those in control areas.

40|$|The {{effect of}} catnip Nepeta cataria {{essential}} oil and two isomers of nepetalactone, the major components, {{on the distribution}} of Aedes aegypti (yellow fever mosquito) mosquitoes in a static-air olfactometer response was examined to determine their activity as spatial repellents. A glass cylinder was used as a choice-test chamber. The catnip (Nepeta cataria) essential oil, as well as the E,Z- and Z,E-isomers of nepetalactone were significantly repellent after application of one ml of 1 % and 0. 1 % solution to filter paper (conc. of 157 and 15. 7 µg/cm 2). Diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) a positive control was significantly repellent at 157 µg/cm 2 in this assay. Both nepetalactone isomers and the <b>catnip</b> essential <b>oil</b> had excellent spatial repellency while DEET only exhibited spatial repellency at higher concentrations. The bioassay allowed for definition of and delineation between spatial and contact repellency...|$|R

40|$|The larvicidal {{activity}} and repellency of 5 plant essential oils—thyme oil, <b>catnip</b> <b>oil,</b> amyris oil, eucalyptus oil, and cinnamon oil—were tested against 3 mosquito species: Aedes albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and Culex pipiens pallens. Larvicidal activity of these essentials oils was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} against 4 th instars {{of each of the}} 3 mosquito species, and amyris oil demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effect with LC 50 values in 24 h of 58 µg/ml (LC 90  =  72 µg/ml) for Ae. aegypti, 78 µg/ml (LC 90  =  130 µg/ml) for Ae. albopictus, and 77 µg/ml (LC 90  =  123 µg/ml) for Cx. p. pallens. The topical repellency of these selected essential oils and deet against laboratory-reared female blood-starved Ae. albopictus was examined. <b>Catnip</b> <b>oil</b> seemed to be the most effective and provided 6 -h protection at both concentrations tested (23 and 468 µg/cm 2). Thyme oil had the highest effectiveness in repelling this species, but the repellency duration was only 2 h.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Horn flies {{are among}} the most {{important}} biting fly pests of cattle in the United States. Horn fly management is largely dependent upon pesticides, which ultimately leads to the rapid development of insecticide resistance. Alternative control strategies, including repellents, have shown promising results in reducing fly biting. In the present study, we examined the efficacy and longevity of recently identified natural product repellents against horn flies. RESULTS: <b>Catnip</b> <b>oil,</b> geraniol and C 8910 acids reduced horn fly feeding in a laboratory bioassay and also exhibited spatial repellency in the olfactometer. Residual activity was observed for up to 3 days in laboratory assays; however, 24 h of residual effectiveness was observed from the two repellents when applied on cattle in the field. The limited residual effectiveness was correlated with the high volatility of the major active repellent compounds. CONCLUSION: All three natural product repellents effectively repel biting horn flies, exhibiting both feeding deterrence and spatial repellency. Theymay be used for developing an effective push-pull strategy with a slow releasematrix that can prolong their effectiveness for horn flymanagement...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} in insecticide resistant mosquito populations necessitates {{the exploration of}} novel vector control intervention measures. Push-pull strategies for insect control have been successful when used in integrated crop pest management. Through the combinatory use of deterring and attracting stimuli, the abundance of insect pests can be changed in a given area. A push-pull strategy might also significantly reduce human-vector contacts and augment existing mosquito control strategies, e. g. through the combination of an attractive trapping system and a potent spatial repellent. Our approach includes the BG-Sentinel (BGS) trap in combination with <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> (Nepeta cataria), a known spatial repellent for Aedes aegypti. To impart a deterrent effect on mosquitoes at a distance, a homogenous and continuous dispersal of volatile repellent compounds is crucial. We have developed a repellent dispensing system that is {{easy to use and}} provides a homogenous dispersal of repellent in an air curtain. The use of five 9 V fans and custom-made repellent sachets con-taining 10 % catnip essential oil created a repellent loaded air curtain that provided coverage of an area of 2 m 2 (1. 2 x 1. 65 m). Air was sampled at four different heights in the curtain an...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{studies of}} {{mammalian}} carnivores are challenging {{due to the}} animals' secretive nature and the high costs associated with their capture and handling. Use of noninvasive hair sampling to survey these reclusive species has great potential as an alternative, with wide applicability in ecology and conservation. Hairtrapping has been extensively used for focal studies of temperate mammals, but its use and applicability {{as a means to}} survey mammals in tropical environs has never been addressed. We evaluated the effectiveness. of 2 hairtrap types and 2 scents along an elevational gradient within El Cielo Biosphere Reserve (ECBR, Mexico) to detect presence of carnivores. Hairtraps that used roofing nails as a haircollecting surface collected more hairs and detected a greater number of species than did hairtraps that used velcro, strips. Different scent treatments (commercial freagrance and <b>catnip</b> <b>oil)</b> did not differ for these same variables. Of successful nail hairtraps, 60 % collected >= 20 hairs (max. = 439), providing enough material for DNA analyses. Hairtrap surveys detected 74 % of the potential target mammal species at ECBR with only 19 days of field effort. Developing countries have limited budgets for biodiversity monitoring and hairtraps compare favorably with other methods with a high costbenefit ratio. Hairtraps are inexpensive, portable, can be made with overthecounter materials, and can be successfully used to collect data applicable to population and genetic studies of tropical carnivores...|$|E
40|$|Mosquitoes are the {{dominant}} vectors of pathogens that cause infectious {{diseases such as}} malaria, dengue, yellow fever and filariasis. Current vector control strategies often rely {{on the use of}} pyrethroids against which mosquitoes are increasingly developing resistance. Here, a push-pull system is presented, that operates by the simultaneous use of repellent and attractive volatile odorants. Experiments were carried out in a semi-field set-up: a traditional house which was constructed inside a screenhouse. The release of different repellent compounds, para-menthane- 3, 8 -diol (PMD), <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> e. o. and delta-undecalactone, from the four corners of the house resulted in significant reductions of 45 % to 81. 5 % in house entry of host-seeking malaria mosquitoes. The highest reductions in house entry (up to 95. 5 %), were achieved by simultaneously repelling mosquitoes from the house (push) and removing them from the experimental set-up using attractant-baited traps (pull). The outcome of this study suggests that a push-pull system based on attractive and repellent volatiles may successfully be employed to target mosquito vectors of human disease. Reductions in house entry of malaria vectors, of the magnitude that was achieved in these experiments, would likely affect malaria transmission. The repellents used are non-toxic and can be used safely in a human environment. Delta-undecalactone is a novel repellent that showed higher effectiveness than the established repellent PMD. These results encourage further development of the system for practical implementation in the field...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the repellent properties of extracts from the catnip plant (Nepeta cataria) and the Osage orange (Madura pomifera) fruit. This chapter includes results on German cockroach (Blattella germanica), and house fly (Musca domestica) contact irritancy to catnip essential oil, and its major components, Z,E-nepetalactone and E,Z-nepetalactone, compared with the commercial standard, N,Ndiethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). Both species showed high percentage repellency values when exposed to filter paper treated with catnip essential oil or the individual nepetalactone isomers. Of the two nepetalactone isomers evaluated, German cockroaches were most responsive to the E,Z isomer. House flies showed similar trends in contact irritancy, responding to surfaces treated with the predominant catnip isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone, more intensely than to the catnip essential oil. Catnip and Osage orange essential oils, and a sesquiterpene found in Osage orange, elemol, were evaluated for repellency to the northern house mosquito (Culex pipiens) and are presented here. Two mosquito bioassays were used to measure percentage and contact repellecy. Mosquitoes responded initially with high percentage repellency to surfaces treated with catnip essential oil. From the residual repellency study, this trend in repellency by the <b>catnip</b> <b>oil</b> significantly decreased over the 180 -minute test period. Elemol, and DEET initially had lower percentage repellency values than catnip essential oil, but did not show the negative relationship between percentage repellency and time, retaining excellent repellency throughout the 3 -hour bioassay. Solutions with elemol and DEET exhibited greater significance in contact repellency compared to catnip essential oil. These results show that catnip essential oil is a potent mosquito repellent, but does not provide the same residual effects as the commercial standard, DEET, Elemol, a sesquiterpene extracted from the fruit of the Osage orange, shows excellent promise as a mosquito repellent with comparable activity to DEET in contact and residual repellency...|$|E
40|$|A new {{and general}} {{strategy}} for hetero- and carbocycle synthesis has been developed.
