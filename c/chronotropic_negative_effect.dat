Remifentanil, because of its pharmacologic properties {{could be a very}} interesting approach. This short-acting drug could protect the patient during procedure without increasing the risk of oversedation and consequences. In this study, we did not observe differences in the variation of BIS values, as a surrogate for analgesia evaluation, between the Remifentanil and placebo groups in mechanically ventilated, deeply sedated patients during a fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Moreover, BIS value did not change over time in both groups. We also do not observe significant difference between placebo and Remifentanil group according to PAM and heart rate. Heart rate is always higher in the placebo group than in the remifentanil one, which could be explained by direct <b>chronotropic</b> <b>negative</b> <b>effect</b> of Remifentanil. The absence of BIS variation observed during the procedure could be explained by different ways. The very low values recorded {{at the beginning of the}} procedure can limit the impact of adjunctive therapy. Indeed, we choose to study a particular group of patients needing deep sedation for procedure. We may hypothesize that deep sedation conducted to low initial BIS value, leading to blunt significant variation in BIS value. Statistically, an expected decrease in BIS value of 50 [*]%, used in anterior studies, is probably overestimated in this particular setting of deep sedated patients, and the sample size could be underevaluated. Tolerance to fentanyl developed before the procedure could limit the interpretation of results, but length of sedation before procedure was short and dose was controlled by pain scale. Furthermore, no signs of opioids tolerance were developed by patients. We can also hypothesize that the level of pain is not sufficient but previous study described fiberoptic examination as one of the most painful procedure [...]...|$|E

Objective: To investigate the influence of pharmacokinetics of beta-blockers in heart rate (HR) and autonomic activity (AA) {{in response to the}} exercise. Methods: Three groups of hypertensive patients, users of atenolol (n= 9), enalapril, (n= 8), and a normotensive control group (n= 8), performed two sessions of moderate exercise on a cycloergometer, during 40 minutes, whereby 2 hours (Session I), or 23 hours after drug administration (Session II). Records of electrocardiogram were made before, during and after the exercises. Results: The HR was lower in session I comparing with session II of the atenolol group during the exercise. There were no differences in the components of low and high frequency of AA between these sessions. Conclusions: These results confirm the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of BB.

Right atria of adult Wistar rats {{were used to}} evaluate the effects of adenosine, ATP and CPA (an adenosine A 1 receptor agonist), in the presence and absence of DPCPX, an adenosine A 1 receptor antagonist. Effects of adenosine A 2 and A 3 receptors agonists and antagonists were also investigated. Finally, involvement of calcium and potassium channels in these responses was assessed using BayK 8644 and 4 -Aminopyridine. Cumulative concentration–effect curves of adenosine and CPA resulted in a <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> culminating in cardiac arrest at 1000 μM (adenosine) and 1 µM (CPA). Furthermore, ATP produced a <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> at 1 – 300 µM and cardiac arrest at 1000 μM in the right atrium. ATPγS (a non-hydrolysable analogue of ATP) reduced chronotropism only. The effects of adenosine, CPA and ATP were inhibited by DPCPX, a selective adenosine A 1 receptor antagonist. The selective adenosine A 2 and A 3 receptors antagonists did not alter the chronotropic response of adenosine. 4 -Aminopyridine, a blocker of potassium channels at 10 mM, prevented the cardiac arrest produced by adenosine and ATP, while BayK 8644, activator of calcium channels, did not prevent cardiac arrest.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of remifentanil on RR interval and on HRV in children. Forty children ASA I or II were studied after approval by the human studies committee and informed parental consent was obtained. After stabilisation at sevoflurane 1 MAC, they were randomly divided into two groups: one received a 20 microg. kg(- 1) atropine injection (AT + REMI) and the other ringer lactate solution (REMI). Three minutes later, a 1 microg. kg(- 1) bolus of remifentanil was administered over 1 min, followed by a continual infusion at 0. 25 microg. kg(- 1). min(- 1) for 10 min increased to 0. 5 microg. kg(- 1). min(- 1) for a further 10 min. A time varying, autoregressive analysis of RR sequences was used to estimate classical spectral parameters: low (0. 04 - 0. 15 Hz; LF) and high (0. 15 - 0. 45 Hz; HF) frequency, whereas the root mean square of successive differences of RR intervals (rmssd) was derived directly from the temporal sequence. Statistical analyses were conducted {{by means of the}} multiple correspondence analysis and with non parametrical tests. Remifentanil induced an RR interval lengthening, i. e. bradycardia, in both groups compared to pretreatment values and was associated with an increase of HF and rmssd only for the REMI group.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{synthesized}} from L-arginine is a ubiquitous intracellular {{chemical messenger}} and {{is involved in}} signal transduction in diverse mammalian cells, including vascular endothelium and neuronal tissues. The role of the NO-signaling pathway in the direct modulation of cardiac function is less well characterized. In this report, the effects of inhibitors of NO synthase (NOS) were examined in isolated neonatal and adult rat ventricular myocytes exposed to either muscarinic or adrenergic agonists. Carbachol (10 microM) caused a 91 % inhibition of the spontaneous beating rate of cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine, an L-arginine analog that inhibits NOS, and methylene blue, an inhibitor of NO, blocked the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of carbachol but {{had no effect on}} the basal beating rate of these cells. The inhibition by N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine of the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of carbachol was reversed by adding excess L-arginine. The <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of carbachol was also mimicked by analogs of cGMP, a second messenger implicated in mediating the action of NO in other cell types. Production of NO could be detected directly in carbachol-stimulated neonatal myocytes by using a reporter cell bioassay. The regulation of adrenergic responsiveness by the NO signaling system was also documented in studies of adult cardiac myocyte contractility. The NOS inhibitor N omega-nitro-L-arginine significantly increased the inotropic effect of the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol on electrically stimulated adult rat ventricular myocytes, whereas this inhibitor had no effect on basal contractility. Inhibition of NO production by N omega-monomethyl-L-arginine in these cells, as measured by reporter cell bioassay, was also reversible with excess L-arginine. Thus, the physiologic response of isolated neonatal and adult ventricular myocytes to both muscarinic cholinergic and beta-adrenergic stimulation is mediated, at least in part, by products of an endogenous NOS...|$|R

Muscarinic receptors of guinea-pig heart homogenates were labelled with tritiated quinuclidinyl-benzilate [(3 H]QNB) in the absence and in the presence of chloroquine. Chloroquine (10 (- 5) - 10 (- 4) M) produced a shift of the QNB saturation binding curve to the right. Increasing the chloroquine concentration {{in the presence of a}} constant QNB concentration produced a progressive decrease in QNB binding, but the QNB-chloroquine competition curves were shallow (Hill coefficients = 0. 65). Chloroquine also shifted the QNB-carbachol competition curve to the right without changing its Hill slope. In electrophysiological experiments, chloroquine inhibited the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of carbachol in Langendorff-perfused hearts. This inhibitory effect of chloroquine was obtained at concentrations lower than those expected to produce significant binding to muscarinic receptors, and was not completely reversible.

40|$|The endothelial isoform of {{nitric oxide}} synthase (eNOS) is dually acylated and thereby {{targeted}} to signal-transducing microdomains termed caveolae. In endothelial cells, eNOS interacts with caveolin- 1, which represses eNOS enzyme activity. In cardiac myocytes, eNOS associates with the muscle-specific caveolin- 3 isoform, but whether this interaction affects NO production and regulates myocyte function is unknown. We isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes from mutant mice with targeted disruption of the eNOS gene and transfected them with wild-type (WT) eNOS or myristoylation-deficient (myr-) eNOS mutant cDNA. In myocytes expressing WT eNOS, the muscarinic cholinergic agonist carbachol completely abrogated the spontaneous beating rate and induced a 4 -fold elevation of the cGMP level. By contrast, in the myr- eNOS myocytes, carbachol failed to exert its <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> and to increase cGMP levels. We then used a reversible permeabilization protocol to load intact neonatal rat myocytes with an oligopeptide corresponding to the caveolin- 3 scaffolding domain.

Moreover, the influence of pertussis toxin on the inotropic and chronotropic effects of adenosine and carbachol in A 1 -adenosine receptor overexpressing atria was studied. Adenosine and carbachol alone exerted <b>negative</b> inotropic and <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in electrically driven left atrium or spontaneously beating right atrium of wild-type mice. These effects were abolished or reversed by pre-treatment of animals with pertussis toxin which can interfere with signal transduction through G-proteins.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Herbs {{have been}} used for many centuries in diverse civilizations for the {{treatment}} of heart disease. Only a few natural supplements claim to have direct cardiovascular actions including hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) and berberine derived from the Berberidaceae family. Several different studies indicate important cardiovascular effects of hawthorn and berberine. For example, both exert positive inotropic effects and {{have been used}} in the treatment of congestive heart failure. Recently, it was shown that hawthorn extract preparations cause <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in a cultured neonatal murine cardiomyocyte assay independent of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The aim {{of this study was to}} further characterize the effect of hawthorn extract to decrease the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes. We hypothesized that hawthorn extract may be acting through muscarinic receptors to decrease contraction rate of cardiomyocytes. Atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes were treated with hawthorn extract in the presence of atropine or himbacine. Changes in the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes revealed that both muscarinic antagonists significantly attenuated the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> activity of hawthorn extract. Using quinuclidinyl benzilate, L-[benzylic- 4, 4 '- 3 H] ([³H]-QNB) as a radioligand antagonist, the effect of a partially purified hawthorn extract fraction to inhibit muscarinic receptor binding was quantified. Hawthorn extract fraction 3 dose-dependently inhibited [³H]-QNB binding to mouse heart membranes. These findings suggest that muscarinic receptors may be involved in the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of hawthorn extracts in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes. Berberine exhibits variable positive and <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in different species. Our first aim was to examine the effect of berberine in a cultured neonatal murine cardiomyocyte assay. Our study demonstrates that berberine has significant <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> actions on cardiomyocytes which is not an effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. Pertussis toxin (PTX), a Gi/o protein inhibitor, blocked the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> activity of berberine. Muscarinic, adenosine, opioid, and α₂ receptors are coupled through a G-protein (Gi/o) to adenylyl cyclase in an inhibitory fashion. Activation of these receptors are primarily responsible for PTX-sensitive <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in heart. We hypothesized that berberine may be acting through one of these receptor type to decrease contraction rate of cardiomyocytes. For this purpose, we studied the effects of the muscarinic-receptor antagonists, atropine, himbacine, or AF- DX 116 on the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> activity of berberine. Muscarinic antagonists completely blocked the effect of berberine on contraction rate of cardiomyocytes, whereas the bradycardic effect of berberine was not inhibited by the opioid, adenosine, or α 2 receptor antagonists naloxone, CGS 15943, or phentolamine, respectively. Using [³H]QNB as a radioligand, we demonstrated that berberine bound to muscarinic receptors of adult mouse heart membranes with relatively high affinity. Furthermore, berberine dose-dependently inhibited [³H]QNB binding to muscarinic M 2 receptors exogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells. Therefore, the findings of the present study suggest that berberine has muscarinic agonist effects in cultured neonatal murine cardiomyocytes, potentially explaining reported physiological effects of berberine. Cardiac hypertrophy represents the most important factor in the development of congestive heart failure. We investigated the inhibitory effect of berberine on hypertrophy of H 9 c 2 cells. In rat heart-derived H 9 c 2 myoblast cells treated with different hypertrophic agonists such as insulin growth factor II (IGF-II), arginine vasopressin (AVP), phenylephrine, and isoproterenol, protein content and size of cells were significantly increased compared to control group. However, the number of H 9 c 2 cells after treatment with hypertrophic agonists did not differ significantly compared to control. The increases in area of cells and protein content induced by the hypertrophic agonists were inhibited by treatment with berberine in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings have provided the first scientific evidence that berberine may have an inhibitory effect on hypertrophy of heart-derived cells, and provide a rationale for further studies to evaluate berberine's cardiac activity...|$|R

After the i. v. administration of 200 micrograms/kg (0. 60 mumol/kg) of CPA, the time course of heart rate and arterial blood pressure was monitored in conjunction with serial blood sampling. Potential interference of the concentration-cardiovascular effect relationship by the development of acute tolerance or the formation of (inter) active metabolites was investigated by infusion of CPA with different rates and by determination of blood concentrations both by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioreceptor assay. In the individual rats the concentration-hemodynamic effect relationships were satisfactorily modeled according to the sigmoidal Emax pharmacodynamic model. For the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect,</b> the pharmacodynamic parameters proved to be independent of the infusion rate, indicating the absence of development of acute tolerance during the experiment. Potency (EC 50) and intrinsic efficacy (Emax) were 2. 7 +/- 0. 5 ng/ml and - 209 +/- 10 bpm, respectively (mean +/- S. E., n = 17).

In equimolecular as well as higher amounts (10 – 4 M) the hypoxanthine derivatives Inosine, IMP, IDP and ITP did not show any effect neither on the S-A node nor on the A-V node...|$|R
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDPlants used in {{traditional}} medicines {{have served as}} sources {{of some of the}} drug compounds used in medicines today, and could still serve as leads for then development of new drugs to treat existing chronic diseases such as hypertension. This study was aimed at the isolation and identification of a cardio-active compound from L. leonurus, a plant commonly used {{in traditional}} medicines in South Africa for the treatment of hypertension and other cardiac problems. The possible mechanisms by which the isolated compound produced its effect on the cardiovascular system were explored using the anaesthetized normotensive rat model. Fractionation of the organic extracts of the leaves led to the isolation of a novel diterpene,(13 S) - 9, 13 -epoxylabda- 6 (19), 15 (14) diol dilactone (EDD) whose structure was elucidated using infra red (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectroscopy(MS), and X-ray diffraction analysis. In anaesthetized normotensive male Wistar rats, EDD(0. 5 mg/kg – 5. 0 mg/kg; IV) produced slight non-significant decreases in systolic pressure(SP), diastolic pressure (DP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) with the lower (0. 5 mg/kg– 2. 0 mg/kg) doses, while significant increases in SP, DP and MAP occurred with the higher (3. 0 mg/kg – 5. 0 mg/kg) doses. All doses of EDD administered also produced significant decreases in heart rate (HR). Prazosin and reserpine pre-treatment abolished the vasoconstrictive effect of EDD,suggesting an indirect vasoconstrictive effect for EDD via the release of catecholamines. Atenolol pre-treatment led to increases in the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of EDD, while the positive chronotropic effect of dobutamine was significantly decreased by EDD,suggesting the involvement of the 1 adrenoceptor in the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of EDD. In animals pre-treated with verapamil, a cardio-selective Ca 2 + channel blocker, no significant changes in HR occurred with all EDD doses, but HR values were significantly lower than those obtained with EDD in non pre-treated animals. The results {{of this study indicate that}} (13 S) - 9, 13 -epoxylabda- 6 (19), 15 (14) diol dilactone, a novel dilactone diterpene isolated from the leaves of L. leonurus has an effect on the cardiovascular system. EDD exhibits a dual effect on the cardiovascular system by producing a vasoconstrictive effect accompanied by bradycardia. The vasoconstrictive effect of EDD is probably due to the release of catecholamines, while the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> is probably due to 1 adrenoceptor antagonism. Further studies are however required to fully determine the mechanism by which EDD produces its cardiovascular effects...|$|R
40|$|Untreated rats, {{and rats}} treated with methimazole (0. 05 % w/v in {{drinking}} water) or thyroxine (1 mg/kg, s. c., three times weekly) for 4 - 6 weeks to induce hypo- and hyperthyroidism respectively, {{were used to}} study the influence of thyroid hormone upon <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> and inotropic responses mediated by cardiac muscarinic receptors, and upon the affinity of these receptors for atropine. <b>Negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of methacholine were investigated by establishing partial concentration-response curves for isolated preparations of right atria. Methacholine was least potent in tissues from thyroxine-treated rats. Isolated left atria paced at 3 Hz, and spontaneously beating right atria, were used in studies of the <b>negative</b> inotropic <b>effects</b> of methacholine. This agonist was least potent in atria from the thyroxine-treated rats in which it also produced the smallest maximal responses. The <b>negative</b> inotropic <b>effects</b> of carbachol were examined on left atria paced at 3, 5 and 5. 8 Hz to approximate the basal contraction rates of isolated right atria from methimazole-treated, untreated control and thyroxine-treated rats, respectively. At each of these frequencies, carbachol was most potent in atria from methimazole-treated rats, and least potent in atria from thyroxine-treated rats. Maximal responses were smallest in the latter group. pA 2 values for atropine with methacholine as the agonist were obtained by the method of Arunlakshana & Schild (1959) for spontaneously beating right atria (<b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> and inotropic <b>effects)</b> and left atria paced at 3 Hz (<b>negative</b> inotropic <b>effects).</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Adenosine and the A 1 -adenosine {{receptor}} agonist R-PIA, exerted a <b>negative</b> inotropic <b>effect</b> in isolated, electrically driven left atria of wild-type mice. In left atria of mice overexpressing the A 1 -adenosine receptor, adenosine and R-PIA exerted a positive inotropic effect. The positive inotropic effect of adenosine and R-PIA in transgenic atria could be {{blocked by the}} A 1 -adenosine receptor antagonist DPCPX. In the presence of isoprenaline, adenosine exerted a <b>negative</b> inotropic <b>effect</b> in wild-type atria but a positive inotropic effect in atria from A 1 -adenosine receptor overexpressing mice. The rate of beating in right atria was lower in mice overexpressing A 1 -adenosine receptors compared with wild-type. Adenosine exerted comparable <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> in right atria from both A 1 -adenosine receptor overexpressing and wild-type mice. A 1 -adenosine receptor overexpression in the mouse heart can reverse the inotropic but not the chronotropic effects of adenosine, implying different receptor-effector coupling mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The use the aqueous {{decoction}} of Leonotis leonurus (L. leonurus) (Ll) R. Br. (Lamiaceae) in {{the treatment}} of hypertension (HPT) in traditional medicine is well documented. The effect of the aqueous extract of LI on the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) has been investigated in normotensive rats. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of Ll aqueous extract on the in isolated perfused rat heart (IPRH). Hearts were excised from male Wistar albino rats weighing 250 - 350 g, aged less than 6 months. They were perfused at constant flow using the modified Langendorff perfused model of the heart. Effects of adrenaline on the left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), heart rate (HR), cardiac work (CW) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) were compared to that of Ll. Adrenaline (1 µM) significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the LVSP by 40. 6 %, the LVDP by 43. 9 %, the HR by 22. 5 % and the CW by 89. 4 %. Ll (1. 0 mg/ml and 2. 0 mg/ml respectively and significantly (p< 0. 01) increased the LVSP by 25. 36 and 14. 91, the LVDP by 29. 40 and 14. 88. Ll (1. 0 mg/ml and 2. 0 mg/ml) significantly produced a <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect.</b> Both adrenaline and Ll aqueous extract did not have any significant effect on the LVEDP. Adrenaline resulted in positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. At low concentrations Ll produced a positive inotropic and a <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect.</b> At the concentration of 2. 0 mg/ml Ll decreased all parameters to zero. At higher concentrations higher than 2. 0 mg/ml, Ll seemed to have toxic effects on the heart...|$|R
40|$|WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECTClinical {{pharmacology}} {{and clinical}} therapeutic studies of fingolimod demonstrate that heart rate {{after the initial}} dose decreases by about 10 – 20 % while normal circadian rhythm is preserved. With continued daily dosing, heart rate returns to normal over the next 2 weeks. This <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> {{is consistent with the}} binding of fingolimod-phosphate to the sphingosine- 1 -phosphate receptor on atrial myocytes. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThe present clinical pharmacology study demonstrates that atropine administered at usual therapeutic doses can prevent the decrease in heart rate when given concomitantly with fingolimod and can counteract the decrease in heart rate when give {{at the time of the}} typical heart rate nadir, 4 h after the fingolimod dose. Although therapeutic intervention is rarely needed for reduced heart rate in patients receiving fingolimod, atropine is an option, should this be desired...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert {{their effects}} by {{inhibiting}} angiotensin II (AII) production, {{but also by}} inhibiting bradykinin (BK) degradation. In order to clarify whether BK {{is involved in the}} systemic effects of ACE inhibition in the newborn period, we investigated the effect of perindoprilat (20 microgram/kg i. v.) in newborn rabbits, with or without the blockade of BK beta(2) -receptors (Hoe 140, 300 microgram/kg s. c.). The bolus infusion of perindoprilat resulted in a marked fall in mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and a slight decrease in heart rate. BK receptor blockade had no effect on the perindoprilat-induced hypotension but the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effect</b> of ACE inhibition was partly prevented by pretreatment with Hoe 140. We therefore conclude that BK is not involved in neonatal blood pressure regulation but that the ACE inhibition-induced neonatal bradycardia is at least partly BK- mediated...|$|R
40|$|Amiodarone was {{selectively}} perfused {{into the}} sinus node artery and atrioventricular node artery of 51 dogs. Amiodarone had an immediate <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> and dromotropic <b>effect.</b> Threshold concentration was 2. 5 micrograms/ml. 25 and 50 micrograms/ml of amiodarone {{injected into the}} sinus node artery slowed the heart by 25. 6 +/- 3. 1 and 33. 7 +/- 2. 6 beats/min (mean +/- 1 SEM), respectively. Amiodarone 25 and 50 micrograms/ml injected into the AV node artery during AV junctional rhythm slowed the AV junctional pacemaker by 12. 2 +/- 1. 8 and 17. 4 +/- 1. 7 beats/min, respectively. Injections of amiodarone into the AV node artery during sinus rhythm regularly increased AV conduction time sometimes causing 2 degrees AV block at the highest concentration used. Impaired conduction was exclusively measured {{at the level of}} the A-H interval in the His electrogram. Neither atropine nor propranolol prevented the <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> <b>effects</b> of amiodarone. Amiodarone had no significant effect on sinus node response to either stellate stimulation or intranodal administration of norepinephrine. The <b>negative</b> <b>chronotropic</b> action of amiodarone was significantly enhanced when amiodarone was administered in a perfusate containing low (0. 6 mM) instead of normal calcium. Taken collectively these observations indicate that amiodarone has immediate depressant electrophysiologic effects on both the sinus node and the AV junction and that these early effects might involve the blockade of the slow channel...|$|R
