Although it is discussed at firm level in narrative studies, in empirical studies technology {{orientation is}} mostly considered in a single-dimensional construct and associated with R&D and manufacturing departments. This study proposed that technology orientation needs to be studied at firm level in a multidimensional construct. The objective of the study is to constitute and operationalize the multidimensional construct of technology orientation. A two-step field study with a survey method was preferred. Manufacturing firms in Izmir were in the focus of the study. In the final field study, 147 firms participated. According to the findings, a reliable and valid multidimensional technology orientation scale is employed, where the dimensions were named as top management capability, technological <b>capability,</b> <b>commitment</b> to learning and commitment to change...|$|E
40|$|Universities are {{fundamentally}} still academic communities {{as opposed to}} being corporations. The core processes that are fundamental to creating and sustaining communities according to Bryan Smith (Senge, Ross, Smith, Roberts, & Kleiner, 1994) enhance <b>capability,</b> <b>commitment,</b> contribution, continuity, collaboration and conscience. These processes underpin the principles and practice of a research skills development program at a large multi-modal, multi-campus university. With increasing emphasis on the need for staff to undertake research and student growth in post-graduate study programs it is crucial to provide staff with opportunities to enhance their skills both to undertake and supervise research. There are several tensions at tertiary education institutions currently, viz. increasing workloads and accountability, decreasing growth in some programs and increasing post-graduate registration, financial cutbacks in government subsidies, staff reductions as a result of institutional restructuring resulting in conflict and competition among staff, among others. This has resulted in increasing demands being made on staff time. They are expected to 'do more with less', that is, being responsible for teaching more students, undertaking research and engaging in professional development. An attempt is made in this paper to describe a learning partnership model adopted to develop and enhance research expertise thereby sustaining a collegial, academic community. The staff development unit plays a dual role of acting as catalyst to initiate and sustain learning partnerships as well as furthering the aim of collegiality, viz. sharing best practice. This is achieved by harnessing the expertise of senior experienced staff in the planning and delivery of training sessions. The training is designed to give all staff participating the opportunity to share their ideas, experience and expertise. Maintaining the balance between being 'instructive' and 'constructive' is the ultimate challenge facing the Unit, viz. of being catalyst in the learning partnership relationship. The Research Skills Certificate, an example of a partnership initiative launched at the beginning of 2001 provides staff with the incentive and reward to engage in professional development activities despite time and other pressures. Staff members attend the training sessions {{for a variety of reasons}} that range from being personal interests to institutional requirements. Obtaining a Certificate provides staff with the incentive to attend generic research management skills training required to undertake successful research which varies from general consciousness raising in terms of policy and guidelines, writing good proposals for research and funding, being able to supervise student research, to writing for publication, among other skills. Other learning partnerships facilitated by the staff development unit include both departmental and individual consultations. Finally, in the light of under-resourced and -staffed development units generally, analysing, showcasing and documenting the practice of one university provide the opportunity for extending partnerships between and among staff development units. There would be sharing of expertise and resources across units that would avoid re-inventing the wheel each time. In conclusion, the extent to which the adoption of a learning partnership model is effective is summed up. If learning partnerships work within institutions, why shouldn't they work across institutions in higher education...|$|E

40|$|Every {{business}} organisation {{has a unique}} set of challenges and problems. The family business is mainly affected by personal factors and family political influences. Most family business political influences are based on succession. Many of these problems exist in corporate business environments, but can be exaggerated in a family business. Family businesses go through various stages of growth and development over time. Many of these challenges will be found once the second and subsequent generations enter the business. One of the key problems is succession planning. Most family organisations do not have a plan for handing the power to the next generation, leading to great political conflicts and divisions. Despite the foregoing problems, family business is the world’s dominant form of {{business organisation}}. Based on figures compiled by the Family Firm Institute (FFI), in the Barclays Wealth Insights 2009, family firms comprise 80 % to 90 % of all businesses in North America. In the United Kingdom 75 % of all businesses are family businesses. Some of the world’s biggest and best-known companies are family-owned. In the United States, some 37 % of Fortune 500 companies are family-owned. In the global beer industry there are two family owned businesses in the top five, namely the Anheuser Busch Inbev Brewing Company and Heineken Breweries. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, a Heineken family member is delegate member of the Board of directors of Heineken Holding N. V. (Heineken Annual Report, 2011). This research report investigated succession at Heineken (as a family business). The researcher employed a mixed methodology approach where both quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments were used to gather data from two different groups of respondents (Heineken Operational Company Executives and Heineken Expatriates). Numerous attempts were made to contact Mrs Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken as well as other members of the Heineken family, without success. None of the questionnaires were returned. The research concluded that despite the fact that Heineken management has been highly professionalised with the majority of senior management structures filled with non-family members; the company is still a family business because 50. 005 % of the shareholding is held by Mrs. de Carvalho Heineken who is a family member. The research also observed that Mrs. de Carvalho Heineken sits on the Heineken Board of Directors. There is also an interesting side to the family ownership of the Heineken business. According to the Heineken Group’s 2009 Annual Report, the Hoyer family and Heineken family own L’Arche Green, a company that holds 58. 78 % interest in Heineken Holdings. This scenario confirms earlier research findings that according to the Agency Theory, managers who are not owners will not watch over the affairs of a firm as diligently as owners managing the firm themselves. The placement of Mrs. de Carvalho Heineken and Mr. D. P. Hoyer on Board of Directors is therefore very strategic in terms of maintaining the “familiness” of the Heineken business. Although respondents were not as direct as to whether there was a succession plan at Heineken, available documents reveal that indeed there is a succession plan at the company. It {{is interesting to note that}} Mrs. de Carvalho Heineken has been a member of the Executive Board of Directors since the age of thirty-four (she was nominated in 1988). This type of exposure to the Heineken business would went a long way in preparing Mrs. de Carvalho-Heineken for future positions. Her experience as a member of the Executive Board of Directors therefore confirms results of studies that found that positive firm performance by family successors is associated with successor’s development and intergenerational relationships, succession planning, successor’s potential <b>capability,</b> <b>commitment</b> to the firm and successor’s business skills...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the origins and}} prospects of NATO's Prague <b>Capabilities</b> <b>Commitment</b> (PCC). Following {{the end of the}} Cold War in 1989 - 1991, NATO's conventional military capabilities rose in importance as the Allies undertook crisis management operations in the Balkans. Capability shortcomings, particularly among the European Allies, led NATO in 1999 to approve a Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI). However, the DCI's disappointing results, the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, the subsequent American military action in Afghanistan in cooperation with NATO Allies, the leading role of NATO Allies in the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul, and other factors convinced the Allies to make a new effort to improve capabilities. The Allies decided at the November 2002 Prague Summit to endorse the PCC. The PCC's prospects for success may not be greater than those of the DCI unless the European Allies commit greater resources, pool assets in multinational frameworks, pursue specialization in military missions, and modify their procurement priorities. Moreover, the PCC's success hinges on closely related initiatives: the NATO Response Force and the new command structures. Major, United States Marine Corp...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} organizational service {{orientation and}} focused on the dimensions, limits and measurability of the construct. A concept-centric literature review was conducted to clarify the borders of the construct, to investigate the dimensions of the construct and to gather tools for comprehensive measurement of the construct. Based on the findings, this study constructed an analytical framework for organizational service orientation and formed a scale that measures it accordingly. The framework and the scale represent a comprehensive view on the subject avoiding the context restrictions evident in previous research. The theoretical findings implicate that the following dimensions are essential for organizational service orientation: internal characteristics (e. g., service climate and organizational culture), strategy (e. g., service-orientated business strategy and service-oriented strategic choices) {{and the nature of the}} services offered (e. g., services in support of the client's actions or in support of the product). In the empirical section, the framework and the scale were utilized to gather data from the retail sector to examine organizational service orientation. First, the scales were pre-tested during February-March 2013 with a test survey among the members of the Union of special trade (Erikoiskaupanliitto) yielding 39 responses. Second, the actual quantitative data used in this study was collected during October-November 2013 with a web-based questionnaire administered to 1263 operative managers of speciality retail stores in Finland. The survey yielded 152 acceptable responses (response rate 12. 02 %).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine the marketing strategies of Ethiopian medium and large textile companies. The textile sector became the focus of this study because it has performed far below expectation, despite the government‘s unreserved support to the sector and the country‘s comparative advantage in the sector. To attain the stated objective, qualitative research approach with case study design was employed. The cases were selected based on two criteria; production of finished textile products and operation in both local and global markets. Accordingly, nine companies qualified these criteria and all of them were used as cases. The RBV was the theory employed to explain the differences in performances among firms‘ in similar environment. Furthermore, within and cross case analyses were employed to get in-depth understanding and to explain about the marketing strategies of the firms. The major findings of the study indicate that the emphasis given to marketing strategy and the marketing resources and <b>capabilities</b> <b>commitment</b> thereof were found to be so low that the companies seemed to equate marketing strategy with selling strategy. Furthermore, the companies failed to link their marketing enabling environment with their marketing strategy. Similarly, such weak link was reflected between the firms‘ marketing strategy and their market performances. Hence, the marketing strategies of the case companies are so weak that with their current marketing strategy, it is difficult for them to be competent in the local market, let alone in the international markets. Generally, both empirical and conceptual conclusions were drawn from the findings. As a result, the cross-case findings indicate that marketing resources commitment is linearly linked to marketing strategy which in turn is linked to export performances. Therefore, it can be understood that the link between enabling environment and marketing strategy is direct and the link between marketing strategy and marketing performances is linear. Hence, it can be understood from this transitivity that there exists a link between firms‘ enabling environment and their marketing performances. Business ManagementD. B. L...|$|R
