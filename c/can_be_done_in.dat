5|$|There are {{different}} ways to determine the value of c. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> various astronomical and earth-based setups. However, {{it is also possible}} to determine c from other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constants ε0 and μ0 and using their relation to c. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equalling c.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E
5|$|Bicycle kicks are {{generally}} done in two situations, one defensive {{and the other}} offensive. A defensive bicycle kick is done when a player facing his side's goal uses the action to clear {{the ball in the}} direction opposite his side's goalmouth. Sports historian Richard Witzig considers defensive bicycle kicks a desperate move requiring less aim than its offensive variety. An offensive bicycle kick is used when a player has his back to the opposing goal and is near the goalmouth. According to Witzig, the offensive bicycle kick requires concentration and a good understanding of the ball's location. Bicycle kicks can also be done in the midfield, but this is not recommended because safer and more accurate passes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> this zone.|$|E

5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 kilohertz during calculations and dropping to 15 kilohertz between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E

25|$|Maturing <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> a vat. It takes {{little time}} to clarify and to prepare the {{packaging}} (bottling or Bag-In-Box) but this may be extended by maturing of lees. This type of maturing consists of regularly adding fine lees in suspension in the wine. The dead yeast {{is used for the}} fine lees which digests itself (autolysis) giving the wine volume and body to support the fruitiness. This operation is called Bâtonnage or stirring and is traditionally done with a stick to agitate the lees {{at the bottom of the}} barrel. This technique needs to be well controlled, however, otherwise the wine may take on a Goût de réduit (Reduced taste) due to the activity of reductase sulphite from the yeast. This operation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> vats, as in Muscadet, barrels as in Burgundy and many chardonnays, or bottles as in champagne.|$|E
