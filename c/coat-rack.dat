50|$|The song is {{featured}} in Stop Making Sense (1984), a concert film featuring Talking Heads {{and directed by}} Jonathan Demme. Throughout the Stop Making Sense version, Byrne and his bandmates perform by a standard lamp, while close-up images of various body parts are projected onto a screen behind them. As revealed on the commentary to the film, the body parts belong to Byrne and his girlfriend (later wife) Adelle Lutz who was also known as Bonnie. When the song reaches a bridge, the musicians step back and Byrne dances with the lamp, a reference to Fred Astaire's similar dance with a <b>coat-rack</b> in the film Royal Wedding. During the song, Weymouth is seen playing a rare Fender Swinger electric guitar, instead of her usual bass.|$|E
40|$|This solo {{exhibition}} {{takes place at}} the Overbeck Gesellschaft, Luebeck, Germany, between 17 Nov 2013 – 12 Jan 2014. The exhibition extends the enquiry embodied in the installation (chair, <b>coat-rack,</b> stretcher) shown in 2010 at Espace Arlaud (Des Seins à Dessein, Lausanne) and on the exploration of alternative venues for showing contemporary views on jewellery and body related issues. Understanding the exhibition as a discursive element in research (see interview, Bernabei, 2011), speculative design and artistic installations were developed to investigate the merging between medical techniques of self-design and the everydayness of domestic interiors. Referencing the mass-media familiarity with the medical operation-theatre, this exhibition uses the three rooms of the pavilion (134 -m 2) to reflect on the relationship between home-improvement and body-improvement. Work made for the venue, including site-specific work and photography, utilise chromed tubing, glass, leather and 2 nd hand furniture as prime materials, appropriating in a critical manner the grammar of Modern design...|$|E
