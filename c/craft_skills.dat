5|$|Nineteenth and {{twentieth century}} avant-garde artistic {{movements}} {{took an interest}} in the typographical arts, greatly enriching book design and illustration. In the late nineteenth century, William Morris founded the Arts and Crafts movement, which emphasized the value of traditional <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> that seemed to be disappearing in the mass industrial age. His designs, like the work of the Pre-Raphaelite painters with whom he was associated, referred frequently to medieval motifs. In 1891 he founded the Kelmscott Press, which by the time it closed in 1898 had produced over fifty works using traditional printing methods, a hand-driven press and hand-made paper. They included his masterpiece, an edition of the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer with illustrations by Edward Burne-Jones. Morris also invented three distinctive typefaces - Golden, Troy, and Chaucer, with the text being framed with intricate floral borders similar to illuminated medieval manuscripts. His work inspired many small private presses in the following century.|$|E
25|$|Epstein and Prak's book (2008) rejects Ogilvie's conclusions. Specifically, Epstein {{argues that}} guilds were cost-sharing rather than {{rent-seeking}} institutions. They located and matched masters and likely apprentices through monitored learning. Whereas {{the acquisition of}} <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> required experience-based learning, he argues that this process necessitated many years in apprenticeship.|$|E
25|$|The {{proponents of}} {{industrial}} unionism, {{on the other}} hand, generally believed that craft distinctions may have been appropriate in those industries in which craft unions had flourished, such as construction or printing, but they were unworkable in industries such as steel or auto production. In their view, dividing workers in a single plant {{into a number of}} different crafts represented by separate organizations, each with its own agenda, would weaken the workers' bargaining power and leave the majority, who had few traditional <b>craft</b> <b>skills,</b> completely unrepresented.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} plans to {{refurbish}} the cathedral pipe organ and renovations to the Choir House have already been completed, providing better facilities for choristers. Improvements are planned to {{the fabric of the}} library buildings and to the cathedral's audio-visual and lighting systems which will significantly benefit visitors including the disabled, visually impaired and hard of hearing. The appeal also aims to develop the outmoded workshop area and stained glass studio, in order to ensure the survival of Canterbury as a centre of excellence for vital <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> and to promote a sustainable maintenance base for work on the cathedral which can be viewed by the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} {{stone of}} the Technical School building was laid on 9 May 1888 by the Prince and Princess of Wales; the building was completed {{towards the end of}} 1894. It is built in the Northern Renaissance style and has a slate roof, an attic, a basement, and two intermediate storeys. Made mainly of red brick and yellow terracotta, it is profusely decorated and features ornate gables, a round arched entrance with angle turrets and balcony above, and a frieze below the top storey with panels depicting art and <b>craft</b> <b>skills.</b> The Technical School is a gradeII listed building and is now part of Blackburn College. Prince Charles- The Prince of Wales placed a time capsule into the wall of the college during his visit to Blackburn.|$|E

A number of these open to the Royal Marines Reservists are Assault Engineer, Landing <b>Craft,</b> <b>Skills</b> at Arms Instructor, Physical Training Instructor and Swimmer Canoeist. The majority of courses are abridged versions of those undertaken by regulars, courses usually last two to four weeks. Four-week courses are divided up into separate two-week packages. As reservists progress through the ranks in the RMR, they can attend further courses in their chosen specialisation that are of a more advanced nature (e.g.. LC3 - Marine; LC2 - Corporal; LC1 - Sergeant). However, many reservists are given the opportunity to attend the full courses undertaken by regulars if they are able to make the time available.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{received}} some {{success as a}} third-party candidate, Debs was largely dismissive of the electoral process; he distrusted the political bargains that Victor Berger and other [...] "Sewer Socialists" [...] had made in winning local offices.

500|$|As well {{as being}} a popular {{recreational}} space for both residents and visitors, the gardens are the venue for special events such as open-air theatre and music performances. In 1970, bands including Roxy Music, Hawkwind and Pink Fairies staged concerts, and in 2007 [...] presented a production of Romeo & Juliet. [...] During the 20th-century revival of the York Mystery Plays, performances were held on a fixed stage in the gardens among the ruins of St. Mary's Abbey. In the 1950s, York actress Dame Judi Dench acted in the plays performed in the gardens, and played the Virgin Mary in 1957. 2012 sees the York Mystery Plays return to the gardens between 2–27 August and will involve over one thousand local volunteers. Several of York's festivals use the gardens as a venue for events; in 2006, between 800 and 1,000 people celebrated the Chinese New Year with displays that included lion dancers, and in 2007 during the Jorvik Viking festival there were demonstrations of Viking <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> and battle training. The gardens are the location of York’s Saluting Station, one of only 12 in the United Kingdom, with 21-gun salutes being fired at noon to celebrate occasions related to the British Royal Family throughout the year. At these times a military band marches to the gardens before the salute is fired.|$|E

2500|$|For {{philosophers}} Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz [...] "... pseudo-science may {{be defined}} as one where the uncertainty of its inputs must be suppressed, lest they render its outputs totally indeterminate". The definition, in the book Uncertainty and quality in science for policy (p.54), alludes {{to the loss of}} <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> in handling quantitative information, and to the bad practice of achieving precision in prediction (inference) only at the expenses of ignoring uncertainty in the input which was used to formulate the prediction. This use of the term is common among practitioners of post-normal science. Understood in this way, pseudoscience can be fought using good practices to assesses uncertainty in quantitative information, such as NUSAP and - in the case of mathematical modelling - sensitivity auditing.|$|E
2500|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Samuel Gompers focused on [...] "pure and simple" [...] trade unionism. The AFL concerned itself with a [...] "philosophy of pure wage consciousness", according to Selig Perlman, who developed the [...] "business unionism" [...] theory of labor. Perlman saw craft organizing as a means of resisting the encroachment of waves of immigrants. Organization that was based upon <b>craft</b> <b>skills</b> granted control over access to the job. In a sense, craft unions provided a good defense for the privileges of membership, but the offensive power of craft unions to effect change in society at large has been circumscribed by a self-limiting vision. The AFL was businesslike and pragmatic, adopting the motto, [...] "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work." ...|$|E

Fursuits range from designs featuring simple construction and resembling sports mascots to those with more sophisticated features that include moving jaw mechanisms, animatronic parts, prosthetic makeup, and other features. Fursuits range in price from $500, for mascot-like designs, to an upwards of $10,000 for models incorporating animatronics. While about 80% of furries do not own a full fursuit, often citing their expensive cost as the decisive factor, a majority of them hold positive feelings towards fursuiters and the conventions in which they participate. Some fans may also wear [...] "partial" [...] suits consisting simply of ears and a tail, or a head, paws, and a tail.|$|E

40|$|It is time {{to reexamine}} craft and {{small-scale}} manufacture within our histories of industrialisation, both West and East, and {{to reflect on the}} long survival and adaptation of artisanal production even within our globalised world of production and consumption. Historians since the 1950 s have addressed <b>craft,</b> <b>skill</b> and labour-intensive production in historical frameworks such as ‘the rise of the factory system’, ‘proto-industrialisation’ and ‘flexible specialisation’. More recently, they have devised other concepts which include labour and skill-intensive production such as ‘industrious revolution’, ‘the great divergence’, ‘knowledge economies’, ‘East Asian development paths’ and ‘cycles of production’. This paper surveys this historiography of <b>craft</b> and <b>skill</b> in models of industrialisation. It then reflects on small-scale industrial structures in current globalisation, emphasising the continued significance of <b>craft</b> and <b>skill</b> over a long history of global transitions. It gives close examination to one region, Gujarat, and its recent industrial and global history. The paper compares industrial production for East India Company trade in the eighteenth century to the recent engagement of the artisans of the Kachchh district of Gujarat in global markets. It draws on the oral histories of seventy-five artisan families to discuss the past and future of <b>craft</b> and <b>skill</b> in the industry of the global economy. ...|$|R
