These are symbols laid down by the Geneva Convention, and all countries signatory to it agree to restrict their use to either (1) Military Ambulances or (2) the national Red Cross or Red Crescent society. Use by any other person, organization or agency is in breach of international law. The protective symbols are designed to indicate to all people (especially combatants in the case of war) that the vehicle is neutral and is not to be fired upon, hence giving protection to the medics and their casualties, although this has not always been adhered to. In Israel, Magen David Adom, the Red <b>Cross</b> <b>member</b> organization use a red Star of David, but this does not have recognition beyond Israeli borders, where they must use the Red Crystal.|$|E

Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the longerons. There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|E
40|$|A {{deployable}} geodesic {{truss structure}} {{which can be}} deployed from a stowed state to an erected state is described. The truss structure includes a series of bays, each bay having sets of battens connected by longitudinal <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> which give the bay its axial and torsional stiffness. The <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> are hinged at their mid point by a joint so that the <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> are foldable for deployment or collapsing. The bays are deployed and stabilized by actuator means connected between the mid point joints of the <b>cross</b> <b>members.</b> Hinged longerons may be provided to also connect the sets of battens and to collapse for stowing {{with the rest of}} the truss structure...|$|R

2500|$|Like {{the rest}} of Chevrolet's 1958 full size car line up, the Bel Air {{featured}} Chevrolet's new [...] "Safety-Girder" [...] cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adopted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> that bowed under the engine. [...] These [...] "x-frames" [...] were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> This design was later criticized as providing less protection {{in the event of}} a side impact collision, but would persevere until 1965.|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre, {{like the}} earlier Caudron land-planes, had no {{enclosed}} fuselage but instead {{a pair of}} parallel vertical girders, each with cross-members but only cross-braced horizontally towards the tail. On the land-planes the lower longitudinal members of the girder ran to the undercarriage; this was not practical on the float-plane so they were replaced by horizontal members running forward from the tail to beyond the wing. These extensions, braced by sloping struts on each side to both of the centre section struts formed a kind of outrigger on which the pilot sat, exposed, just forward of the leading edge. Behind the pilot and mounted on the rear pair of the centre-section struts was an un-cowled, pusher configuration [...] Anzani 6-cylinder radial engine. Long cut-outs from the trailing edges of both wings were needed to clear {{the path of the}} large diameter, two blade propeller. A rectangular tailplane was mounted on a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> between the upper girders, strengthened by outward diagonal bracing, with broad chord elevator-like surfaces extending beyond. A pair of rectangular rudders were hinged, close together, from this same cross-member.|$|E
2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Type D {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one {{from the base of the}} forward interplane strut to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear interplane strut to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical <b>cross</b> <b>member.</b> [...] Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members reduced the landing run. There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member with a pair of round-cornered rectangular rudders above it.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and flared side panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180Â°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the year}} of 1989, {{modifications}} to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management netted another [...] on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also changed in late 1989, with the exact date not known as of this writing. The changes made to the <b>cross</b> <b>member</b> and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japan models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem on the previous years. The [...] "white package" [...] was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white [...] "saw blade" [...] wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. 1989 also {{marked the end of}} headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.|$|E

50|$|In 1930 Teichfuss {{produced}} the LT.10, a strengthened but otherwise little changed {{version of the}} much imitated ZÃ¶gling. His 1940 Allievo Pavullo was a strengthened ZÃ¶gling with a plywood skinned nacelle {{in place of the}} original exposed, girder supported seat. This nacelle contained the open cockpit, placed just ahead of the wing leading edge and extended up to the wing behind the cockpit and rearwards to enclose the forward <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> of the simple girder fuselage. As on the ZÃ¶gling these <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> ran in the vertical plane between a horizontal upper beam and a lower beam which sloped upwards to the tail, though their angles were altered {{so as not to be}} normal to the top girder. Again like the ZÃ¶gling, on the wire braced Allievo Pavullo two forward <b>cross</b> <b>members</b> continued above the wing to form a triangular cabane, faired in on the Teichfuss development, to which some wires were attached. This was dispensed with on the strutted variant, which also had an extra frame strut towards the rear and normal to the lower girder.|$|R
