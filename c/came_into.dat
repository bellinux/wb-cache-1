40|$|Consider a {{specific}} type of fission where psychological continuity takes a branching form, and one of the offshoots <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being later than the other offshoot. Let us say that the earlier offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the left branch at t, and the later offshoot <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. With regard to the question how many persons are involved in this case, three answers are worth considering: (i) The original subject persists up to t; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being immediately after t and continues to exist in the left branch; and the third person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1.

(iii) The original subject continues to exist in the left branch; a distinct person <b>comes</b> <b>into</b> being in the right branch at t+ 1. For those who hold that personal identity consists in psychological continuity of some sort, the aforementioned three options exhaust the sensible ways of understanding how one persists in delayed fission. However, I argue that complications arise for each answer. Hence, delayed fission poses a challenge for the psychological approach to personal identity. close...|$|R
