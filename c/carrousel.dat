25|$|Chance <b>Carrousels</b> (deliberately spelled {{with two}} 'Rs') were {{introduced}} in 1971 following the acquisition of the Allan Herschell Company the previous year. Chance modified the Herschell design giving it a more ornate style. After Chance purchased Bradley & Kaye in December 1986, Chance {{was able to use}} the molds and manufacturing rights to 62 carousel figures produced by Bradley & Kaye owner, David Bradley. He had carefully reproduced prized carousel animals from famous carvers over the previous 20 years and new molds were cast at the Chance facility under his direction, until Bradley died in 1988. These famous reproductions with spectacular detail have been included on Chance <b>carrousels</b> since the late 1980s. With the merger of the D. H.

40|$|International audienceCarrousels are Automated Storage and Retrieval Systems {{frequently}} used in warehouses. The performance of warehouses with carousels is highly correlated {{to the order}} picking performance. The order picking {{is one of the}} main activities in warehouse management, consisting of retrieving the required products from their storage location to fulfil customers’ orders. A critical operation for the order picking efficiency is the order batching, namely how to regroup customers’ orders into batches before the collect. In this paper, we provide an optimization model for the orders batching problem, when the products are stored in one or several <b>carrousels,</b> with the objective of minimizing the total completion time. We use real data in order to test and validate our models. Numerical experiments show that our model outperforms the actual batching strategy used by the considered companies...|$|R
25|$|In 1806, in {{imitation}} of Ancient Rome, Napoléon ordered {{the construction of a}} series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the Arc de Triomphe, built {{at the edge of the}} city at the Barrière d'Étoile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller Arc de Triomphe du <b>Carrousel</b> (1806–1808), copied from the arch of Arch of Septimius Severus and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses he took from the façade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the <b>Carrousel.</b> He also commissioned the building of the Vendôme Column (1806–10), copied from the Trajan's Column in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Royale on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the Église de la Madeleine, which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into the Temple de la Gloire, a military shrine to display the statues of France’s most famous generals.|$|E

5000|$|In 1903 a Mr. H. Knapman {{formed the}} Canadian Amusement Company {{and opened up}} an Amusement park, (1903-1978), on Burlington Beach, which today is known as Hamilton Beach. It {{featured}} boats, boathouses, swings & slides, snack bars and a fun house named the [...] "Crazy House". Shortly thereafter <b>carrousels</b> and a ferris wheel were added and by the 1950s a small roller coaster and pony rides {{were included in the}} parks' inventory. Roller skaters and dancers whirled across open-air, wooden dance floor. The dance floor became the foundation for the Pier Ballroom. Sunday-evening talent contests were popular and famous artists - Ozzie Nelson, the Clooney Sisters and Duke Ellington played there. In 1978 the City of Hamilton did not renew the Canal Amusement Park lease. One by one, the rides and attractions were sold.|$|R
40|$|A {{good way}} to deliver video and {{multimedia}} services to mobile terminals is to broadcast them. But, methods to broadcast interactive applications are very crude. In current broadcasting systems, the available bandwidth for interactive applications is and will remain heavily constrained by the associated video and audio streams. To overcome these constraints, traditional techniques rely on <b>carrousels</b> to deliver the application in fragments, with some implied latency. The application starts when the base fragments have been received and the whole application is available when all the fragments have been delivered. It is crucial for broadcasters to control how an application is fragmented. Such fragmentation is in general made by hand, specifically for each application and differently for each broadcast technology. In this paper, we analyzed some typical interactive applications and derive a model, close to the application level, that can drive the broadcasting of the application independently from {{the type of application}} and from the broadcast technology. We also present a piece of software developed based on this model that validates the concepts on some applications...|$|R
40|$|Learning {{to store}} {{information}} over extended time intervals via recurrent backpropagation takes {{a very long}} time, mostly due to insucient, decaying error back ow. We brie y review Hochreiter's 1991 analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, ecient, gradient-based method called Short-Term Memory " (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete time steps by enforcing constant error ow through error <b>carrousels</b> " within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error ow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with articial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with RTRL, BPTT, Recurrent Cascade-Correlation, Elman nets, and Neural Sequence Chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, articial long time lag tasks {{that have never been}} solved by previous recurrent network algorithms. ...|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{distrust}} of the king, Paris continued to grow and prosper, reaching a population of between 400,000 and 500,000. The king named Jean-Baptiste Colbert as his new Superintendent of Buildings, and Colbert began an ambitious building programme to make Paris the successor to ancient Rome. To make his intention clear, Louis XIV organised a festival in the <b>carrousel</b> of the Tuileries in January 1661, in which he appeared, on horseback, in the costume of a Roman Emperor, followed by the nobility of Paris. Louis XIV completed the Cour carrée of the Louvre and built a majestic row of columns along its east façade (1670). Inside the Louvre, his architect Louis Le Vau and his decorator Charles Le Brun created the Gallery of Apollo, the ceiling of which featured an allegoric figure of the young king steering the chariot of the sun across the sky. He enlarged the Tuileries Palace with a new north pavilion, and had André Le Nôtre, the royal gardener, remodel the gardens of the Tuileries.|$|E

40|$|Many labs are {{currently}} using Pulsed Laser Deposition for {{rapid growth of}} a range of materials that would naturally includes metals, dielectrics, semiconductors, functional materials such as ferroelectrics or piezoelectrics, biomaterials, and more. Each PLD set-up will also have been designed around a particular interest or application area which might be the basic growth process itself, involving a range of on-line diagnostics, or the optimisation of a particular material, in terms of film quality, properties, thickness or size. However, while some labs may use multiple targets, via <b>carrousels</b> or specialist composite sector targets, one factor which is common to most facilities is that a single laser is used to ablate these targets and films are grown from a single laser plume/substrate interaction process. We have chosen to extend the basic single beam/single target geometry to a new 3 laser/ 3 target deposition set-up, and we believe this offers unique new capabilities within PLD research. Three independent laser plumes allow either a sequential or coincident deposition capability. If sequential deposition is implemented, there is the added flexibility of adjusting the temporal delay so that plume-plume interactions can be either utilised or avoided. Use of multiple plumes means that oxide films for example can now be grown from their separate constituents, and dopants can be added to a growing film in a gradual or graded manner, for applications in lasing planar waveguides. Combinatorial growth can be explored in a manner equivalent to the RGB three colour palette. Films that incorporate lateral or horizontal variation such as donut structures can be fabricated and new materials such as quaternary or penternary oxide crystals can be grown from ternary targets. Finally, multilayers, superlattices and mixed films are readily grown, by rapid shuttering of the individual plumes or incident lasers. Our work to date using multiple targets and laser beams will be described, for end applications that require low loss, single crystal films for lasing and amplifying end applications. I will describe what we now consider as routinely achievable and also our wish list for truly exotic fabrication strategies involving both horizontal and vertically integrated growth...|$|R
500|$|The {{commission}} was tardy in giving the final {{order for the}} statue to Bartlett, so late {{that it was impossible}} to have the final bronze piece ready in time; a one-third model was only completed in May. [...] According to Q.David Bowers, [...] "the French are at home in such problems." [...] The {{commission was}} able to have a full-sized plaster model ready by July 4 by sawing the scale model in pieces [...] and distributing them to various workshops, that made enlargements in plaster. Brought together, the plaster pieces fitted perfectly. [...] This assembly was ceremoniously dedicated in the Place du <b>Carrousel</b> on July 4, 1900. [...] Afterwards, Bartlett was dissatisfied with certain aspects of the design, and changed them. [...] His bronze statue erected there in 1908 differs considerably from the statue depicted on the coin. [...] Changes made included the elimination of Lafayette's three-cornered hat, and the position of the raised arm and sword. The statue stood there for almost eighty years, but was displaced in the 1980s during the excavations for I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre.

Following the Egyptian campaign of 1798–1801, Napoléon appointed the museum's first director, Dominique Vivant Denon. In tribute, {{the museum was}} renamed the [...] "Musée Napoléon" [...] in 1803, and acquisitions were made of Spanish, Austrian, Dutch, and Italian works, either as spoils or through treaties such as the Treaty of Tolentino. At the end of Napoleon's First Italian Campaign in 1797, the Treaty of Campo Formio was signed with Count Philipp von Cobenzl of the Austrian Monarchy. This treaty not only marked the completion of Napoleon's conquest of Italy, but also {{the end of the}} first phases of the French Revolutionary Wars. Under this treaty, Italian cities were required to contribute pieces of art and patrimony to take part in Napoleon's [...] "parades of booty" [...] through Paris before being put into the Louvre Museum. One of the most famous pieces taken under this program was the Horses of Saint Mark. The four antique bronze horses, which had adorned the basilica of San Marco in Venice after the sack of Constantinople in 1204, were brought to Paris to reside atop Napoleon's Arc du <b>Carrousel</b> in Paris in 1797.|$|E
