500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic planning decision affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any planning decision authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|E

50|$|Semi-detached homes {{continued}} {{to be built in}} the post-war period, often alongside detached types such as the bungalow. They remain popular with developers today because they are cheaper to build than detached houses. According to the 2006 census Toronto had more than 139,000 semis, more than any other Canadian city by a wide margin.

2500|$|The main {{entrance}} to the Yonge–University line part of the station is concealed inside a house at 85 Spadina Road, which was built in 1899 and listed as a heritage property by the City of Toronto in 1974. The building was designed by architect Robert Ogilvie for lawyer Norman Gash. The property had previously been needed for construction of the Spadina Expressway, which was cancelled in 1971. Since it was still planned to build the subway on its original route along {{the course of the}} expressway, the site was subsequently acquired by Metropolitan Toronto in 1972, with the intention of replacing it with a new station building. Local protest forced the TTC to repurpose the old building, thereby retaining the residential <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> Opposite the house, {{on the west side of}} Spadina Road at Kendal Avenue, there is an uncovered stairwell {{entrance to the}} station mezzanine. There are northbound and southbound bus stops outside the entrances.|$|E

On the south alone, it keeps rising until it not only out-tops the Castle but looks down on Arthur’s Seat. The <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> is pretty strongly marked by a scarcity of hedges; by many stone walls of varying height; by {{a fair amount of}} timber, some of it well grown, but apt to be of a bushy, northern profile and poor in foliage; by here and there a little river, Esk or Leith or Almond, busily journeying in the bottom of its glen; and from almost every point, by a peep of the sea or the hills. There is no lack of variety, and yet most of the elements are common to all parts; and the southern district is alone distinguished by considerable summits and a wide view.|$|E

It draws {{on a survey}} of 1200 face-to-face interviews in an up-market private housing estate on Hong Kong Island, a large, neither rich nor poor public housing estate in the New Territories and a mixed-use, low-income inner-city neighbourhood in Kowloon. Four indexes measure interneighbourhood and intraneighbourhood differences—namely, attraction to neighbourhood, neighbouring and psychological sense of community adapted from <b>the</b> Buckner scale <b>of</b> social cohesion, and social organisation developed by the author. There are significant differences between <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhoods.</b> However, these differences are not duplicated between occupation-defined class within <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhoods,</b> {{although there are some}} differences based on self-defined social class. The likely explanation lies in <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>neighbourhoods,</b> government policy, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> private housing management and <b>the</b> low level <b>of</b> spatial differentiation by income across the city. ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{in other}} cases, rot and mildew and dead {{citizens}} formed the uppermost scent, while, infused into it in a dreamy way {{not at all}} displeasing, was the staple <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> In the churches about Mark-lane, for example, there was a dry whiff of wheat; and I accidentally struck an airy sample of barley out of an aged hassock in one of them. From Rood-lane to Tower-street, and thereabouts, there was often a subtle flavour of wine: sometimes, of tea. One church near Mincing-lane smelt like a druggist's drawer. Behind the Monument the service had a flavour of damaged oranges, which, a little further down towards the river, tempered into herrings, and gradually toned into a cosmopolitan blast of fish. In one church, the exact counterpart {{of the church in}} the Rake's Progress where the hero is being married to the horrible old lady, there was no speciality of atmosphere, until the organ shook a perfume of hides all over us from some adjacent warehouse.|$|E
6000|$|Each {{morning after}} an early breakfast I wandered by {{myself into the}} forest, where I found {{delightful}} occupation in capturing the large and handsome butterflies, which were tolerably abundant, {{and most of them}} new to me; for I was now upon the confines of the Moluccas and New Guinea,--a region the productions of which were then among the most precious and rare in the cabinets of Europe. Here my eyes were feasted {{for the first time with}} splendid scarlet lories on the wing, as well as by the sight of that most imperial butterfly, the [...] "Priamus" [...] of collectors, or a closely allied species, but flying so high that I did not succeed in capturing a specimen. One of them was brought me in a bamboo, bored up with a lot of beetles, and of course torn to pieces. The principal drawback of the place for a collector is the want of good paths, and the dreadfully rugged character of the surface, requiring the attention to be so continually directed to securing a footing, as to make it very difficult to capture active winged things, who pass out of reach while one is glancing to see that the next step may not plunge one into a chasm or over a precipice. Another inconvenience is that there are no running streams, the rock being of so porous a nature that the surface-water everywhere penetrates its fissures; at least such is the <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> we visited, the only water being small springs trickling out close to the sea-beach.|$|E

40|$|Summary Recent {{research}} into the Swedish urban residential segregation situation has moved towards an explanatory framework which, rather than taking <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view that ethnic segregation is reducible to economic, migratory or demographic factors, takes its starting point in ethnicity itself and <b>the</b> actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish host population in particular. Within this body or work, little {{has so far been}} done to establish whether co-ethnic congregation is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving forces on the city-wide general level. This thesis aims to partially fill that gap. The method deployed uses a data extract covering the total adult population of Göteborg in 2008. This is divided into ethno-cultural groups based on country of birth as well as income groups by splitting out those residents with a purchasing power enabling a relatively free choice on the urban housing market. The ethnic composition for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city’s small scale neighbourhoods is calculated and projected as totals for these population groups using <b>the</b> segregation measure <b>of</b> exposure. <b>The</b> resulting figures show <b>the</b> ethnic <b>neighbourhood</b> compositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city on the general, systemic level based on the resident’s own ethnic belonging and economic power. This allows an analysis of residential co-ethnic congregation, as well as possible avoidance/flight dynamics between ethnic groups, by looking at <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> chosen in <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> significant economic constraints. The result strongly support that Swedish self-segregation is a considerable factor driving the ethnic residential segregation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. It reconfirms that immigrant neighbourhoods are ethnically mixed. However, the results show clear indications of residential congregation along finer ethnic lines within this pattern. It establishes that co-ethnic congregation is not alleviated by sufficient income to enable a freer choice <b>of</b> residence. <b>The</b> ethnic hierarchy reconfirmed and the flight/avoidance behaviours indicated support the recently developing framework within Swedish segregation research viewing residential segregation in light of structural racialization or more generally polarisation, with the qualification that co-ethnic congregation is an important dimension within these theory frameworks.

40|$|Debate has {{centred on}} whether <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> places plays an {{independent}} {{role in shaping}} individual smoking behaviour. At the small-area scale, particular attention has focused on whether measures of neighbourhood deprivation predict an individual's smoking status independent of their own personal characteristics. This study applies multilevel modelling techniques to data from the British Health and Lifestyle Survey and ward (local neighbourhood) level deprivation scores based on four variables from the national Census. Results suggest that after taking account of a large range of individual characteristics, both as main effects and interactions, together with complex structures of between-individual variation, measures of neighbourhood deprivation continue to have an independent effect on individual smoking status. In addition, significant between-ward differences in smoking behaviour remain which cannot be explained either by population composition or ward-level deprivation. The study suggests that <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local <b>neighbourhood</b> {{plays a role in}} shaping smoking behaviour.
