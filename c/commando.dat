5|$|From 1944 the Operational Holding <b>Commando</b> Headquarters was formed. It was {{responsible}} for two subâ€“units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding <b>Commando</b> Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops and a heavy weapons troop of fully trained commandos. The men in these troops were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the <b>Commando</b> units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as <b>Commando</b> brigades.|$|E

The modern Royal Marine Commandos, Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service and Special Boat Service trace their origins to the Commandos.

5|$|As {{part of the}} 1st Special Service Brigade, No.4 <b>Commando</b> {{took part}} in the Normandy Landings in June 1944. Landing on Sword beach 30 minutes before the rest of the brigade, their first {{objectives}} were to capture a strong point and gun battery in Ouistreham. After the commandos eliminated these positions they rejoined the brigade, reinforcing the 6th Airborne Division at the Orne bridges. Before the invasion the brigade had been informed that they would stay in France for only a few days. The <b>commando</b> remained there for a further 82 days, protecting the beachhead's left flank. During that period, No.4 <b>Commando</b> endured over 50 percent casualties. Finally withdrawn to Britain in September 1944, they were reassigned to the 4th Special Service Brigade for the assault on Walcheren island. At {{the end of the war}} No.4 <b>Commando</b> became part of the occupation force in Germany, but together with all other army <b>commando</b> units were disbanded in 1946.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 1942 a major landing {{took place}} at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was {{provided}} by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 <b>Commando</b> was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that {{was in a position to}} fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 <b>Commando</b> ran into a German coastal convoy. Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary operation No. 4 <b>Commando</b> landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) <b>Commando</b> and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 <b>Commando</b> safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 <b>Commando</b> was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 2009, the {{battalion}} was renamed the 2nd <b>Commando</b> Regiment.

5|$|On 2 November No. 47 <b>Commando</b> {{advanced}} through No. 48 <b>Commando</b> {{to attack}} a gun battery at Zouteland. The attack failed, with the unit suffering heavy casualties, including all the rifle troop commanders. The next day No. 47, supported by No. 48 <b>Commando,</b> again attacked the Zouteland gun battery. This time they managed to continue the advance and link up with No. 4 <b>Commando.</b> The capture of these batteries allowed the navy to start sweeping the channel into Antwerp for mines. On 5 November, No. 41 <b>Commando</b> captured the gun battery north east of Domburg; this left only one battery still under German control. The brigade regrouped and concentrated its assault on the last position. Just before the attack began on 9 November, the 4,000 men in the battery surrendered. This was quickly followed by the surrender {{of the rest of}} the island's garrison.|$|E
50|$|After the {{operation}} of 16 August, all <b>commandos</b> returned to India.

5000|$|In July 2012, the Afghan <b>commandos</b> {{conducted}} {{their first}} successful night operation.

This was an Afghan plan, an Afghan-led mission. Afghan pilots flew four helicopters during the exercise, which involved more than 50 Afghan <b>commandos,</b> and US special operations forces acting in an advisory capacity. In the exercise, the <b>commandos</b> successfully discovered and apprehended a person of interest, recovered weapons and intelligence." [...] In March 2013, U.S. special operations forces handed over their strategic base in Wardak Province to local Afghan <b>commandos.</b> Afghan <b>commandos</b> gradually began taking over the lead from NATO forces the fight against insurgents.

It was the largest <b>Commando</b> unit formed, and contained troops from France, Belgium, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and No. 3 (X) Troop. The No. 3 (X) Troop consisted of enemy aliens; it was also known as the English, Jewish, or British troop and was officially renamed the Miscellaneous Troop in 1944. Most of the troop had German, Austrian, or Eastern European backgrounds, while others were political or religious refugees from Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|The advance {{continued}} {{throughout the}} month and by 29 April, No. 3 <b>Commando</b> crossed the Elbe {{and carried out}} an attack on Launenberg.

By {{the end of the}} month all German opposition in the area had ceased and it marked the end of No. 3 Commando's offensive operations. On 7 May, when the Germans surrendered, No. 3 <b>Commando</b> was firmly established in LÃ¼beck, where they began the next phase of their service history as occupation troops.|$|E
5|$|A {{brief period}} of lull {{followed}} as the 1st <b>Commando</b> Brigade prepared to resume operations and on 13 February they were relieved in Linne by No. 46 Royal Marine <b>Commando</b> {{and went back to}} Maasbrecht for a rest.

50|$|Meanwhile, the Egyptian <b>commandos</b> airdropped on October 6 began encountering Israeli {{reserves}} {{the following}} morning.

According to Abraham Rabinovich, only the <b>commandos</b> near Baluza and those blocking the road to Fort Budapest had measurable successes. Of the 1,700 Egyptian <b>commandos</b> inserted behind Israeli lines during the war, 740 were killedâ€”many in downed helicoptersâ€”and 330 taken prisoner.|$|R

5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 <b>Commando</b> led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 <b>Commando,</b> now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the <b>Commando</b> Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was an attack on a factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 <b>Commando</b> had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from these}} exercises, the RLI Commandos garrisoned {{separate}} {{areas of the}} country; 1 <b>Commando</b> and the Battalion Headquarters were at Kariba, opposite the positions {{taken up by the}} Zambian Defence Force on the border. 2 <b>Commando</b> was at Chirundu, another town on the border with Zambia, and 3 <b>Commando</b> was split between Rhodesia's two Air Force bases: Salisbury's New Sarum base and Thornhill air base in Gwelo. The Battalion received its Queen's and regimental colours, approved two years earlier, from the colonial Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, on 19 June 1965. Meanwhile, negotiations between Smith and Harold Wilson's British Labour government broke down repeatedly throughout the year, leading the Rhodesian government to issue the Unilateral Declaration of Independence on 11 November 1965. Most RLI men supported Smith, the RF and UDI, and so saw this step as cause for celebration.|$|E
