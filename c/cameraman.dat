5|$|The {{director}} of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers.

The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over the <b>cameraman</b> credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as the <b>cameraman,</b> but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also could have been the <b>cameraman.</b> Smith was the first <b>cameraman</b> of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the camera, but the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H.
