2500|$|An upper <b>cabin</b> <b>deck,</b> {{called a}} texas, had been {{constructed}} on the steamer. [...] In the texas were fourteen staterooms, each with two single berths. [...] These {{were said to}} be the best staterooms on the boat, because they were away from the noise of the lower decks and well-ventilated. [...] The lower staterooms had two double berths in each. [...] Two “exquisitely furnished” “‘bridal chambers’” were located just off of the ladies cabin.|$|E

2500|$|During the boat's {{twenty-one years}} of service, the paddlesteamer was rebuilt by several new owners. A Certificate of Enrollment issued on January 21, 1890 when {{ownership}} of the steamboat was transferred to brothers Charles B. and Benjamen Wade shows a rebuild in 1889. The paddlesteamer was now [...] long, 18 feet 7inches wide, and 3 feet 5inches deep.It weighed 66.21 gross tons and was modified to have a recessed stern wheel instead of a propeller. According to a January 13, 1894 Certificate of Enrollment, the steamboat was enlarged to 81 feet 4inches length with a gross weight of [...] 69.60 tons with [...] "an enlarged <b>cabin</b> <b>deck</b> running {{the full length of}} the boat above the boiler deck" [...] and a larger captain's cabin. The Alligator's final rebuild occurred in 1906. The new reconfiguration made the boat more suitable for local freight and passenger trips rather than more lengthy transport. The cabins deck was removed and replaced with an open deck running half the length of the boat; with the pilot house and captain's cabin placed on that same level.|$|E
