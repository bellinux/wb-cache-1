40|$|After people incur {{costs to}} get future benefits, they usually track these costs in their mental {{accounts}} and are keen {{to receive the}} benefits when they become available. We introduce the notion that costs and benefits can occur either in the same <b>accounting</b> <b>period</b> (day, season, etc.) or in different periods. Our key argument is that monetary costs are tracked across <b>accounting</b> <b>periods</b> but that temporal costs are written off {{at the end of}} the period in which they are incurred. Thus, <b>accounting</b> <b>periods</b> lead to a time-money asymmetry in the tracking of costs and, consequently, in the likelihood of seeking benefits.

Our findings offer insights into the sunk-cost effect, time-money differences, and mental accounting. (c) 2010 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc [...] ...|$|R
