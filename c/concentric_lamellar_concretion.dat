Up to now, such fibers have been formed by melt extrusion or drawing from a macroscopic preformed rod and were typically limited to diameters > 10 μm with internal features > 1 μm (Abouraddy, A. F.; et al. Nat. Mater. 2007, 6, 336). We describe {{a new class of}} continuous fibers and fibrous membranes with long-range ordered <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structure that have fiber diameters and feature sizes 2 − 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those made by conventional methods. These fibers are created through confined self-assembly of block copolymers within core−shell electrospun filaments.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. The {{intervertebral}} disc {{is the largest}} avascular structure in the human body, withstanding transient loads of up to nine times body weight during rigorous physical activity.

The disc also contains an elastic fiber network which has been suggested to play a structural role, but to date {{the relationship between the}} collagen and elastic fiber networks is unclear. CONCLUSION. The multimodal transmitted and reflected polarized light microscopy technique developed here allows clear differentiation between the collagen and elastic fiber networks of the {{intervertebral disc}}.

40|$|Phylogenetic {{characters}} for Heteroderinae Luc. et al., 1988 {{are evaluated}} in Meloidodera which {{is believed to}} have primarily ancestral characters. Phasmid ultrastructure is observed in second-stage juveniles (J 2), third-stage juvenile males, fourth-stage juvenile males, and fifth-stage males of Meloidodera floridensis and M. charis. Phasmid secretion occurs inside the egg before the J 1 -J 2 molt. Before J 2 hatch, <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> membranes occur within the sheath and socket cells. Some membranes become lamellae of the sheath cell plasma membrane; others become multilamellar bodies. During early molting, plasma membrane lamellae disappear and a distal dendrite segment appears in a rudimentary canal. After the molt, the distal dendrite is not present within the canal. The phylogenetic utility of phasmid features is discussed. In both species the ampulla shape and size between molts are stable features in juveniles and males.

40|$|Fine {{structure}} of developing sperm of the monospecific genus, Ekphymatodera, was {{compared with other}} Heteroderinae {{as part of a}} study to recognize diversity and phylogenetically informative characters within the subfamily. Sperm of Ekphymatodera originate from germ cells connected to a central rachis, a character which is shared with Globodera, but not with other Heteoderinae. In Ekphymatodera, and cyst-forming genera, a layer of cortical microtubules lies just {{beneath the surface of the}} plasma membrane. Sperm of Ekphymatodera are unique among Heteroderinae examined by the presence of spiral surface elevations on the filopodia, a character that may prove to be a synapomorphy for Sarisoderini. Fibrous bodies are abundant in spermatids; however, they do not persist in sperm of Ekphymatodera as they do in Meloidodera and Verutus. The male gonad of Ekphymatodera is lined by epithelial cells, which are greatly enlarged near the ejaculatory canal. These enlarged cells contain vesicles with <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> inclusions, not observed in other genera of the subfamily.

40|$|Abstract: The drug {{discovery}} and development process is lengthy and expensive, and bringing {{a drug to}} market may take up to 18 years and may cost up to 2 billion $US. The extensive use of computer-assisted drug design techniques may considerably increase the chances of finding valuable drug candidates, thus decreasing the {{drug discovery}} time and costs. The most important computational approach is represented by structure-activity relationships that can discriminate between sets of chemicals that are active/inactive towards a certain biological receptor. An adverse effect of some cationic amphiphilic drugs is phospholipidosis that manifests as an intracellular accumulation of phospholipids and formation of <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> bodies. Here we present structure-activity relationships (SAR) computed {{with a wide variety}} of machine learning algorithms trained to identify drugs that have phospholipidosis inducing potential. All SAR models are developed with the machine learning software Weka, and include both classical algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors and decision trees, as well as recently introduced methods, such as support vector machines and artificial immune systems. The best predictions are obtained with support vector machines, followed by a perceptron artificial neural network, logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors...|$|R
40|$|When etiolated Euglena {{gracilis}} {{was treated}} with 10 mM 5 -azacytidine (5 -azaC), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, stimulation of plastidogenesis in both dark and light conditions was observed. The phenomenon occurred in 10 - 15 % of the cells possibly due to the asynchronicity of the cultures. The main features of this sub-population, as evaluated by electron and fluorescence microscopy, were the following: 1. the presence in darkness of differentiating proplastids that were red fluorescent under UV, positive to TCNBT cytochemical reaction (specific for PSII) and negative to DAB (specific for PSI); 2. the acceleration of proplastid differentiation during the first 20 - 30 h of illumination; 3. the occurrence in both culture conditions of <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> bodies (LBS). These structures {{were considered to be}} proplastids blocked in the first step of evolution, since they emitted a red fluorescence, were contained within compartments limited by a triple-layered envelope, were reactive to TCNBT in darkness and to both TCNBT and DAB in light conditions. Even if the action mechanism of 5 -azaC on plastidogenesis in Euglena remains to be defined, the induced stimulatory effect on plastid differentiation pointed to a relationship between DNA methylation and plastid development. Furthermore, the presence of LBS opens the possibility of studying early aspects of plastid development in Euglena...|$|R

We hypothesized that decellularized annular fibrosus matrix may be an appropriate scaffold for annular fibrosus tissue engineering. We aimed to determine the optimal decellularization method suitable for annular fibrosus. Annular fibrosus tissue was treated with 3 different protocols with Triton X- 100, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and trypsin. After the decellularization process, we examined cell removal and preservation of the matrix components, microstructure and mechanical function with the treatments to determine which method is more efficient. All 3 protocols achieved decellularization; however, SDS or trypsin disturbed the structure of the annular fibrosus. All protocols maintained collagen content, but glycosaminoglycan content was lost to different degrees, with the highest content with TritonX- 100 treatment. Furthermore, SDS decreased the tensile mechanical property of annular fibrosus as compared with the other 2 protocols. MTT assay revealed that the decellularized annular fibrosus was not cytotoxic. Annular fibrosus cells seeded into the scaffold showed good viability. The Triton X- 100 – treated annular fibrosus retained major {{extracellular matrix}} components after thorough cell removal and preserved the <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structure and tensile mechanical properties.

In the present study, we examined whether this accumulation could cause cell alterations in phagocytic (J 774 mouse macrophages) and nonphagocytic (rat embryo fibroblasts) cells exposed to clinically meaningful (0 - to 40 -mg/liter) concentrations of oritavancin. Optical and electronic microscopy evidenced conspicuous alterations of the vacuolar apparatus in both cell types, {{characterized by the}} deposition of <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structures, finely granular material, or other less-defined osmiophilic material, often deposed in giant vesicles. Biochemical studies showed an accumulation of phospholipids (1. 5 � control values) and free and esterified cholesterol (3 to 4 � control values for total cholesterol). Accumulation of these lipids was in close relation to that of oritavancin (excess phospholipid/oritavancin and excess cholesterol/oritavancin molar ratios of 2 to 3 and 3 to 5, respectively). Cholesterol accumulation was rapid and reversible, and that of phospholipids was slower and poorly reversible.

40|$|Mammalian bone is a {{heterogeneous}} tissue which is divisible at the microscopic level into units or regions of different appearance. The relationship of these units {{to one another}} is, in large measure, {{a reflection of the}} developmental processes by which the tissue has been formed. Primary bone is laid down either as surface bone (<b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> bone) or as primary osteones, but in many species this is not a permanent tissue. As it ages it undergoes focal resorption and, in the vascular spaces so created, secondary osteones are formed by the centripetal accretion of new bone. Subsequently these secondary osteones are themselves partially resorbed and replaced by new osteones of similar form. Once established, this process of internal resorption and replacement continues throughout life, and the extent of its effects on bone architecture is related to the life span of the species concerned. The bone which surrounds secondary osteones is often described collectively as the interstitial tissue, and its structure exhibits both species and age variations. During the period of growth, and for some time after in many bones, it consists, largely or entirely, of primary bone, either in the form of primary osteones (Figs. 1 and 2) or as surface bone (Fig. 4). However, as age advances the remnants of partially resorbed secondary osteones progressively replace the primar...|$|R

Progressive deposition of neutral glycosphingolipids that have terminal α-linked galactosyl moieties in vascular endothelial cells causes renal failure along with premature myocardial infarctions and strokes in patients with this condition. No specific treatment is available for patients with this disorder at this time. An animal model of this condition would be valuable for exploring therapeutic strategies for patients with Fabry disease. We report here the generation of α-Gal A deficient mice by gene targeting and an analysis of the resulting phenotype. The knockout mice display a complete lack of α-Gal A activity. The mice, however, appeared clinically normal at 10 weeks of age. Ultrastructural analysis revealed <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> inclusions in the kidneys, and confocal microscopy using a fluorescent-labeled lectin specific for α-d-galactosyl residues showed accumulation of substrate in the kidneys as well as in cultured fibroblasts. Lipid analysis revealed a marked accumulation of ceramidetrihexoside in the liver and the kidneys. These findings indicate the similarity of the pathophysiological process in the mutant mice and in patients with Fabry disease.

Methods and Results—Thirty-four consecutive women (mean age, 5013. 6 years) who received an ECG and echocardiographic diagnosis of HCM were submitted to an invasive cardiac study that included a biventricular endomyocardial biopsy. Tissue samples were analyzed for histology and electron microscopy. Peripheral blood activity of -galactosidase (-Gal) A was assessed in all patients. None of them had a family history of FD. Histology and electron microscopy showed in 4 patients (12 %; mean age, 51. 53. 9 years) the presence of cell vacuoles characterized by the accumulation of glycolipid material organized in <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structures, diagnostic for FD. In the remaining patients, histology was consistent with HCM. In all the female carriers, the heart was the only organ clinically involved in the disease, showing concentric hypertrophy in 2 patients, asymmetric hypertrophy in 1, and apical hypertrophy in 1. The -Gal A enzymatic activity was 4414 % of control values. Genetic analysis showed the presence of -Gal A gene mutation in all 4 cases. Conclusions—FD may account for up to 12 % of females with late-onset HCM.

In this research, we carefully examine the morphology of KCC- 1 to define more appropriate nomenclature. We also propose a formation mechanism of KCC- 1 based on our experimental evidence. Herein, the KCC- 1 morphology was interpreted mainly on the basis of compiling all observation and information taken from SEM and TEM images. Further analysis on TEM images was carried out. The gray value intensity profile was derived from TEM images {{in order to determine the}} specific pattern of this unique morphology that is found to be clearly different from that of other types of porous spherical-like morphologies.

40|$|The {{development}} of the cells in the posterior silk gland of the silkworm, Bombyx mori, during the fourth larval instar has been studied. In {{the early stages of}} this instar, the wet weight of the gland and the amounts of RNA, DNA, and protein per animal increase logarithmically until they reach a stationary state at about 72 hr. At around 96 hr of the fourth instar, the larvae enter the molting state, which lasts for about 24 hr until the fourth ecdysis. Towards the end of the molt stage, the growth of the silk gland is resumed. Electron microscopical observation shows that in the early intermolt stage the cytoplasm is filled with free ribosomes and with rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), first of the lamellar type (0 - 6 hr) and then of the vesicular or tubular type. The Golgi apparatus also is well developed. At the beginning of the molt stage (90 - 96 hr), however, most of the ER becomes <b>lamellar</b> in type, <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structures being occasionally observed, and the Golgi vacuoles disappear. Autophagosomes and lysosomes increase markedly and the apical portion of the cytoplasm becomes extensively vacuolated; this suggests that the secretory activities are completely depressed, and pronounced degenerative changes appear during the molt stage.

It is induced in humans and in animals by drugs with a cationic amphiphilic structure. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to identify a set of molecular biomarkers of PLD in rat blood and heart, hypothetically applicable in preclinical screens within the drug development process. A toxicological study was set up in rats orally treated up to 11 days with 300 mg/kg/day amiodarone (AMD). Light and transmission electronmicroscopy investigations were performed to confirm the presence of lamellar bodies indicative of phospholipid accumulation. The effects ofAMD upon the transcriptome of these tissues were estimated using DNA microarray technology. Microarray data analysis showed that a total of 545 and 8218 genes weremodulated byAMD treatment in heart and blood, respectively. Some genes implicated in the phospholipid accumulation in cells, such as phospholipase A 2, showed similar alterations of gene expression. After transcriptome criteria of analysis and target selection, including also the involvement in the onset of PLD, 7 genes (Pla 2 g 2 a, Pla 2 g 7, Gal, Il 1 b, Cebpb, Fcgr 2 b, Acer 2) were selected as candidate biomarkers of PLD in heart and blood tissues, and their potential usefulness as a sensitive screening test was screened and confirmed by quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis.

40|$|We {{have found}} that {{glucosamine}} (1 mg/ml) or tunicamycin (0. 2 – 0. 4 μg/ml), specific inhibitors of lipid carrier-dependent glycosylation of protein, when added to cultured B- 16 melanoma cells produce a marked loss of pigmentation, accompanied by distinctive, biochemical as well as ultrastructural aberrations in their melanogenic compartments. Electron microscopic analysis shows that these newly induced unpigmented cells form uniquely altered melanosomes containing little or no melanin, although their population is not substantially reduced. Within the melanogenic compartments, selective aberration of melanosomes is seen, that is, deformity, bulging, and segregation of their interior membrane, {{as well as the}} intramelanosomal formation of irregularly <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structure. No apparent structural deformity of Golgi apparatus, Golgi-associated endoplasmic reticulum of lysosome (GERL), and coated vesicles has been observed. Further, no substantial alteration is seen in mitochondria or other cellular structures. Quantitative analysis of altered and nonaltered melanosomes has revealed that the ratio of altered premelanosomes to the total number increases to 44 % in glucosamine-treated cells and to 99. 5 % in tunicamycin-treated cells, compared to 13 % in the control. Electron microscopic dopa reaction has also revealed that these altered melanosomes seem to exhibit a weakly positive or a negative dopa reaction in both glucosamine- and tunicainycin-treated melanoma cells although a number of dopa-positive altered melanosomes are still seen. However, GERL and coated vesicles show no apparent decrease in dopa reaction. It may be concluded that glycoprotein synthesis is integral to the formation of normal melanosomes and to their specific melanizing function, which could be impaired by inhibition of the synthesis of asparagin-linked mannose-containing sugar chains. This results in retrogressive changes in the premelanosomal tyrosinase during its maturation process...|$|R
40|$|While most {{forms of}} {{multicellular}} life {{have developed a}} calcium-based skeleton, a few specialized organisms complement their body plan with silica. However, of all recent animals, only sponges (phylum Porifera) are able to polymerize silica enzymatically mediated in order to generate massive siliceous skeletal elements (spicules) during a unique reaction, at ambient temperature and pressure. During this biomineralization process (i. e., biosilicification) hydrated, amorphous silica is deposited within highly specialized sponge cells, ultimately resulting in structures that {{range in size from}} micrometers to meters. Spicules lend structural stability to the sponge body, deter predators, and transmit light similar to optic fibers. This peculiar phenomenon has been comprehensively studied in recent years and in several approaches, the molecular background was explored to create tools that might be employed for novel bioinspired biotechnological and biomedical applications. Thus, it was discovered that spiculogenesis is mediated by the enzyme silicatein and starts intracellularly. The resulting silica nanoparticles fuse and subsequently form <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> layers around a central protein filament, consisting of silicatein and the scaffold protein silintaphin- 1. Once the growing spicule is extruded into the extracellular space, it obtains final size and shape. Again, this process is mediated by silicatein and silintaphin- 1, in combination with other molecules such as galectin and collagen. The molecular toolbox generated so far allows the fabrication of novel micro- and nanostructured composites, contributing to the economical and sustainable synthesis of biomaterials with unique characteristics. In this context, first bioinspired approaches implement recombinant silicatein and silintaphin- 1 for applications in the field of biomedicine (biosilica-mediated regeneration of tooth and bone defects) or micro-optics (in vitro synthesis of light waveguides) with promising results...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of the kidney of the Swiss albino mouse changes progressively during the first 2 weeks after birth. Cells proliferate to form new nephrons, cells differentiate by acquiring specialized membranous components, and certain cytological features which are present at birth diminish in abundance or disappear. The differentiation of {{the cells of the}} cortical tubules has been studied using the light and electron microscopes. The tubules are partially and variably differentiated at birth. During the first 2 weeks after birth the brush border develops in the proximal tubules by the accumulation of numerous microvilli on the apical cell margins. Basal striations develop in proximal and distal tubules as an alignment of mitochondria, the result of what appears to be progressive interlocking of adjacent fluted cells. The mitochondria increase in number and size, accumulate homogeneous matrix, and acquire small, very dense granules. The collecting ducts develop tight pleating of the basal cell membranes, and dark cells containing numerous small cytoplasmic vesicles and microvilli appear. At birth there are dense irregular cytoplasmic inclusions presumed to be lipide in renal cells, the cytoplasmic granules of Palade are abundant, and there are large round bodies in the cells of the proximal tubules. The lipide inclusions disappear a few days after birth, and the cytoplasmic granules of Palade diminish in abundance as the cells differentiate. The large round bodies in the proximal tubules consist of an amorphous material and contain concentrically lamellar structures and mitochondria. They resemble the cytoplasmic droplets produced in the proximal tubules of adult rats and mice by the administration of proteins. The large round bodies disappear from the proximal tubules of infant mice during the first week after birth, but the <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> structures may be found in adult mice...|$|R

Recently, H. Sawada et al. (2005, Toxicol. Sci. 83, 282 – 292) identified 17 genes as potential biomarkers of PLD in HepG 2 cells. The present study was undertaken to determine if this set of genes measured by quantitative PCR could be validated in the same cell line. The objective was also to investigate the dose-response relationship to further validate the assay and to select the concentrations to use for screening activities. In a first experiment (one concentration tested), out of the 17 genes, the best gene biomarkers of PLD (i. e., 11 genes) were selected for practical screening reasons. Based on these genes, 91. 6 % (i. e., 11 of 12) of the compounds known to induce PLD were identified as positive and all the negative compounds (i. e., five of five) were also confirmed. When the data obtained in the first experiment were compared to the data by Sawada et al., (2005) the coefficient of correlation calculated was slightly higher than 75 %. In the second experiment (26 com-pounds [all 17 compounds from the first experiment plus 9 other compounds] tested at {{a minimum of three}} concentrations), 93. 3 % (14 / 15) of the compounds known to induce PLD were identified as such and all the negative controls (six compounds) were also confirmed. Three compounds likely to induce PLD were identified as positive in our assay. Finally, two compounds for which no data are available were also tested. When both experiments 1 and 2 were compared, the coefficient of correlation for 16 compounds tested at the same concentrations reached 87. 7 %. In conclusion, the present study further confirms the utility of gene expression in HepG 2 cells to identify a potential to induce PLD. Finally, based on the data presented, researchers are encouraged to use a range of minimum three concentrations (e. g., 12. 5, 25, and 50 mM) to screen for PLD in the human HepG 2 cell line...|$|R
40|$|Case report: A {{previously}} healthy 13 {{year old}} girl developed acute hemianopsia and anomia 5 days after {{an episode of}} fever and malaise of unknown origin. Cerebral MRI revealed three white matter lesions, one with ring-like contrast enhancement. Lumbar puncture showed mononuclear pleocytosis of 30 cells/µl, oligoclonal IgG, and a normal protein level. Follow up cerebral MRI scans revealed <b>lamellar</b> <b>concentric</b> hemispheric lesions characteristic of BCS. The first neurological symptoms of the patient coincided with primary HHV- 6 CNS infection, diagnosed by a positive PCR test of the CSF together with seroconversion. Response to antiviral and corticosteroid treatment was only temporary, but immunoglobulin treatment {{has so far been}} followed by clinical stability for 30 months...|$|R
40|$|The {{vascular}} {{anatomy of}} the cortical bone and the canal system are highly correlated, and the former has an important bearing on shape and microscopic lamellar structure, as it is established in the progression of the remodelling process. The classical description of a longitudinal system of canals (Havers') connected by the transversal Volkmann's canals is the generally acknowledged model of the structural organization of the cortex. However, it is remarkably difficult to study the circulation inside the compact bone in detail owing to its hard, calcified matrix, and the methods thus far applied have represented either the bone morphology and {{the architecture of the}} canal system or the injected vessel network. In the present study, the intracortical vessel network was injected with black China ink and evidenced by transillumination of full-thickness, decalcified hemicortices. By making use of the depth of field of the microscope objective, the three-dimensional architecture of the network was highlighted and the morphometry of vessel size measurements and a classification of the network nodes according to the number of arms was made possible. These observations were integrated with data obtained by routine histology on decalcified sections relevant to the connections of the intracortical canal system with the outer environment, with regard to the direction of advancement of new canals and with regard to the mode of formation of the system nodes. The formation of the intracortical vessels network involved two processes: the incorporation of the periosteal network and osteonal remodelling, the latter occurring through the advancement of cutting cones followed by their own vascular loop and by <b>concentric</b> <b>lamellar</b> apposition. The two systems could be distinguished by the diameter of the vessels (the former were significantly larger) and by the network architecture (the former convoluted, and the latter longitudinally orientated and straight). Longitudinal vessels could form branches or create connections with the periosteal derived vessels that occasionally meet on the line of their advancement. They were observed entering from either inside the cortex from the metaphyses or from the endosteal surface of the marrow cavity. The combined observations from different methods of study documented a model of intracortical canal and vessel networks formed by two initially independent systems: one derived from the external, periosteal vessels, and one from metaphyseal and marrow vessels. Connections between the two were established with the advancing of cutting cones from the extremities of the diaphysis. Analysis of the system architecture and the modalities of its progressive organization suggested that the direction of advancement of a forming canal does not necessarily correspond to the final blood flow direction of its central vessel...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of complexes made from DNA and suitable lipids (lipoplex, Lx) was examined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM). We observed a distinct concentric ring-like pattern with striated shells when using plasmid DNA. These spherical multilamellar particles have a mean diameter of 254 nm with repetitive spacing of 7. 5 nm with striation of 5. 3 nm width. Small angle x-ray scattering revealed repetitive ordering of 6. 9 nm, suggesting a lamellar structure containing at least 12 layers. This <b>concentric</b> and <b>lamellar</b> structure with different packing regimes also was observed by cryoEM when using linear double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and oligodeoxynucleotides. DNA chains could be visualized in DNA/lipid complexes. Such specific supramolecular organization {{is the result}} of thermodynamic forces, which cause compaction to occur through concentric winding of DNA in a liquid crystalline phase. CryoEM examination of T 4 phage DNA packed either in T 4 capsides or in lipidic particles showed similar patterns. Small angle x-ray scattering suggested an hexagonal phase in Lx-T 4 DNA. Our results indicate that both lamellar and hexagonal phases may coexist in the same Lx preparation or particle and that transition between both phases may depend on equilibrium influenced by type and length of the DNA used...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Dysplastic nevus is {{described}} as {{an important factor in}} increasing the risk of melanoma. Many authors suggested dysplastic nevi should be graded according to architectural and cytological features. Dermal fibroplasia can be in <b>concentric</b> or <b>lamellar</b> fashion. In our study we aim to grade architectural and cytological atypia in dysplastic nevi and to assess the relationship between atypia and dermal fibroplasia. Material and Method: Ninety-three biopsies obtained from 71 patients were included in the study group. Hematoxylin-eosin stained slides were evaluated and graded according to architectural and cytological features. A total score was obtained for both architectural and cytological atypia in each case. Masson Trichrome stained sections were used to assess dermal fibroplasia and evaluated semiquantitatively. Results: Twenty-eight (30. 1 %) cases had mild, 48 (51. 6 %) cases moderate, and 17 (18. 3 %) cases had severe atypia regarding architectural features. Nine (9. 7 %) cases were scored having mild, 28 (30. 1 %) cases moderate, and 56 (60. 2 %) cases having severe atypia regarding cytologic features. There was a significant correlation between the degree of architectural and cytologic atypia. Six (21. 4 %) cases with mild, 31 (64. 6 %) cases with moderate,, and 12 cases (70. 6 %) with severe architectural atypia had dermal fibroplasia. One case (11. 1 %) with mild, 10 cases (% 35. 7) with moderate, and 10 cases (67. 9 %) with severe cytological atypia had dermal fibroplasia. A significant relationship was found between the presence of fibroplasia and the degree of cytological and architectural atypia. Conclusion: A statistically significant relationship was revealed between the increase of architectural and cytological atypia and dermal fibroplasia. Detection and evaluation of stromal changes by histochemical methods, and scoring of atypia in dysplastic nevi may be helpful to distinguish dysplastic from other banal nevi...|$|R
