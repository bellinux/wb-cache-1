5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 the <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> {{producer}} Peter Rogers assembled the cast for the 15th film of the series, <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Doctor. Rogers initially chose Joan Sims {{to play the role}} of the hospital matron but she declined the part, stating that Jacques's performance of the role in <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Nurse could not be bettered. As such, Rogers cast Jacques as Matron, with Sims accepting a smaller role as the timid assistant of the film's lead character Francis Bigger, played by Frankie Howerd. Jacques's screen time was increased from <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Nurse, as the producers considered her part to be an extension of the earlier role. <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Doctor was released in December of that year, to much success.|$|E

5|$|Two further <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> films {{followed}} for Jacques in 1972: <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Matron, {{for which she}} was engaged in the title role, and <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Abroad, as Floella, the fiery Spanish cook at a half-finished hotel. As well as the film being Charles Hawtrey's last, it also marked a reduction in Jacques's screen time; she spent only one week filming her scenes. During post-production, the film's insurers became concerned about Jacques's deteriorating health. In {{a letter to the}} series producer Peter Rogers, they expressed their reluctance to insure her on set in any future film.|$|E

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> his work after his death.

5|$|As {{the first}} film in the series, {{a number of the}} {{elements}} of Dr. No were contributors to subsequent films, including Monty Norman's Bond theme and Maurice Binder's gun barrel sequence, variants of which all appeared in subsequent films. These conventions were also lampooned in spoof films, such as the Austin Powers series. The first spoof films happened relatively soon after Dr. No, with the 1964 film <b>Carry</b> <b>On</b> Spying showing the villain Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included Charlie Bind (Charles Hawtrey) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor).|$|E

5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave.

On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to <b>carry</b> <b>on</b> with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
