He worshipped his little friend with {{something}} of the same superstition, but {{without any of the}} caprice, that he bestowed upon his porcelain Pagan god. It was his delight to walk behind her to school, carrying her books--a service always fraught with danger to him from the little hands of his Caucasian Christian brothers. He made her the most marvellous toys; he would cut out of <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> <b>turnips</b> the most astonishing roses and tulips; he made life-like chickens out of melon-seeds; he constructed fans and kites, and was singularly proficient in the making of dolls' paper dresses. On the other hand, she played and sang to him, taught him a thousand little prettinesses and refinements only known to girls, gave him a yellow ribbon for his pig-tail, as best suiting his complexion, read to him, showed him wherein he was original and valuable, took him to Sunday school with her, against the precedents of the school, and, small-woman-like, triumphed. I wish I could add here, that she effected his conversion, and made him give up his porcelain idol. But I am telling a true story; and this little girl was quite content to fill him with her own Christian goodness, without letting him know that he was changed. So they got along very well together,--this little Christian girl with her shining cross hanging around her plump, white little neck; and this dark little Pagan, with his hideous porcelain god hidden away in his blouse.|$|E
6000|$|Monday, August 15th.--George Hillard and {{his wife}} arrived from Boston in the dusk of Saturday evening, to spend Sunday with us. It was a {{pleasant}} sensation, when the coach rumbled up our avenue, and wheeled round at the door; for I felt that I {{was regarded as a}} man with a household, a man having a tangible existence and locality in the world,--when friends came to avail themselves of our hospitality. It was a sort of acknowledgment and reception of us into the corps of married people,--a sanction by no means essential to our peace and well-being, but yet agreeable enough to receive. So we welcomed them cordially at the door, and ushered them into our parlor, and soon into the supper-room. [...] . The night flitted over us all, and passed away, and up rose a gray and sullen morning, [...] . and we had a splendid breakfast of flapjacks, or slapjacks, and whortleberries, which I gathered on a neighboring hill, and perch, bream, and pout, which I hooked out of the river the evening before. About nine o'clock, Hillard and I set out for a walk to Walden Pond, calling by the way at Mr. Emerson's, to obtain his guidance or directions, and he accompanied us in his own illustrious person. We turned aside a little from our way, to visit Mr. ------, a yeoman, of whose homely and self-acquired wisdom Mr. Emerson has a very high opinion. We found him walking in his fields, a short and stalwart and sturdy personage of middle age, with a face of shrewd and kind expression, and manners of natural courtesy. He had a very free flow of talk; for, with a little induction from Mr. Emerson, he began to discourse {{about the state of the}} nation, agriculture, and business in general, uttering thoughts that had come to him at the plough, and which had a sort of flavor of the fresh earth about them. His views were sensible and characteristic, and had grown in the soil where we found them; [...] . and he is certainly a man of intellectual and moral substance, a sturdy fact, a reality, something to be felt and touched, whose ideas seem to be dug out of his mind as he digs potatoes, beets, <b>carrots,</b> <b>and</b> <b>turnips</b> out of the ground.|$|E

In this manner, they cover several kilometers a day while foraging. They feed on the tubers of sedges, plant roots, earthworms, insects and other invertebrates, frogs and other small vertebrates.

This document was accompanied by another containing theSrdar's decision, by which the Sawan or Zirkunnee Nullah, was settled to be the boundary between Daraban and Kolachi, and the Nullah called Kowruh between Daraban and Choudwan. The authenticity of both documents was acknowledged on both sodes; but arise as to the indenty of Kowruh Nullah alluded to.There is a little rivulet about two hundred yards to the south of Moosazai which is called Kowruh to the day, and this the Babhurs maintained to be the boundary of Jahan khan's decision.There is another and larger one, about two koss to the south of Moosazai, which is called Turkhoba and this the Miankhails declared to be the ancient Kowruh.Mr. Elphinstone found the Babhurs, forty years ago, [...] "a civilized tribe, much addicted to merchandise, and, on the whole the richest and most flourishing of the tribes of Daman".There bravery has been sufficiently established by their blood.

40|$|Environmental impact {{originating}} from food production {{is of great}} concern since it is related to every single customer in the world. Food is cultivated, transported, stored and processed in different ways, and every step in the life cycle {{has an impact on}} the environment whereas the nutritional value of food is altered in many of the steps. Waste of food is also an important aspect. A majority of the food waste in households and large-scale catering establishments is related to vegetables and it may be assumed that fresh vegetables have a higher waste than frozen at consumer stage. Further on, whether fresh or frozen vegetables provide consumers with most nutrients for every g of CO 2 -equivalent (eq) generated during production of the vegetables may be a concern. This study aimed to answer whether there is any difference in nutritional value of fresh and frozen coarse vegetables and if the production of these has different global warming potential. The vegetables investigated were <b>carrots</b> <b>and</b> <b>turnips.</b> Nutritional content was measured by nutrient index score, NRF 9. 3 (Nutrient Rich Food). Global warming potential was investigated by Life Cycle Assessment. Cultivation, storage, processing, packaging and transportation were investigated; from harvest to processing plant, wholesaler and restaurants and large-scale catering establishments, including storage losses and preparation waste. The results show that frozen root products has a lower nutritional content than fresh before cooking but after cooking the difference in nutritional content between fresh and frozen is decreased due to increased solubility and extractability of nutrients, and disrupted cell membranes. Fresh carrots provide consumers with the highest nutritional value for every g CO 2 -equivalent generated during production of these products, followed by (in descending order) frozen carrots, fresh turnips and frozen turnips, independent of cooked or uncooked state. Thus, from an environmental and nutritional perspective (bioavailability disregarded)) fresh carrots are the best choice of the products examined in current study. Complementary research on vegetables that are more easily spoiled during time of storage is needed in order to investigate whether fresh or frozen vegetables in general are the best choice from an environmental and nutritional perspective...|$|E
