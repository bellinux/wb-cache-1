Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted on 40 Surti goats out of which 20 goats who had undergone recent parturition acted as treatment group and 20 non-pregnant animals comprised control group. Blood samples were collected from the treatment group on 0, 7, 14, 21, 30, and 45 days post kidding and once from the control group. Blood samples were analyzed for hematological parameters such as hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count, and biochemical metabolites such as total protein (TP), albumin, globulin, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA), glucose, and urea. Results: Hb level was the highest on the 45 th day and lowest on the day of parturition. Significantly low level of Hb, PCV, and lymphocyte was found on 0 day and significantly high level was found on the 45 th day. TEC was also low on the 0 day and high on the 45 th day post kidding, but the difference was non-significant. Mid-sized cells and granulocyte percentage decreased significantly from 0 to 45 th day post-partum. TP, albumin, and urea were found to be lowest on 0 day and highest on 45 th day post-partum. Urea concentration increased parallel to TP indicating an increase in urea production with <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein.</b> The globulin concentration also increased from 0 to 45 th day post-partum, but the difference was non-significant. TC, TG, and NEFA were the highest on 0 day and lowest on the 45 th day post-partum. Decrease in TC and TG from 0 to 45 th day post-partum indicates that the animals utilized the lipids for the supply of energy for milk production. High level of NEFA acts as an indicator of negative energy status but in the present study, the high glucose level on 0 day indicates that the animals were in positive energy status. The glucose concentration decreased up to 14 th day post-partum and then started increasing from 21 st day onward. Conclusion: Hematobiochemical parameters are indicative of health status of animals. Significantly low values of Hb, PCV, and TLC during first 2 weeks post-partum are indicative of stress. <b>Catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> occurred during 2 weeks post-partum, as observed from increase in urea concentration.

The bird had been captured in South Africa a few months before the experiment, and the start of its voluntary fast may have mimicked the natural mass decrease during northward migration. After 14 days of fasting, when the bird had reached a mass of 129 g, it started making numerous flights through the cage as if wanting to escape. Since this is the mass level at which the fat stores of Knots approach depletion and since there is evidence that the focal bird was beginning to catabolize its protein reserves, the restlessness of the experimental Knot strongly parallels the behaviour and physiology of Aptenodytes-penguins (and, incidentally, the behaviour of Oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus).

40|$|The {{molecular}} defect {{responsible for}} a dramatic prolongation of all standard clotting tests discovered in a 15 -yr-old boy has been identified. Initial investigations revealed {{the presence of an}} activated Factor X (Factor Xa) and thrombin inhibitor which copurified with alpha 1 -antitrypsin (alpha 1 -AT), thereby suggesting the occurrence of an alpha 1 -AT variant similar to alpha 1 -AT Pittsburgh. This was confirmed by dot-blot analysis and direct sequencing after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. A G to T transition at nucleotide 10038 results in the substitution of Met to an Arg, converting alpha 1 -AT into an Arg-Ser protease inhibitor (serpin) that inhibited thrombin and Factor Xa more effectively than antithrombin III. Surprisingly, there was no bleeding history in the proband. The common mutation Z, which may explain a reduced expression of the allele bearing the Arg 358 Met mutation, was not observed in the propositus' DNA.

Recently, the patient experienced his first hemorrhagic episode at the age of 17. The level of the abnormal inhibitor had increased twofold 2 mo before. The large decrease in protein C concentration may account for the mild bleeding tendency in this case, despite the presence of the alpha 1 -AT Pittsburgh mutation.

Ninety male broiler chicks (Cobb) were obtained at 1 -day old and raised in an environmentally controlled room. Food and water was provided ad libitum. At day 7, the chicks were provided with the experimental diets: Control diet (CON: 20 % CP; 9. 1 % L; 39. 6 % CHO), Low lipid diet (LowL: 22 % CP; 3. 36 % L; 59. 7 % CHO), and low carbohydrate diet (LowCHO: 22 % CP; 8. 09 % L; 46. 7 % CHO). T e chickens fed the CON manifested the best growth rate feed conversion compared to both other groups. The CO chickens showed the highest plasma T- 3 Concentrations at 14 days of age as compared to both LowL and LowCHO chickens. At 35 days of age however, LowL chickens were characterized by the highest plasma T- 3 levels. Overall, CON birds had the highest plasma T- 4 levels (P < 0. 0001) compared to LowL and LowCHO chickens. Plasma corticosterone levels were not affected by diet composition. Glucose levels increased {{towards the end of the}} experimental period, but there was no overall effect of diet composition on plasma glucose levels. Chickens fed the CON diet were consistently characterized by the highest plasma uric acid levels compared to LowL and LowCHO chickens. Irrespectively of diet, plasma triglyceride levels were high at 14 days of age, then decreased and finally increased again during the last week. This latter increase was most pronounced for the CON chickens and is congruous with their high fat deposition. At 28 days of age, a significant effect of diet was observed, as CON birds had lower plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels compared to LowL but not to LowCHO chickens. However there was no overall effect of diet composition on plasma FFA levels. Creatine kinase (CK) activities increased significantly with age and were consistently higher in CON chickens. In conclusion, fast growth in broiler chickens is positively correlated with <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> from dietary or endogenous origin and (muscle) cell membrane disruption as reflected in high plasma uric acid levels and CK activity, respectively.

40|$|For {{the polar}} bear (Ursus maritimus), a {{terrestrial}} carnivore on the highest trophic level in the Arctic marine ecosystem, periods of nutritional restriction or fasting are a characteristic feature of an annual cycle. The overall objective of my thesis was to examine some {{of the effects of}} such a 'feast-or-fast' feeding pattern on the body composition, body size and reproductive performance of this Holarctic ursid. As a reproductive strategy, pregnant polar bears occupy maternity dens for up to 6 months between late summer and spring. While in dens, maternal nutrient stores meet all maintenance energy requirements and sustain the nutritional demands of gestation and early lactation. I quantified the nutritional costs of this prolonged 'reproductive fast' in polar bears and examined the effects of variation in maternal body condition on reproductive performance. While fasting, body mass decreased by 43 % and of the change in body energy content 93 % was attributable to loss of fat. Bears that were fatter priorto denning produced heavier cubs, which {{would be more likely to}} survive. Much of the variation in body condition prior to denning was accounted for by age, older females being in better condition. Using an index of milk quality that was closely related to daily milk energy yield, I investigated the independent effects of maternal body condition and age on lactation. Irrespective of condition, older bears tended to produce higher quality milk. While lactation in polar bears is clearly sensitive to body condition, these results also provide strong support for an age-specific increase in reproductive effort among females. Body size is typically a strong determinant of male reproductive success in polygynous mammals such as polar bears. Consequently, theory predicts that mothers in good condition should invest more in male than female offspring in-order to produce large adult males. An underlying assumption of this theory, however, is that early differences in body size among male offspring, such as those apparent by the end of maternal care, will affect their relative adult body size. I tested the validity of this assumption in polar bears and found that, in comparison to females, variation in body size among 2 -year-old males was a weak determinant of adult size. I suggest that, in comparison to females, a longer period of growth after maternal care may predispose the adult size of males to a greater degree of environmentally mediated variation. This lack of persistence in relative body size would limit the ability of mothers to affect the adult size of their male offspring, and thus reduce the effectiveness of sex-biased maternal investment as a reproductive strategy in polar bears. One of the principle physiological adaptations enabling animals to go without food for prolonged periods seems to be a heightened ability to minimize the net catabolism of body protein. I quantified changes in the body composition of free-ranging polar bears during the ice-free season. In contrast to previous studies on fasting bears, <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> appeared to meet a significant proportion of maintenance energy demands in some individuals.

40|$|Piglets {{are born}} with limited energy reserves, agammaglobulinemic and with an {{immature}} gastro-intestinal tract. Colostrum is the sole external nutrient resource for piglets after birth, provides the piglets with maternal immunity and also contains several factors that stimulate {{the development of the}} gastro-intestinal tract and other organs (chapter 1). Colostrum thus has important functions and insufficient CI is a major cause of pre-weaning mortality and reduced daily weight gain (chapter 3. 4.), both causing major economic losses in modern sow herds. Approximately 30 % of sows do not produce sufficient colostrum for their litter (chapter 3. 1.) and the CY is independent of litter size (chapter 3. 4.). Consequently, insufficient CY in sows is a major problem and becomes even more pronounced in high-prolific sows. Research on CY in sows is scarce and mainly focused on the hormonal regulation (chapter 1). Very limited information is available on how the sow’s use of energy and protein derived from the feed or body reserves affects CY. The general aim of this thesis was to investigate the use of energy and protein from feed or body reserves during gestation in relation to CY in sows. In a first study (chapter 3. 1.), we identified 2 periods in late gestation during which the use of body energy reserves was correlated with CY. The BF change between d 85 and 108 of gestation was negatively correlated with CY (r = - 0. 346, P = 0. 032) whereas the BF change the week prior to farrowing was positively correlated with CY (r = 0. 391, P = 0. 017). In this study, we also collected sow serum samples 3 - 4 days before farrowing and at d 1 of lactation and blood analyses confirmed that the use of body energy and protein reserves just prior to farrowing was negatively correlated with CY. This study also showed that there was no correlation between CY and colostrum composition, which is interesting as this suggests that improving CY should not be at cost of the colostrum composition. Causal relationships between CY and the change of body reserves could not be established with this study design. Therefore, the 2 identified periods of interest were further investigated. In the second study (chapter 3. 2.), we focused on the positive correlation between CY and the BF change 1 week before farrowing. Sows were randomly divided into 2 treatment groups at d 108 of gestation. The first group (L, n = 28) received 1. 5 kg feed per day, the second group (H, n = 22) received 3 times 1. 5 kg feed per day until farrowing. Based on BF at d 108, sows were divided into 3 BC groups: skinny (23 mm, n = 14). The H-group tended to have a greater total CY (P = 0. 074) and had a greater CY per kg liveborn piglet (P = 0. 018) than the L-group. Compared to sows in moderate BC, fat sows had a lower total CY (P = 0. 044), and a lower CY per kg liveborn piglet (P = 0. 005). The H-group had a greater concentration of lactose (P = 0. 009) and n- 3 PUFA (P 0. 10) which is indicative for more functional mammary tissue; 3) piglets’ daily weight gain was correlated with BF change between d 85 and 108 of gestation up to d 3 of lactation (r = - 0. 359, P = 0. 019) which is right before the start of lactational mammogenesis. Although BF change between d 85 and 108 of gestation and daily feed allowance between d 85 and 108 of gestation affected the glucose and insulin metabolism, CY was not correlated with the changes in insulin (r = 0. 025, P = 0. 876) and glucose (r = - 0. 149, P = 0. 359) between d 85 and 108 of gestation which makes this hypothesis less evident. Improving mammogenesis in sows thus seems promising as a long term strategy to increase CY in sows. In the fourth study (chapter 3. 4.) we investigated the effects of CI on piglet performance (survival and daily weight gain) during lactation. All piglets born to 37 PIC sows were observed until weaning and 4 piglets per litter were randomly selected for serum collection 24 - 30 h after birth. The daily weight gain was positively correlated with BWB and CI/kg BWB, and negatively with time between birth and first suckle until d 3 of lactation (R² = 0. 39, P 60 min (P < 0. 01). The CI/kg BWB was negatively correlated with urea (P = 0. 002), positively to some free AA (P < 0. 05) but not to creatinine, NEFA, IgG and IgA in piglets’ serum. The daily weight gain was negatively correlated with urea and positively to leucine until d 3 of lactation (R² = 0. 19, P < 0. 001), until d 7 of lactation (R² = 0. 13, P < 0. 001) and until weaning (R² = 0. 08, P < 0. 001). A lower CI/kg BWB was accompanied by a higher <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> that did not seem to originate from the piglets’ body reserves. It seems that piglets with a lower CI/kg BWB use a larger proportion of colostral protein as a substrate for energy production rather than for other purposes such as lean growth, as there was a negative correlation between parameters indicating protein catabolism and daily weight gain at least until weaning. Sufficient CI is thus essential for piglet performance at least until weaning. This underlines the importance of improving CY in sows and distribution of the available CY within a litter. In conclusion, this thesis showed that CY in sows and CI in piglets are highly variable and also insufficient for a considerable number of the animals. The results also documented the importance of sufficient CI for piglet’s performance during the entire lactation period. Next to elucidating the importance of insufficient CY and intake, the thesis also showed that the use of body reserves during late gestation is correlated with CY. A negative energy balance the week prior to farrowing should be avoided. A high peripartal feeding strategy the week prior to farrowing resulted in decreased negative energy balance, less imbalance at the entry of the citric acid cycle and a higher CY. The use of body energy reserves between d 85 and 108 of gestation was negatively correlated with CY and several indications were presented showing that this correlation might be due to better gestational mammogenesis. The thesis provided opportunities for both short-term and long-term strategies to improve CY in sows...|$|E

40|$|Erythrocyte ghosts {{loaded with}} 125 I-labeled {{proteins}} were fused with confluent monolayers of IMR- 90 fibroblasts using polyethylene glycol. Erythrocyte-mediated microinjection of 125 I-proteins did not seriously perturb the metabolism {{of the recipient}} fibroblasts as assessed by measurements <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis, rates <b>of</b> <b>protein</b> degradation, or rates of cellular growth after addition of fresh serum. A mixture <b>of</b> cytosolic <b>proteins</b> was degraded after microinjection according to expected characteristics established for <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> endogenous cytosolic <b>proteins.</b> Furthermore, withdrawal <b>of</b> serum, insulin, fibroblast growth factor, and dexamethasone from the culture medium increased the degradative rates <b>of</b> microinjected cytosolic <b>proteins,</b> and <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> long-lived <b>proteins</b> was preferentially enhanced {{with little or no}} effect on degradation <b>of</b> short-lived <b>proteins.</b> Six specific polypeptides were degraded after microinjection with markedly different half-lives ranging from 20 to 320 h. Degradative rates <b>of</b> certain purified <b>proteins</b> (but not others) were also increased in the absence of serum, insulin, fibroblast growth factor, and dexamethasone. The results suggest that erythrocyte- mediated microinjection is a valid approach for analysis <b>of</b> intracellular <b>protein</b> degradation. However, one potential limitation is that some microinjected proteins are structurally altered by the procedures required for labeling proteins to high specific radioactivities. Of the four purified proteins examined in this regard, only ribonuclease A consistently showed unaltered enzymatic activity and unaltered susceptibility to proteolytic attack in vitro after iodination...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{asymmetric}} dimethylarginine (ADMA) correlate with {{risk factors for}} cardiovascular disease. ADMA is generated by the <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> methylated on arginine residues by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), and is degraded by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). Reports have shown that DDAH activity is down regulated and PRMT 1 protein expression is upregulated under oxidative stress conditions, leading many to conclude that ADMA accumulation occurs via increased synthesis by PRMTs and decreased degradation. However, we now report that the methyltransferase activity of PRMT 1, the major PRMT isoform in humans, is impaired under oxidative conditions. Oxidized PRMT 1 displays decreased activity, which can be rescued by reduction. This oxidation event involves one or more cysteine residues that become oxidized to sulfenic acid (-SOH). We demonstrate a hydrogen peroxide concentration-dependent inhibition of PRMT 1 activity that is readily reversed under physiological H 2 O 2 concentrations. Our results challenge the unilateral view that increased PRMT 1 expression necessarily results in increased ADMA synthesis, but rather demonstrate that enzymatic activity can be regulated in a redox-sensitive manner...|$|R

The products of these processes are amino acids (mainly alanine), free fatty acids, and lactic acid. Free fatty acids from triglycerides are converted to ketones, and to acetyl-CoA.

40|$|ABSTRACT (249 words) Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an {{endogenous}} inhibitor of {{nitric oxide}} synthesis. ADMA {{is generated by}} <b>catabolism</b> <b>of</b> <b>proteins</b> containing methylated arginine residues and its levels are correlated with endothelial dysfunction in systemic cardiovascular diseases. Arginine methylation <b>of</b> cellular <b>proteins</b> is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT). The expression and localization of PRMT in the lung has not been addressed. Here, we sought to analyze the expression of PRMT isoforms in the lung, and determine whether PRMT expression is altered during exposure to chronic hypoxia (10 % oxygen). Adult mice were exposed to hypoxia {{for up to three}} weeks, lung tissues harvested, and processed for reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and determination of tissue ADMA levels. All PRMT isoforms investigated were detected at the mRNA and protein level in mouse lung, and were localized primarily to the bronchial and alveolar epithelium. In lungs of mice subjected to chronic hypoxia, PRMT 2 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated, whereas the expression of all other PRMT isoforms remained unchanged. This was mainly due to increased expression of PRMT 2 in alveolar type II cells, which did not express detectable level...|$|R
