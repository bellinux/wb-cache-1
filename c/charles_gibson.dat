25|$|On May 29, 2006, ABC named <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson</b> as sole {{anchor of}} ABC World News Tonight. Two months later, ABC renamed the program World News with <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson.</b> In February 2007, the program {{achieved}} {{the number one}} spot in the Nielsen ratings for nightly news broadcasts, overtaking NBC Nightly News. This was ABC's first victory since the week Peter Jennings died in August 2005, {{and the first time}} since 1996. NBC Nightly News subsequently reclaimed the lead and currently maintains a steady lead over the other programs. On September 2, 2009, ABC announced that Mr. Gibson would retire from broadcasting at the end of 2009, and then be succeeded by Diane Sawyer.|$|E

25|$|The {{last big}} {{event in the}} final week of the {{campaign}} was the April 16 debate on ABC-TV.

25|$|CBS heavily {{promoted}} Couric's {{arrival at}} the network, hoping to revive the evening news format, but there were suggestions that it backfired. Although there was much interest during her first week as anchor, CBS Evening News remained a distant third in viewership, behind ABC World News and NBC Nightly News. While Couric's ratings improved over her predecessor, Bob Schieffer, ABC's <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson</b> widened World News' lead over Evening News.|$|E
25|$|Good Morning America {{has been}} the most watched morning show in total viewers and key demos each year since Summer 2012. GMA {{generally}} placed second in the ratings, behind NBC's Today from 1995 to 2012. It overtook its rival for a period from the early to mid-1980s with anchors David Hartman and Joan Lunden, from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s with <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson</b> and Lunden, and in April 2012 with Roberts and Stephanopoulos.|$|E

25|$|To improve Good Morning Americas ratings performance, which briefly fell {{to third}} {{place among the}} morning shows in January 1999, ABC News {{management}} selected Shelley Ross {{from the field of}} executive producer candidates. As part of Rossʼs proposed changes, Ross ousted the McRee-Newman team and lobbied to bring in Diane Sawyer and team her with <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson,</b> who had been reluctant to return. On January 18, 1999, the Gibson-Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on-air, which during the first full season resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network news franchises saw losses.|$|E
25|$|After Hartman's departure, Lunden was {{paired with}} ABC News {{correspondent}} <b>Charles</b> <b>Gibson</b> on February 23, 1987, which ultimately resulted in {{ratings for the}} program skyrocketing. The team of Lunden and Gibson became the most popular news partnership on television in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{and for the first}} time Good Morning America regularly won the ratings against Today. At one point prior to Spencer Christian's arrival in 1986, forecasts on the program were provided by WXYZ-TV chief meteorologist Jerry Hodak via a split screen between the WXYZ studios in Detroit and the Good Morning America set in New York City.|$|E

Couric, Gibson and Williams made appearances together on all three major network morning shows, first on CBS's Early Show, then on NBC's Today and finally on ABC's Good Morning America.|$|E
