5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much longer the war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E

They were initially <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the player loses all their items if they die during a rescue mission, but realized {{that it had to be}} that way to avoid people abusing rescue missions to get new items. Due to programming changes between the Japanese and the English versions of the game, rescue quests from the North American and European versions are only compatible with each other, and not with the Japanese release.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he would respond, but Ellis {{decided to do it}} regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of the}} first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
5|$|The 26-year-old FitzRoy had {{hopes of}} {{commanding}} a second expedition {{to continue the}} South American survey, but when he heard that the Lords of the Admiralty no longer supported this, he grew <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to return the Fuegians who had been taught English {{with the idea that}} they could become missionaries. He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy heard that he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted. On 27 June 1831 FitzRoy was commissioned as commander of the voyage, and Lieutenants John Clements Wickham and Bartholomew James Sulivan were appointed.|$|E
5|$|Written in 1866, Augusta Jane Evans {{domestic}} novel St. Elmo {{became one}} of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. Its popularity would spur the creation of popular consumer products, parodies and even the names of several towns. Evans was <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the novel's themes would be portrayed on the stage and did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909. It is also unknown if Evans was aware of any intention to adapt the novel for the screen. Lloyd Lonergan adapted the play for the Thanhouser Company. The Book News Monthly said that Lonergan received a share of interest in the company for his good work in producing the scenario. Lonergan already had a single share of 100 total shares of the company from the initial $10,000 in capital in 1909.|$|E

5|$|The IIHF {{assigned}} Norway's Hans Rønning as {{the referee}} for this game. The assignment was made {{based on his}} neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of Rønning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, René Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about Rønning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials {{were not on the}} ice when the melee occurred; however, Rønning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the game would be played. Rønning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams.|$|E
5|$|Lexie {{continues}} to harbor romantic feelings for George, {{oblivious to the}} fact that he doesn't see her in the same way. Their relationship is a mirror foil of George's previous infatuation with the oblivious Meredith. She prioritizes helping George study over taking part in a surgery with Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), but feels betrayed when George doesn't request that she become one of his interns after passing his exam. Finally realizing that he doesn't feel the same way, Lexie gives up on her feelings for George and the pair's friendship begins to fizzle out. She later begins a flirtation with Mark, and the pair begin an unlikely romantic relationship, though they are forced to keep it a secret when Meredith and Derek warn Mark away from Lexie. Lexie discovers that some of her fellow interns have secretly been performing simple procedures on each other and begins taking part to prove she's hardcore. Sadie Harris (Melissa George) joins the society, and seeking a more daring procedure, suggests removing her appendix. Though Lexie agrees, she quickly finds herself out of her depth, resulting in Meredith and Cristina having to intervene to save Sadie's life. Lexie and the other interns are put on probation. Derek finds Lexie distraught at the day's events, and allows her to move into the attic at his and Meredith's house. Mark comes clean to Derek about his relationship with Lexie, resulting in the two men getting into a fist fight. The pair continue to feud, resulting in Lexie beginning to stress eat until they eventually reconcile. Lexie is delighted when Meredith asks her to be a bridesmaid at her and Derek's wedding, though they eventually give the ceremony to Alex and cancer-stricken Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Mark decides to purchase a house and invites Lexie to move in with him, however she declines, <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> fast their relationship is progressing.|$|E

25|$|Spelling and Goldberg {{decided to}} add actor David Doyle to the cast as John Bosley, an {{employee}} of Charlie, who would frequently aid the 'Angels' in their assignments.

ABC executives brought in David Ogden Stiers as Scott Woodville, who would act as the chief back-up to the Angels and Bosley's superior; he would also be depicted as the organizer of the plan, in similar fashion to Jim Phelps in , a series for which Goff and Roberts had written. Woodville also was the only regular known to meet Charlie face to face.|$|E

Personnel from the cruiser were <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> their colleagues had been treated, and during the afternoon, about 100 sailors assembled in Quay Street, Auckland, and decided to not return to duty.

Another 40 sailors mustering at Philomel before boarding Bellona were recruited into the mutiny: these men attempted to recruit more from Bellona, but the actions of the cruiser's officers prevented any additional sailors from joining them. The party then marched off the base, despite orders to halt from the Master-at-Arms stationed at the gatehouse, then dispersed.|$|E

25|$|However, Castle's unique {{idea for}} the game {{somewhat}} side-stepped the potential legal problems. He didn't want to adapt the film; {{he wanted to make}} an original game set within the film's milieu. This would mean the game would not have to borrow as heavily from the film as it would were it a straight adaptation, hence avoiding the potential legal problems down the road. Virgin loved Castle's idea, and asked him to make a pitch to Bud Yorkin. Castle built a demo for the pitch, but rather than using footage from the film, he and his team created a rough opening cutscene based on the film's aesthetic style, but without recreating any exact scenes. According to Castle, going into the pitch, Yorkin was <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much footage from the film would be needed for the game, but when he saw the demo, he was thrilled, and asked Castle if the whole game could be made in a similar manner. From that point forward, the development team had one overriding mandate; every scene in the game would be generated from scratch in 3D; no footage from the film would be used.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{believe that}} cotton farming was {{introduced}} into the United States by immigrants. While it was recorded in Florida in 1556 and in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, {{it is believed that}} cotton has been planted and cultured in the United States since 1621. Plantation owners brought mass supplies of labor (slaves) from Africa and the Caribbean and Mexico to farm the fields during cotton harvests. Black women and children were also employed in the industry. Cotton farming became a major issue of racial conflict {{in the history of the}} United States, particularly during the 19th-century. Prior to the U.S Civil War, cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850. After, Southern black cotton farmers faced discrimination from the North, and many white Democrats were <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> many of them were being employed in the U.S. cotton industry and the dramatic growth of black landowners. They urged white farmers in the South to take control of the industry, which from time to time resulted in strikes by black cotton pickers; for instance blacks led by the Colored Farmer's Association (CFA) strikers from Memphis organized a strike in Lee County, Arkansas in 1891, which resulted in much violence. Black cotton farmers were very important to entrepreneurs which emerged during industrialization in the United States, particularly Henry Ford.|$|E
