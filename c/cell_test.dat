2500|$|The modern period, {{beginning}} in 1920, saw major developments in {{research into the}} cause and treatment of discoid and systemic lupus. [...] Research conducted in the 1920s and 1930s led to the first detailed pathologic descriptions of lupus and demonstrated how the disease affected the kidney, heart, and lung tissue. [...] A major breakthrough was made in 1948 {{with the discovery of}} the LE cell (the lupus erythematosus cell—a misnomer, as it occurs with other diseases as well). [...] Discovered by a team of researchers at the Mayo Clinic, they discovered that the white blood cells contained the nucleus of another cell that was pushing against the white's cell proper nucleus. [...] Noting that the invading nucleus was coated with antibody that allowed it to be ingested by a phagocytic or scavenger cell, they named the antibody that causes one cell to ingest another the LE factor and the two nuclei cell result in the LE cell. The LE cell, it was determined, was a part of an anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) reaction; the body produces antibodies against its own tissue. This discovery led to one of the first definitive tests for lupus since LE cells are found in approximately 60% of all people diagnosed with lupus.

Kalkitoxin was originally isolated from Lyngbya majuscula {{as an effort to}} collect new molecules for testing as antitumor or antifungal agents. One of the first tests of kalkitoxin tumor-selective cytotoxicity used an in-vitro assay to test solid tumor selectivity of kalkitoxin's previously demonstrated cytotoxicity against the human colon cell line HCT-116. The assay measured the extent of differential cytotoxicity of kalkitoxin and various analogous structures by observing differential cytotoxicity against solid tumor cells, and either non-solid tumor cells such as leukemia cells or normal cells.

40|$|This {{workshop}} {{reviewed the}} current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches {{on the use}} of germ <b>cell</b> genotoxicity <b>tests.</b> The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, {{it is not necessary to}} conduct germ <b>cell</b> <b>tests,</b> notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for germ <b>cell</b> mutagenicity <b>testing.</b> For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further <b>testing.</b> Nevertheless, germ <b>cell</b> mutagenicity <b>testing</b> would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic <b>cell</b> genotoxicity <b>tests.</b> Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.

40|$|The single <b>cell</b> <b>test</b> system {{development}} for the SRNL sulfur dioxide-depolarized electrolyzer has been completed. Operating experience and improved operating procedures were developed during test operations in FY 06 and {{the first quarter of}} FY 07. Eight different cell configurations, using various MEA designs, have been tested. The single <b>cell</b> <b>test</b> electrolyzer has been modified to overcome difficulties experienced during testing, including modifications to the inlet connection to eliminate minute acid leaks that caused short circuits. The test facility was modified by adding a water bath for cell heating, thus permitting operation over a wider range of flowrates and cell temperatures. Modifications were also identified to permit continuous water flushing of the cathode to remove sulfur, thus extending operating time between required shutdowns. This is also expected to permit a means of independently measuring the rate of sulfur formation, and the corresponding SO{sub 2 } flux through the membrane.

40|$|A Workshop {{sponsored}} by EURL ECVAM {{was held in}} Ispra, Italy in 2013 {{to address the question}} of whether the in vitro mammalian <b>cell</b> genotoxicity <b>test</b> results could complement and mitigate the implications of a positive Ames test response for the prediction of in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, and if patterns of results could be identified. Databases of Ames-positive chemicals that were tested for in vivo genotoxicity and/or carcinogenicity were collected from different sources and analysed individually (Kirkland et al., xxxx, this issue). Because there were overlaps and inconsistent test results among chemicals in the different databases, a combined database which eliminated the overlaps and evaluated the inconsistencies would be preferable for addressing the above question. A database of > 700 Ames-positive chemicals also tested in vivo was compiled, and the results in in vitro mammalian <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> were analysed. Because the database was limited to Ames-positive chemicals, the majority (> 85 %) of carcinogens and in vivo genotoxins were positive when tested in both in vitro gene mutation and genotoxicity/clastogenicity tests. However, about half (> 45 %) of chemicals that were not carcinogenic or genotoxic in vivo also gave the same patterns of mammalian cell results. Although the different frequencies were statistically significant, positive results in 2 in vitro mammalian <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> did not, per se, add to the predictivity of the positive Ames test. By contrast, negative results in both in vitro mammalian <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> were rare for Ames-positive carcinogens and in vivo genotoxins but, were significantly more frequent for Ames-positive chemicals that are not carcinogenic or genotoxic in vivo. Thus, in the case of an Ames-positive chemical, negative results in 2 in vitro mammalian <b>cell</b> <b>tests</b> covering both mutation and clastogenicity/aneugenicity endpoints should be considered as indicative of absence of in vivo genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.
