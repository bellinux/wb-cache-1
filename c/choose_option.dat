So, agent A, if placed in circumstance C, would freely <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> X over option Y. Thus, if God wanted to accomplish X, all God would do is, using his middle knowledge, actualize {{the world in which}} A was placed in C, and A would freely choose X. God retains an element of providence without nullifying A's choice and God's purpose (the actualization of X) is fulfilled.|$|E

Participants in the Safer Choice/Vaccinated group {{were also more likely to}} <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B, although the odds ratio for this group at 1.89 was lower than the Safer Choice/Enhance group. The fact that participants who received the “unsubstantiated” food safety label (Safer Choice/Enhance) without the words “vaccines” or “E. coli” were more likely to choose this version, compared to those who were exposed to the more informative labeling versions, suggests the importance of the nature of information on food labels in influencing consumer choice.|$|E

40|$|Freedom {{of choice}} is often defended with {{reference}} to its positive influence on the satisfaction of preferences. The more choice options there are, the greater the level of utility one derives from choosing one of the options. Moreover, {{it is assumed that}} the satisfaction of preferences will not decrease if the size of the choice set increases, in particular in parametric situations. This paper opposes this conclusion by showing that <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a from a one-element choice set {a} may not be identical with <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a from a two-element choice set {a,b}. The character and the consequences of <b>choosing</b> <b>option</b> a may change considerably with the addition of another option b. Therefore, the level of utility derived from option a changes as well, possibly even in a negative way. Hence, an increase in freedom of choice may diminish one's preference satisfaction, also in parametric situations...|$|R
30|$|Participants {{who wanted}} beef {{products}} from vaccinated cattle labeled as such were 1.40 {{times more likely}} to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B and had a 56 % increase in their odds of choosing neither of the two options, relative to option A. It can thus be inferred that consumers in the latter group might prefer having the vaccine intervention indicated on a beef label to avoid it, likely the result of their concerns about the intervention. This result is similar to findings by Lusk and Fox (2002) who found a strong demand to mandatorily label beef products treated with hormones. Another interesting finding is that participants who wanted vaccines against E. coli to be mandatorily adopted had a 45 % increase in their odds of choosing option B, relative to option A. This finding combined with the preference for labeling beef with the vaccine intervention among participants who chose option B or neither of the two options highlights the fact that consumers can have competing motivations when they demand food labeling. As argued by Messer et al. (2017), food process labels can lessen asymmetric information between producers and consumers. Thus, while food labels make it easier for consumers to purchase their preferred product, there are also consumer segments whose clamor for a label is to have a signal to avoid the product altogether (Liaukonyte et al. 2015). Regarding demographics, male and income were the two variables that emerged significant at the 5 % level. Males were more likely to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B, and household income did not increase the odds of choosing option B over option A.|$|E

In positive externality situations Δui is increasing in si, and there exists a threshold social signal value s*, possibly with s* < 0 or s* > bi, such that a utility maximizing agent will <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> 0 if si < s* and option 1 if si ≥ s*.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how firms hedge, what instruments firms use {{and whether there}} are systematic differences between firms adopting different risk management strategies. I find {{that the decision to}} use non-linear hedging strategies (options strategies) is mostly a function of market conditions {{and to a lesser extent}} due to the non-linearity of the exposure. Consistent with Stulz (1996), larger firms are more likely to incorporate a market view in their risk management programs and use asymmetric hedging strategies (buy or sell options). Financially less constrained firms are more likely to buy options, while financially more constrained firms are more likely to sell options. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that financial constraints affect firms’ discount factors, and hence their hedging decisions. Finally, if market volatility is high firms are less likely to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> strategies. This is consistent with the fact that option strategies expose a firm to volatility risk, which may be undesirable...|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{there were}} 112 {{respondents}} who chose option A, representing 25.17 % of the sample. Of this number, 65 participants {{were willing to}} purchase option B if they were offered a discount. The small number of these observations, however, did not allow for a very meaningful empirical analysis for this group. A table summarizing discount bids among participants is displayed in section C of the Appendix. Also included in the Appendix (section D) is a selection of comments from respondents explaining why they did not <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> B. It {{is important to note}} that approximately a quarter of respondents choosing the ground beef with the standard label also underscores the challenge in labeling food safety attributes. Among these participants, the majority indicated a willingness to purchase the ground beef with a food safety label at a discount if that was their only choice. Reasons given by respondents who were completely opposed to ground beef with a food safety label, and would not purchase it even at a discount, echoed their aversion for vaccinations for a variety of reasons. In general, the remarks given by these respondents revealed doubts about the food safety labels and insufficient knowledge of vaccines. This suggests the possibility of some consumers misinterpreting the information on the labels (Messer et al. 2017).|$|E
30|$|Example A 1.2 : {{information}} externalities. Suppose {{the utility}} to agent i of each option {{is independent of}} the number of other agents choosing that option but there exists uncertainty regarding this utility. To be concrete, assume that agent i’s utility depends on the “state of world” w ∈ {w 0, w 1 }, so that ui = ui(oi,w), and there exists uncertainty regarding w. In this case, agent i may observe others’ decisions in order to infer w and then choose the option which maximizes his utility for this world state (as when a tourist chooses a crowded restaurant over an empty one in an unfamiliar city). Consider, for instance, the decision of whether to adopt an innovation of uncertain quality, and let the world state w 1 signify that innovation quality is such that adopting maximizes utility. In this situation it is reasonable for agent i to maximize expected utility and choose the option (adopt or not) oi* = argmaxo∈O Σw∈W P(w | si) ui(oi,w). If agent i uses Bayesian inference to estimate P(w 1 | si) then we have a positive externality decision process and there exists a threshold value s* for the social signal such that agent i will <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> 0 if si < s* and option 1 if si ≥ s* [17].|$|E
40|$|If {{decision}} makers assign stable fitness-related values to options, {{preference for the}} most valuable of simultaneously encountered options should be independent of background context (i. e., prior options). The tendency to <b>choose</b> <b>option</b> x versus y should be unaffected by whether the decision maker has already been given a choice between x � and y � or between x � and y�. Here, food-hoarding gray jays (Perisoreus canadensis) were given an initial choice between x � (one raisin, 0. 5 m into a tube) and y� (three raisins, 0. 5 m) or between x � and y � (both identical to x�). All subjects were then given a choice between x � (one raisin, 0. 3 m) and y � (three raisins, 0. 7 m). In violation {{of the principle of}} irrelevant alternatives, the ‘‘market share’ ’ of x depended on prior options. Subjects initially exposed to context {x�, y�} showed a stronger preference for x than did subjects initially exposed to {x�, y�}, which implies that the jays did not assign a fixed value to each option. Subjects that initially could obtain a large reward (y�) for about the same ‘‘price’ ’ (perceived danger) as a small reward (x�) apparently devalued the large reward (y) in the subsequent choice. This effect may be the joint byproduct of cognitive constraints and an adaptive tendency to us...|$|E
