40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} regularized approximate <b>cloaking</b> for the Helmholtz equation. Various <b>cloaking</b> schemes {{have been}} recently proposed and extensively investigated. The existing <b>cloaking</b> schemes in literature are (optimally) within |lnρ|− 1 in 2 D and ρ in 3 D {{of the perfect}} <b>cloaking,</b> where ρ denotes the regularization parameter. In this work, we develop a <b>cloaking</b> scheme with a well-designed lossy layer right outside the <b>cloaked</b> region that can produce significantly enhanced near-cloaking performance. In fact, it is proved that the proposed <b>cloaking</b> scheme could (optimally) achieve ρN in RN, N⩾ 2, within the perfect <b>cloaking.</b> It is also shown that the proposed lossy layer is a finite realization of a sound-hard layer. We work with general geometry and arbitrary <b>cloaked</b> contents of the proposed <b>cloaking</b> device...|$|R

We derive some completely novel characterizations of the finite energy solutions corresponding to the singular <b>cloaking</b> problems. Particularly, some `hidden' boundary conditions on the <b>cloaking</b> interface are shown for the first time.

40|$|<b>Cloaking</b> {{techniques}} conceal objects {{by controlling}} {{the flow of}} electromagnetic waves to minimize scattering. Herein, the effectiveness of homogenized anisotropic materials in non-resonant dielectric multilayer <b>cloaking</b> is studied. Because existing multilayer <b>cloaking</b> by isotropic materials {{can be regarded as}} homogenous anisotropic <b>cloaking</b> from a macroscopic view, anisotropic materials can be efficiently designed through optimization of their physical properties. Anisotropic properties can be realized in two-phase composites if the physical properties of the material are within appropriate bounds. The optimized anisotropic physical properties are identified by a numerical optimization technique based on a full-wave simulation using the finite element method. The <b>cloaking</b> performance measured by the total scattering width is improved by about 2. 8 % and 25 % in eight- and three-layer cylindrical <b>cloaking</b> materials, respectively, compared with multilayer <b>cloaking</b> by isotropic materials. In all <b>cloaking</b> examples, the optimized microstructures of the two-phase composites are identified as the simple lamination of two materials, which maximizes the anisotropy. The same performance as published for eight-layer <b>cloaking</b> by isotropic materials is achieved by three-layer <b>cloaking</b> using the anisotropic material. <b>Cloaking</b> with an approximately 50 % reduction of total scattering width is achieved even in an octagonal object. Since the <b>cloaking</b> effect can be realized using just a few layers of the laminated anisotropic dielectric composite, this may have an advantage in the mass production of <b>cloaking</b> devices.

40|$|We {{consider}} approximate <b>cloaking</b> from a regularization viewpoint {{introduced in}} [13] for EIT and further investigated in [12] [17] for the Helmholtz equation.

In this paper, we show that by employing a sound-hard layer right outside the <b>cloaked</b> region, one could (optimally) achieve ρ^N in R^N, N≥ 2, which significantly enhances the near-cloak. We then develop a <b>cloaking</b> scheme by making use of a lossy layer with well-chosen parameters. The lossy-layer <b>cloaking</b> scheme is shown to possess the same <b>cloaking</b> performance as the one with a sound-hard layer. Moreover, it is shown that the lossy layer could {{be taken as a}} finite realization of the sound-hard layer.

40|$|Transformation optics constructions {{have allowed}} the design of <b>cloaking</b> devices that steer electromagnetic, {{acoustic}} and quantum waves around a region without penetrating it, so that this region is hidden from external observations. The proposed material parameters are anisotropic, and singular at the interface between the <b>cloaked</b> region and the <b>cloaking</b> device. The presence of these singularities causes various mathematical problems and physical effects on the interface surface. In this paper, we analyze the 3 -dimensional <b>cloaking</b> for Maxwell's equations when there are sources or sinks present inside the <b>cloaked</b> region.

40|$|<b>Cloaking</b> {{has long}} been {{exploited}} by spammers {{for the purpose of}} increasing the exposure of their websites. In other words, <b>cloaking</b> has long served as a major malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). <b>Cloaking</b> hides the true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users versus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of employing <b>cloaking</b> in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting <b>cloaking</b> is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP <b>cloaking</b> and are not suitable for detecting <b>cloaking</b> in SEM because their search-and-visit method leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring <b>cloaking</b> on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help them avoid frauds. Our work focuses on mitigating IP <b>cloaking</b> and SEM <b>cloaking,</b> and providing client-based real-time <b>cloaking</b> detection services. To achieve these goals, we first propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation of websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and implement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving system, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on demand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from the server and compares them with user views to detect <b>cloaking.</b> Since Cloaker Catcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP <b>cloaking</b> can be detected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using our system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM <b>cloaking</b> and found that the main purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services...|$|R
