50|$|Water coolers for desktop {{computers}} were, {{until the end}} of the 1990s, homemade. They were made from car radiators (or more commonly, a <b>car's</b> <b>heater</b> core), aquarium pumps and home-made water blocks, laboratory-grade PVC and silicone tubing and various reservoirs (homemade using plastic bottles, or constructed using cylindrical acrylic or sheets of acrylic, usually clear) and or a T-Line. More recently a growing number of companies are manufacturing water-cooling components compact enough to fit inside a computer case. This, and the trend to CPUs of higher power dissipation, has greatly increased the popularity of water cooling, although only a very small minority of computers are water-cooled.|$|R

5000|$|Similar to the 1930 {{formation}} of Ohio's Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban, {{a number of}} struggling Indiana interurban lines were combined to create the new Indiana Railroad. In 1931, the IRR ordered interurbans from the Pullman and American Car and Foundry based upon the Cincinnati Car Company Red Devil design but with improvements. More aluminum was used, and a heavier Commonwealth truck design was adopted to allow more stability at speed. The IRR operated multiple car coupled trains from Indianapolis south to Louisville, so the new IRR lightweights had couplers and a rounded rear end, unlike the Red Devil's squared rear end. The round end allowed coupled car operation around tight curves in town streets. IRR abandoned operations in 1941, and LVT purchased IRR parlor car #55 to replace former Red Devil car 1004 lost in a fire due to 1004's malfunctioning electric <b>car</b> <b>heater</b> at Philadelphia and Western's King Manor station. (The fire also burned the station.) Car 55 arrived on the LVT property in IRR's bright [...] "traction orange" [...] paint scheme and LVT's Fairview shopmen humorously labeled it the [...] "Golden Calf." [...] The shop crew changed the former parlor seating to coach seating and repainted the exterior with LVT's white with red trim (called by the LVT a dramatic [...] "Picador Cream and Mountain Ash Scarlet") and numbered it LVT 1030. It stood out from its former C&LE Red Devil brothers by having more tapered front windows and the round rear end. LVT also replaced the IR Commonwealth trucks with the Cincinnati Car Company's ABC-74D trucks (bogies) salvaged from the 1004. They retained the interior club arrangement, but installed a refrigerator at the first left side window. Transit company officials introduced No.1030 to the public on September 14, 1941 and on October 3, 1941, the luxury car entered the revenue service on the Liberty Bell Route. Passenger traffic increased steadily during World War II and more passenger capacity was needed, so December 1941 and May 1942, several side-facing individual chairs were removed and replaced by forward and rearward facing sofas {{in order to increase}} the seating capacity from thirty to thirty-six. The original IR car design placed the motorman's controls on the left side, but the controller and brake stand were moved to the center by the LVT and a passenger loading door was added at the left front to provide southbound passenger access to the left side Norristown platform. This door was also used at Lansdale and Souderton on northbound trips to allow passengers to unload curbside rather than into the street. Although the frequent stops and occasional steep grades (the climb from Souderton's Broad Street to Summit street was severe) were more demanding on traction motors than Ohio's had been, the former Red Devils and the 1030 performed well until LVT abandonment in 1951. As company earnings severely declined due to post World War 2 diminishing ridership, seriously disabled cars were often set aside, not repaired, and cannibalized for parts for other equipment. Car 1030 is now preserved and operating at the Seashore Trolley Museum.|$|E
40|$|Current-fed {{resonant}} converters {{have been}} widely used in large induction heating systems due to their low power losses and low EMI (Electromagnetic Interference). However, because of the bulky magnetic components and complicated control circuits employed, conventional current-fed inverters can hardly satisfy low power heating applications where the cost and size are of major concerns. This paper proposes a novel low cost push-pull current-fed inverter that is suitable for a portable <b>car</b> <b>heater</b> or other similar applications. The inverter integrates the dc inductor and the splitting transformer used in a conventional push-push inverter into one magnetic component using two drum cores wound with two identical windings. Furthermore, it does not require any additional controllers, thus the cost, weight, and physical size of the inverter are significantly reduced, making it ideal for portable <b>car</b> <b>heater</b> applications. The operation of the proposed inverter has been analysed in detail, and both simulation and practical experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed inverter works very well in generating the high frequency current required for an induction <b>car</b> <b>heater</b> or other low power heating devices...|$|E

The study at hand is proposed {{to provide a}} new method and to introduce procedure {{to the design of}} wiring pattern for a <b>car</b> seat <b>heater</b> for Kongsberg Automotive, KA. KA is a Norwegian company and a global provider of engineering, design, and manufacture for seat comfort, driver and motion control systems, fluid assemblies, and industrial driver interface products. The method that currently is used in the company to create a wiring pattern is neither sufficient enough nor automated.

Secondly, <b>car</b> seat <b>heater</b> 2 D layout is imported and then, the dimensions of the elements are defined as constraints. Then VBA codes are opened and the program is run. The result will be a wiring pattern in different 2 D layouts. To make the design process easier, we have modeled five different layouts; wiring pattern of one element, two elements, three elements, five elements (with two back sides) and one element trapezoidal 2 D layout. The algorithm written in VBA (Visual basic for application) creates the pattern according to the dimensions of the elements which are used as inputs to define constrained parameters. The created macros are simple to use and easy to modify, independent from the programming knowledge. The user is only responsible with parameter input and running the program.

The Heffleys car is towed to a mechanic's shop for repairs. Greg is surprised to see that a water park that he was thinking about going to is very close to them, but many misfortunes happen, and the family thought that their valuables were stolen by the Beardos Greg encountered at the hotel. The Heffleys call the police, but to no avail. Fortunately, their car keys were at the mechanic's and they go to the mechanic's to retrieve their car, but with their money presumed stolen, they cannot pay for the repairs. As a result, the mechanic uses sealant to temporarily fix the radiator. The drawback is that the <b>car's</b> <b>heater</b> has to run at full blast to prevent engine overheating.|$|R

40|$|A 30 -year-old Bedouin {{woman who}} lives in a hut {{presented}} with skin changes in the anterior portion of both shins. The lesions were mildly itchy. The skin changes had developed gradually over some years and were significantly worse during winter periods. History revealed repeated sitting in front of an open fire in the hut used for warmth in winter. Physical examination (Figure 1) showed nonblanching brown lichenified hyperpigmentation in a reticular pattern on both anterior shins and ankles. Based on the findings a diagnosis of Erythema ab igne (EAI) was established. Diagnosis of EAI is based on clinical history and physical examination. 1 The EAI is caused by repeated exposure to heat at a lower level than that which causes a thermal burn (infrared radiation). Historically, this condition was seen in people, who sat closely to open fires. The EAI is a rare condi-tion because of the advent of central heating. Its incidence has been rising as heating sources are being used to treat chronic pain. Currently, it is more commonly seen after repeated use of heating pads, laptops occupational exposure, and <b>car</b> <b>heaters.</b> 2 Chronic lichenified lesions of EAI have potential for malig-nant transformation. A skin biopsy performed revealed no evidence of malignancy. Erythema ab igne may be considered an infectious disease mimic.
