5|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly {{to regain control}} of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino front, and the 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E
5|$|Halo.bungie.org {{has used}} its notability to conduct several fundraisers for various causes, {{including}} raising money for Hurricane Katrina disaster relief. The site's members {{took part in a}} massive effort by the Halo community to raise money, primarily through selling collectible items through eBay auctions. These auctions raised just under $11,000 for the relief effort. Members of the community also <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> through personal means; one member held a charity Xbox live night and raised $139. In 2003, following news that community member Brian Morden's cancer had returned, the community decided to set up a donation fund to support him. Although Brian died later that year, the fund became the Brian Morden Memorial Fund.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{took only}} one wicket {{in the next}} two matches, which Australia won. In the seventh and final match, Kartik took a career best of 6/27 from 10 overs at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to bowl Australia out for 193. The {{tourists}} had reached 2/117 after 19.4 overs, scoring at over six runs and over before Kartik removed Brad Hodge and Andrew Symonds from consecutive balls. He failed to get his hat-trick, but in the 32nd over he removed Brad Haddin from the first ball, and then Brad Hogg and Brett Lee from the fourth and fifth balls. Again Kartik missed the hat-trick opportunity, but returned to claim his six wicket. In reply, India had fallen to 8/143 before Kartik <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> with an unbeaten 21 from 34 balls in an unbroken 52-run stand with Zaheer Khan, guiding India to a two-wicket victory. Kartik was recognised by being selected as the man of the match. Kartik then made his T20 international debut, taking 0/27 from four overs in an Indian win over Australia.|$|E

25|$|Chasing, New Zealand lost Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle for sub-20 scores (Astle facing 15 balls {{but only}} scoring two runs), before their third-wicket pairing, {{who had played}} a {{combined}} total of one ODI before this match, added 95 runs for the third wicket. Jamie How, the ODI debutant, was eventually bowled when he missed a slog sweep off Sanath Jayasuriya, and was out for 58, but Hamish Marshall <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> with 16 not out in the unbeaten fourth-wicket stand, and New Zealand won by seven wickets with more than 12 overs remaining.|$|E

The population jumped from about 800 in 1950 to 62,698 in 2000.

Warne struck either side of lunch to dismiss Stewart and Atherton, but Hick (80) and Graham Thorpe (67) gave the England fans some hope, adding 152 in four hours together before the close, playing Warne and May with relative ease.|$|E

Graeme Welch <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> by conceding 21 runs in ten overs and {{claiming}} three scalps. Steve Stubbings and Michael di Venuto then shared an opening partnership of 81, but two wickets from Johann Louw evened out the game somewhat, and Monty Panesar wrapped up Derbyshire's innings with three wickets on the second day, as Derbyshire were bowled out for 219.|$|E
25|$|RPS {{faced the}} Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 1 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, {{with a win}} {{securing}} them {{a spot in the}} final. RPS batted first and posted a slightly below-par total of 162-4, with 41 runs coming from the last two overs, thanks to well-paced innings from Manoj Tiwary and Ajinkya Rahane and a late surge from MS Dhoni. Washington Sundar ripped apart the middle order of the Indians and finished with career best figures of 3-16 in 4 overs. Shardul Thakur and Jaydev Unadkat <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> as Pune beat the Mumbai Indians comfortably by 20 runs.|$|E

Brian Lara made a half-century and Dwayne Bravo and Dave Mohammed <b>chipped</b> <b>in</b> with 30s, but Umar Gul (five for 65 including the last three wickets) and Shahid Nazir (three for 42) had done the damage, and they were bowled out for 206.|$|E
