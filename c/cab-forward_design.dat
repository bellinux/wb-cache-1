2500|$|In the United States on the Southern Pacific Railroad, {{a series}} of cab forward {{locomotives}} were produced with the cab and the firebox {{at the front of}} the locomotive and the tender behind the smokebox, so that the engine appeared to run backwards. This was only possible by using oil-firing. Southern Pacific selected this design to provide air free of smoke for the engine driver to breathe as the locomotive passed through mountain tunnels and snow sheds. Another variation was the Camelback locomotive, with the cab situated halfway along the boiler. In England, Oliver Bulleid developed the SR Leader class locomotive during the nationalisation process in the late 1940s. The locomotive was heavily tested but several design faults (such as coal firing and sleeve valves) meant that this locomotive and the other part-built locomotives were scrapped. The <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design</b> was taken by Bulleid to Ireland, where he moved after nationalisation, where he developed the [...] "turfburner". This locomotive was more successful, but was scrapped due to the dieselisation of the Irish railways.|$|E
50|$|The concept show vehicle {{featured}} rear suicide {{doors and}} a 400 hp turbocharged 3.0-liter two stroke engine. Both {{the concept and}} production model used the Chrysler Corporation's new <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design,</b> which was launched on the larger LH sedans in 1992. <b>Cab-forward</b> <b>design</b> was characterized by the long, dramatically slanted windshield, and short overhangs. The wheels were pushed further to {{the corners of the}} vehicle, which created a much larger passenger cabin than most other similarly sized vehicles of that time.|$|E
2500|$|Well known {{were the}} Southern Pacific's unique [...] "cab-forward" [...] steam {{locomotives}}. These were 2-8-8-4 locomotives {{set up to}} run in reverse, with the tender attached to the smokebox end of the locomotive. Southern Pacific {{had a number of}} snow sheds in mountain terrain, and locomotive crews nearly asphyxiated from smoke in the cab. After a number of engineers began running their engines in reverse (pushing the tender), Southern Pacific asked Baldwin Locomotive Works to produce <b>cab-forward</b> <b>designs.</b> No other North American railroad ordered cab-forward locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The 1996 Plymouth Voyager was {{completely}} redesigned {{from the ground}} up. Gone were its K-car underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design.</b> The third generation redesign used the Chrysler NS platform and included a driver's-side sliding door, a minivan first. The Voyager was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.|$|E
5000|$|The {{best known}} {{example of the}} <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design</b> in the United States, the Southern Pacific Cab-Forward (also known {{to a lesser extent}} as [...] "Cab-in-fronts" [...] and [...] "Cab-aheads") placed the cab at the front by the simple {{expedient}} of turning the entire locomotive, minus the tender, by 180 degrees. This arrangement was made possible by burning fuel oil instead of coal.|$|E
5000|$|... 1932 {{would mark}} several major {{changes for the}} company. As part of his taking over day-to-day {{operations}} of Crown from his father, MM Brockway introduced a ground-breaking school bus body; elements of its design would change school bus design forever. To improve forward visibility, the new bus was a <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design,</b> with the driver {{sitting next to the}} engine and radiator. [...] To improve safety, the bus was designed with an integral chassis; the windows were mesh-reinforced safety glass. [...] Alongside the standard braking system, the bus also was equipped with two backup braking systems.|$|E

50|$|With Generation III, the Chrysler minivans were {{available}} in long- and short- wheelbase models; three- and four-door configurations; and eight different powertrains, including electric and compressed natural gas; on a single, flexible platform.In development for nearly 5 years from early 1990 (full development from 1991) to December 26, 1994 (final design by Don Renkert was approved on September 23, 1991 and frozen in May 1992), the 1996 model was introduced at the 1995 North American International Auto Show using the Chrysler NS platform. Gone were its K-car underpinnings and architecture, replaced with more modern components and Chrysler's acclaimed <b>cab-forward</b> <b>design.</b> It included a number of innovations, including a driver's side sliding door (optional initially, to become standard equipment later), a first for Chrysler and a non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada (the Honda Odyssey had introduced the first four-door non-compact minivan for the United States & Canada in 1994, although the first-generation Odyssey had conventional hinged rear doors). With Generation III, Chrysler introduced a seat management system marketed as Easy Out Roller Seats: When installed, the 2nd and 3rd row seats (either bucket or bench seats) were latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached {{to the floor and}} seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter. A conventional door handle and lock was added to the rear hatch, eliminating the confusing pop-and-lift maneuver which had been required on earlier models. The new minivans earned unanimous critical acclaim: the Dodge Caravan was the 1996 Motor Trend Car of the Year, and the vans were on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.|$|E
