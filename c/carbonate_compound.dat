Bicarbonate dissociates into carbonate (CO32−), releasing another hydrogen ion (H+), with an equilibrium constant known as K2.

40|$|The {{methodology}} {{developed for}} the evaluation of the anaerobic organic substrate constructed wetlands as alternative method for the treatment of acidic waters emanating from mined out adits, is described in the present PhD thesis. Within the framework of an integrated evaluation of the method, laboratory tests were initially performed for the selection of the suitable organic substrate. The material that was finally selected was then used for the performance of the static and kinetic laboratory tests. The basic objective of the static tests was the determination of the maximum ability of the substrate to retain metals within its body, while in parallel, the forms in which these metals are precipitated were also investigated with the application of the five step sequential extraction procedure. During the static tests the metals examined included iron (Fe), zinc (Zn) and manganese (Mn) given that these metals constitute the basic pollutants in the case of acid mine waters from mixed sulphide mines. To further examine the precipitation mechanisms and the retain mechanisms within the substrate of the anaerobic constructed wetlands, long-term kinetic tests were designed and performed. Based on the results of all of the laboratory tests, the removal percentage for the three basic metals that were examined was 95 - 98 % for iron (Fe), 96 - 100 % for zinc (Zn) and 50 % for manganese (Mn). For the determination of the form in which the metals are retained in the substrate the five step sequential extraction procedure was again applied. At the same time and based on the laboratory measurements, a thermodynamic approach of the system was elaborated with the construction of ph-Eh diagrams. The experimental results were introduced in these diagrams and the thermodynamically stable forms for each metal were determined. Based on the comparison of the results, iron mainly precipitates as sulphide compound, hydroxide or <b>carbonate</b> <b>compound.</b> Zinc precipitates as sulphide or <b>carbonate</b> <b>compound,</b> while manganese is removed from the solution mainly due to ion exchange mechanisms or carbonate. These encouraging results were the basis for the design and construction of a pilot scale application aiming at the evaluation of the operation of the system under actual field conditions (i. e. variations in flow, composition etc.) The results of the pilot scale application verified the results of the static and kinetic tests. The average % removal recorded was 60 % for iron, 63 % for zinc and 40 % for manganese. The results of the pilot scale test were furthered evaluated within the framework of a feasibility study with the use of sustainable indicators. This evaluation showed the possibility of an industrial application of the method if this can be selectively applied in individual acidic streams, resulting from mined out areas, prior to their final conventional treatment in an active treatment unit with the use of alkaline reagents. ...|$|E

The effect of using seashell powder as additive on the modulus of rupture, force against deflection and the rate of water absorption of the mortar are investigated using varying percentage of 1 %, 2 %, 3 % and 4 % from the cement weight respectively. 30 mortar beams with different percentage of seashell powder of 100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm were moulded and cured for 7 and 28 days respectively. Findings revealed cement-seashell powder mortar has higher modulus of rupture than controlled beam. The modulus of rupture decreases with the increase of the percentage of seashell powder of 4 %. In addition, the mortar beam containing seashell powder can withstand higher forces compared to the controlled beam. All mortars containing seashell powder yielded lower porosity compared to the conventional mortar. This indicates that seashell powder has potential to be used as additive in cement replacement.

For comparison purpose, four other rocks, albite, hornblende, diorite, and quartz, also were exposed. During the exposure of granite, ionic carbonic acid, known as the wet carbonation reactant, preferentially reacted with anorthoclase-type albite and biotite, rather than with quartz. The susceptibility of biotite to wet carbonation was {{higher than that of}} anorthoclase-type albite. All the carbonation by-products of anorthoclase-type albite were amorphous phases including Na- and K-carbonates, a kaolinite clay-like compound, and silicon dioxide, while wet carbonation converted biotite into potassium aluminum silicate, siderite, and magnesite in crystalline phases and hydrogen fluoride (HF). Three of these reaction by-products, Na- and K-carbonates and HF, were highly soluble in water. Correspondingly, the carbonated top surface layer, about 1. 27 mm thick as carbonation depth, developed porous microstructure with numerous large voids, some of which have a size of {>=} 10 {mu}m, reflecting the erosion of granite by the leaching of these water-soluble reaction by-products. Comparing with this carbonation depth, its depth of other minerals was considerable lower, particularly, for hornblende and diorite with 0. 07 and 0. 02 mm, while no <b>carbonate</b> <b>compound</b> was detected in quartz. The major factor governing these low carbonation depths in these rocks was the formation of water-insensitive scale-like carbonate by-products such as calcite (CaCO{sub 3 }), siderite (FeCO{sub 3 }), and magnesite (MgCO{sub 3 }). Their formation within the superficial layer of these minerals served as protective barrier layer that inhibits and retards further carbonation of fresh underlying minerals, even if the exposure time was extended. Thus, the coverage by this barrier layer of the non-carbonated surfaces of the underlying rock was reason why the hornblende and diorite exhibited a minimum depth of carbonation. Under exposure to the scCO{sub 2 }/water at 200 C and 10. 34 MPa pressure for up to 42 days, the ranking of the magnitude of erosion caused by wet carbonation was in the following order; granite > albite > hornblende > diorite > quartz. The eroding-caused weight loss of granite (0. 88 %) was {approx} 2. 4, {approx} 5. 2, {approx} 9. 8, and {approx} 17. 6 times greater than that of albite, hornblends, diorite, and quartz, respectively...|$|E

The ¹³C NMR CSA parameters of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) are measured using two-dimensional ¹³C phase adjusted spinning sidebands (PASS) NMR spectroscopy and are analyzed {{on the basis of}} this correlation. The results indicate a distortion of the CO₃ units in ACC in the form of an in-plane displacement of the C atom away from the centroid of the O₃ triangle, resulting from hydrogen bonding with the surrounding H₂O molecules, without significant out-of-plane displacement. Similar distortion for all C atoms in the structure of ACC suggests a uniform spatial disposition of H₂O molecules around the CO₃ units forming a hydrogen-bonded amorphous network.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{mechanisms}} of carbonation of clay minerals, such as bentonite, kaolinite, and soft clay, we exposed them to supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) /water at temperatures of 200 and 250 C and pressures of 1500 and 2000 psi for 72 - and 107 -hours. Bentonite, comprising three crystalline phases, montmorillonite (MMT), anorthoclase-type albite, and quartz was susceptible to reactions with ionic carbonic acid yielded by the interactions between scCO 2 and water, particularly MMT and anorthoclase-type albite phases. For MMT, the cation-exchangeable ions, such as Na+ and Ca 2 +, present in its basal interplanar space, were replaced by proton, H+, from ionic carbonic acid; thereafter, the cations leaching from MMT directly reacted with CO 32 - as a counter ion of H+ to form <b>carbonate</b> <b>compounds.</b> Such in-situ carbonation process in basal space caused the shrinkage and breakage of the spacing structure within MMT. In contrast, the wet carbonation of anorthoclase-type albite, categorized as rock minerals, entailed the formation of three amorphous by-products, such as <b>carbonates,</b> kaolinite-like <b>compounds,</b> and silicon dioxide. Together, these two different carbonations caused the disintegration and corruption of bentonite. Kaolinite clay containing the amorphous carbonates and silicon dioxide was inert to wet carbonation.
