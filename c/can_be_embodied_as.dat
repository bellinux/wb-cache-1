40|$|Abstract — In {{a mobile}} ad hoc (multi-hop) {{wireless}} network, the logical {{structure of a}} ring {{is likely to become}} volatile or expensive to maintain over time due to changeable network topology. Additional adverse effects take place when a node joins or leaves the computation in the presence of mobility. This paper presents a protocol that adapts a ring among mobile nodes to the network dynamics to reflect overall communication efficiency. This is achieved by modifying the ring structure in a localized, mutual exclusive fashion, thereby allowing for concurrent segment-wise modifications to proceed. Remarkably our proposal operates without global knowledge of the logical structure and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>embodied</b> <b>as</b> an underlying protocol stratum that supports transparent deployments of conventional algorithms in mobile environment. Subsequent to correctness proof, simulation results show that our proposal is promising in several regards. I...|$|E

The kind of compensatory homeostasis <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>embodied</b> <b>as</b> various degrees accompanying disease progression (denoted as compensatory degree). Compensatory homeostasis provides a window for the transition from disease to healthy state. The causes of compensatory homeostasis themselves may be identified as targets for effective measures to eliminate compensation. Compensatory homeostasis embodies significantly mostly in the developing process of chronic diseases, which may help to explain in theory why intensive therapeutic strategies led to unexpected outcome in clinical practice. In addition, a large body of clinical evidence has valued traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is based on shifting compensatory homeostasis to the overall human body homeostasis, complementary to Western medicine in the management of chronic disease. In this review, we will briefly summarize the concept of compensation and attempt to bridge Western and traditional Chinese medicine through homeostasis and compensatory homeostasis based on an ample of evidence obtained from both disciplines...|$|E
40|$|To work {{effectively}} in a dynamic and uncertain environ-ment, an automated manufacturing system {{needs to be}} able to carry out actions that achieve its objectives, despite the broad range of, possibly unpredictable, vents that may oc-cur.

40|$|Abstract – In the {{conceptual}} design of mechanisms, {{the consideration of}} functional requirements is usually put off after the enumeration of kinematic structures. This design process can thus easily perform the enumeration of kinematic structures in an exhaustive manner. The degree of ingenuity involved can be greatly reduced. However, exactly since functional requirements are not taken into consideration during the enumeration process, numerous infeasible mechanisms are subsumed. It is necessary to evaluate each kinematic structure enumerated and screen out infeasible ones so that an inefficient procedure is yielded. In this paper, an efficient and systematic methodology for {{the conceptual}} design of mechanisms will be presented. It will be shown that functional requirements of mechanisms <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>embodied</b> <b>as</b> different categories of functional characteristics. Different aspects of functional characteristics can be systematic contrived from technical details from relevant patents. Through these functional characteristics, functional requirements can positively be utilized {{as the foundation of}} enumerating feasible mechanisms, instead of a negative use as the evaluation criteria for the enumerated kinematic structures. Hence, functional requirements can be brought into the enumeration process of kinematic structures to avoid creating numerous infeasible ones failed to satisfy functional requirements. The design efficiency can thus be greatly enhanced...|$|E
40|$|Most {{inquiries}} {{into the}} nature of literary value have focused on how the academy shapes literary taste and determines the reputation of individual authors. This thesis examines how ideas of literary canon can impact a writer at the creative level. Michael Ondaatje's interest in the cultural significance of authorship makes him ideal for this topic of study. The first essay discusses how Ondaatje's repeated quotation of his own texts {{can be viewed as a}} metafictional commentary on the anxieties of literary innovation. It shows how the idea of literary influence and the author's relationship to the canon <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>embodied</b> <b>as</b> a formal and thematic characteristic of the literary text. The second essay shows how Ondaatje responds to traditional conceptions of the English-Canadian canon as an editor of a national anthology of short fiction. Early national anthologists beginning with E. H. Dewart in his Selections from Canadian Poets (1864) consolidated a set of evaluative criteria that reflected aspects of nineteenth-century English-Canadian nationalism. This essay examines two national anthologies that represent an alternative to this tradition. John Simpson's The Canadian Forget Me Not for MDCCCXXXVII (1837) is a representation of popular nineteenth-century bourgeois literary taste that predates this legitimating rhetoric.

As China’s social stratification deepens, new class identities are emerging, and class structures and class relations are being redefined (Li 2013). Consumption has also presented itself as key prism through which changing social structures in China in the reform era are understood. Real estate markets, for instance, provides a means of ‘spatializing class’ in urban China (L. Zhang 2010). Similarly, retail sector affords shoppers and sales people occasions to engage in strategies of class distinction (Hanser 2008). Class inequality <b>can</b> <b>be</b> experienced <b>as</b> <b>embodied</b> ‘interactive labour practices’ in the service and hospitality sector, whereby the bodies of workers function as ‘signs, codes and messages’ of class difference (Otis 2012 : 9).

Among the many topics to which philosophy of science could contribute, this paper selects two, not only for their intrinsic importance, but also because they are essential for any fruitful discussion of the rest.

40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{architectural}} concept of poche'and {{uses it to}} explore new possibilities in transforming polyhedra with effectors. In many computer-aided design systems, architectural entities are represented as well-formed polyhedra. Parameters and functions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to modify the forms of these polyhedra. For example, a cuboid <b>can</b> <b>be</b> transformed by changing its length, breadth and height, which are its parameters. In a more complex example, a polyhedron <b>can</b> <b>be</b> transformed {{by a set of}} user-defined functions, which control its vertices, edges and faces. These parameters and functions <b>can</b> further <b>be</b> <b>embodied</b> <b>as</b> effectors that control and transform the polyhedra in extremely complex ways. An effector is an entity, which has a transforming effect on another entity or system. An effector is more complex than a parameter or function. An effector <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a modelled as a virtual computer. Effectors can take on many roles that range from geometric transformation agents and constraints to performance criteria. The concept of the poche', made famous by Venturi is familiar to architects. The poche'is a device to mediate the differences between an interior and an exterior condition or between two interior conditions. In a poche', the role of the effector changes from being an agent that acts on a polyhedron from the outside, to an agent that acts as a mediator between an interior polyhedron and an exterior polyhedron, which represent interior and exterior environments respectively. This bi-directionality {{in the role of the}} effector allows a wide range of architectural responses to be modelled. The effector then becomes an interface in the true sense of the word. This concept will work best in a threedimensional or four-dimensional representational world but <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used effectively in a two-dimensional representational world as well. The application of this concept in design systems is explored with examples drawn from the work of the author, and practitioners who are using the concept of effectors in their work. A brief discussion of how this technique can evolve in the future is presented...|$|R

Several concepts and even more numerous labels (e. g., body image, body schema) have historically been proposed to define these representations in operational terms. Recent evidence of embodiment of external objects has added complexity to an already quite intricate picture. In particular, because of their perceptual and motor effects, both rubber hands and tools <b>can</b> <b>be</b> conceived <b>as</b> <b>embodied,</b> that <b>is,</b> represented in the brain {{as if they were}} parts of one's own body.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the online {{learning}} environment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as the means by which higher education can explore the challenges and opportunities raised by online and digital society. Design/methodology/approach – The paper argues that the online learning environment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as a metaphor for how universities respond to the requirements and challenges of the digital age. Current learning management systems (LMSs) are examined, and compared with the values found in web 2. 0 and social media. Current thinking on pedagogy for online learning is then examined. The SocialLearn project at the Open University in the UK is then explained, which seeks to create a disaggregated, decentralised, social system for learners. Findings – The conclusion from the analysis is that there is a conflict between the centralised learning management system (LMS) and the requirements of online pedagogy. The traditional LMS <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> the wrong metaphor, that of the traditional classroom. The paper concludes by arguing that such learning environments will be more useful to higher education in coming to understand its response to many of the changes being seen in society, which are facilitated by the new technologies.

While ideal and visionary ideas are rarely applied to their full extent, it is important the ideal be maintained. The importance of ideal or visionary designs and plans <b>can</b> <b>be</b> examined by looking at British architecture and planning {{in the postwar period}} into the 1960 s. Both the work of Alison and Peter Smithson and of Archigram <b>can</b> <b>be</b> examined <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> criticisms of postwar reconstruction planning and its failure to address the wants, desires, and aspirations of the postwar society, the perceived “backwardness” of the architectural establishment at the time, and its lack of new discourse. British architecture and planning in the postwar period lost sight of the ideals and visions for a new city which had been produced during the war. Public demand, shortage of materials, and economic problems led to a rebuilding of structures as they had been. As a result, reconstruction became a bland, sterile process that lacked innovation and vision. The architectural establishment came to be viewed as “backward” and as not addressing the needs of a rapidly changing society. The Smithsons and Archigram <b>can</b> <b>be</b> viewed as a reaction to how reconstruction had been carried out. Both were important to restoring the ideal and vision to architecture and planning and by doing so, sparking a new architectural discourse.

40|$|Zidane a 21 st Century Portrait is a 2006 film {{directed}} by Douglas Gordon and Philippe Parreno which follows Zinedine Zidane, arguably {{one of the}} most famous football players in the world, through a match between Real Madrid and Villarreal which took place on April 23, 2005. Rather than focusing on the game itself, the frame is fixed on Zidane for almost the entire duration of the game. My line of inquiry has focused on untangling what is meant by the assertion of the film as a 21 st century portrait, with particular focus on the film s self-reflexive foregrounding of the television apparatus. I argue that Zidane a 21 st Century Portrait builds on a strategy which I term formatting, involving the creation of a new format that explicitly foregrounds the relationship between televised football and post-industrial life. Rather than a typical model of portraiture, where the portrait is conceived of as a negotiation between the artists and Zidane, I argue that the mode of portraiture engendered by the film rests on a normative schema of Zidane, produced through the affective engagement of viewers and originating in the media events that Zidane inhabits. Accordingly, the 21 st century portrait asserted in the title <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> the machine which produces this schema of Zidane by self-reflexively foregrounding the television apparatus, rather than a schema assigned from the outside. This approach is interdisciplinary, intersecting art history with concepts originating in media studies, philosophy, and film studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I use post-modern {{emergent}} arts-based methodology (Somerville, 2005) {{to explore how}} young people come to know themselves through wild places. I respond to the need identified by educational theorists, for frameworks in education which, while attempting to address current social and ecological crisis, foster deeply connective experiences in natural landscapes and the relearning and enlivening of perceptual acuity. Along side my own observations and reflections, I explore multiple creative representations of embodied experience, including journalling, poetry, song, sculpture, dance and theatre, to understand a process of becoming {{in relation to the}} phenomena of wild places. I focus firstly on two treks with young people, one through the Northern Flinders Ranges and one through the Guy Fawkes River Gorge. Utilising and building on these experiences, the research then moves into a wilderness theatre project involving a third trek and a three phase process of data collection and analysis. Correspondingly, the reader journeys through a wild place, a series of theatre workshops and a dramatic performance with a group of young people <b>as</b> they <b>embody,</b> articulate and represent their experience. The drama process serves as an innovative method of analysis both stimulating re-embodiment of participant experience and as an in-between space of creative production through which to assemble data into a collective representation. As the research unfolds, critical pedagogy of place (Gruenwald, 2003 c), traditional rites of passage (Turner, 1982) and wilderness theatre (Pitman, 2003) become integrated through a post structural understanding of the self as process. From this emerges a lens through which young people’s experience in wild places <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> a sense of belonging to the earth in new storylines of connection...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} research {{carried out}} {{to date on the}} Sky Bear and seeks to demonstrate the implications of this line of research for ―cultural astronomy‖. It begins by reviewing research that has been done cross-culturally on bear ceremonialism, focusing on the role of circumpolar stars, Dipper stars and stars adjacent to them, and how they came to be integrated, cognitively, into an over-arching cosmology shared by different hunter-gatherer populations across the N. Hemisphere. Next, using three mutually reinforcing ethnographic datasets, the manner in which, specifically in Europe, this archaic worldview, characterized by embodied reciprocity, allowed humans, animals and nature to be bound together. The cosmology, grounded in the belief that humans descended from bears, integrated skyscape and landscape into a single interlocking reality. Furthermore, the worldview <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> a ―relational epistemology‖ or ―relational ecology‖. This more culturally-informed approach coincides with the goals of ―cultural astronomy‖ as well as the methodology and goals of the emerging field of archaeological ethnography. The reasons that these particular sky resources were chosen to project this set of spirtual beliefs skyward are also addressed. In the final section I suggest that the skyscape acts a kind of mnemonic device. As such, it is a cognitive resource, readily available to the social collective in question, which can act as a repository for past beliefs. Anchoring key components of a cosmology in the stars above allows the resulting skyscape to act as an enduring ―memory bank‖. In short, the datasets analyzed facilitate the reconstruction of a European-wide ethno-cultural substrate that points to an archaic relational cosmovision and the belief that humans descended from bears as well as providing evidence for the way that skyscape and landscape were integrated into this cosmology...|$|R
40|$|This {{extended}} essay {{explores the}} validity of teaching twentieth century dystopian fiction in twenty-fırst century classrooms. This extended essay explores changing state society interactions, {{the role of the}} individual {{in a world in which}} technology is ubiquitous and increasingly plays a role in driving those changes, the simultaneous perceived freeing and enslaving tendencies of those same technologies, and the ambiguous relationship that exists between these technologies and individuals. At the heart of the discussion is the question of the compatibility of classical dystopian literature in the contemporary classroom. The scope of the essay is not limited to one novel. The corner stones of twentieth century dystopian literature such as Huxley’s Brave New World, Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty- Four and Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 are compared and contrasted with the popular dystopian novels of the present which young adults prefer. Malley’s Declaration, Legacy & Resistance trilogy and Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy are two of them. Literary commentaries and articles from literature journals have been used to support the discussion. This essay concludes that the aim of an author while creating a dystopia is to mirror questionable or disturbing trends in his society in order to shift the direction that the society appears to be taking. From this perspective, dystopian literature <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> a cautionary tale. Besides their literary value, the dystopias of the twentieth century may not be able to offer a prescriptive point of view to young adults who have been born into a world which in many respects is already characterized by the very context about which the classic genre warns. This essay acknowledges the power of literary texts over the public and the constructivist interplay that exists between an author and his society...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the utopian}} {{potential}} of the theatrical space, there has been surprisingly little attention spent on {{the exploration of the}} relationship between utopianism and theatre hermeneutics, with some notable exceptions including Klai? (1991) and Gray (1993). Bearing in mind theatre's tendency to make frequent use of forms of utopian expression, at least at the level of "pretending" and "playing," it is noticeable how infrequently the two fields are brought together in criticism. In one of the few engagements with this relationship, the stage is insightfully referred to by Diana Knight as "a sort of laboratory for constructing the liberated social space of utopia" (22). While the novel's form fits the traditional utopia, wherein the narrator is usually the guest who is guided around the utopian literary space, the exciting multi-dimensionality of the theatrical space [...] in relation to utopianism and the expression of the utopian impulse often present in drama [...] has been markedly neglected. Theatre in particular as an art form <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen <b>as</b> <b>embodying</b> an intense contradiction of utopian and anti-utopian features. It is utopian, in the creativity of a shared performance between theatre practitioners and audience that takes place in a collective space (or "no-space"), but anti-utopian in the modes of hierarchy, exclusivity and discipline that are inscribed in the economics, cultural forms and institutions of bourgeois theatre. Many of Caryl Churchill's plays display a preoccupation with political possibility and reveal traces of utopian desire. Her 1970 s plays, in particular, intersect with and reflect a cultural context that produced rejuvenated engagements with utopia. The theatre groups Joint Stock and Monstrous Regiment, who performed the original productions of her history plays Light Shining in Buckinghamshire (1976) and Vinegar Tom (1976), were additionally committed to utopian considerations of non-hierarchical collaborative working methods and participated in a system of pay parity. This essay seeks firstly to explore the ways in which theatre, utopia and space <b>can</b> <b>be</b> brought together theoretically, and secondly to read Churchill's history plays with reference to the utopian dimensions of their production contexts as well as with regard to the potentiality of utopian (historical) space [...] both literal (physical spaces) and metaphorical (spaces of possibility) [...] that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced in the plays...|$|R
