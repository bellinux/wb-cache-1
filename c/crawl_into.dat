5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals. Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous, but in reality, even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans. It is a common myth that earwigs <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> one of the engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Crush {{contains}} ten {{levels in}} each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{typically}} inhabit open eucalypt woodlands, and {{the leaves}} of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial animals, and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> their mothers' pouches, where they stay {{for the first six}} to seven months of their lives. These young koalas, known as joeys, are fully weaned around a year old. Koalas have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by various pathogens, such as Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the koala retrovirus, as well as by bushfires and droughts.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

25|$|The larvae {{spend about}} a week feeding off the carcass then <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the soil to pupate, or develop. Mature N. americanus beetles emerge from the soil 45 to 60 days after their parents {{initially}} bury the carcass. Adult American burying beetles live for only 12 months.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1941, Germany {{attacked}} the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Cherokmanov led the 148th Rifle Division {{as part of}} the 21st Army at the end of June. On 1 July, the division was transferred to the 13th Army. The division fought in the Battle of Smolensk. In July, the division was fighting on the Oster near Shumyachi. The division suffered such heavy losses fighting German tanks that officers fought in the trenches. The division then retreated into the forest, where Cherokmanov attempted to capture a group of German soldiers. He was wounded but was able to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> a thicket. At night, he reached the Krasny Krym collective farm, where he was sheltered by an elderly farmer, Nikolai Filippovich Kozlov. For a month, Kozlov sheltered Cherokmanov. After recovering from his wounds in August, Cherokmanov crossed the front line.|$|E
500|$|The baby turtles, usually {{weighing}} {{less than}} [...] hatch at night after around two months. These newly emergent hatchlings are dark-colored, with heart-shaped carapaces measuring around [...] long. They instinctively <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the sea, {{attracted by the}} reflection of the moon on the water (possibly disrupted by light sources such as street lamps and lights). While they emerge under the cover of darkness, baby turtles that do not reach the water by daybreak are preyed upon by shorebirds, shore crabs, and other predators.|$|E

500|$|Several romantic {{scenes with}} Nagarjuna and Amala were {{initially}} filmed at Ushakiron Movies in Secunderabad. Dissatisfied with the results, Varma reshot {{them at the}} Osman Ali House. Mugur Sundar choreographed the songs, and [...] "Anando Brahma" [...] was filmed at the Borra Caves in Vishakhapatnam. The film crew had to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the caves, making Siva the first Telugu film shot in its interiors. The remaining songs were filmed on sets at Annapurna Studios. Srinivasa Rao filmed his scenes in one day. The fights, choreographed by Varma, featured hand-to-hand combat and attacks with hooks as he was trained in kickboxing.|$|E
500|$|... 'Triandrus' form. Pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (Anthophora, Bombus) which forage {{for both}} pollen and nectar. The large corona allows the bees to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the {{perianth}} {{but then the}} narrow tube prevents further progres, causing them to probe deeply for nectar. The pendant flowers prevent pollination by lepidoptera. In N. albimarginatus there may be either a long stigma with short and mid length anthers or a short stigma and long anthers (dimorphism). In N. triandrus there are three patterns of sexual organs (trimophism) but all have long upper anthers but vary in stigma position {{and the length of}} the lower anthers.|$|E
500|$|Earwigs are {{generally}} nocturnal, and typically hide in small, dark, and often moist {{areas in the}} daytime. They can usually be seen on household walls and ceilings. Interaction with earwigs at this time results in a defensive free-fall to the ground followed by a scramble to a nearby cleft or crevice. During the summer they can be found around damp areas such as near sinks and in bathrooms. Earwigs tend to gather in shady cracks or openings or anywhere that they can remain concealed during daylight. Some people erroneously believe that earwigs burrow into people's ears; that is mostly a myth, although earwigs may <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> ears and some can bite, as other insects do. [...] Picnic tables, compost and waste bins, patios, lawn furniture, window frames, or anything with minute spaces (even artichoke blossoms) can potentially harbour them.|$|E

500|$|The sequel [...] was {{released}} in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and right to see diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain {{on the lookout for}} some time after losing sight of the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springfield {{is held in}} a grip of terror by Bart, who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy with his rule into another being, and even history is changed to suit Bart's pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a {{football}} game so that Bart can watch [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (which has been running for 346 consecutive hours), Bart transports him into the football stadium {{in place of the}} ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house, trying to surprise Bart with a blow {{to the back of the}} head, Bart transforms him into a jack-in-the-box. Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The doctor says that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a jack-in-the-box, Homer spends quality time with Bart, and they soon become a normal, loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in their bed. As the two <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> bed, Homer laments that he has to go to work in a few hours and dozes off, becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} mother's death, Gein began {{to create a}} [...] "woman suit" [...] so that [...] "...he could become his mother—to {{literally}} <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> her skin". Gein denied having sex with the bodies he exhumed, explaining: [...] "They smelled too bad." [...] During state crime laboratory interrogation, Gein also admitted to {{the shooting death of}} Mary Hogan, a tavern owner missing since 1954 whose head was found in his house, but he later denied memory of details of her death.|$|E

2500|$|Link Passage is {{a narrow}} rift passage that links {{back to the}} Chamber of Columns. A series of small {{passages}} at two levels leave Link Passage and heads towards the river passage. One of these leads into the wide Blind Passage, which also emerges into the Chamber of Columns. The upper passage is a tight <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the pretentiously named Wembley Stadium. [...] This passage is formed in a fault. The survey of the British expedition in 1972 showed that the Wembley Fault extended from a right bank passage on the river to Wembley Stadium, Mudwall and Rimstone Passages.|$|E
2500|$|The first part, [...] "The Thieving Magpie", {{begins with}} Toru Okada, a low-key {{unemployed}} man, who is tasked by his wife, Kumiko, {{to find their}} missing cat. Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung {{out there for a}} while with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house that she says is a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later on to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> and think.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{extensions}} to the South Dock {{were opened}} in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during {{construction of the}} new south lock connecting the South Dock to the Severn Estuary, supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. The rescuers included 12-year-old paper boy Thomas ‘Toya’ Lewis who was small enough to <b>crawl</b> <b>into</b> the collapsed trench. Lewis worked for two hours with hammer and chisel in an attempt to free one of those trapped who was released the next day. Several hundred pounds was later raised through public subscription in gratitude for the boy's efforts, and he was sent on an engineering scholarship to Scotland. Lewis was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving by King Edward VII in December 1909. A Wetherspoons pub in the city centre is named [...] "The Tom Toya Lewis" [...] after the young hero. The building in which the pub is housed was formerly the Newport YMCA, the Foundation Stone for which was laid by Viscount Tredegar, also in 1909.|$|E
