50|$|The Super Sprite was {{packaged}} as {{a self-contained}} engine {{in its own}} nacelle, jettisoned after take-off and retrieved by parachute. Inflatable air bags cushioned its impact with the ground. To obtain a clean separation from the carrier aircraft, the production engines fitted to the Vickers Valiant had a small <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> at the nose, pitching the nacelle downwards on separation.|$|E
40|$|A {{structural}} excitation system, {{using an}} oscillating <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> to generate force, was {{mounted on the}} forebody of the YF- 12 A airplane. The <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> was used to excite the airframe structural modes during flight in the subsonic, transonic, and supersonic regimes. Structural modal responses generated by the <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> forces were measured at the flight test conditions by airframe-mounted accelerometers. Correlations of analytical and experimental aeroelastic results were made. Doublet lattice, steady state double lattice with uniform lag, Mach box, and piston theory all produced acceptable analytical aerodynamic results within the restrictions that apply to each. In general, the aerodynamic theory methods, carefully applied, were found to predict the dynamic behavior of the YF- 12 A aircraft adequately...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentials}} and {{capability for}} implementing a LAMS (load alleviation and mode suppression) {{system on the}} YF- 12 A {{for the purpose of}} flight research were evaluated. The nature of the research is to minimize the design risk in application of LAMS to future aircraft. The results of the study show that the YF- 12 A would be a suitable test bed for continuing development of LAMS technology. This was demonstrated by defining five candidate LAMS systems and analytically evaluating them with regard to performance and mechanization. Each of the five systems used a different combination of force producers. A small <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> or a mass-reaction device mounted near the cockpit was considered as a possible LAMS force producer, together with the existing inboard and outboard elevons. It was concluded that a combination of <b>canard</b> <b>vane</b> and outboard elevons would provide the most effective system for the YF- 12 A...|$|E
50|$|The Rockwell B-1 Lancer has small <b>canard</b> <b>vanes</b> or fins {{on either}} side of the forward fuselage. They form part of an active damping system that reduces {{aerodynamic}} buffeting during high-speed, low altitude flight. Such buffeting would otherwise cause crew fatigue and reduce airframe life during prolonged flights.|$|R
40|$|High-speed {{aerospace}} vehicles which employ high strength, light weight, yet deformable materials may exhibit {{significant interaction}} between the rigid-body and vibrational dynamics. Preliminary High-Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) configurations are a prime example. Traditionally, separate control systems {{have been used to}} augment the rigid-body and vibrational dynamics. In the HSCT arena, the highly coupled motions may not allow this design freedom. The research activity addresses two specific issues associated with the design and development of an integrated flight control system (FCS) for HSCT configurations, which are discussed next. The HSCT is expected to have a short period instability at subsonic speeds. Flight vehicles with this characteristic (i. e., F- 16, F- 22, X- 29, Space Shuttle) are stabilized with what is called a superaugmented pitch rate loop. One concern is 'Will this stability augmentation logic work for a HSCT?' Studies show that an idealized pitch rate design would be acceptable, but is not realistic. Investigations using a contaminated pitch rate design reveal serious hurdles to overcome in the FCS design. Mounting location for the pitch rate sensor is critical. Results indicate a forward location leads to destabilizing pick-up of aeroelastic modes, while aft locations lead to undesirable coupling of the dominate pitch mode with the first aeroelastic mode. Intermediate locations for the sensor may not be acceptable. The source of the problem is the presence of low frequency aeroelastic modes in HSCT configurations, which are not present in vehicles currently using the superaugmented logic. To say the least, a conventional superaugmented pitch rate loop strategy may have undesirable characteristics. An unconventional strategy, which attempts to eliminate the above deficiencies by blending several pitch rate signals, indicates an improvement in the FCS architecture feasibility, but is still lacking in some respects. The HSCT configuration does not have aerodynamic surfaces {{in the vicinity of the}} nose (i. e., no <b>canard</b> or <b>vane).</b> A second concern is 'Can the fuselage bending/torsion aeroelastic modes be effectively augmented without sufficient control input near the vehicle nose?' The superaugmented FCS results above may be suggesting the necessity of a secondary feedback loop to achieve an acceptable integrated FCS. Preliminary analysis of HSCT aeroelastic mode shapes indicate the use of existing wing leading edge devices as a second control input may be lacking in control authority for the rigid-body attitude and aeroelastic modes. An effort is underway to incorporate generic wing leading edge devices and canards into a generic HSCT model for the purpose of assessing additional control authority and it's use in candidate FCS designs. A generic HSCT mathematical model was necessary for the studies above. A HSCT category model is available in NASA-CR- 172201. This model describes the linear, longitudinal dynamics about the following flight condition: ascent, W = 730, 000 lbs, h = 6, 500 ft, M = 0. 6. The model incorporates the full rigid-body variable set, as well as eighteen aeroelastic modes. Elevator deflection serves as the control input. Modifications to the model include the incorporation of relaxed static stability (i. e., static margin from - 7. 3 % to + 10 %) and additional control inputs...|$|R
