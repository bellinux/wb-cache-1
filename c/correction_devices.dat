2500|$|One {{difference}} between live {{performances in the}} popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a microphone and PA system (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as [...] "crooning" [...] which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic {{very close to the}} mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop beatboxers, doing plosive [...] "p" [...] and [...] "b" [...] sounds into the mic to create percussive effects.

50|$|Pitch {{correction}} is {{an electronic}} effects unit or audio software {{that changes the}} intonation (highness or lowness in pitch) of an audio signal so that all pitches will be notes from the equally tempered system (i.e., like the pitches on a piano).

40|$|Adolescent {{idiopathic}} scoliosis is characterised by an S- or C-shaped {{lateral deviation}} of the spine, an axial {{rotation of the}} vertebrae, and a flattening of the sagittal curvature.

Therefore, a non-fusion scoliosis <b>correction</b> <b>device</b> is being developed in which the disadvantages of present systems are reduced. Furthermore, this device should correct the deformity in all three anatomical planes and should allow growth of the patient.

Part 2 of this thesis focuses on the timing of the surgery. This is highly important and mainly dependent on the timing of the pubertal growth spurt of the adolescent patient.

With this device, the shape recovery forces of a shape-memory metal rod are used to achieve a gradual three-dimensional scoliosis correction. In the experimental study the action of the now device was inverted: the device was used to induce a scoliotic curve instead of correcting one. Surgical procedures were performed in six pigs. An originally curved squared rod, in the cold condition, was straightened and fixed to the spine with pedicle screws. Peroperatively, the memory effect of the rod was activated by heating the rod to 50 degreesC by a low-voltage, high-frequency current. After 3 and after 6 months the animals were sacrificed. The first radiographs, obtained immediately after surgery, showed in all animals an induced curve of about 40 degrees Cobb angle - the original curve of the rod. This curve remained constant during the follow-up. The postoperative serum nickel measurements were around the detection limit, and were not significantly higher compared to the preoperative nickel concentration. Macroscopic inspection after 3 and 6 months showed that the device was almost overgrown with newly formed bone. Corrosion and fretting processes were not observed. Histologic examination of the sections of the surrounding tissues and sections of the lung, liver, spleen and kidney showed no evidence of a foreign body response. In view of the initiation of the scoliotic deformation, it is expected that the shape-memory metal based scoliosis <b>correction</b> <b>device</b> also has the capacity to correct a scoliotic curve.
