25|$|Forficula auricularia {{has been}} known to cause {{significant}} damage to crops, flowers, and fruit orchards when at high population levels. Some of the commercially valuable vegetables it feeds upon include cabbage, cauliflower, chard, celery, lettuce, potato, beet, and cucumber among others. Earwigs readily consume corn (maize) silk and can damage the crop. Among fruits, they have been found to damage apple and pear orchards. They damage young plum and peach trees in early spring, when other food is scarce, by devouring blossoms and leaves at night. It is not uncommon to find them wedged among petals of fresh cut <b>carnations,</b> roses, dahlia and zinnia.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{its history}} before 1957, the all-Pullman train made station stops only at GCT and Harmon for New York–area {{passengers}} and LaSalle Street Station and Englewood for Chicago-area passengers.

On December 2, 1967, at 6:00P.M., the half-full train left GCT, track 34 for the last time. As always, <b>carnations</b> were given to men and perfume and flowers to women boarding the train.

25|$|Arabidopsis thaliana has a gene called AGAMOUS {{that plays}} an {{important}} role in defining how many petals and sepals and other organs are generated. Mutations in this gene give rise to the floral meristem obtaining an indeterminate fate, and many floral organs keep on getting produced. We have flowers like roses, <b>carnations</b> and morning glory, for example, that have very dense floral organs. These flowers have been selected by horticulturists since long for increased number of petals. Researchers have found that the morphology of these flowers is because of strong mutations in the AGAMOUS homolog in these plants, which leads to them making a large number of petals and sepals. Several studies on diverse plants like petunia, tomato, impatiens, maize etc. have suggested that the enormous diversity of flowers is a result of small changes in genes controlling their development.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 1936, Hindenburg made {{surprise}} {{visits to}} England. In May {{it was on}} a flight from America to Germany when it flew low over the West Yorkshire town of Keighley. A parcel was then thrown overboard and landed in the High Street. Two boys, Alfred Butler and Jack Gerrard, retrieved it and found the contents to be a bouquet of <b>carnations,</b> a small silver cross and a letter on official note paper dated May 22, 1936. The letter read: 'To the finder of this letter, please deposit these flowers and cross on the grave of my dear brother, Lt. Franz Shulte, 1 Garde Regt, zu fuss, POW in Skipton cemetery in Keighley near Leeds. Many thanks for your kindness. John P. Shulte, the first flying priest'. Historian Oliver Denton speculates that the June visit may have had a more sinister purpose: to observe the industrial heartlands of Northern England.|$|E

The service was attended by thousands of Puerto Ricans, with plena being played in the background. The burial ceremony was also attended by thousands, with La Borinqueña being sung by Lucecita Benítez prior to the procession. After stopping at San Ignacio de Loyola Church, the procession advanced to Buxeda Cemetery, where Rubén Berríos offered the final words. As Juliá's coffin was lowered, a load of <b>carnations</b> was dropped from a helicopter while the crowd shouted ¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!.
