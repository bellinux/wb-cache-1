5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
25|$|Wet sand heath is {{the ideal}} habitat for purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix) and scirpus (Scirpus cespitosus). It occurs in places close to the water table and in the {{transition}} zone around bogs. Its primary locations are areas north of Wilsede and near the Hörpel Ponds (Hörpeler Teichen).|$|E
500|$|On {{the slopes}} of Kilham Hill are {{the remains of a}} shielling, which {{provided}} shelter for shepherds watching over the sheep as they grazed. [...] In summer the hillside is a profusion of purple and blue as wild thyme, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> and harebells come into bloom; foxgloves have colonised the stony ground. [...] A stone cairn crowns the summit, and was found to conceal a Bronze Age cist containing burnt bones. [...] From the summit, there are views over the Milfield Plain, Glendale and the Till Valley, and to Eildon Hill, Yeavering Bell and the Cheviot Hills. [...] Buzzards, kestrels, lapwings and curlews are common, while bilberry, tormentil and heath bedstraw carpet the soil.|$|E
500|$|The {{total number}} of {{vascular}} species is low by world standards, {{partly due to the}} effects of Pleistocene glaciations (which eliminated all or nearly all species) and the subsequent creation of the North Sea (which created a barrier to re-colonisation). Nonetheless, {{there are a variety of}} important species and assemblages. Heather moor containing Ling, Bell Heather, <b>Cross-leaved</b> <b>Heath,</b> Bog Myrtle and fescues is generally abundant and contains various smaller flowering species such as Cloudberry and Alpine Ladies-mantle. Cliffs and mountains host a diversity of [...] arctic and alpine plants including Alpine Pearlwort, Mossy Cyphal, Mountain Avens and Fir Clubmoss. On the Hebridean islands of the west coast, there are plantago pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to sea spray and include Red Fescue, Sea Plantain and Sea Pink. The machair landscapes include rare species such as Irish Lady's Tresses, Yellow Rattle and numerous orchids along with more common species such as Marram and Buttercup, Ragwort, Bird's-foot Trefoil and Ribwort Plantain. Scots Lovage, (Ligusticum scoticum) first recorded in 1684 by Robert Sibbald, and the Oyster Plant are common plants of the coasts.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are large}} areas of bog in Boho, [...] typified by species such as bell heather, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> and ling (common heather). Additionally species such as [...] sundew (which are carnivorous) and bog asphodels can be found.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the areas}} of damp heath, the {{predominant}} species when the site was designated an SSSI in 1963 were common heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix), common gorse (Ulex europaeus), western gorse (U. gallii) and purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea). These areas also of [...] bog moss (Sphagnum). A total of 50 species of bryophytes have been recorded at the site, including the large white-moss (Leucobryum glaucum), which is rare in Cheshire. Other locally rare species that have been observed here include bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), common lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica) and round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia).|$|E
2500|$|The town's two {{parks are}} the main open spaces in the town centre. Cheetham Park was opened in June 1932 to a crowd of 15,000 people. The park was left to the town under the will of John Frederick Cheetham along with his house, Eastwood, and his {{collection}} of paintings, which now form part of the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery collection. The park is landscaped informally with large areas of woodland. Adjacent to Cheetham's Park lies the Eastwood Nature Reserve. Eastwood {{was one of the}} first reserves to be owned by the RSPB. It is managed by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. The reserve is a cut-over, lowland, raised mire SSSI, surrounded by a woodland fringe. Characteristic bog plants include sphagnum mosses, cotton grass and <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath.</b> Nine species of dragonfly and damselfly have been recorded on the reserve, along with the green hairstreak butterfly. The steep-sided broad-leaved woodland is bisected by Acres Brook and contains several old mill ponds. The geology is shale and sandstone, with a rich variety of plants and animals typical of woodland habitat on an acid soil. Access is from the A6018 Mottram Road. Car parking is available in Stalybridge Celtic FC's car park. The reserve occupies [...]|$|E

50|$|The Grundloses Moor {{nature reserve}} is {{dominated}} by cottongrass, cranberries, bilberries, peat moss and <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath.</b> It was formerly used for peat cutting, especially in the south, but has regenerated itself after measures {{to raise the water}} levels were introduced.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} flora of {{the site}} is characterised as a wet heath composed of heather (Calluna vulgaris), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix), deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and tormentil (Potentilla erecta), and occasional bog-moss (Sphagnum capillifolium).|$|E
50|$|Upland pasture (mostly semi-natural, that is {{maintained}} by particular farming {{practices such as}} grazing and mowing). Typical species are: moor matgrass, wavy hair-grass, species of Agrostis, sheep's fescue, green-ribbed sedge, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> bell heather, bilberry, black crowberry, deergrass and bog asphodel.|$|E
50|$|The {{soil of the}} site, {{deriving}} from slate-based mudstones and siltstones, is permanently waterlogged in large places. It is {{the foundation for the}} largest area in Cornwall of Southern Atlantic wet heath, containing <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix) and Dorset heath (Erica ciliaris).|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the site soil drainage is impeded which has caused a significant area of mixed humid heath and acidic grassland to thrive. The main flora present in this part of the site are purple moor-grass, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> degenerate heather, heath rush, compact rush, green-ribbed sedge and crowberry.|$|E
50|$|There {{are large}} areas of bog in Boho, typified by species such as bell heather, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> and ling (common heather). Additionally species such as sundew (which are carnivorous) and bog asphodels can be found.The {{woodlands}} of Boho consist of a mixture of plantation woodlands and semi-natural broadleaf woodlands (mainly ash and hazel).|$|E
50|$|There is a drier area of {{heathland}} {{around the}} marsh which supports creeping willow, sneezewort, common fleabane, devil's-bit scabious, purple moor-grass, heather, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> heather and bell heather. The {{boundaries of the}} reserve are edged with bramble, gorse, silver birch and willow. rosebay willowherb flourishes in one corner and its spread is controlled.|$|E
50|$|Wet sand heath is {{the ideal}} habitat for purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea), <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix) and scirpus (Scirpus cespitosus). It occurs in places close to the water table and in the {{transition}} zone around bogs. Its primary locations are areas north of Wilsede and near the Hörpel Ponds (Hörpeler Teichen).|$|E
50|$|At {{the base}} of the valley slopes there are boggy areas with common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix), common {{bilberry}} (Vaccinium myrtillus), marsh lousewort (Pedicularis palustris), and many-stalked spike-rush (Eleocharis multicaulis). The wet pasture supports uncommon species such as whorled caraway (Carum verticillatum), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), and heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata subsp. ericetorum).|$|E
50|$|The wet heath areas {{also contain}} purple moor-grass along with bog myrtle (Myrica gale) and <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix) {{as the three}} most {{prolific}} species. Black bogrush (Schoenus nigricans) are prominent in the wetter, more base-rich parts, whereas bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.) and the insectivorous round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) {{can be found in}} the wet hollows.|$|E
50|$|The wetter {{parts of}} the valley mire are characterised by an {{abundance}} of bog mosses, Sphagnum spp, in association with species such as common cottongrass, Eriophorum angustifolium, star sedge, Carex echinata, and bog asphodel, Narthecium ossifragum. The drier areas are heathland, with heather, Calluna vulgaris, hare's-tail cottongrass, Eriophorum vaginatum, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> Erica tetralix, and common sedge, Carex nigra.|$|E
5000|$|The moorland has {{a number}} of {{distinct}} vegetative zones. The plateau is dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris) and hare's-tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with local patches of <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> (Erica tetralix). Other notable species include deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) and bog mosses such as (Sphagnum papillosum) and (S. capillifolium var. rubellum).|$|E
50|$|Merrick Kells {{contains}} three habitats of European interest: blanket bog, montane acid grasslands, and wet heath with <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath.</b> There are mires supporting various communities, and {{the area}} has {{a wide variety of}} species but low population levels. There are nationally important breeding bird populations, and important invertebrate populations. The site is the largest remaining unafforested area of upland in Galloway.|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of the bogs {{depends on}} the type and location. Blanket bog, which forms on the highest land where the rainfall exceeds 2000 mm a year, consists mainly of cotton-grass (Eriophorum species), sedges (Carex and Rhynchospora), Bog Asphodel and Common Tormentil, with Sphagnum thriving in the wettest patches. The valley bogs have lush growth of rushes, with sphagnum, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> sundews and several other species.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife in {{the nature}} reserve {{includes}} kingfisher, mute swans, watervoles, damselfly and dragonfly species such as the white-faced darter, various species of duck, and even the rare bird of prey the hobby. Plants include cotton sedge, bog moss (Sphagnum), great hairy willowherb, bog myrtle, water figwort, flag iris, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> bog rosemary, cranberry and sundew; common alder trees, alder buckthorn, grey sallow and crack willow predominate.|$|E
50|$|The massif {{enjoys a}} variety of climatic {{influences}} and supports {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal species, including Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata (a subspecies of mountain pine) which grows in abundance between elevations of 1,600-2,300 m, <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath,</b> the arctic marsh cinquefoil, 94 species of lichen and several Mediterranean species, as well as some 22 species of sphagnum moss in the bogs within the park.|$|E
50|$|The bog {{vegetation}} {{features a}} high percentage cover of sphagnum mosses, ericoid dwarf-shrubs such as <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> Erica tetralix and heather Calluna vulgaris, and other associated species such as hare's-tail cottongrassEriophorum vaginatum, common cottongrass Eriophorum angustifolium, deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum and sundew species Drosera. Additional species, also well represented within the bog include Bog Asphodel Narthecium ossifragum and White Beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba, with occasional patches of Bog-myrtle Myrica gale also occurring.|$|E
50|$|Of special {{importance}} {{within the}} park are the 525 ha of heathland which are almost entirely covered in heather (Calluna vulgaris). <b>Cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> is only found occasionally, in damper places. These areas are {{the remnants of the}} vast heathlands of the Middle Ages that stretched from Celle to Lüneburg. They have now been protected, either as nature reserves, or as part of the European ecological network, Natura 2000.|$|E
50|$|The actual area of bog {{within the}} state of North Rhine-Westphalia covers 215 ha {{and has been a}} nature reserve since 1974. The {{landowner}} of most of the real estate is the district of Minden-Lübbecke, which has bought up the plots of land {{with the support of the}} state of North Rhine-Westphalia. In spite being formerly drained, the bog forms a habitat for a large number of endangered plant and animal species. Important plants on the Oppenwehe Moor include peat mosses, cottongrass and <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath.</b> The peat mosses are responsible for the growth of the bog and are the most important plants in the raised bog; they can store more than twenty times their own weight of water. Their lower layers die off and become peat. The best-known and most striking plant is cottongrass. In spring the cottongrasses turn large parts of the raised bog into a sea of white. The <b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath</b> is a typical heather plant of raised bogs. It prefers wet locations and blooms in summer.|$|E
50|$|Erica tetralix (<b>cross-leaved</b> <b>heath)</b> is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Ericaceae, native to western Europe, from southern Portugal to central Norway, {{as well as a}} number of boggy regions further from the coast in Central Europe such as Austria and Switzerland. In bogs, wet heaths and damp coniferous woodland, E. tetralix can become a dominant part of the flora. It has also been introduced to parts of North America.|$|E
