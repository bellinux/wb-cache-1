The catalytic performances of the [Pd(NHC) (dvtms) ] complexes are evaluated in the Mizoroki–Heck coupling of 4 -bromoacetophenone and n-butyl acrylate, providing a ready and effective comparison into the influence of ring size and steric congestion on catalytic activity in <b>carbon–carbon</b> cross <b>coupling</b> reactions...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} field in catalysis is transition-metal (TM) based <b>carbon-carbon</b> cross <b>coupling.</b> As noble metals are scarce, efforts {{are made to}} use first-row transition metals for these catalytic conversions instead. However, due to their current design, some base metal TM complexes contain phosphine ligands. These ligands are prone to dissociation, making these complexes difficult to characterize. The use of strongly binding anionic silyl ligands, isoelectronic to phosphines, might aid in {{the stability of the}} complex and thus allow for more facile characterisation. This would lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanism behind <b>carbon-carbon</b> cross <b>coupling,</b> and will eventually allow for better catalyst design. In this work, 1, 9 -diphenyl- 5, 5 -dimethylbipyrromethane (H 2 dpbpm) and 1, 9 -dimesityl- 5, 5 -dimethylbipyrromethane (H 2 dmbpm) are synthesized in a three-step synthesis, largely according to literature procedures. These compounds are then silylated in a two-step synthesis via lithiation, of which 1, 9 -dimesityl- 5, 5 -dimethylbipyrromethyl phenyl silane is isolated in good yields. The crystal structure of this compound is presented as well. Attempts to deprotonate the silane are made, but most led to degradation of the scaffold and desilylation of the silane, if the reagents reacted at all. The potassium salt of the siloxane was synthesized and crystallized serendipitously by reaction of PhSi(dmbpm) H in the presence of potassium hydride, 18 -crown- 6 and traces of moisture. Methods to circumvent the problem of deprotonation included oxidative addition to platinum(0) tetrakis(triphenylphosphine), as well as incorporating halogens into the designed silane for subsequent reduction. These methods proved to be unsuccessful as well, as oxidative addition did not occur, and silylation with trihalogenated silanes resulted in an incomprehensible mixture of compounds, often not representing the bipyrromethyl backbone, from which no single compound could be isolated...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} {{is focused on}} two main objectives, the study of catalytic efficiency and mechanism of palladium nanoparticles stabilized by poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) for <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> reactions, and to rationally synthesize metal nanoparticles stabilized by metal-carbon bonds and apply them to catalyze <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> reactions. In the first project, Pd nanoparticles stabilized by PVP were used to catalyze carbon-coupling reactions, specifically the Stille and Suzuki reactions. The mechanism of <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> reactions was studied. The uncertainty of whether nanoparticles or Pd salts are the catalyst was also examined using the same experimental procedure with Pd salts to examine their catalytic activity in <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> reactions. Results show {{that the presence of}} O 2 is crucial to the Stille reaction with the Pd nanoparticles, which are nearly completely inert under N 2, while the K 2 PdCl 4 precursor is itself quite active for the Stille reaction. However, the Pd nanoparticles were found to be active for the Suzuki reaction with high yields in the absence of O 2. The yields for 4 -chlorobenzoic acid are higher than 4 -bromobenzoic acid and occur for un-catalyzed reactions, for reasons that are still unknown. Finally Au nanoparticles have been tested by the same experimental procedure and have no catalytic activity for these two reactions. In the second project, the synthesis of Au and Pd monolayer protected clusters (MPCs) with metal carbon covalent linkages was examined, and the stability of the resulting MPCs was tested. UV-Vis spectra and TEM images show the formation of Au and Pd nanoparticles and 1 H NMR was used to characterize the ligands attached {{to the surface of the}} nanoparticles. The decylphenyl-stabilized Pd MPCs were synthesized successfully and quite stable in air, while decylphenyl-stabilized Au MPCs prepared with the same protocol have less stability and are easily decomposed. XPS spectra indicate the composition of decylphenyl-stabilized Pd MPCs is a combination of Pd 0 and Pd 2 + species with the Pd 2 + species in excess. In addition, alkylphenyl-stabilized Pd nanoparticles were shown to be effective catalysts for <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> reactions such as Suzuki and Stille reactions as well as hydrogenation reactions. Finally, it was noted that Pd-C bonds could be easily reduced by H 2 when performing hydrogenation reactions resulting in nanoparticle aggregation and precipitation under hydrogenation conditions...|$|E

Spectra of cell extracts from wild-type E. coli show that glutamate becomes highly enriched in 13 C when 13 C-enriched propionate {{is the sole}} carbon source. No glutamate labelling was detected when the tricarboxylic acid cycle was blocked either by deletion of citrate synthase or by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate. The 13 C fractional enrichment in glutamate C- 2, C- 3 and C- 4 in wild-type cells was quantitatively and qualitatively different when [2 - 13 C]propionate as opposed to [3 - 13 C]propionate was supplied. Approximately equal labelling occurred in the C- 2, C- 3 and C- 4 positions of glutamate when [3 - 13 C]propionate was available, and multiplets due to <b>carbon-carbon</b> spin-spin <b>coupling</b> were observed. However, in cells supplied with [2 - 13 C]propionate, very little 13 C appeared in the glutamate C- 4 position, and the remaining glutamate resonances all appeared as singlets. The unequal and non-identical labelling of glutamate in cells supplied with [2 - 13 C]- as opposed to [3 - 13 C]propionate {{is consistent with the}} utilization of propionate by E. coli via two pathways, oxidation of propionate to pyruvate and carboxylation of propionate to succinate. These intermediates are further metabolized to glutamate by the action of the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

A number of ¹³C labeled lactams were synthesized to cover a range of dihedral angles; experimental and theoretical <b>carbon-carbon</b> and carbon-hydrogen <b>coupling</b> constants were obtained to give {{the relationships between the}} vicinal coupling constants ³J[C(O) -N-C-C], ³J[C(O) -N-C-H] and dihedral angle φ. Vicinal ¹³C-¹³C coupling constants for dihedral angles in the range of 90 ° to 180 ° were obtained unambiguously from the coupling between the carbonyl and carbons in the side chains of lactams. However, due to coupling via multiple paths, vicinal ¹³C-¹³C coupling constants for dihedral angles ranging from 0 ° to 90 ° were estimated by excluding the contributions from the geminal ²J[C(O) -C-C] or vicinal ³J[C(O) -C-C-C] couplings in the lactam rings. The experimental and theoretical results show that the angular dependence of vicinal ¹³C-¹³C coupling constants do not follow a simple Karplus type relationship, especially at small dihedral angles. It was found that geminal ²J[C(O) -N-C] were small (< 0. 3 Hz). However, the ²J[C(O) -N-C] in the cis arrangement are shifted to about 2. 2 Hz in N-methyl substituted lactams while in the trans arrangement the values are about 4. 4 Hz.

In the drive towards a more eco-responsible chemistry, the main focuses rely on the search of highly active and selective nanocatalysts, in association with an efficient recycling mainly under pure biphasic liquid-liquid conditions. In this Personal Account, we proposed our almost fifteen-years odyssey {{in the world of}} metal nanoparticles for a sustainable catalysis.

40|$|AbstractThe {{simplest}} pulse sequence (π/ 2) x—τ— (π/ 2) y (Acquisition) {{for nuclear}} spin polarization transfer {{is used in}} a selective fashion: transfer only flows from a nucleus A to any nucleus X J-coupled to A, provided that the carrier frequency coincides with the A resonance and that τ is slightly varied around a properly chosen value, relevant free induction decays being co-added. According to the value selected for τ (1 / 2 J or 1 / 4 J, J: one bond <b>carbon-carbon</b> <b>coupling</b> constant), it proves possible to sort out and compare subspectra pertaining to isotopomers involving one, two, three, and four consecutive 13 C. The method {{has been applied to}} an extract of mycelium grown on a medium containing 13 C-labeled acetate, with the aim of delineating metabolic pathways from proportions of the detected isotopomers...|$|E
