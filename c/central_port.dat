5|$|Haifa's {{development}} owed much to British {{plans to}} make it a <b>central</b> <b>port</b> and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization. The State-run Palestine Railways also built its main workshops in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} services took Biko to the Walmer police station in Port Elizabeth, {{where he was}} held naked in a cell with his legs in shackles. On 6 September, he was transferred from Walmer to room 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in <b>central</b> <b>Port</b> Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in shackles, and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten {{by at least one}} of the ten security police officers.

The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and leg irons.|$|E

40|$|West and <b>Central</b> Africa <b>ports</b> have {{historically}} not {{paid much attention}} to environmental issues. In the past decade, however, environmental concerns are beginning to emerge with pockets of innovative responses to environmental risks as the ports undergo institutional and infrastructural reform – most notably, with concessions to multinational terminal operators. In this article, environmental management processes in the ports of Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Douala (Cameroon), Lagos (Nigeria) and Tema (Ghana) are compared. Three aspects of ecological modernization theory: changing role of the state, growing involvement of economic actors and economic incentives, and shifting roles for civil society organizations are focused on to analyse the dynamics of their environmental reform. Findings suggest that globalization processes are a common major trigger in enhancing a gradual but still fragmented and limited process of environmental reform in West and <b>Central</b> Africa <b>ports,</b> but paces and pathways of the reform are influenced by national politico-administrative arrangements rooted in colonial legacies. Consequently, understanding and advancing environmental reform processes of West and <b>Central</b> Africa <b>ports</b> requires following trends and significant developments but also taking into account national historical trajectories...|$|R
