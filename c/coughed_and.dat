25|$|N. americanus and A. duodenale eggs can {{be found}} in warm, moist soil where they will {{eventually}} hatch into first stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding non-infective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second stage larvae, L2. L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage, will feed for approximately 7 days and then molt into the third stage larvae, or L3. L3 is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the non-feeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and will seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While N. americanus larvae only infect through penetration of skin, A. duodenale can infect both through penetration as well as orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, the larvae then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They will then travel up the trachea to be <b>coughed</b> <b>and</b> swallowed by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5–9 weeks. The female adult worms will release eggs (N. americanus about 9,000–10,000 eggs/day and A. duodenale 25,000–30,000 eggs/day) which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs will hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle will start anew.|$|E
500|$|As {{the years}} went by and the king became {{increasingly}} prone to outbursts of anger, breaking with all his old relationships, it was said that only in Caroline and their sons' company did Leopold [...] "recapture some of his vitality and Germanic humour". Caroline was described as having been above average in height, [...] "plump but graceful, with a beautiful complexion and skin", with masses of chestnut hair; in character, she was [...] "haughty, sharp, irritable" [...] and ill-educated, and insisted on being treated with respect or else one would have to face the king's displeasure. She was also said to be in possession of [...] "vivid conversational powers" [...] and [...] "dazzling youthfulness". Caroline was well-used to Leopold's [...] "quirks", such as his extreme hypochondria; for instance, when she needed free time for herself, she <b>coughed</b> <b>and</b> pretended to have a cold; she used this [...] "weapon" [...] to keep scheming female rivals from gaining favor with the king as well, telling Leopold that they had colds. Rather than ignore their age difference, Caroline and Leopold seemed to enjoy it, she calling him Tres Vieux and he calling her Tres Belle.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present {{case study}} reports {{a case of}} chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope {{associated}} with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). Careful analysis of cough-related symptoms and ECG monitoring led to the suspicion of PVC-induced cough. A coincidence between PVCs <b>and</b> episodes of <b>cough</b> was also documented by a portable multichannel recorder. Moreover, Doppler echocardiography revealed a PVC-induced transient increase in the pulmonary artery blood flow. After exclusion of other possible aetiologies, complete relief of chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope was achieved by radiofrequency ablation of the arrhythmogenic focus located in the right ventricular outflow tract. Premature ventricular complexes {{should be considered as}} a cause of chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> syncope <b>and</b> an interdisciplinary cooperation can lead to successful diagnosis and treatment of this condition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cough</b> <b>and</b> cold {{medications}} that contain nasal decongestants, antihistamines, <b>cough</b> suppressants, <b>and</b> expectorants commonly are used {{alone or in}} combination in attempts to temporarily relieve symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection in children aged < 2 years. However, during 2004 – 2005, an estimated 1, 519 children aged < 2 years were treated in U. S. emergency departments for adverse events, including overdoses, associated with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications. * In response to reports of infant deaths after such events, CDC and the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) investigated deaths in U. S. infants aged < 12 months associated with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications. This report describes {{the results of that}} investigation, which identified deaths of three infants aged < 6 months in 2005, for which <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications were determined by medical examiners or coroners to be the underlying cause. The dosages at which <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications can cause illness or death in children aged < 2 years are not known. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved dosing recommendations for clinicians prescribing <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications do not exist for this age group. Because of the risks for toxicity, absence of dosing recommendations, and limited published evidence of effectiveness of these medications in children aged < 2 years, parents and other caregivers should not administer <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications to children in this age group without first consulting health-care provider and should follow the provider’s instructions precisely (1). Clinicians should use caution when prescribing <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medications to children aged < 2 years. Moreover, clinicians should always ask caregivers about their use of over-the-counter combination medications to avoid overdose in children from multiple {{medications that}} contain the same ingredient...|$|R

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies {{indicate}} that chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production are associated with increased mortality and disease progression in COPD subjects. Our objective was to identify features associated with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production in COPD subjects. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of data were obtained in a multicenter (17 university hospitals in France) cohort of COPD patients. The cohort comprised 433 COPD subjects (65 +/- 11 years; FEV(1), 50 +/- 20 % predicted). Subjects with (n = 321) and without (n = 112) chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between groups for age, FEV(1), body mass index, and comorbidities. Subjects with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production had increased total mean numbers of exacerbations per patient per year (2. 20 +/- 2. 20 vs 0. 97 +/- 1. 19, respectively; p < 0. 0001), moderate exacerbations (1. 80 +/- 2. 07 vs 0. 66 +/- 0. 85, respectively; p < 0. 0001), and severe exacerbations requiring hospitalizations (0. 43 +/- 0. 95 vs 0. 22 +/- 0. 56, respectively; p < 0. 02). The total number of exacerbations per patient per year was the only variable independently associated with chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production. Frequent exacerbations (two or more per patient per year) occurred in 55 % vs 22 % of subjects, respectively, with <b>and</b> without chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production (p < 0. 0001). Chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production and decreased FEV(1) were independently {{associated with an increased}} risk of frequent exacerbations and frequent hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> sputum production are associated with frequent COPD exacerbations, including severe exacerbations requiring hospitalizations...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors {{are one of}} {{the first}} drugs of choice for the {{treatment}} of hypertension.

40|$|Background: Despite {{the high}} use of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines, {{little is known}} about Australia's <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines information needs. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify gaps in consumers' perceived knowledge and concerns, to better target consumer medicines information and improve quality use of medicines. Methods: We analysed cough-and-cold related enquiries from consumers who contacted an Australian national medicine call centre between September 2002 and June 2010. Results: Of 5503 <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold calls, female callers made up 86 % of the calls and 33 % were related to children. Questions most frequently related to drug-drug interactions (29 %). An analysis of narratives over an 18 -month period (248 calls) revealed 20 % of the calls concerned potentially clinically relevant interactions, particularly those involving psychotropic agents. Discussion: The potential for interactions with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold medicines purchased OTC is recognised by consumers. Patient information should address their concerns. Doctors should be aware of the common <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> cold interactions and communicate likely clinical symptoms to patients when prescribing medication to prevent potential harm...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND—It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that cough effectiveness can be improved by assisted techniques. The effects of manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation on cough flow physiology are reported in this study.  METHODS—The physiological actions and patient self-assessment of manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation were investigated in 29 subjects (nine normal subjects, eight patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), four subjects with respiratory muscle weakness (RMW) with scoliosis, and eight subjects with RMW without scoliosis).  RESULTS—The peak cough expiratory flow rate <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> expiratory volume were not improved by manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation alone or in combination in normal subjects. The median increase in peak cough expiratory flow in subjects with RMW without scoliosis with manually assisted cough alone or in combination with mechanical insufflation of 84 l/min (95 % confidence interval (CI) 19 to 122) and 144 l/min (95 % CI 14 to 195), respectively, reflects improvement in the expulsive phase of coughing by these techniques. Manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation in combination raised peak expiratory flow rate more than either technique alone in this group. The abnormal chest shape in scoliotic subjects and the fixed inspiratory pressure used made effective manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation difficult in this group and no improvements were found. In patients with COPD manually assisted <b>cough</b> alone <b>and</b> in combination with mechanical insufflation decreased peak expiratory flow rate by 144 l/min (95 % CI 25 to 259) and 135 l/min (95 % CI 30 to 312), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS—Manually assisted <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> mechanical insufflation should be considered to assist expectoration of secretions in patients with RMW without scoliosis but not in those with scoliosis. ...|$|R
