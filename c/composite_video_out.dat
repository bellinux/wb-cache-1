50|$|An Averkey (AVerkey) is {{a device}} that is built by the AVerMedia Group that allows a user to {{simultaneously}} display their computer on a TV. Main components in this device are zoom, pan, and picture positioning. Cables used for this device are VGA in (from PC) and VGA out (to PC monitor) and S-Video (or RCA <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> cable) <b>out</b> (to TV).|$|R
5000|$|Included {{to allow}} {{connection}} with televisions, DVD players, video recorders and video game consoles. They often {{come in two}} 10-pin mini-DIN connector variations, and the VIVO splitter cable generally comes with either 4 connectors (S-Video in and <b>out</b> + <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> in and <b>out),</b> or 6 connectors (S-Video in and out + component PB out + component PR out + component Y out composite out + composite in).|$|R
5000|$|The {{system was}} {{released}} {{as part of}} the Gold package, which includes the [...] "Neo Geo X Station", a replica of the original Neo Geo AES console that functions as a charging/docking station with its own <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out</b> and HDMI output along with a functioning replica of the original Neo Geo AES arcade stick controller.|$|E
5000|$|The {{rear of the}} MediaMVP {{unit has}} a plug for 6 VDC power, an Ethernet port, and in the US edition, S-Video out, <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out,</b> and stereo audio out, while the European edition has instead a single [...] "SCART out" [...] connector, {{offering}} additional RGB output possibilities, and bundles a SCART lead with 2 extra stereo audio cables with female RCA connectors coming {{out of one of}} the plugs.|$|E
50|$|The Digitronix PC (DTX PC) of 1992 is an {{inexpensive}} OEM personal computer {{that can also}} serve as a business capable workstation or a clustered file server. It boasted 100 megabytes of ram, an HDTV monitor and optical disk storage, possibly based on the NeXTcube's magneto-optical drive. It also had built in compatibility with NTSC\PAL formats and had built in <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out,</b> as well as advanced digital audio and video editing capacity on-chip, possibly as coprocessors similar to the Amiga.|$|E
50|$|The first HR-3300 was {{released}} in 1976. These early units used two large rotary knobs for tuning television signals for recording, one for VHF and another for UHF. Separate antenna inputs and pass-throughs were provided for both frequencies, as well <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> in and <b>out</b> via RCA jacks. An electronic timer with four seven-segment displays was located in the lower left of the front panel allowed the user to automatically record programs, one event up to 24 hours in the future. It also included a mechanical three-digit counter, similar to those on audio cassette recorders.|$|R

2500|$|In {{comparison}} to the PSP-2000, the PSP-3000 (marketed in PAL areas as PSP Slim & Lite, or [...] "PSP Brite" [...] (with enhanced screen + built in microphone) [...] and still marketed as PSP in North America and Japan) has an improved LCD screen featuring an increased color range, five times the contrast ratio, half the pixel response time to reduce ghosting and blurring effects, new sub-pixel structure, and anti-reflective technology to improve outdoor playability. The disc tray, logos, and buttons have all been redesigned and the system now has a microphone. In addition, all games may now be output by component or <b>composite</b> using the <b>video</b> <b>out</b> cable.|$|R
50|$|Videoface takes {{signal from}} any video source with <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out</b> capability. It {{produces}} a 256 × 192 pixel 4-bit screen. Scanning speed is just below four frames per second. These screens {{can be saved}} as single pictures or animations with variable speed, and later loaded into any drawing program for editing. During scanning, the contrast of the picture can be adjusted by turning the knob {{on top of the}} Videoface, and the picture can be shifted horizontally and vertically.|$|E
50|$|The Apple Video Adapter was {{specially}} {{designed to allow}} users to connect to S-video or composite video devices. The video adapter cable plugs into the video output port (Mini-VGA) built {{into the back of}} certain Macintosh computers. The video output port supports VGA, S-Video and <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out.</b> The Apple Video Adapter is for S-Video or Composite video output only, use a separate Apple VGA Adapter for VGA video output options. With the Apple Video Adapter you can connect to your TV, VCR, or overhead projector via S-Video or Composite cables.|$|E
50|$|The Multiface One was {{released}} in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum 48K. It cost £29.95 and had the capability of saving data to cassette tape, ZX Microdrive, Opus Discovery (an external 3.5 inch disk drive) or Technology Research Beta (an interface that allowed 5.25 inch and 3.5 inch drives to be connected). The device worked on 128K Spectrums, {{but only if they}} were put in 48K mode. It featured a Kempston joystick port, and later revisions contained a switch that effectively 'hid' the device from software. Early versions had a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out</b> port but this feature was later removed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the AC adapter input on the Commodore VIC-20, 64 and some plus/4 computers, Commodore used DIN connectors {{for a number of}} other purposes on many of their 8-bit computers. The VIC-20 through the Commodore 128 used a 6-pin DIN connector for their [...] "serial" [...] port (used primarily for disk drives and printers). These same machines also used a DIN connector for audio/video, with the VIC-20 and early 64s using a 5-pin DIN for <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> plus audio <b>out,</b> while later revisions of the C64 and the 8-bit machines that followed it used an 8-pin DIN, which supported separated chroma/luma (like S-Video). The TED family of Commodore 8-bit computers (the Commodore 116, 16, and plus/4) also used mini-DIN connectors for their cassette and joystick ports, unlike the rest of the Commodore 8-bit computers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> {{connections}} use {{a single}} RCA plug on each end. <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> is standard on all AV receivers {{allowing for the}} switching of video devices such as VHS players, cable boxes, and game consoles. DVD players may be connected via <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> connectors although a higher bandwidth connection is recommended.|$|R
50|$|Natlock is a picture-source {{synchronizing}} system using {{audio tone}} signals {{to describe the}} timing discrepancies between <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signals, whilst Icelock uses digital information conveyed in the vertical blanking interval of a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal.|$|R
50|$|Betacam was {{initially}} introduced as a camera line {{along with a}} video cassette player. The first cameras were the BVP-3, which utilized three saticon tubes, and the BVP1, which used a single tri-stripe Trinicon tube. Both these cameras could be operated standalone, or with their docking companion VTR, the BVV-1 (quickly superseded by the BVV-1A), to form the BVW-1 (BVW-1A) integrated camcorder. Those decks were record-only. The only transport controls on the deck were Eject and Rewind. The docked camera's VTR button started and paused the tape recorder. Later the Betacam SP docking decks had full transport controls (except a Record button) but tapes could not be played back except in the camera's viewfinder in black-and-white only. Sony then {{came out with the}} Play Adapter, a separate portable unit that connected via a multi-pin cable and had a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> <b>out</b> jack for color playback. At first color playback required the studio source deck, the BVW-10, which could not record, only play back. It was primarily designed as a feeder deck for A/B roll edit systems, usually for editing to a one-inch Type C or three-quarter-inch U-matic cassette edit master tape. There was also the BVW-20 field playback deck, which was a portable unit with DC power and a handle, that was used to verify color playback of tapes in the field. Unlike the BVW-10, it did not have a built in Time Base Corrector, or TBC.|$|E
50|$|Sync on composite, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with composite sync, is commonly used on devices that output both <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> and RGB over SCART. The RGB signal is used for color information, while the <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal is only used to extract the sync information. This is generally an inferior sync method, as this often causes checkerboards to appear on an image, but the image quality is still much sharper than standalone <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b>|$|R
50|$|Older {{professional}} mixers {{worked with}} <b>composite</b> <b>video,</b> analog signal inputs. There {{are still a}} number of consumer <b>video</b> switchers with <b>composite</b> <b>video,</b> S-Video or even FireWire available. These are often used for VJing, presentations, and small multi-camera productions.|$|R
50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> and audio.|$|R
50|$|Television {{auxiliary}} <b>video</b> inputs: <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> vs. S-video. <b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> inputs {{had more}} widespread support since {{they used the}} ubiquitous RCA connector previously used only with audio devices, but S-video used a 4-pin DIN connector exclusively for the video bus.|$|R
50|$|<b>Composite</b> <b>video</b> and RF (channel 3/channel 4) F-connectors {{were two}} ways of {{connecting}} entertainment devices to television sets. This {{was not so much}} of a format as the RF option was an adaptation necessary for plugging in such devices on television sets that did not come equipped with a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> input. RF was a noticeably inferior substitute. The competition between options mainly manifested itself as competition between television set manufacturers and their individual models that offered <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} specification defined pin 16 as a {{high frequency}} (up to 3 MHz) signal that blanked the <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b> The RGB inputs were always active and the signal 'punches holes' in the <b>composite</b> <b>video.</b> This {{could be used to}} overlay subtitles from an external Teletext decoder.|$|R
5000|$|D-2 is a {{professional}} digital videocassette format created by Ampex and introduced at the 1988 [...] NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) convention as a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> alternative to the component video D-1 format. It garnered Ampex a technical Emmy in 1989. Like D-1, D-2 stores uncompressed digital video on a tape cassette; however, it stores a <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> signal, rather than component video as with D-1. While component video is superior for advanced editing, especially when chroma key effects are used, <b>composite</b> <b>video</b> is more compatible with most existing analog facilities.|$|R
