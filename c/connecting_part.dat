5000|$|On 5 April 2009, the ice bridge <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> of the {{ice shelf}} to Charcot Island collapsed. [...] The break {{occurred}} at the thinnest point in the 40 km bridge {{and was the first}} in any of the sections that connect it to the mainland. While only a section has broken away, some scientists predicted that another large section of the Wilkins Ice Shelf was only days away from completely breaking off. The shelf remains connected to Latady Island, although it has been stated that this connection [...] "looks set to collapse" [...] as well. [...] The breakaway is seen as firm evidence of the ongoing effects of warming. Temperatures in this region of Antarctica have risen by 2.5 degrees Celsius since the 1950s. Some scientists believe that the collapse of the weakened ice was triggered by increased wave action due to the current relative absence of sea ice, however, a prominent glaciologist, Doug MacAyeal, has said the trigger for the original break-up in March 2008 was likely the much longer wavelengths of ocean swells created by distant storms.|$|E

40|$|International audienceMachine {{condition}} monitoring and fault diagnosis of rotating machinery {{are very important}} because of the wide use of rotating machinery in industry. Couplings and gears are used in many mechanical sys tems to connect elements and transmit power. The system is usually modeled as a single degree of free dom system with a piecewise linear spring property, where the mass of main machine is only considered. In the present study, the dynamic behavior of a system with an unsymmetrical nonlinearity and a signif icant mass of the <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> was investigated both experimentally and by numerical simulation. In the experiment, a 1 / 3 sub harmonic oscillation was observed, but this oscillation was {{not found in the}} simulation using a single degree of freedom system, in which the mass of the <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> was ignored. However, when a two degrees of freedom system was used that considered both the mass of the <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> and the impact property, the 1 / 3 sub harmonic oscillation was observed. Thus it is recognized that an adequate mathematical model for diagnosis in the early stage of abnormality must be {{selected on the basis of}} the mass ratio between the <b>connecting</b> <b>part</b> and the main body...|$|E
