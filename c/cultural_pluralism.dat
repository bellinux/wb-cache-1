5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism,</b> had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School. Eisenberg then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts in New York. When he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger. His work in the film prevented Eisenberg from enrolling at New York University. Instead, Eisenberg would go on to study anthropology and contemporary architecture at The New School in Greenwich Village, where he majored in liberal arts, with a concentration in democracy and <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Bangkok's population are of Thai ethnicity, although {{details on the}} city's ethnic make-up are unavailable, as the national census does not document race. Bangkok's <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism</b> {{dates back to the}} early days of its foundation; several ethnic communities were formed by immigrants and forced settlers including the Khmer, Northern Thai, Lao, Vietnamese, Tavoyan, Mon and Malay. Most prominent were the Chinese, who played major roles in the city's trade and became the {{majority of}} Bangkok's population—estimates include up to three-fourths in 1828 and almost half in the 1950s. However, Chinese immigration was restricted from the 1930s and effectively ceased after the Chinese Revolution in 1949. Their prominence subsequently declined as most of younger generations of Thai Chinese have integrated and adopted a Thai identity. Bangkok is still nevertheless home to a large Chinese community, with the greatest concentration in Yaowarat, Bangkok's Chinatown. The majority (91 percent) of the city's population is Buddhist. Other religions include Islam (4.7%), Christianity (2.0%), Hinduism (0.5%), Sikhism (0.1%) and Confucianism (0.1%).|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh {{is noted}} for <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism</b> within a Bengali Muslim majority. Traditional Bengali secularism {{has been an}} {{important}} contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The Bengali language is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The Bengali Language Movement sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced socialism under a secular parliamentary system. Military coups ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the free market and promoted moderate Islamism. In 1988, Islam was made the state religion. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of separation of mosque and state in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion. The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities. Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a peace treaty in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect adivasi land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of Bangalee as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.|$|E
40|$|By {{examining}} the pluralistic {{nature of the}} psychiatric domain in Bengal, India, the paper critically analyzes the concept of medical pluralism. Three varieties of pluralism are identified: the social institutional pluralism of the diverse specialists, the <b>cultural</b> cognitive <b>pluralism</b> of the client's conceptual frameworks, and the pluralism resulting from the divergent perspectives of clients and specialists. The paper argues that all three forms of pluralism can be better understood if pluralism is conceptualized in terms of actors' structuring activities and thus as an emergent product of social interaction. ...|$|R

500|$|Polyethnicity divides nations, {{complicating the}} {{politics}} as {{local and national}} governments attempt to satisfy all ethnic groups. Many politicians in countries attempt to find the balance between ethnic identities within their country and {{the identity of the}} nation as a whole. Nationalism also plays a large part in these political debates, as <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism</b> and consociationalism are the democratic alternatives to nationalism for the polyethnic state. The idea of nationalism being social instead of ethnic entails a variety of culture, a shared sense of identity and a community not based on descent. Culturally plural states vary constitutionally between a decentralized and unitary state (such as Great Britain) and a federal state (such as Belgium, Switzerland, or Canada). Ethnic parties in these polyethnic regions are not anti-state but instead seek maximum power within this state. Many polyethnic countries face this dilemma with their policy decisions. The following nations and regions are just a few specific examples of this dilemma and its effects: ...|$|E

Her work with Belafonte in the 1960s {{has been described as}} creating the genre of world music before the concept entered the popular imagination, and also as highlighting the diversity and <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism</b> within African music. Within South Africa, Makeba has been described as influencing artists such as kwaito musician Thandiswa Mazwai and her band Bongo Maffin, whose track [...] "De Makeba" [...] was a modified version of Makeba's [...] "Pata Pata", and one of several tribute recordings released after her return to South Africa. South African jazz musician Simphiwe Dana has been described as [...] "the new Miriam Makeba". South African singer Lira has frequently been compared with Makeba, particularly for her performance of [...] "Pata Pata" [...] during the opening ceremony of the 2010 Football World Cup. A year later, Kidjo dedicated her concert in New York to Makeba, as a musician who had [...] "paved the way for her success".

The 1978 Ann Arbor Black English Trial-the King decision depended heavily upon the testimony given by sociolinguists in support of the plaintiffs, who argued that they had been denied an equal educational opportunity. The King decision exemplifies a problematic and unresolved conflict between linguistic research as a descriptive enterprise and applications of linguistic research which, by and large, implement assimilationkt language policy.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a series of}} empirical tests of two influential theoretical perspectives on the industrialization and modernization of polyethnic societies. On the one hand, the functionalist perspective predicts that <b>cultural</b> diversity and <b>pluralism</b> will decline, that group inequalities will decrease, and that communal conflict should become less likely over time. The communal competition perspective, on the other hand, predicts that <b>cultural</b> diversity and <b>pluralism</b> will not necessarily wither away, that group inequalities will not inevitably be reduced, and that communal conflict is a possibility {{at any point in}} time. Hypotheses derived from these two perspectives are tested using survey data on French-English relations drawn from the 1970 - 71 Quebec Social Movements Study. Part of the thesis is an update and replication of the benchmark study of Roseborough and Breton (1971). The study provides an examination {{of the structure of the}} belief system of a segmented society, and contributes to a systematic assessment of the relative utility of the two theoretical perspectives for an understanding of social change in plural societies...|$|R

2500|$|Prior to the 1930s, {{the study}} of folk music was {{primarily}} the province of scholars and collectors. [...] The 1930s saw the beginnings of larger scale themes, commonalities, themes and linkages in folk music developing in the populace and practitioners as well, often related to the Great Depression. [...] Regionalism and <b>cultural</b> <b>pluralism</b> grew as influences and themes. [...] During this time folk music began to become enmeshed with political and social activism themes and movements. Two related developments were the U.S. Communist Party's interest in folk music {{as a way to}} reach and influence Americans, and politically active prominent folk musicians and scholars seeing communism as a possible better system, through the lens of the Great Depression. Woody Guthrie exemplifies songwriters and artists with such an outlook.|$|E
