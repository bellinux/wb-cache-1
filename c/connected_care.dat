30|$|However, {{as stated}} in the European Council’s {{conclusions}} on Health in the Digital Society [4], new opportunities are arising from big data and improved data analytics capabilities, yet barriers to scaling up the potential in digital health and <b>connected</b> <b>care</b> still need to be overcome. These include the dominance of data silos, lack of interoperability and of common standards for measuring clinical and patient reported outcomes, and limited access and use of large databases for research and innovation purposes. Moreover, a lack of funding and financial incentives exists, which together with market fragmentation in the EU and across the spectrum of services further impedes innovation. Progress in implementing data-driven digital solutions in healthcare requires rigorous validation and testing of new solutions’ clinical effectiveness.|$|E

Many elderly people live in nursing homes, with varying care needs. A substantial proportion of these people will need help with their hearing aids and other hearing devices. Objective: The objective of the study has been to assess the knowledge, experience, skills, competence, and need for information of staff at nursing homes in relation to residents’ hearing loss and hearing aids. Materials and methods: One hundred and ninety-five employees at seven nursing homes participated in the study. The main approach was a descriptive study, using questionnaires. Results: The main findings are that 73 % of informants found that many residents need help with their hearing aids. Only one-tenth report that they know enough about the residents’ hearing aids. Almost four out of five informants find that the residents become socially isolated as a result of hearing loss. Seventy-eight percent agree to some extent that more residents would benefit from hearing aids. Conclusion: Staff at nursing homes have insufficient knowledge about hearing loss and hearing aids. Increased focus on the elderly with hearing impairment in nursing homes is needed. Contact between nursing homes and audiological specialists should be improved to best follow-up hearing loss and hearing aids.

40|$|Background Grosvenor Management Consulting (Grosvenor) {{was engaged}} by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) {{to conduct an}} {{evaluation}} of the Living Well Dying Well (LWDW) pilot program and the Cradle Coast <b>Connected</b> <b>Care</b> Electronic Health Record (4 CEHR) system. The aim of the LWDW and 4 CEHR pilot was to: 	implement person-centred advance care planning processes within Tasmanian Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs) 	support the advance care planning processes with an electronic health care record which could be communicated between health care settings. Scope The evaluation sought to answer the following six evaluation questions, identified by DHHS:  	Is 4 CEHR consistent with the approach of LWDW? 	Does 4 CEHR have the capacity to support the goals of LWDW in Tasmania? 	How does 4 CEHR interface with the national program to implement a PCEHR? 	What will it take to establish a sustainable LWDW program state-wide in Tasmania? 	Is the LWDW the most appropriate approach to advanced care planning in aged care for application across Tasmania? 	How can Tasmania move beyond trials and establish a state-wide program of coordinated communication for advanced care planning? Outcomes The evaluation made 16 recommendations in relation to the evaluation questions above. Notably, analysis identified the nationally supported Residential Aged Care Palliative Approach (RACPA) as the most appropriate advance care planning approach for Tasmania. The evaluation therefore recommended that DHHS supports RACPA as the advance care planning approach for Tasmanian RACFs. The evaluation also outlined key areas and actions to support the implementation and improvement of advance care planning in Tasmania...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{mentally ill}} are {{vulnerable}} to human rights violations, particularly in Indonesia, where shackling is widespread. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the provision of mental health care in Indonesia, thereby identifying ways to improve care and better support carers. Methods: Grounded theory methods were used. Study participants included health professionals, non-health professionals and individuals living with a mental disorder who were well at the time (n[*]=[*] 49). Data were collected through interviews conducted in 2011 and 2012. Results: The core category of this grounded theory is 'connecting care' a term coined by the authors to describe a model of care that involves health professionals and non-health professionals, such as family members. Four main factors influence care-providers' decision-making: competence, willingness, available resources and compliance with institutional policy. Health professionals are influenced most strongly by institutional policy when deciding whether to accept or shift responsibility to provide care. Non-health professionals base their decisions largely on personal circumstances. Jointly-made decisions can be matched or unmatched. Unmatched decisions can result in forced provision of care, increasing risks of human rights violations. Limitations: Generalization of this grounded theory is difficult as the research was conducted in two provinces of Indonesia. Conclusion: Institutional policy was important in the process of <b>connecting</b> <b>care</b> for the mentally ill in Indonesia and needs to be underpinned by legislation to protect human rights. Implications for nursing and health policy: Strengthening mental health legislation in Indonesia will allow nurses to <b>connect</b> <b>care</b> more effectively...|$|R
