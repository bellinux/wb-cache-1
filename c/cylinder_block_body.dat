50|$|Although {{the chassis}} itself saw few major changes (with its L-head engine and unusual 60-degree <b>cylinder</b> <b>block),</b> the <b>body</b> saw {{significant}} updates. At {{the direction of}} Henry's son Edsel, in 1923 several body styles were introduced, that included two- and three-window, four-door sedans and a phaeton that accommodated four passengers. They also offered a two-passenger roadster and a seven-passenger touring sedan and limousine, which was sold for $5,200. A sedan, limo, cabriolet, and town car were also offered by coachbuilders Fleetwood, Derham and Dietrich, and a second cabriolet was offered by coachbuilder Brunn. Lincoln contracted with dozens of coachbuilders during the 1920s and early 30s to create multiple custom built vehicles, to include American, Anderson, Babcock, Holbrook, Judkins, Lang, LeBaron, Locke, Murray, Towson, and Willoughby in the 1920s. Murphy, Rollston, and Waterhouse were added in the 1930s.|$|R

This research examines the {{discharge flow}} ripple of axial piston pump with conical <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> by developing a comprehensive mathematical model based upon the Bernoulli equation and the continuity equation.

As a result of researching previous studies, not only in Japan but also in other countries, there has been no study identified concerning the Montessori <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> B type being used or not used as a screening test instrument.

The use of carbon-carbon over conventional materials, such as cast iron or aluminum, reduces {{the weight of}} the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> and improves thermal efficiency of the internal combustion reciprocating engine.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The knock sensor is {{provided}} on an engine <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> to detect abnormal engine combustion (knocking) {{and to provide}} feedback to engine control unit (ECU). The ECU then modifies the engine input and avoids knocking. A commonly used knock sensor is an accelerometer that detects cylinder wall vibration and estimates knocking of the engine. Selecting {{the location of a}} knock sensor in many cases involves a challenging trial and error approach that depends upon the measurement of the knock signal at many locations on engine structure. However, a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> exhibits many structural resonances. Thus, a large vibration signal at the surface of <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> can be either due to knocking of the engine or due to the resonances of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> structure because of normal excitation forces. Hence, this conventional method does not always yield reliable results. The aim of the work reported in this paper is to experimentally determine the inherent dynamic characteristics of a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> and to combine this with a calculation of the fundamental knock frequency and, thus, to identify the optimum location for the knock sensor...|$|R

The main objectives {{of this project}} are to predict the fatigue life of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> using strain-life method and to identify the critical locations and to investigate the effect of loading. Aluminum alloys are selected as a <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> materials. The fatigue life predicted utilizing the finite element based fatigue analysis code. The structural model of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> was utilizing the solidworks. The finite element model and analysis were performed utilizing the finite element analysis code. In addition, the fatigue life was predicted using the strain-life approach subjected to variable amplitude loading. TET 10 mesh and maximum principal stress were considered in the linear static stress analysis and the critical location was identifying at node (109730). From the fatigue analysis, Smith-Watson-Topper mean stress correction method was conservative life subjected to SAETRN loading. It is observed that the nitrided treatment and polished surface finish produce the longest life.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an extensive simulation study of power {{loss in the}} lubricating gap between <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> and valve plate. The simulation model used in this investigation covers fluid structure interaction and micro motion of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> resulting from oscillating piston forces. The model calculates pressure and velocity fields generated in the lubricating film as well as leakage, and viscous friction. Details of the model are explained. Using the model, power losses in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> valve plate gap are investigated {{as a function of}} operating condition for three displacement units. It is shown that power losses for low load operating conditions are approximately the same as power loss for high load operating conditions. In order to reduce losses at low loads, a sinusoidal or wavy micro structured surface is applied to the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> surface. The effect of operating parameters that waved surfaces of varying amplitude and frequency have on power loss in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>block</b> valve plate interface when compared to power loss of a standard, ideally smooth sliding surface is studied. As the gap height of the lubricating film represents the most critical parameter relating to pump performance, special attention is given to the relation between gap height, operating parameters, surface design and power loss. It is shown that significant reductions in power loss occur at low pressure operating conditions with the introduction of the waved surface. ...|$|R
