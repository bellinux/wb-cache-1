5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E
5|$|Kleinman {{contacted}} {{a pair of}} Canadian graphic novel {{artists to}} begin the storyboarding process. Storyboarding the commercial meant that the agency <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> {{how much of the}} £1.3M budget to allocate to each section, and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue. The effort paid off and approval was given to move ahead with production.|$|E

5|$|Another claim {{involved}} alien invasion. In December 2010, an article, {{first published}} in examiner.com and later referenced in the English-language edition of Pravda claimed, citing a Second Digitized Sky Survey photograph as evidence, that SETI had detected three large spacecraft due to arrive at Earth in 2012. Astronomer and debunker Phil Plait noted that by using the small-angle formula, one <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> that if the object in the photo were as large as claimed, {{it would have had}} to be closer to Earth than the Moon, which would mean it would already have arrived. In January 2011, Seth Shostak, chief astronomer of SETI, issued a press release debunking the claims.|$|E
5|$|In December 1962, Combat Development Command (CDC) {{drafted a}} Qualitative Material Requirement (QMR) for an interim, {{commercial}} off-the-shelf (COTS) aircraft, with a 140-knot (161mph, 259km/h) cruise speed and a 1,500-pound (680kg) payload. This {{was seen as}} an attempt by Army officials, anticipating the potential of the D-255, to acquire an interim aircraft to fill the escort role until the Army <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> the requirements for a dedicated armed helicopter. However, the Secretary of the Army disapproved the interim approach and directed that the Army look for a more advanced system that would dramatically improve over current helicopter designs.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 2016, the Australian Transport Minister, Darren Chester, {{said that}} a piece of {{aircraft}} debris had been found on Pemba Island, {{off the coast of}} Tanzania. It was handed over to the authorities so that experts from Malaysia <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> whether {{it is part of the}} aircraft. The Australian government released photos of the piece, believed to be an outboard flap from one of the aircraft's wings, on 20 July. On 15 September, Malaysia's transport ministry confirmed that the debris came from the missing aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The Germans quickly {{developed}} {{a series of}} basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar {{at this stage in}} the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the Fernnachtjagd in operations over Britain. Major Kuhlmann, head of the wireless telegraphy interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did Wolfgang Martini's Luftnachrichtentruppe (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the North Sea, and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or Räume (areas). Raum A was Yorkshire, bounded by Hull, Leeds, Lancaster and Newcastle. Raum B covered the Midlands and Lincolnshire whilst Raum C encompassed East Anglia bounded by London Peterborough, Luton and The Wash. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.|$|E

25|$|Jay Forrester was {{an early}} pioneer in cybernetic systems who {{believed}} that brains, cities and even societies live in networks of feedback loops that control them, and he thought computers <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> {{the effects of the}} feedback loops.

25|$|The {{ability of}} O. noveboracense to {{transmit}} microorganisms {{has also been}} researched.

Even though these bacteria were isolated, it is only hypothesized that they may serve as a reservoir host. Further research <b>could</b> <b>determine</b> whether O. noveboracense is able to actually transmit the bacteria present. More succession studies may be able to narrow the time frame at which this beetle is attracted to carrion.|$|E

During the War of the League of Cognac, the Florentines rebelled against the Medici, then represented by Ippolito de' Medici, and restored the freedom of their republic.
