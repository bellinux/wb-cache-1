5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the hydrogen bomb project into a matter of a security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa {{retired from}} {{political}} life after his resignation. The scandal over the labor flexibility law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker, Mario Pontaquarto, {{claimed to be}} a witness of the case who delivered $5,000,000 to the legislators. De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared of <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> a unanimous resolution, and Pontaquarto was removed from the witness protection program.|$|E

5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said almost nothing until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} {{during a}} game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA, with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge. The referee of the game took no action against Shearer, and he was then cleared of all <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the FA, with Lennon giving evidence in the player's defence. Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly, who brought the charges against the player, later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer.|$|E
5|$|Brussels {{also has}} better {{transport}} links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the city of Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy died down when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby {{called for}} volunteers {{to serve in}} the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was {{commissioned}} as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a white flag {{in the midst of the}} British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{is shown}} {{working in an}} office {{building}} for a box company.

He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the hour to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with her is up.|$|E

Cody's agent, Peter Schaffer, denied his client's guilt and said that Cody's dog died of worms {{and that there was}} no animal cruelty. The investigating veterinarian said the dog was neglected and starved to death.|$|E
5|$|Stephen found {{fault with}} Symeon {{especially}} for his charismatic approach, and {{his support of}} individual direct experience of God's grace. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, {{without the need for}} formal ordination—as practiced by his own teacher, Symeon the Studite. Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, while Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience. Symeon's teachings, especially those regarding the direct experience of God's grace, brought accusations of heresy from Stephen. Symeon responded to Stephen's <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> declaring that the real heresy was to teach {{that it is impossible to}} have direct experience of God (Disc. 29.4).|$|E

In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by Inge Bongo.

5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, who were still adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full <b>charges.</b> <b>By</b> then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then set them in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all <b>charges.</b> <b>By</b> that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E

5|$|On 12 May 2006, several players, {{including}} Buffon, {{were accused}} of participating in illegal betting on Serie A matches. Buffon voluntarily co-operated, allowing himself to be interrogated by Turin magistrates. While admitting that he did place bets on sporting matches (until regulations {{went into effect in}} late 2005, banning players from doing so), he vehemently denied placing wagers on Italian football matches. Despite concerns that he had jeopardised his chance of playing for Italy in the 2006 World Cup, he was officially named Italy's starting goalkeeper on 15 May and helped Italy to win their fourth title. Buffon was cleared of all <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on 27 June 2007. Following Juventus's punishment in the Calciopoli scandal, in which their two most recent Serie A titles were stripped and the squad were relegated to Serie B and penalized with a point deduction, rumours spread that Buffon would be placed on the transfer market. Buffon elected to remain with Juventus, despite the team's relegation, a decision which made him extremely popular with the Juventus fans.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of the fort, the Hessian right, {{commanded}} by Johann Rall, moved up the steep hillside south of Spuyten Duyvil Creek against almost no resistance from the Americans. The Hessians began to bring up their artillery. At this point, the main body of Hessians, 4,000 men, under Knyphausen began to advance down the Post Road, which ran between Laurel Hill and the hill Rall was on. The Hessians crossed swampy land and when they approached the wooded hillside near the fort, they were fired upon by 250 riflemen of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment under the command of Lt. Col. Moses Rawlings. Rawlings' men hid behind rocks and trees and darted from place to place to shoot at the Hessians as they tried to advance through the fallen trees and rocks. The first and second <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> the Hessians were repulsed by Rawlings' riflemen.|$|E
5|$|With A Company {{providing}} fire support, B Company assaulted {{the position}} at 15:35 with artillery, air strikes and armour in support. From the outset the lead elements came under constant Viet Cong sniper {{fire from the}} trees, and from machine-guns that had not previously been detected by the Australians. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties as the Viet Cong resisted strongly, withstanding multiple frontal assaults, including bayonet <b>charges</b> <b>by</b> two separate platoons. Surrounded and receiving fire from all sides, the lead Australian elements from B Company could advance no further against a determined and well dug-in force, and all attempts to regain momentum were unable to dislodge the defenders. Initially the Australians had used their APCs to secure the landing zone at the jungle's edge, however with the infantry in trouble they were subsequently dispatched as a relief force. Fighting their way forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most badly wounded as darkness approached. The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, yet both were repulsed by the Australians. During the fighting one of the APCs was subsequently disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver.|$|E
