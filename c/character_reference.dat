25|$|XML (and hence XHTML) defines an &apos; {{character}} {{entity reference}} for the ASCII typewriter apostrophe. No equivalent entity {{is defined in}} the HTML 4 standard, despite all the other predefined character entities from XML being defined in HTML. If it cannot be entered literally in HTML, a numeric <b>character</b> <b>reference</b> could be used instead, such as &#x27; or &#39;. &apos; is officially supported in HTML since HTML 5.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Ryan {{appeared}} {{in court for}} passing bad cheques in Dandenong. He was given a bond. His next appearance in court was after he issued {{a large number of}} forged cheques in Warrnambool. His partner was caught with the goods purchased with the bad cheques and handed Ryan over to the police. He received another good-behaviour bond after the arresting detective gave a favourable <b>character</b> <b>reference</b> on Ryan's behalf.|$|E
25|$|Hardy was {{released}} on licence in August 1919 upon successfully petitioning Lord French. His ticket of leave was signed by Ian Macpherson and allowed him to move freely as he wished, although he was mandated to report to a police station {{at least once a}} month. He maintained a good character and caused the police no trouble even, he claims, becoming the editor of several religious publications in London. Piaras Béaslaí's papers contain a <b>character</b> <b>reference</b> from the Christian Herald of London which seems to verify this assertion. They contain a letter from the Dean of Westminster to Hardy concerning a job on the staff of Westminster Abbey for which Hardy had unsuccessfully applied.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to native character encodings, characters {{can also be}} encoded as <b>character</b> <b>references,</b> which can be numeric <b>character</b> <b>references</b> (decimal or hexadecimal) or <b>character</b> entity <b>references.</b> <b>Character</b> entity <b>references</b> are also {{sometimes referred to as}} named entities, or HTML entities for HTML. HTML's usage of <b>character</b> <b>references</b> derives from SGML.|$|R
50|$|In {{the initial}} {{versions}} of SGML and HTML, numeric <b>character</b> <b>references</b> were interpreted {{in relationship to}} the document character encoding, rather than Unicode. For Latin-script documents, numeric <b>character</b> <b>references</b> to <b>characters</b> between x80 and x9F in those documents will not be correct against Unicode, and must be recoded. HTML standards prior to HTML 4 only supported Western Latin script documents: the treatment of <b>character</b> <b>references</b> above #7F may vary between applications and national conventions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Character</b> <b>references</b> {{that are}} based on the <b>referenced</b> <b>character's</b> UCS or Unicode code point are called numeric <b>character</b> <b>references.</b> In HTML 4 and in all {{versions}} of XHTML and XML, the code point can be expressed either as a decimal (base 10) number or as a hexadecimal (base 16) number.

500|$|On July 10, 2008, the {{swastika}} CJK unicode character (...) {{appeared at}} the top of Google's Hot Trends list—a tally of the most popular search terms in the United States—for several hours.
