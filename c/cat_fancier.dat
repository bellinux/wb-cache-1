5|$|A {{pedigreed cat}} is one whose ancestry is {{recorded}} by a <b>cat</b> <b>fancier</b> organization. A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals {{of the same}} breed. Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats. Cats of unrecorded, mixed ancestry {{are referred to as}} domestic short-haired or domestic long-haired cats, by coat type, or commonly as random-bred, moggies (chiefly British), or (using terms borrowed from dog breeding) mongrels or mutt-cats.|$|E
500|$|In 1938 {{the first}} {{organisation}} {{devoted to the}} breed, the Norwegian Forest Cat Club, was formed in Oslo, Norway. [...] The club's movement to preserve the breed was interrupted by World War II. Owing to cross-breeding with free-ranging domestic cats during the war, the Norwegian Forest cat became endangered and nearly extinct until the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed make a comeback by developing an official breeding program. Since the cat did not leave Norway until the 1970s, it was not registered as a breed in the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe), the pan-European federation of cat registries, until Carl-Fredrik Nordane, a Norwegian <b>cat</b> <b>fancier,</b> took notice of the breed, and made efforts to register it. The breed was registered in Europe by the 1970s, and in the American Cat Fanciers Association in 1994. In 1978, it was recognized in Sweden, and in 1989, they were accepted as a breed in the United Kingdom by the Norwegian Cat Club of Britain.|$|E
500|$|The Norwegian Forest cat ( [...] or [...] ) is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat originating in Northern Europe. This natural breed {{is adapted to}} a very cold climate, with top coat of glossy, long, water-shedding hairs and a woolly undercoat for insulation. Although this is uncertain, the breed's ancestors {{may have been a}} landrace of short-haired cats brought to Norway by the Vikings around 1000 AD, who may also have brought with them long-haired cats, like those ancestral to the modern Siberian and Turkish Angora breeds. During World War II, the breed became nearly extinct until efforts by the Norwegian Forest Cat Club helped the breed by creating an official breeding program. It was registered as a breed with the European Fédération Internationale Féline in the 1970s, when a local <b>cat</b> <b>fancier,</b> Carl-Fredrik Nordane, took notice of the breed and made efforts to register it. Currently, the Norwegian Forest breed is very popular in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and France.|$|E

50|$|The Kashmir type of cat is not {{recognized}} {{as its own}} breed by many <b>cat</b> <b>fancier</b> and breeder organizations, being usually more of a label of a coat type: semi-long-haired to long-haired, and grey or brown.

50|$|In 1885, {{the writer}} Gaston Percheron {{suggested}} the lop-eared cat {{might be a}} hybrid between the cat and a marten. In 1926, <b>cat</b> <b>fancier</b> Lilian J.

Percheron's description changed the lop-eared cat from a cosetted pet fed on delicacies to an animal consumed as a delicacy and this, along with the erroneous use of the sumxu name, was also perpetuated by later authors.|$|E
5000|$|The breed is in {{the first}} stages of {{recognition}} with the two major <b>cat</b> <b>fancy</b> organizations in the UK, the Governing Council of the <b>Cat</b> <b>Fancy</b> and Felis Britannica (the UK branch of Fédération Internationale Féline).
