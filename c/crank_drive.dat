2500|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, Frenchmen Pierre Michaux and Pierre Lallement took bicycle design {{in a new}} {{direction}} by adding a mechanical <b>crank</b> <b>drive</b> with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the velocipede). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman Thomas McCall in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by Eugène Meyer of Paris. The French vélocipède, made of iron and wood, developed into the [...] "penny-farthing" [...] (historically known as an [...] "ordinary bicycle", a retronym, since there was then no other kind). It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor weight distribution. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the Coventry Machinists Company), brought a Michaux cycle to Coventry, England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner James Starley, used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.|$|E

40|$|The single-mass, crank-and-rod exciters {{vibrational}} conveyers have a trough {{supported on}} elastic stands which are rigidly {{fastened to the}} trough and a supporting frame. The trough is oscillated by a common <b>crank</b> <b>drive.</b> This vibration causes the load to move forward and upward. The moving loads jump periodically and move forward with relatively small vibration. The movement is strictly related to vibrational parameters. This is applicable in laboratory conditions in the industry which accommodate a few grams of loads, up to those that accommodate tons of loading capacity. In this study I explore the transitional behavior across resonance, during the starting of a single degree of freedom vibratory system excited by crank-and-rod. A loaded vibratory conveyor is more safe to start than an empty one. Vibrational conveyers with cubic nonlinear spring and ideal vibration exciter have been analyzed analytically for primary and secondary resonance by the Method of Multiple Scales, and numerically.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the electrical and the thermodynamic losses in hermetic compressors, mechanical losses have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the compressor. In the present paper the friction losses in the journal bearings of a hermetic reciprocating compressor are investigated using numerical methods. A dynamic model is set up to solve the Reynolds equation using a finite volume approach to calculate the pressure field in each journal bearing. The calculation of the fluid film thickness is accomplished with the formulas of the parallel gap. The resulting hydrodynamic forces are equated with forces obtained by a dynamic multibody model of the compressor <b>crank</b> <b>drive</b> to calculate the transient orbit movement of the bearing. Based on the movement of the crankshaft at steady-state conditions, the shear stresses in the gap between crankshaft and housing can be calculated. Thus the cycle averaged friction power loss can be determined. To consider effect such as surface roughness of the bearings or possible contacts between the solids, correlations found in the literature are implemented. The present method is used to assess the friction power loss of the journal bearings during the operation with different oil viscosities. The simulated data is verified with simple analytical friction loss calculations based on shear stresses in the Couette flow between bearing and housing...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} herein described {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} performance characteristics of the oscillating vane-type fan. The fan was the invention of Mr. Van Dorn and Mr. Cornwell, primarily for use in circulating air in railroad refrigerator cars. In the present system of railroad refrigeration for the transportation of perishable foodstuffs, the refrigerator car is a heat insulated car, with bunkers at each end for the cakes of ice. When the car is loaded and the doors shut, cooling is obtained only due to the natural circulation of air in the car, caused by the difference in temperature between the ice in the bunker and the fruit. This circulation has not been found sufficient, in {{that there is a}} large temperature difference between the top and bottom fruit (see Appendix B) and the top half is too warm, often spoiling during transportation. Also, because of this, the car cannot be filled to its volumetric capacity. Therefore the requirements which led to the invention of this type of fan were as follows: 1. To provide a sufficient volume of air, against the resistance developed in passing through the fruit, to obtain the cooling characteristics required. 2. To provide a fan which would not require major changes in the structural design of the car, or lessen the amount of fruit which could be carried. 3. To provide a fan, simple in construction and installation, and in its drive mechanism from the car axle. The oscillating vane-type fan met conditions 2 and 3 in that it could be situated in the four and one half inch space between the floor racks and the floor of the car, through which the air naturally circulated, and in that it could be driven by a simple wheel and <b>crank</b> <b>drive</b> directly off the axle. This thesis presents the results of the investigation of the first condition. ...|$|E

Although you could simply reverse a normal set of crank arms, {{the left side}} and right side {{specific}} pedal bosses would be reversed, causing them to tend to come loose and spin out with normal riding.

25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum.

During acceleration, the pedal <b>crank</b> <b>drives</b> the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can <b>drive</b> the pedal <b>cranks.</b> This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks.

50|$|In {{steam engines}} and {{internal}} combustion engines, valves {{are required to}} allow the entry and exit of gases at the correct times in the piston's cycle.

Early designs used the D slide valve but this has been largely superseded by Piston valve or Poppet valve designs.

5000|$|The Bridgestone Picnica (Japanese: Burijisuton Pikunika: ブリヂストン 「ピクニカ」) line of {{collapsible}} bikes, {{some models}} featuring belt-drives, {{were introduced in}} the early 1980s and carried in the Bridgestone Cycle USA catalogs from 1985 through 1990. It weighs 29 pounds, and belt-drive models use a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increases belt tension with increasing load. In April 1987, Popular Mechanics described Bridgestone's Beltrex system as follows: [...] "Unlike the belt-drive motorcycles, which can slide the rear wheel back to keep the belt taut, the Beltrex uses a floating pulley that's cogged to the drive gear. Tension on the pedal <b>cranks</b> <b>drives</b> the floating pulley forward, taking up belt slack and preventing tooth slippage."The Picnica is a folding bicycle, {{and part of the}} appeal of the belt drive is cleanliness. It is a small wheel bicycle, so belt tension may be less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels.|$|R

Much simplified was the suspension which consisted of Belleville washers. These were simply bolted on to the chassis and could be easily removed for repair or replacement. This suspension system was later used on the Swiss Panzer 61.
