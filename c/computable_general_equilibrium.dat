As illustrations, public policies are calculated to rationalize, {{with respect to the}} stochastic neoclassical growth model, capital market behavior since WWII and labor market behavior 1929 - 50. One conclusion is that capital taxation drives a wedge between consumption growth and the expected pre-tax capital return, in the direction and amount predicted by the theory, and that capital taxation is the major intertemporal distortion in the postwar capital market. Second, a good theory of the Great Depression labor market must explain why measured MRS and MPL diverged so dramatically 1929 - 33 and why the wedge persisted.

Due to the fragile ecosystem, and harsh climates that are experienced by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the region has become vulnerable {{to a wide variety of}} ecosystem and climate change issues. Aside from the climate affecting the area severely, its dependence on hydrocarbons, also makes it vulnerable to climate changes. There are climate change policies adopted by the GCC region for prosperous future and sustainability. These include, policies to affect impacts of energy and carbon intensities, response measures being adopted for climate change, the mitigation potentials of the region, along with the suitability of the markets to harness potentials. This analysis focuses on utilizing Marginal Abatement Cost curves, along with econometric techniques that will assess the emissions of Green House Gases (GHGs), the potential for mitigation in the GCC region, and <b>computable</b> <b>general</b> <b>equilibriums</b> that invest the impacts of measures, exploring suitability of instruments that can help to harness the potential mitigation measures for the region. Main policy insights that can be concluded based on the analysis is the role that incentives play to help promote energy efficient mechanics, while reducing emissions of carbon emissions within the region, contributions made to climate policies for air quality, along with the roles that green tax reforms play to help improve the economics of welfare, while pursuing carbon policies for the domestic areas in the region. Globally, there are a lot of energy efficiency policies. The GCC has been witnessing a phenomenal amount of growth when it comes to meeting the needs of domestic households. The region is facing extreme demographic pressure, and as a result has decided to accelerate energy intensive drives. The requirements that the GCC has to meet is causing trade-offs and challenging implications regarding allocation and development of hydrocarbon resources to adhere to domestic and export demands. In conclusion, four issues that have arisen within the GCC in relations to climate change policies have been addressed in this paper. These issues include the rising amounts of energy and carbon intensities, the impacts that the response measures that are being implemented by developed countries have on developing countries, as well as the mitigation potentials that exist within the region, as a method to harness the potentials that are available. Energy efficiency is believed to be a primary candidate to deal with the challenges the GCC is facing. Detailed assessments regarding energy efficiency for the GCC economies is addressed, along with how these intensities relate to outside world economies.

40|$|Assessing the {{importance}} of borrowing constraints for college entry is key for education policy analysis in the U. S. economy. I present a <b>computable</b> dynamic <b>general</b> <b>equilibrium</b> model with overlapping generations and incomplete markets that allows me to measure the fraction of households constrained in their college entry decision. College education is financed by family transfers and public subsidies, where transfers are generated through altruism on part of the parents. Parents face a trade-off between making transfers to their children and own savings. Ceteris paribus, parents who expect lower future earnings transfer less and save more. Data from the 1986 Survey of Consumer Finances give support to this mechanism. I show that this trade-off leads to substantially higher estimates of the fraction of constrained households compared to the results in the empirical literature (18 instead of 8 percent). The model also predicts that an increment in parents' earnings uncertainty decreases their willingness to provide transfers. In combination with rising returns to education, which makes college going more attractive, this boosts the number of constrained youths and explains why family income has become more important for college access over the last decades in the U. S. economy. College Enrolment, Borrowing Constraints,Parental Transfers, Household Savings, Dynamic <b>General</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> Models...|$|R

The indirect construction of a technical coefficients matrix essentially removes secondary activities from industries, and this procedure may create negative input coefficients.

30|$|The Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) has {{constructed}} or overseen {{the construction}} of a number of impact and forecasting models for the Chicago metropolitan area, which encompasses Cook, Dupage, Kane, Lake, McHenry and Will counties. One such model, CREIM, is based on an initial formulation of Conway (1990, 1991), which was developed further by Israilevich et al. (1997). CREIM integrates econometric and input–output components, enabling impact analysis to be conducted as well as annual forecasts made for a 30 -year horizon for up to 45 different NAICS-based 3 industrial sectors (production, employment and income) and several major economic aggregates (such as gross regional product, wage rates, unemployment). CREIM is a <b>computable</b> regional <b>general</b> <b>equilibrium</b> model based on Marshallian equilibrium of outputs (see Takayama 1985). The model combines traditional input–output analysis with time-series analysis. The input–output component in this model enables a detailed analysis of purchases and sales between industries, while the time-series component allows for the analysis of intertemporal change in the transaction flows of goods and services. Together, these two components yield a detailed analysis of structural change over time at the sectoral level. By taking into account transaction flows between industries, CREIM is able to yield estimates of the spillover or indirect effects within the economy that direct analysis cannot capture because it examines each sector irrespective of its effect on other sectors.|$|R

One alternative to auction quotas is a system of tariff-rate quotas, which are designed to keep supplier countries welfare equal to that in free trade. We calculate that the tariff-rate quotas could raise $ 067 - 1. 55 billion in revenue for the U. S.

This study uses a <b>Computable</b> Dynamic <b>General</b> <b>Equilibrium</b> setting {{based on}} Brock’s (1979, 1982) intertemporal growth and asset pricing models and applies this framework as a formal test {{to study the}} out-of-sample forecast performance of Bollerslev’s (1986) GARCH (1, 1) Classical Historical Volatility forecasts. The solution to Brock’s growth model reflects the utility maximizing behavior of the consumer and profit maximizing behavior of producers, and is a framework that has recorded some remarkable successes in mirroring the real economy. All existing studies have used a sample realized variance in the forecast horizon to test the out-of- sample performance of conditional variance forecasting models. The realized variance is simply an approximation to the true distribution of variance in the forecast horizon, and is often an unfair benchmark of performance. Simulation of Brock’s model enables one to obtain the true distribution of asset returns and their variance at all times. The true distribution reflects all the possible states of a simulated economy, which is shown to mimic all the properties observed in empirical financial data. This framework affords the luxury of comparing the out-of-sample forecasts from various models with the true variance in the forecast horizon. The results jointly demonstrate that the GARCH (1, 1) model performs significantly better than the Classical Historical Volatility when the true variance is used as the forecast comparison benchmark. It is concluded {{that the use of}} realized variance for out-of-sample performance is highly misleading, especially for short-run forecasts. Yiğitbaşıoğlu, Ali BoraM. S...|$|R

A few robust findings emerge from the econometric literature: (1) more disaggregate analyses find higher elasticities, (2) long-run estimates are higher than short-run estimates, and (3) time series analyses generally find lower elasticities relative to cross-sectional studies.
