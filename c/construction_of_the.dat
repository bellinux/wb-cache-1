5|$|<b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first phase, the A Station, {{began in}} March 1929. The main {{building}} work {{was carried out}} by John Mowlem & Co, and the structural steelwork erection carried out by Sir William Arrol & Co. Other contractors were employed for specialist tasks. Most of the electrical equipment, including the steam turbine turbo generators, was produced by Metropolitan-Vickers in Trafford Park, Manchester. The building of the steel frame began in October 1930. Once completed, the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brick cladding began, in March 1931. Until the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> B Station, the eastern wall of the boiler house was clad in corrugated metal sheeting as a temporary enclosure. The A Station first generated electricity in 1933, but was not completed until 1935. The total cost of its construction was £2,141,550. Between construction beginning in 1929 and 1933, there were six fatal and 121 non-fatal accidents on the site.|$|E
