50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century <b>Chinese</b> <b>banana</b> farmers used Aborigines as labourers in the Tully River region.

Superintendent John Martin Kenny started the necessary work on 1 September 1914. There was no mission in the religious sense. The settlement had characteristics of a penal settlement.|$|E
50|$|Ensete lasiocarpum, {{commonly}} known as <b>Chinese</b> dwarf <b>banana,</b> golden lotus <b>banana</b> or <b>Chinese</b> yellow <b>banana,</b> is a plant of the Ensete genus. It is thus a close relative of bananas, and {{also a member of}} the Musaceae family. The plant is native to the Yunnan province in China, where it grows high in the mountains up to an altitude of 2500 m. It is known for its yellow erect flower (see image), generally appearing during the second year of cultivation, that can last a few months. Just before opening, the flower resembles a lotus - from which the plant gets one of its names.|$|R

50|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>banana</b> farmers {{had been}} {{clearing}} and farming along the Tully River {{from the early}} twentieth century but settlement {{in the vicinity of the}} township of Tully began in 1906 when James Savage selected land on Banyan Creek. The upper Banyan lands were opened for selection in 1912 and the area expanded rapidly after 1924 when the Tully Sugar Mill was erected and the railway extended to the area.|$|E

He went on to direct a range of genres from drama to action movies, comedies, horror and satire, in both English and <b>Chinese.</b> <b>Banana</b> Cop (1984) was the story of a British-Chinese policeman who returns to Hong Kong to seek help with a case, was the genesis for his first British film Ping Pong (1986), made for UK's Channel 4, the first English feature film set in Sohos Chinatown.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chinese</b> <b>banana</b> growers {{along the}} Tully River were {{numerous}} after 1900. They cleared garden plots and grew bananas that they sent to southern markets, loading {{them from their}} sampans onto the lighters which took the fruit out to the coastal steamer waiting at the river mouth. The Chinese employed Aboriginal labourers and opium addiction became a problem. Other problems arose from the inevitable conflict resulting from white settlers moving into the traditional hunting territories of the Aboriginal people. The Queensland Government proposed to establish the Hull River Aboriginal Settlement on high ground {{at the north end}} of what is now South Mission Beach to combat the opium and other problems. Superintendent John Martin Kenny arrived on 1 September 1914 and commenced organising the clearing and building of three large houses on the hillside overlooking the beach ...|$|E

5000|$|Chinawal {{village and}} Jalgaon {{district}} {{are known for}} banana production, but this wasn't always the case. The 16th century Ain-i-Akbari written by Abul Fazl discusses {{the economy of the}} Khandesh region in detail, but does not mention banana cultivation It is not known with certainty when banana cultivation started in the Jalgaon district, but the Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency (Vol II, Book IV, Part II, Page 176) written in 1880 made the following observation regarding banana cultivation in the Khandesh: [...] The Plantain, kel, Musa paradisiaca, is widely grown wherever water is plentiful and easily raised. There are two tolerably distinct kinds, the ray kel and the common kel. The ray kel is like the <b>Chinese</b> <b>banana.</b> The fruit, though thinner skinned and somewhat better flavoured than the common plantain, is less suitable for cooking, and being a light cropper and wanting much water, is but sparingly cultivated. The common three-cornered plantain, the taperi of Gujarat, the monde of Madras, and the gulur bale of Mysor, is easily grown and yields freely. [...] During the British period, Chinawal village was known for handloom weaving and quality cloth production, not for banana production. Page 229 of the British gazette made the following observation: [...] The chief hand-woven cloth goods are ... floor cloths, cotton sheets, stamped dirty-red coverlets, smaller sheets and cushions, from Nandurbar, Shahada, Varsi, Betavad, Sindkheda, Chopda, Jalgaon, Jamner, Faizpur, and Chinaval.|$|E
40|$|Land-based {{production}} provides societies with indispensable goods such as food, feed, fibre, and energy. Yet, {{with economic}} globalisation and global population growth, {{the environmental and}} social trade-offs of their production are ever more complex. This is particularly so since land use changes are increasingly embedded in networks of long-distance flows of, e. g., material, energy, and information. The resulting scientific and governance challenge is captured in the emerging telecoupling framework addressing socioeconomic and environmental interactions and feedbacks between distal human-environment systems. Understanding telecouplings, however, entails a number of fundamental analytical problems. When dealing with global connectivity, a central question is how and where to draw system boundaries between coupled systems. In this article, we explore the analytical implications of setting system boundaries {{in the study of}} a recent telecoupled land use change: the expansion of <b>Chinese</b> <b>banana</b> plantation investments in Luang Namtha Province, Laos. Based on empirical material from fieldwork in Laos in 2014 and 2015, and drawing on key concepts from the ‘systems thinking’ literature, we illustrate how treating the system and its boundaries as epistemological constructs enable us to capture the differentiated involvement of actors, as well as the socio-economic and environmental effects of this land use change. In discussing our results, the need for more explicit attention to the trade-offs and implications of scale and boundary choices when defining systems is emphasised...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{scholarly}} {{debate around}} ‘global land grabbing’ is advancing theoretically, methodologically and empirically. This study contributes to these ongoing efforts by investigating {{a set of}} ‘small-scale land acquisitions’ {{in the context of}} a recent boom in banana plantation investments in Luang Namtha Province, Laos. In relation to the actors, scales and processes involved, the banana acquisitions differ from the state-granted large-scale land acquisitions dominating the literature on ‘land grabbing’ in Laos. Starting from the experience of a rural village in Laos, where two <b>Chinese</b> <b>banana</b> investors leased land on six-year contracts in 2010, we trace the strategies employed by the investors to gain access to the land, the experience of the villagers in the process and the outcome of the acquisitions in terms of land use change. The findings reveal how the investors established networks of local middlemen who facilitate negotiations over land directly at the village level, thus enabling them to circumvent any formal involvement of government authorities. The informal acquisition process also ensured a rapid and successful implementation of the plantations with consequent land use change, including the destruction of field structures, plot borders and irrigation systems, as well as erosion and heavy chemical input. Drawing upon the literature on ‘powers of exclusion’ and ‘control grabbing’, the paper argues that despite the apparent small-scale and short-term nature of these leases, the forceful acquisition strategies pursued by the investors coupled with the rapid land use conversion and associated cultivation practices results in strong and longer-term alienation of land from the local communities involved. This implies the need to take these more informal forms of land acquisitions into account when designing policies to address the negative implications of land grabbing in Laos and elsewhere...|$|E
