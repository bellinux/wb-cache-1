25|$|After {{slavery was}} phased out by 1888, many former slaves {{had little choice}} but to stay on the farms on which they had been prisoners for years. The {{plantation}} owners adapted to the situation by incorporating wage labour, tenantry and <b>contract</b> <b>farming.</b> After gaining their freedom, some more fortunate ex-slaves were sold small plots of land where they could build a house and plant crops for their own consumption and for sale at market. According to the Spanish Civil Code, rights of possession were paramount, making a signed and verified agreement very important. In 1890, however, a new civil code (which had been introduced in Spain the year before) came into effect which acknowledged the rights of prescription (squatter’s rights). Granted, these rights were minimally recognized, but still they motivated many landless workers to occupy and cultivate previously unused land.|$|E
2500|$|Farming {{contracts}} are agreements between a farmer and a buyer that stipulates what the farmer will grow {{and how much}} they will grow usually in return for guaranteed purchase of the product or financial support in purchase of inputs (e.g. feed for livestock growers). [...] In most instances of <b>contract</b> <b>farming,</b> the farm is family owned while the buyer is a larger corporation. This makes it difficult to distinguish the contract farmers from [...] "corporate farms," [...] because they are family farms but with significant corporate influence. [...] This subtle distinction left a loop-hole in many state laws that prohibited corporate farming, effectively allowing corporations to farm in these states as long as they contracted with local farm owners.|$|E

The Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) in Tokyo has conducted a series of case studies in selected Asian countries to assess the conditions for benefits to be achieved by marginal rice farmers. In Lao PDR, the research suggested that contracted farmers earned significantly higher profits than non-contracted farmers. This facilitated the transition of subsistence farmers to commercial agriculture, offering potential to reduce rural poverty. A study in Cambodia on organic rice for export assessed the effect of <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> on farmers’ performance. This suggested that younger and more educated farmers with larger families and fewer assets were more likely to join the contract. However, farmers with access to good road communications often left the contract, indicating that <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> had helped them to develop into independent farmers.|$|E

40|$|A complex {{deterministic}} approach (ZPLAN) {{was used}} to optimize the breeding programs for beef breeds. For the model population 1, 000 beef cows and 60, 000 dual purpose Simmental cows for crossbreeding were assumed. The percentage of AI was 25 % within the beef breed and 93 % within the Simmental cows. Domestic AI beef bulls were used for crossbreeding only. The total merit index included beef traits (birth weight, 200 -day-weight direct and maternal, 365 -day-weight, daily gain, dressing percentage, EUROP grading score) and functional traits (calving ease, stillbirth, fertility and functional longevity). The proportion of foreign proven and domestic AI bulls was varied {{as well as the}} number of bulls tested on stations and on <b>contract</b> <b>farms.</b> Annual monetary genetic gain and discounted profit were used to evaluate alternative breeding strategies. Extending the number of bulls tested on stations and establishing performance testing of natural service bulls on <b>contract</b> <b>farms</b> increased the annual monetary genetic gain and the discounted profit, especially when domestic AI bulls were also used in the beef cattle breeding population...|$|R
30|$|The current {{literature}} on fresh vegetable supply chain contains several examples of successful implementations which {{are focused on}} the maximisation of the total revenue for the grower. For instance, see Ahumada and Villalobos (2009 b).

5000|$|<b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> {{has been}} used for {{agricultural}} production for decades but its popularity appears to have been increasing in recent years. The use of contracts has become attractive to many farmers because the arrangement can offer both an assured market and access to production support. <b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> is also of interest to buyers, who seek supplies of products for sale further along the value chain or for processing. Processors constitute the main users of contracts, as the guaranteed supply enables them to maximise utilization of their processing capacity. Contracts with farmers can also reduce risk from disease or weather and facilitate certification, which is being increasingly demanded by advanced markets. There are also potential benefits for national economies as <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> leads to economies of scale, which, as Collier and Dercon argue, are [...] "bound to provide for a more dynamic agricultural sector.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> {{involves}} {{agricultural production}} {{being carried out}} {{on the basis of}} an agreement between the buyer and farm producers. Sometimes it involves the buyer specifying the quality required and the price, with the farmer agreeing to deliver at a future date. More commonly, however, contracts outline conditions for the production of farm products and for their delivery to the buyer’s premises. The farmer undertakes to supply agreed quantities of a crop or livestock product, based on the quality standards and delivery requirements of the purchaser. In return, the buyer, usually a company, agrees to buy the product, often at a price that is established in advance. The company often also agrees to support the farmer through, e.g., supplying inputs, assisting with land preparation, providing production advice and transporting produce to its premises. The term [...] "outgrower scheme" [...] is sometimes used synonymously with <b>contract</b> <b>farming,</b> most commonly in Eastern and Southern Africa. <b>Contract</b> <b>farming</b> can be used for many agricultural products, although in developing countries it is less common for staple crops such as rice and maize.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> {{must first}} and {{foremost}} {{be considered as a}} commercial proposition, it has also come to be viewed as an effective approach to help solve many of the market access and input supply problems faced by small farmers. A guide published by GIZ in 2013 seeks to advise on ways in which <b>contract</b> <b>farming</b> can be developed to maximise such benefits for smallholders in developing countries. Effective linkages between companies and thousands of farmers often require the involvement of formal farmer associations or cooperatives or, at least, informal farmer groups. However, empirical evidence of the best way of achieving this is not yet available.|$|E
