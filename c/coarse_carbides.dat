40|$|Abstract. Effects of high {{magnetic}} fields (HMF) up to 19. 81 T on pearlite phase transformation are studied by {{examination of the}} microstructures of a Fe- 0. 47 C- 2. 3 Si- 3. 2 Mn (wt %) alloy partially isothermally processed above the eutectoid temperature. The results show that granular pearlite (GP) can be obtained at earlier transformation stages. The evolution of the granular pearlite is always accompanied by the formation of lamellar pearlite. TEM analysis reveals the existence of sub-grain boundaries within GP colonies and indicates that the nucleation of ferrite matrix in GP belongs to multiple nucleation mechanism.

40|$|Abstract — Cobalt-based alloys {{are known}} for their {{excellent}} wear resistance, particularly under high temperature and corrosive environments. However the cast cobalt-based alloys have relatively high brittleness, and low toughness, due to their <b>coarse</b> <b>carbide</b> structure. This paper aims to comprehend if carbide refinement, caused by changing the processing route from sand casting to powder consolidated Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing), can improve the tribo-mechanical properties of cobalt-based alloys. The alloy selected for this investigation had a nominal wt. % composition of Co- 30 Cr- 14 W- 1 C, which is similar to the composition of the commercially available Stellite® 4 alloy. The Hot Isostatic Pressed (HIPed) alloy had a much finer microstructure than the cast alloy, which showed a typical hypoeutectic dendritic microstructure. Both alloys had similar hardness. Although the cast alloy showed slightly better abrasive and sliding wear resistance than the HIPed alloy due to their <b>coarser</b> eutectic <b>carbides,</b> the HIPed alloy had a significant advantage on the impact toughness and contact fatigue performance. The results of this comparative investigation indicated that the HIPed alloy had an attractive combination of tribo-mechanical properties, i. e. improved impact and fatigue resistance, whilst preserving the high hardness and good wear resistance associated with the cast alloy, making it suitable for relatively higher stress applications...|$|R

A thermal processing cycle consisted of quenching the ribbon in liquid nitrogen, tempering at 600 C for 10 sec, 'upquenching' to 750 C for 10 sec, and subsequently quenching again in liquid nitrogen. The heat-treatment resulted in martensite grains with sizes of about 1 micron or less in both length and thickness and cementite particles of 0. 4 micron or less.

40|$|Presented in {{this study}} are the {{variations}} of microstructures and mechanical properties with tempering and Post-Weld Heat Treatment (PWHT) conditions for SA 508 Gr. 4 N steel used as Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) material. The blocks of model alloy were austenitized at the conventional temperature of 880 °C, then tempered and post-weld heat treated at four different conditions. The hardness and yield strength decrease with increased tempering and PWHT temperatures, but impact toughness is significantly improved, especially in the specimens tempered at 630 °C. The sample tempered at 630 °C with PWHT at 610 °C shows optimum mechanical properties in hardness, strength, and toughness, excluding only the transition property in the low temperature region. The microstructural observation and quantitative analysis of carbide size distribution show that the variations of mechanical properties are caused by the under-tempering and carbide coarsening which occurred during the heat treatment process. The introduction of PWHT results in the deterioration of the ductile-brittle transition property by an increase of <b>coarse</b> <b>carbides</b> controlling cleavage initiation, especially in the tempered state at 630 °C...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} carbide {{precipitates}} {{with a size}} range of 30 – 300 nm on the austenite to martensite transformation has been studied. Such particles are known to enhance shape memory, {{and it was the}} aim of this work to clarify how the particles exert a favourable effect on shape memory. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the presence of particles increases the amount of thermally induced martensite. X-ray diffraction showed that the presence of particles increases the amount of stress-induced martensite also. Surface-relief produced on a pre-polished surface by bending deformation showed that the particle-containing samples exhibited a more complex and highly tilted surface-relief indicative of the formation of a larger volume fraction of martensite. The reversion characteristics of the particle-containing and solution-treated samples were similar: both showed co-reversion of multiple variants of martensite within the same volume of microstructure. However, a higher volume fraction of martensite reverted for the particle-containing sample on recovery annealing. The increased density of nucleation sites for martensite formation and a higher volume fraction of stress-induced martensite for a given strain are therefore considered to be the main contributions of relatively <b>coarse</b> <b>carbide</b> particles to the improvement of shape memory performance. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{aluminides}} {{have been}} of interest for about 60 years because of their good high temperature strengths (below 600 {degrees}C) and excellent oxidation and sulfidation resistance, {{as well as their}} relatively low cost and conservation of strategic elements. These advantageous properties have driven the development of iron aluminides as potential structural materials. However, the industrial application of iron aluminides has been inhibited because of a sharp reduction in strength at temperatures higher than 600 {degrees}C and low ductility at ambient temperatures due to hydrogen embrittlement. Oak Ridge National Laboratory has shown in recent years that room temperature properties of alloys containing 28 % Al (all compositions are in atomic percent unless otherwise noted) can be improved through thermomechanical processing and alloying. Iron aluminides must have good weldability {{if they are to be}} used as structural materials. A coarse fusion zone microstructure is formed when iron aluminides are welded, increasing their susceptibility to cold cracking in water vapor.

In this paper, the disc-to-disc tests of the material with 4 % Cr and that with 4 % Cr + Ti were carried out respectively under the conditions of dry contact and emulsion lubricant of 3. 9 % Quakerol N 680 - 2 -DPD. The wear and friction patterns were discussed by correlating the disc surface morphologies and the microstructures of both materials. The surface roughness of the disk of the material with 4 % Cr + Ti deteriorates much slower than that with 4 % Cr under the condition of lubrication. The material with 4 % Cr + Ti is characterised as carbonitrades precipitated in a fine tempered martensite matrix while <b>coarse</b> <b>carbides</b> (M 7 C 3) exist in the material with 4 % Cr. The disk of the material with 4 % Cr + Ti wears differently to that with 4 % Cr. Delamination may become an important wear mechanism earlier in the case of 4 % Cr than that of 4 % Cr + Ti. Micro spalling and pitting occur after 120 min of wear in the case of 4 % Cr, but not in the case of 4 % Cr + Ti until 330 min. Detached carbides are responsible for the abrasive wear on both discs at the late stage. Ti alters the friction pattern due to surface regeneration that resulted from the abrasive effect of carbonitrades. Generally, the wear-resistance of roll material may be improved by 175 % by introducing added Ti. The outcome is beneficial for developing new materials for prolonging the service life of the cold work roll...|$|E
40|$|Contrary to {{interstitial}} free (IF) steel grades, {{low carbon}} steels exhibit dynamic strain ageing during warm rolling {{due to the}} presence of solute carbon. This leads to the reduced formation of grains containing in-grain shear bands and a weak but desirable { 111 } recrystallisation texture on annealing, when compared to IF steels. Addition of Cr leads to carbon depletion in the ferrite matrix as a result of Cr carbide formation. The warm rolling schedule could also {{have an effect on the}} amount of carbides and grains containing in-grain shear bands formed. In this work extra low carbon steel alloyed with 0. 78 wt%Cr was subjected to two different warm rolling schedules: (i) rolling to 65 % reduction at 913 K and (ii) rolling to 80 % reduction at 853 K. The microstructure was characterised using optical metallography, transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and bulk texture analysis. The results have shown that increase in the severity of deformation resulted in a very slight increase in the number of grains containing in-grain shear bands. The intensity of ND-fibre, which comprises of grains withaxes parallel to the normal direction (ND), was slightly higher in the steel warm rolled at 853 K than at 913 K. In both steels several types of carbides were formed, such as Cr 3 C 2, Cr 23 C 6 and Cr 19 Fe 4 C 6. The density of fine strain-induced carbides in the steel after 80 % reduction was by order of magnitude higher than after warm rolling to 65 % reduction.

40|$|Weld {{simulations}} {{have been}} conducted on a C 90 quenched tempered steel used in offshore riser systems, in order to investigate the possibility of introducing an effective solid state weld procedure. As a secondary objective, the microstructure of the HAZ of a TIG welding is to be evaluated. The C 90 is as steel of high hardenability and its base microstructure consists of tempered martensite with a Vickers hardness of 239 HV 10. The main focus in this work has been to sufficiently soften the weld as well as obtaining impact toughness properties within requirements, by implying a {{post weld heat treatment}} procedure. Hardness values cannot exceed 270 HV 10 and impact toughness energy must exhibit an average value above 40 J. Steel samples have been heated to a peak temperature of 1150 ˚C, followed by controlled cooling at 10 and 60 ˚C/s, prior to post weld heat treatment. Tempering at temperatures of 680 and 720 ˚C has been conducted on the post quenched structure for up to three hours and has been performed in an air circulating furnace and in a Smitweld Thermal Cycle apparatus. Low tempering times (up to 1200 s) have been performed in the Smitweld apparatus. Weld hardness and impact toughness requirements was met after three hours of post weld heat treatment at 720 ˚C in an air circulating furnace, producing a hardness value of 253 HV 10 and a Charpy-V energy of 66 J for the parallel quenched at 10 ˚C/s. After some tempering of the structure, the two cooling rates used did not affect hardness values significantly. Tempering at 680 ˚C did not soften the structure sufficiently to meet the criteria, with the lowest measured hardness of 315 HV 10 after three hours. The hardness of the intercrictial zone of the weld was reduced to 246 HV 10 after tempering for three hours at 720 ˚C. Tempering in the Smitweld apparatus softened the structure more efficiently than what was observed in the furnace, producing hardness values of 271 HV 10 after only twenty minutes of tempering at 720 ˚C. It has been suggested that due to substantially higher heating rates obtained by the Smitweld apparatus, low temperature tempering mechanisms may be inhibited or delayed, resulting in a post tempered structure consisting of <b>coarse</b> <b>carbides</b> with large inter particle spacing, contributing little to precipitation hardening. Heating rates obtained by Smitweld is in the same range as those obtainable by the SAG-FW procedure, and the two methods are therefore considered comparable.

40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} the tribo-mechanical {{properties}} and structure–property re-lationships of a wear resistant cobalt-based alloy produced via two different manufac-turing routes, namely sand casting and powder consolidation by hot isostatic pressing (HIPing). The alloy had a nominal wt % composition of Co– 33 Cr– 17. 5 W– 2. 5 C, {{which is similar to}} the composition of commercially available Stellite 20 alloy. The high tungsten and carbon contents provide resistance to severe abrasive and sliding wear. However, the <b>coarse</b> <b>carbide</b> structure of the cast alloy also gives rise to brittleness. Hence this re-search was conducted to comprehend if the carbide refinement and corresponding changes in the microstructure, caused by changing the processing route to HIPing, could provide additional merits in the tribo-mechanical performance of this alloy. The HIPed alloy possessed a much finer microstructure than the cast alloy. Both alloys had similar hardness, but the impact resistance of the HIPed alloy was an order of magnitude higher than the cast counterpart. Despite similar abrasive and sliding wear resistance of both alloys, their main wear mechanisms were different due to their different carbide mor-phologies. Brittle fracture of the carbides and ploughing of the matrix were the main wear mechanisms for the cast alloy, whereas ploughing and carbide pullout were the dominant wear mechanisms for the HIPed alloy. The HIPed alloy showed significant improvement in contact fatigue performance, indicating its superior impact and fatigue resistance without compromising the hardness and sliding/abrasive wear resistance, which makes it suitable for relatively higher stress applications.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve our understanding of the evolution and tribological behaviour of work roll surfaces in cold rolling because surface deterioration affects the quality of products and the efficiency of production. The cost of rolls is almost 25 % of the cost of cold steel production. An experimental Lateral Set-testing (LST) mini-mill was developed to make use of the Gleeble 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator functions to evaluate, for the first time, the roll material surface features, surface roughness, fast Fourier transform (FFT) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) of frequency distribution, after single and multi-pass rolling. A low carbon-steel was prepared for the paired disc and then experiments on disc-to-disc wear were carried out to test surface deterioration and friction. In the laboratory, material imitating an industrial roll was manufactured. One batch contained 4 %Cr and another contained 4 %Cr plus approximately 0. 1 % Ti. These materials were compared against each other in the LST and disc-to-disc experiments. Experiments considered a series of parameters, including strip reduction, speed, and lubrication, while the disc-to-disc experiments considered duration of wear, forward and backward slip and load amplitude. The surfaces of the LST roller and disc were evaluated by surface technologies such as Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and surface profile-meters. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and X-ray diffraction wear properties. Test results from the mini-mill reveal that dominant waviness of the surface roughness still exists on the surface after a single pass of rolling and a 30. 5 % reduction is a critical reduction level that has a significant influence on the density of power spectrum. A rougher work piece results in a larger power spectrum of the surface profile. It has found that the PSD altitude of the roller surface is significantly affected axially but is more sensitive to its original surface roughness circumferentially. It is distributed in an inverse order to the surface roughness in a high frequency domain. The addition of Ti alters surface deterioration. Lubrication has a significant effect on surfaces containing either 4 Cr% or 4 %Cr+Ti, affecting surface roughness of rollers containing 4 %Cr more significantly. In the disc-to-disc tests, more material was removed in the first 60 minutes from the disc containing Ti than the disc containing only 4 %Cr. In general, roll material with 4 %Cr+Ti reveals to have better anti-abrasive properties than the roll with only 4 %Cr, while lubrication significantly reduced the wear rate and amount of material removed from both materials. The speed of the disc influences the weight loss, ie, the higher the speed the greater the amount of material removed. The slip rate also affects roll wear and weight loss because as the speed increases, so do the slip and loss of weight. The coefficients of friction are between 0. 35 ~ 0. 75 when the contact was dry and 0. 06 ~ 0. 11 when lubrication was applied. Adhesive friction dominated the dry contact while a mixed lubrication regime features friction behaviour when emulsion lubrication was applied. A backward slip of 2 % and a forward slip of 1. 5 % resulted in a different coefficient of friction in dry contact mode although the corresponding torques were similar. The torque and coefficient of friction are found to increase with disc speed in dry contact condition. Lubrication alters the friction of both materials. The coefficient of friction decreases with speed on the disc with added Ti but the effect of load is in the opposite trend, while the disc with 4 %Cr was less influenced by speed. The coefficient of friction is more sensitive to load at higher speeds on the disc with 4 %Cr than at slower speeds on the disc with Ti added. This indicates that the addition of Ti enhances the tribological behaviour of rollers because the disc with Ti additive is characterised by carbonitrades precipitated in a refined tempered martensitic matrix. <b>Coarse</b> <b>carbides</b> characterise the 4 %Cr disc materials. Surface defects of the work rolls, including banding, spalling, marking and welding in a cold strip plant, were investigated. It was found that early failures principally resulted from operational factors and roll material off-specification micro-structure defects rather than wear. It is recommended that different grades materials of the roll and strip with different roughness and hardness to be tested and studied on the evolution and tribological behaviour of roll surfaces in the future...|$|E

The 0. 16 %Al steel had a similar strength to the 0. 02 %Al containing steel∼ 300 MPa, but better impact behaviour (30 - 40 °C lower 54 J, ITT) with an impact transition temperature (ITT) of − 90 °C which from previous work will be due to a refinement of the grain boundary carbides.

Five teeth were prepared with wet 60 -grit and 600 -grit SiC papers. After restoration with Clearfil SE Bond, microtensile beans (0. 8 mm(2)) were prepared and tested after 24 hours in a universal testing machine (0. 5 mm/minute). An additional two teeth for each DPM were prepared for SEM evaluation of the smear layer superficial aspects. The BS values were submitted to one-way ANOVA, considering only the DPM (flat surfaces) and two-way ANOVA (C-Factor x DPM, considering only burs) with p= 0. 05. Although the DPM in the flat surfaces was not significant, the standard deviations of carbide bur-prepared specimens were markedly lower. The BS was significantly lower in cavities. The fine carbide bur presented the most favorable smear layer aspect.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} melt {{treatment}} on the microstructure and creep-rupture behavior of M 963 superalloy at 1248 K under 225 MPa has been investigated. The microstructure of the as-cast superalloy without melt treatment consists of solid solution matrix, precipitate, <b>coarse</b> blocky MC <b>carbide</b> and () eutectic. The striking difference in microstructure {{is that the}} melt treatment changes the MC <b>carbide</b> from the <b>coarse</b> blocky morphology into the fine script-like morphology. After heat-treated at 1483 K for 4 h followed by air-cooling, both the creep life and rupture elongation of the melt-treated alloy are all doubled those of the alloy without melt treatment. The mechanism of the melt treatment on the creep-rupture behavior of the M 963 superalloy is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Experimental {{program and}} {{preparation}} technology of highly densified reaction bonded silicon carbide resistance materials with different resistivity were investigated by using alumina or silicon nitride as aids for improving {{of the volume}} resistivity. The microstructure of the materials was observed by scanning electron microscope. According to the experimental results, the resistivity of the material could be controlled by the particle size {{and the content of}} the aids. Besides, alumina could reduce silicon penetration and increase resistivity greatly, and 10 wt. % of alumina could satisfy the requirement of resistance. In addition, different particle size of matrix materials had a great impact on the resistivity. Compared with the <b>coarse</b> silicon <b>carbide,</b> the room temperature resistivity value by using the fine silicon carbide could increases for six times. Introductions At present, the manufacturing level of silicon carbide (SiC ） heating element restricts the expansion of its applications, and low endurance of products also speeds up the replacement frequency of SiC, increases the waste of resources and production costs. The most direct and effective way to improve the performance of SiC heating elements is to improve the density of the green body. Highl...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{stressed}} metal forming tools require surface layers with high resistance to abrasive wear, impact and thermoshock. A new, useful technique for producing protection layers for complex load conditions is laser cladding with carbide reinforced hard alloys. In the present work, powder mixtures of WC/Co agglomerated carbide and WC/W 2 C melt carbide, {{combined with a}} self fluxing Ni-alloy, are clad onto tool steels. By using optimised process parameters, a repeatable composite coating free of pores, cracks and with low iron dissolution can be reached. The typical structure shows a homogeneous distribution of <b>coarse,</b> non-melted <b>carbide</b> particles within the metallic matrix alloy. The carbide content is up to 50 volume percent. Large-scale investigations on the wear behaviour show that the wear resistance of laser clad coatings comes close to that of classical, sintered hard metal WC/Co. In contrast to sintered hard metal, these coatings have a higher toughness, which provides good perform ance also under conditions including fatigue or impact. The layers are characterised by a strong metallurgical bonding to the substrate. Examples of forming dies, laser clad with carbide containing composites, are shown in the paper...|$|R
40|$|Different {{abrasive}} wear tests {{have been applied}} to materials with hardnesses ranging from 80 HV (aluminium) to 1700 HV (tungsten carbide). The tests were: dry sand rubber wheel (DSRbrW); a similar test using a steel wheel (DSStlW); a new combined impact-abrasion test (FIA). The DSRbrW results were as expected, giving generally decreasing wear with increasing hardness. White cast irons and tool steels containing <b>coarse,</b> hard <b>carbide</b> particles performed better than more homogeneous materials of comparable hardness. When normalized to load and distance, the DSStlW results for the homogeneous materials were similar to the DSRbrW results. The multi-phase materials performed poorly in the DSStIW test, with volume loss for high-speed steel (880 HV) {{higher than that of}} aluminium. Within this group, wear increased with increasing hardness. These unexpected results are explained in terms of (a) differential friction coefficients of wheel and specimen, (b) increased fracture of sand, and (c) introduction of microfracture wear mechanisms. The FIA combined impact-abrasion results lacked clear correlations with hardness. The span of relative wear rates was similar to that reported for materials in ball mills. White cast irons at maximum hardness performed fairly poorly and showed evidence of microfracture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a specific kind of failure in ethylene pyrolysis furnace tubes. It considers {{the case in}} which the tubes made of 35 Cr- 45 Ni-Nb high temperature alloy failed to carburization, causing creep damage. The investigation found that used tubes became difficult to weld repair due to internal carburized layers of the tube. The microstructure and geochemical component of crystallized carbide at grain boundary of tube specimens were characterized by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with back-scattered electrons mode (BSE), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Micro-hardness tests was performed to determine the hardness of the matrix and the compounds of new and used tube material. The testing result indicated that used tubes exhibited a higher hardness and higher degree of carburization compared to those of new tubes. The microstructure of used tubes also revealed <b>coarse</b> chromium <b>carbide</b> precipitation and a continuous carbide lattice at austenite grain boundaries. However, thermal heat treatment applied for developing tube weld repair could result in dissolving or breaking up chromium carbide with a decrease in hardness value. This procedure is recommended to improve the weldability of the 35 Cr- 45 Ni-Nb used tubes alloy...|$|R
40|$|CoCrWC alloys {{are widely}} used to protect {{components}} that operate under wear and high temperature environments. Enhanced performance has been achieved with the CoCrMoSi alloys but processing this alloy system is still a challenge due {{to the presence of}} the brittle Laves phase, particularly when welding is involved. This work evaluated Plasma Transferred Arc coatings processed with the Co-based alloy CoMoCrSi - Tribaloy T 400, reinforced with Laves phase, comparing its weldability to the CoCrWC - Stellite 6, reinforced with carbides. Coatings were also analyzed regarding the response to temperature exposure at 600 °C for 7 days and subsequent effect on microstructure and sliding abrasive wear. Coatings characterization was carried out by light and scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Vickers hardness. CoCrWC coatings exhibited a Cobalt solid solution dendritic microstructure and a thin interdendritic region with eutectic carbides, while CoCrMoSi deposits exhibit a large lamellar eutectic region of Laves phase and Cobalt solid solution and a small fraction of primary Laves phase. Although phase stability was observed by X-ray diffraction, coarsening of the microstructure occurred for both alloys. CoCrMoSi showed thicker lamellar Laves phase and CoCrWC <b>coarser</b> eutectic <b>carbides.</b> Coatings stability assessed by wear tests revealed that although the wear rate of the as-deposited CoCrMoSi alloy was lower than that of CoCrWC alloy its increase after temperature exposure was more significant, 22 % against 15 %. Results were discussed regarding the protection of industrial components in particular, bearings in 55 AlZn hot dip galvanizing components...|$|R
40|$|The {{fracture}} of a camshaft made of chilled cast iron, {{installed in a}} home-made Fukang car, happened only after running over a distance of 6, 200 km. The fractured camshaft was received to conduct a series of failure analyses using visual inspection, SEM observation of fracture section, microstructure analysis, chemical composition analysis and hardness examination and so on, while those of CKD camshaft made by Citroën Company in France was also simultaneously analyzed to compare the difference between them. The {{results showed that the}} {{fracture of}} the camshaft mainly results from white section in macrostructure and Ledeburite in microstructure; the crack in the fractured camshaft should be recognized to initiate at the boundary of <b>coarser</b> needle-like <b>carbide</b> and matrix, and then propagate through the transverse section. At the same time, the casting defects such as dendritic shrinkage, accumulated inclusion and initiated crack and abnormal external force might stimulate the fracture of camshaft as well. Based on failure analysis, some measures have been employed, and as a result, the fracture of home-made camshafts has been effectively prevented. Key words: camshaft; car; chilled cast iron; fracture; Ledeburite Camshaft {{is one of the key}} parts or components in the engines of automobile and other vehicles.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop a new {{application}} of cast iron, high niobium cast iron has been developed as a grain refiner for stainless steel. High niobium cast iron was prepared by adding pure niobium to a commercial cast iron. <b>Coarse</b> primary niobium <b>carbide</b> crystals were observed in the microstructure of the cast iron. The effect of the high niobium cast iron as an inoculant on the grain size of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels was examined in various experimental conditions. When the amount of the cast iron inoculant more than 3 mass% was added into the steel melt, fine equiaxed grains were observed and grain size was significantly reduced to 210 μm. The results indicate that the high niobium cast iron is effective as a grain refiner for the austenitic and ferritic stainless steels. From the dissolution rate measurement, the grain refining mechanism was proposed. 9 th International Symposium on Science and Processing of Cast Iron, SPCI- 9; Luxor; 10 November 2010 through 13 November 201...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{tries to}} improve the plasma surface W, Mo alloying process by adding inlet methane aside from the original inert gas argon. The carbon and hydrogen particles are incorporated into the ion sputtering, ionization, surface activation and diffusion processes. The W, Mo atoms sputtered from the target diffuse into {{the surface of the}} substrate at the same time with the diffusion of carbon atoms. So the synergism of the alloying process and the carburizing process is established in this way. The hydrogen atoms participate the reduction and activation process {{on the surface of the}} target and the substrate. The surface HSS combines with substrate via metallurgical bonding and the carbides are all secondary carbides formed at lower temperature during solid state diffusion. These carbides are very soluble to the austenite. This makes the alloy elements fully functional. The carbides with granular shape and distributes homogeneously on the matrix are very fine. No <b>coarse</b> ledeburite eutectic <b>carbide</b> exists. After the co-alloying process of W, Mo, C, direct quench or quench at lower temperature can be applied...|$|R
40|$|Studies of 4 Cr 5 MoSiV 1 {{die steel}} suggest that under {{appropriate}} conditions, additions of rare earth (RE) can enhance tensile property. This improvement is apparently {{due to the}} more uniform distribution of carbides and the enhancement of precipitation strengthening after RE additions. In this present work, {{the effect of the}} RE addition on the carbides evolution and tensile property of 4 Cr 5 MoSiV 1 steel with various RE contents (0, 0. 018, 0. 048 and 0. 15 wt %) were systematically investigated. The two-dimensional detection techniques such as optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to investigate the carbides evolution of as-cast, annealed and tempered with RE addition. The results indicated that the carbides in 4 Cr 5 MoSiV 1 steels were modified by adding the suitable amount of RE. The eutectic structure and <b>coarse</b> eutectic <b>carbides</b> were all refining and the morphology of the annealed carbides initiated change from strip shape to ellipsoidal shape compared with the unmodified test steel (0 RE). In addition, the amount of the tempered M 8 C 7 carbides increased initially and then decreased with the alteration of RE addition from 0. 018 to 0. 15 wt %. Notably, the tensile test indicated that the average value of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation rate of 0. 048 RE steel increased slightly to 1474 MPa and 15 %, higher than the 1452 MPa and 12 % for the unmodified test steel (0 RE), respectively. Such an addition of RE (0. 048 wt %) would {{have a significant effect on}} the carbides evolution of as-cast, annealed and tempered and resulting in the tensile property of 4 Cr 5 MoSiV 1 die steel...|$|R
