50|$|There {{are three}} {{designated}} car park spots for nearby bush walks {{close to the}} road {{at the foot of}} the valley as well as room beside the road between the two bridges where two or three cars could feasibly park. There are six hairpin turns in the gorge, the first and last of them are the most gentle, however the three in between are tight. Vehicles with turning circles of 11m or less can make the turn without the need to swing onto the other side of the road. Those drivers that require to use the other side of the road need to do this before the bend when there is no oncoming traffic or wait at the cusp of the bend until there is room for them to do so. Drivers <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>assume</b> they can use both lanes without first confirming safe passage. Inexperienced gorge drivers sometimes do neither of these and can become stuck between oncoming traffic and following vehicles, leading to a traffic jam until someone can reverse. This, coupled with the often narrow road precariously close to the rock beside the road - particularly going up to Galston side means the road has a fairly notorious reputation. Other than the hairpin turns, it is imperative that all vehicles remain within the drawn lines of their lane to prevent head-on accidents. There are, of course, other Sydney roads more difficult for driving than Galston Gorge, but there are fewer places in Sydney where there is such a large flow of cars during peak hour. There is a lack of suitable public transport for residents travelling from the Galston side of the gorge through to Hornsby as buses are too long to negotiate the hairpin turns. Therefore, residents of Sydney's mostly rural expanding north-west are forced to drive through the gorge or take other public transport options which add considerable time to the trip when travelling to North Shore or city business districts.|$|E

40|$|Quantification of {{proteins}} by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) {{has become an}} established field. Many strategies {{have been designed to}} enable relative or absolute protein quantification for both global or targeted studies. The work presented reveals the limitations of the approaches currently employed and suggests solutions to some of the challenges encountered. Methods were developed to that seek to improve current proteomic approaches both in terms of analytical throughput and proteomic coverage. A Quantitative concatamer (QconCAT) was designed to enable the quantification of the RND family of efflux proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A high throughput LC-MS method that enabled quantification of RND proteins within 10 minutes was developed. This approach revealed that biological variation was greater than the subsequent steps in quantification. This approach was then used to successfully quantify RND proteins within clinically isolated strains and compare their expression in biofilm and planktonic cultures. Comparison with AQUA type peptides revealed that Q-peptides <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>assumed</b> to be present in stoichiometric amounts. Quantification of pure recombinant proteins also revealed that recovery of the surrogate peptide <b>can</b> <b>not</b> be <b>assumed.</b> The accuracy of quantification was variable and dependent upon the surrogate peptide used. An emerging non-isotope dilution strategy that makes quantitative measurements across multiple peptides was shown to quantify proteins from both simple and complex mixtures at similar levels to the isotope dilution strategies. When employed to quantify the membrane proteome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa it quantified 1092 proteins across three strains, spanning 3 orders of magnitude.

The article shows that the collision of the project with ?intractability of a living material? which it should be implemented into, creates various plot?s twists and turns, attaching dramatic tension to plot?s development. The author analyzed the meaning of basic plots in solving ?tasks for potential Me?, when a personality sets itself beyond the available semantic field, creating the possibility of its own inner transformation. ?????? ????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????????? ????????. ????? ????????????, ??? ????????? ???? ????????, ?????????????? ??? ?????? ?, ????????????, ??? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???????, ????? ??????????????? ??? ?????? ??? ??????. ????????, ???, ? ??????? ?? ????????????? ??????????????, ??????? ?????????????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ???????????????? ??????????-??????, ? ??????, ??????????? ????????? ??? ??????????? ??????????????, ? ???????????? ??????, ???????? ?????????????? ????-???????, ??????????? ?????????. ???????????, ??? ? ???????? ?????????????????? ?????? ???????? ?? ? ??????????, ? ???????????????, ????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????, ? ????? ???????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ?? ????????????? ???????????. ????????, ??? ???????????? ??????? ? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????????, ? ??????? ?? ?????? ???? ????????, ??????? ????????? ???????? ???? ? ?????????, ???????? ????????? ???????? ????????????? ? ?????????. ???????????????? ???????? ??????? ??????? ??? ??????? ?????? ?? ? ??????????????, ????? ???????? ??????? ???? ?? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ????, ???????? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ?????????????...|$|E

Drawing on field work conducted in the city of Ahmedabad, India, the author explores a specific case of serious failure on the part of civil society, state officials and organisations to effectively respond and protest the perpetration of violence and human rights abuses between Muslim and Hindu factions in the city. The author concludes that we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>assume</b> that all civil society organisations will be democratic, and that unless people come together across religious, caste and other ethnic divides, civil society will be unable to monitor and respond to transgressions by various actors. This research suggests that shared experiences and identities, a state monopoly over violence, and a visible effort to neutralise political projects along ethnic lines are necessary preconditions for an effective civil society. Policy makers should closely monitor situations where ethnic identities become a formative aspect of a state making project as this will likely lead to violence. Further, it must be recognized that civil society is an essential pre-condition for democracy and is significant in building sociability and solidarity, requisites themselves for a stable and functioning state and society...|$|E
