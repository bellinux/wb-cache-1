On 2 August 1991, representatives of the Iraqi government announced to leaders of UNSCOM's [...] "Team 7" [...] that they had conducted research into the offensive use of B. anthracis, botulinum toxins, and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> <b>toxins.</b> Post-war inspections by UNSCOM, however, were confounded by misinformation and obfuscation. After Iraqi General Hussein Kamel al-Majid defected to Jordan in August 1995, the Iraqi government further disclosed that it had operated a robust BW program at six major sites since the 1980s. It was revealed that the Iraqi program conducted basic research on B. anthracis, rotavirus, camelpox virus, aflatoxin, botulinum toxins, mycotoxins, and an anticrop agent (wheat cover smut). It tested several delivery systems including aerial spray tanks and drone aircraft. The Iraqi government had weaponized 6,000 liters of B. anthracis spores and 12,000 liters of botulinum toxin in aerial bombs, rockets, and missile warheads before the outbreak of war in 1991.

40|$|In <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens,</b> <b>toxins</b> {{that cause}} histotoxic and {{gastrointestinal}} diseases {{have been identified}} on a family of large conjugative plasmids. The tcp transfer locus was initially identified on the prototype conjugative plasmid, pCW 3. This locus {{has been shown to}} mediate conjugative plasmid transfer and studies on several of the Tcp proteins have identified their role in plasmid transfer. In general less is known about the mechanism of conjugative transfer in Gram positive bacteria, nonetheless some functional similarity between the protein families in the C. perfringens conjugation system and other Gram positive systems have been identified. To contribute {{to our understanding of the}} mechanism of conjugative transfer in C. perfringens this thesis examined the functional role of TcpM (formerly called IntP), TcpD, TcpE and TcpJ, all of which are encoded on the tcp transfer locus of pCW 3 (Chapter 2 and 3), and identified components of the novel relaxosome of pCW 3 (Chapter 3). To determine the role of the hypothetical proteins, TcpD, TcpE and TcpJ, independent homologous recombinant mutants were constructed. Conjugative mating studies with the pCW 3 ∆tcpD and pCW 3 ∆tcpE mutants and their complemented derivatives showed that TcpD and TcpE were essential for pCW 3 transfer. The pCW 3 ∆tcpJ mutant transferred at levels similar to wild-type, which showed TcpJ was not required for conjugative transfer. To further analyse the role of TcpD and TcpE, functional HA-tagged derivatives were constructed and shown to complement the respective mutants. Cell fractionation, western blot and immunofluorescence studies showed that TcpD and TcpE were localized to the cell envelope, primarily at the poles of C. perfringens cells, independently of proteins encoded on pCW 3. These results provide evidence that the essential conjugation proteins, TcpD and TcpE, form part of the multi-protein transfer apparatus in C. perfringens donor cells. Although several components of the multi-protein transfer apparatus had been identified, nothing was known about the relaxosome complex that must be essential for C. perfringens plasmid transfer. Key components of this complex, the relaxase gene and the oriT site, had not been identified on pCW 3. The first gene on the tcp locus, tcpM, was hypothesised to be the pCW 3 relaxase due to its similarity to tyrosine recombinases, a family of DNA processing proteins. A tcpM insertion mutant was constructed and shown to have a significantly reduced level of plasmid transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a tyrosine residue Y 259 as the only conserved tyrosine recombinase catalytic residue involved in the in vivo activity of TcpM. The residue Y 259 was also shown to be required for the ability of TcpM to relaxase plasmid DNA in an in vitro assay, which is consistent with the requirement for nucleophilic attack on the DNA substrate by a relaxase. A gene encoding a potential accessory protein, TcpK, of the pCW 3 relaxosome was identified outside the tcp locus. Mutagenesis and complementation studies showed that TcpK was required for wild-type pCW 3 transfer. Mobilization studies then were used to identify the pCW 3 oriT site. A 150 bp fragment located within the intergenic region between tcpK and tcpM increased mobilization of a shuttle vector. Gel mobility shift studies showed that TcpM bound to the oriT site. The addition of TcpK resulted in the formation of a supershift, providing evidence that TcpK could bind to the TcpM-oriT complex. In conclusion, this thesis has completed the genetic analysis the tcp transfer locus on pCW 3, identified a gene outside of the currently defined tcp locus as being involved in conjugative transfer and identified the DNA substrate, the pCW 3 oriT site. Overall these results have lead to the identification of the novel pCW 3 relaxosome. These findings have furthered our understanding of the mechanism of C. perfringens plasmid transfer and have contributed to the advancement of knowledge of Gram positive conjugation systems...|$|E

Thus, structural, functional, and microbiologic indices were used to investigate the etiology of spontaneous NEC development in preterm pigs. Methods : Piglets were delivered by cesarean section at 92 % gestation, reared in infant incubators, and fed infant formula or colostrum every 3 hours (n = 120) until tissue collection at 1 - 2 days of age. Results: Clinical and histopathologic signs of NEC were observed in 57 % of pigs fed FORMULA (26 / 46) and in 5 % of pigs fed COLOSTRUM (2 / 38) (P <. 05). Relative to COLOSTRUM, both healthy and sick FORMULA pigs had reduced intestinal villous heights, enzyme activities, nutrient absorption, and antioxidant levels and higher inducible nitric oxide synthetase activity (P <. 05). In healthy pigs, mucosal microbial diversity remained low and diet independent.

The toxin was purified about 30 -fold (in terms of lecithinase activity) by ammonium sulfate and acetone precipitations. The tagged toxin was injected intravenously into mice and rabbits, and the disappearance from the blood stream, deposition in organs and appearance in urine and expired air determined by measurement of radioactivity. Experimental data showed that toxin disappears rapidly from the bloodstream following intravenous injection, with radioactivity appearing in the urine and expired air shortly thereafter (10 to 20 min). The organs primarily responsible for the uptake of toxin from the blood are the liver (72 %), lungs (15 %), kidney (8 %), and spleen (5 %). The toxin is not bound to skeletal muscle. Fractionation of the liver into subcellular particles by centrifugation showed the radioactivity to be concentrated in the mitochondrial fraction.

The previously determined crystal structure of the actin-Ia complex suggested involvement of Asp 179 of actin in the ADP-ribosylation reaction. To gain more insights into the structural requirements of actin {{to serve as a}} substrate for toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, we engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, in which wild type actin was replaced by actin variants with substitutions in residues located on the Ia-actin interface. Expression of the actin mutant Arg 177 Lys resulted in complete resistance towards Ia. Actin mutation of Asp 179 did not change Ia-induced ADP-ribosylation and growth inhibition of S. cerevisiae. By contrast, substitution of Glu 270 of actin inhibited the toxic action of Ia and the ADP-ribosylation of actin. In vitro transcribed/translated human β-actin confirmed the crucial role of Glu 270 in ADP-ribosylation of actin by Ia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{active site}} of the enzymatic {{component}} (Ia) of the <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> iota <b>toxin</b> has been studied by site-directed mutagenesis. Sequence alignment showed that Ia and C 3 enzymes display a segment in their C-terminal part which is homologous to that forming the active domain of pertussis toxin, cholera toxin, and Escherichia coli thermolabile toxins. This structure consists of a β-strand and an α-helix which forms the NAD-binding cavity and which is flanked by two catalytic spatially conserved residues involved in catalysis [Domenighini et al. (1994) Mol. Microbiol. 14, 41 – 50]. Substitutions (Arg- 295 -Lys, Glu- 378 -Ala, Glu- 380 -Asp, and Glu- 380 -Ala) induced a drastic decrease in ADP-ribosylation and cytotoxic activities, while substitution of the adjacent Arg (Arg- 296 -Lys) only partially affected the enzymatic activity and cytotoxicity. These results indicate that Arg- 295, Glu- 378 and Glu- 380 of Ia {{are involved in the}} ADP-ribosylation activity which is essential for the morphological changes of cells treated with iota toxin...|$|R

The nanoCLAMP scaffold {{is based on}} an IgG-like, thermostable carbohydrate binding module family 32 (CBM32) from a <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> hyaluronidase (Mu <b>toxin).</b> The shape of nanoCLAMPs approximates a cylinder of approximately 4 nm in length and 2.5 nm in diameter, roughly the same size as a nanobody (...) [...] nanoCLAMPs to specific targets are generated by varying the amino acid sequences and sometimes the length of three solvent exposed, adjacent loops that connect the beta strands making up the beta-sandwich fold, conferring binding affinity and specificity for the target.|$|R

Here we report on the recombinant pro-duction of the enzyme component (CSTa) and the binding component (CSTb) of C. spiroforme toxin in Bacillus megaterium. By using the recombinant toxin components, we show that CST enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) and <b>Clostridium</b> <b>perfringens</b> iota <b>toxin.</b> Microscopic studies revealed that CST, but not the related Clostridium botulinum C 2 toxin, colocalized with LSR during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. Our findings indicate that CST shares LSR with C. difficile CDT and C. <b>perfringens</b> iota <b>toxin</b> as a host cell surface receptor. Clostridium spiroforme is frequently found in the digestive tractsof rabbits, where it is proposed to be responsible for severe diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death of the host (7). The virulence of C. spiroforme strongly correlates with the production of an enterotoxin termed CST (C. spiroforme toxin) (6) that be-longs to the family of clostridial iota-like binary <b>toxins,</b> including C. <b>perfringens</b> iota <b>toxin</b> and C. difficile transferase (CDT). CST is an A-B-type toxin, with an enzyme component (CSTa) harborin...|$|R
