5|$|As Afterburn {{exits the}} batwing, it climbs through a {{camelback}} hill over the station before entering its final inversion, a <b>corkscrew</b> to the right. The train then begins a 270-degree climbing helix to the left, after which {{it reaches the}} ride's brake run {{and returns to the}} station.|$|E
5|$|The next {{encounter}} pitted {{the team}} of Héctor Garza, Sonjay Dutt, and Sonny Siaki were pitted against {{the team of}} Kid Kash, Michael Shane, and Frankie Kazarian, who were accompanied by Traci, in a Six Man Tag Team match. Garza, Dutt, and Siaki won the match after Garza jumped off the top rope backwards and twisted in mid-air to perform a <b>corkscrew</b> moonsault onto Kazarian for the pinfall victory.|$|E
50|$|Interlocking <b>corkscrews</b> are {{a type of}} {{roller coaster}} {{inversion}} found on B&M coasters. In this inversion, two separate <b>corkscrews</b> spin around each other; one turns riders upside down over the other. Despite being close to each other, the two <b>corkscrews</b> are not necessarily taken consecutively.|$|R
50|$|<b>Corkscrews</b> are {{normally}} found {{towards the end}} of roller coaster layouts and often exist in pairs, where the end of one leads straight into the next. It is also common to see interlocking <b>corkscrews,</b> where the entrances and exits are parallel, but both <b>corkscrews</b> cross over each other's track.|$|R

5|$|The next match pitted Team Mexico against Team Japan on the June26 {{episode of}} Impact!. The team of Rey Bucanero and Último Guerrero {{represented}} Team Mexico in the contest, while Speed Muscle represented Team Japan. Team Mexico won the bout after Bucanero and Guerrero each performed a <b>corkscrew</b> aerial splash on Doi {{to gain the}} pinfall victory at 6 minutes. At the end of round one, this left Team International and Team Japan with zero points, while Team TNA and Team Mexico both had one point a piece.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of bombers only began {{receiving}} their warning and diversion orders at 00:45 hours. Halifaxes of No. 4 Group were finally alerted at this time. It {{was too late to}} prevent the Ju 88s from sighting, and then homing in on a mass of landing lights. Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver beam and Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews. Pilots that were alerted in time were able to carry out a <b>corkscrew</b> manoeuvre, and evade the attack. Some bombers were able to land but were then subjected to strafing attacks and destroyed though the crews were presented with a greater chance to escape.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second <b>corkscrew</b> was originally the track section which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E

40|$|The {{envelope}} oscillations of a cold-fluid <b>corkscrewing</b> elliptic beam in a uniform-focusing {{magnetic field}} are studied. In particular, by linearizing the generalized beam envelope equations, the eigenmodes of small-amplitude envelope oscillations are calculated for a cold-fluid <b>corkscrewing</b> elliptic beam oscillating about its equilibrium. All of the eigenmodes are {{shown to be}} stable...|$|R
5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to <b>Corkscrew.</b> Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including {{the lights on the}} stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights to the base of Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} two {{installments}} of the Final Destination series, Final Destination 3 was shot in Vancouver. The <b>Corkscrew</b> roller coaster at Playland was {{the basis of the}} Devil's Flight. Winstead and Merriman {{said in an interview that}} the film required three months of shooting; {{the first two}} weeks were spent on filming the roller-coaster scene, and the rest of the film was shot out of sequence. The cast members often rehearsed with each other for better on-screen chemistry. Filming concluded in July but due to negative reception towards the ending in early screenings, a new ending sequence featuring a subway train derailment was filmed in November.|$|E
5|$|Stream erosion {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in dissecting the mountain range, and many of its peaks are dotted with glaciers. This dissection has resulted in a variety of landforms, such as valleys, crags and domes. Small graveled creeks flow from alpine mountains out onto the regional prairies where there are pale blue rock-bottomed lakes, including the so-named Itcha Lake. Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely <b>Corkscrew</b> Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek. Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by stream erosion and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved. Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} suffered substantial damage {{during the}} 2001 Nisqually earthquake as the structure's upper floor twisted in a <b>corkscrew</b> fashion. On {{the top three}} floors, 80percent of the perimeter walls were damaged. A brick pinnacle on the upper roof collapsed and fell through a roof on the 10th floor. An elevator shaft and five floors were flooded when a mechanical water line ruptured. There were no injuries but {{it was estimated that}} the repairs would cost $6million. During repairs, efforts were made to reuse the brick and terracotta, and the same colors and style were sourced when replacement was needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} Mk. XIV {{was first}} tested in June 1941. It {{was the first}} modern bombsight that allowed for accurate bombing immediately after radical manoeuvring, with a settling time as little as 10 seconds. The fast settling time was invaluable during night bombing missions, as it allowed the bomber to fly a <b>corkscrew</b> (a helical path), climbing and turning and then level out immediately before the drop. Even slow turns {{made it difficult for}} night fighters to track the bombers within the limited view of their radar systems and continually changing altitude was an effective way to avoid anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} sure how to fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced the name of their new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a <b>corkscrew.</b> As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} scene, Gaga and her eye-patch wearing boyfriend are reading {{magazines}} {{on a sofa}} in a tea room. Gaga wears a yellow jumpsuit with circular glasses and shoulder pads. The Guardian compared this look with that of Minnie Mouse. She finally takes her revenge on her boyfriend by discreetly poisoning his drink with white powder concealed in her ring. As he falls dead, Gaga calls 9-1-1 and declares that she just killed her boyfriend. The police arrive at the mansion and arrest Gaga who, wearing a tall ice cream cone <b>corkscrew</b> wig, walks to the police car as the paparazzi surround her once again. Images flash by, with newspapers proclaiming her innocence and that Gaga {{is back in the}} spotlight and has regained her fame. The video ends with Gaga posing for mug shots like a fashion model while wearing a tulip shaped metallic dress similar to the single cover.|$|E
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, impregnation, cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the <b>corkscrew</b> locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|Wrestle Kingdom 9 {{featured}} {{two main}} event matches. In the first, Shinsuke Nakamura defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Kota Ibushi. Ibushi ridiculed Nakamura and used {{several of the}} champion's moves, including the corner vibration boot, the reverse powerslam, and the Boma Ye knee strike. Nakamura, responding aggressively, {{kicked out of the}} latter at one. Nakamura used a variety of knee-based strikes, and Ibushi's attacks included a standing <b>corkscrew</b> moonsault, a roundhouse kick, an elevated sit-out powerbomb, and a double stomp to the chest. Ibushi also jumped on the top rope, grabbing Nakamura on the apron, and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two count. In the finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope {{to the back of his}} head; both attempted the Boma Ye, but Nakamura recovered first with the Landslide and then the Boma Ye knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds. After the match, the wrestlers bumped fists.|$|E

5|$|Lewis and Audrey go {{on holiday}} to Greece {{together}} and Lewis suggests they move there and open a hotel. Audrey agrees {{and gets a}} £100,000 loan towards {{the purchase of the}} hotel. Lewis, needing money of his own, decides to steal from Peter Barlow's betting shop with fraudulently franked betting slips. He begins flirting with Deirdre Barlow, an employee at the betting shop. Lewis sends Deirdre out of the shop to get a <b>corkscrew</b> so they can share a bottle of wine. He places his fraudulent betting slips in the till and when Deirdre returns, he kisses her to distract her. Lewis slips out of Audrey's farewell party to collect his money and he leaves for the airport. Peter discovers Lewis has stolen from him and Audrey is devastated by his disappearance. She discovers Lewis has left her money alone and she finds a photograph of them with the words 'I tried' written on the back. While he is in the airport bar waiting for his flight to Barbados, Lewis introduces himself to Lydia Radcliffe and offers to sit with her during the flight.|$|E
