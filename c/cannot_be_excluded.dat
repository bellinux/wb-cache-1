5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>excluded</b> in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, staffed by the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and staffed by civilians during the Principate (although their existence <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>excluded,</b> as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E

40|$|The Coptic Didache excerpt, and the {{so called}} stinoufi prayer in particular, remain a {{contentious}} issue. In this essay two of the interpretations that have been proposed, by Joseph Ysebaert and Alistair Stewart-Sykes, respectively, are reassessed. I argue that not only the stinoufi prayer, but also 2 Cor 2 : 14 - 16 is best understood against the sapiential tradition of associating Wisdom with fragrance. In Did. 10. 8, like in the Pauline passage, {{the notion of the}} aroma most likely refers to the gospel.

40|$|Clathrin-mediated {{endocytosis}} {{has been}} described as the primary internalization pathway for many viruses, including the influenza virus. However, caveolae, an alternative clathrin-independent endocytotic pathway, has also been described as mediating the entry of some molecules, including viruses. To address the question of pathway selection by the influenza virus, we have investigated whether the virus is internalized via clathrin-coated pits and/or caveolae in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. By applying pharmacological manipulations to selectively disrupt the cell internalization pathways, we found that, in MDCK cells, the influenza virus may be internalized via caveolae in addition to entry by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

25|$|Regional {{population}} control {{has been used}} on species that <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>excluded</b> from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98-315 bird strikes per year, from 1979-1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5-6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more {{a function of the}} population reduction than the gulls altering their flight pattern (Dolbeer et al. 1993, Dolbeer et al. 2003, DeVault et al. 2013).|$|E
25|$|According to {{that work}} the {{majority}} of the Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages can be assigned to three major founders within haplogroup K (31% of their total lineages): K1a1b1a, K1a9 and K2a2. The absence of characteristic mutations within the control region in the PPNB K-haplotypes allow discarding them as members of either sub-clades K1a1b1a or K2a2, both representing a 79% of total Ashkenazi K lineages. However, without a high-resolution typing of the mtDNA coding region it <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>excluded</b> that the PPNB K lineages belong to the third sub-cluster K1a9 (20% of Askhenazi K lineages). Moreover, {{in the light of the}} evidence presented here of a loss of lineages in the Near East since Neolithic times, the absence of Ashkenazi mtDNA founder clades in the Near East should not be taken as a definitive argument for its absence in the past. The genotyping of the complete mtDNA in ancient Near Eastern populations would be required to fully answer this question and it will undoubtedly add resolution to the patterns detected in modern populations in this and other studies.|$|E
