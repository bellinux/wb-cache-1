Developing a component for {{the case of a}} contact wire cut to prevent further damage from the overhead <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> <b>system</b> requires an extensive knowledge about the system behaviour. Therefore, a comprehensive multi body system model (MBS) is developed in Matlab SimMechanics environment. In order to validate the datas generated from the simulations, a contact wire test stand has been constructed where cutting experiments can be run by releasing a pretensioned wire. Consequently, the force distribution during the contact wire cut is analyzed and these values are compared with the simulation results.

Specifically, longer life of batteries and less power consumption for reducing required capacity are the top priority issues. Fig. 2 is the block diagram of this system.

ZigBee is a wireless communication standard for sensor networks conforming to IEEE 802. 15. 4 that focuses on reduced power consumption and cost reduction 1), 2). The sensor-integrated RFID tags use solar cells and electric double layer capacitors for power supply. Low-price and high-performance solar cells have recently become available. And electric double layer capacitors have longer life than ordinary secondary batteries, eliminating the need for power supply replacement. JR East carries out inspections of overhead <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> using electric inspection cars a few times a year to maintain soundness of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> equipment that supplies electric power to trains. Electric inspection cars however can inspect only limited items, such as the positions and abrasion condition of main <b>line</b> <b>contact</b> wires and the configuration of crossovers and main lines. Many items thus remain dependant on manual inspection. Inspections of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> equipment that spans long distances require a huge amount of labor, so efficient inspection methods {{need to be}} examined from a viewpoint of reducing labor and maintenance costs. And to improve equipment maintenance quality, we need to identify signs of failures by continuously monitoring equipment conditions.

40|$|Overhead <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> {{equipment}} is important equipment that supplies power to trains. In order thus {{to maintain the}} soundness of the equipment, we inspect wearing depth of contact wires and positions (height and deviation) of overhead <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> {{a few times a}} year using inspection cars. Some equipment, however, cannot be measured by inspection cars, so that is measured or just visually checked and manually measured only about once a year.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the 3 kV {{power supply system}} of Polish {{high-speed}} lines is described. Basic OCL parameters and test results of current collection quality is presented. One of the basic parameters limiting the maximum service speed on a given line is the pantograph-OCL cooperation quality. In this paper three types of overhead contact lines designed and implemented in Poland are described. There are also specified basic parameters and materials of catenaries, as well as OCL geometry or mechanical and electrical design values. The measured values obtained {{as a result of}} the performed tests are given in this paper which allows them to be compared with the design intents. One of the overhead <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> <b>system</b> examples is an OCL system implemented on CMK mainline. The line was built in the 1970 s and nowadays is a backbone of Warsaw to Silesia rail connection. Today PKP provides 200 km/h commercial intercity services on this line. The CMK trunk line is commonly considered as a leading one on the Polish rail network. On this line several tests were performed which allowed the following two types of traction stock to enter service on the domestic network. The first of them was Siemens ES 64 U 4 electric locomotive and the second one was ED 250 Pendolino electric multiple unit, manufactured by Alstom Ferroviaria. All these tests were carried out according to the requirements described in Technical Specifications for Interoperability (TSI) of Trans-European high-speed rail network for both Test pantograph and catenary on compliance with the TSI Energy and locomotives subsystems. During the Pendolino test runs two consecutive speed records were attained, first one (250. 1 km/h) by a modified FS ETR 460 train in 1994 and the latter (293 km/h) by a PKP ED 250 train in 2013. It is to be noticed that the speed records mentioned above were determined not only by the power supply system parameters but were dependent on other factors as well. During the test runs the current collection quality was checked, for both single-unit and multiple-unit operation. In this paper the results of pantograph-OCL cooperation are described, according to TSI “Rolling stock” and “Energy” subsystems. These specifications state that the general current collection quality assessment criteria are the contact wire uplift and the contact force (calculated between a collector head and the contact wire) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Magdeburg-Dessau-Leipzig-Halle axis {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{mainline}} to be electrified with low-frequency, single phase power. The Prussian state railways preferred to electrify the Euskirchen-Trier and the Altona-Kiel lines, but the army command had objections in both cases. In addition, lignite deposits in the area meant that a power station with short supply routes could be constructed at Muldenstein. Construction on the Muldenstein railway power station started on 18 January 1910 and about two months later the construction of a substation in Bitterfeld and the erection of overhead contact wire for the first section from Dessau to Bitterfeld began. [...] The state police approved the power supply and <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> <b>systems</b> on 4 January 1911 and trial operations with a voltage of 5 kV and a supply line voltage of 30 kV began on 18 January 1911 using a borrowed Baden State Railways class A1 locomotive, which had previously had test runs on the Ammergau Railway with transformers suitable for 5.5 kV. From 25 March, after increasing the supply line voltage to 60 kV, the catenary voltage was increased to 10 kV for test runs so that the newly built WSL 10502 HALLE and WGL 10204 HALLE locomotives could be tested at 10 kV. On 1 April, the line was opened for public operations by the Prussian Minister Paul von Breitenbach in the presence of members of parliament. After the “Convention relating to the implementation of electric traction" [...] was established by the state railway administrations of Prussia-Hesse, Bavaria and Baden in 1912, it was agreed in the autumn of 1913 that a voltage of 15 kV and frequency of 16 2/3 Hz would be adopted. In order to extend electrified service to the south, a sub-station was put into operation on 1 May 1914 in Wahren along with a 60 kV feeder line. By 1 June 1914, electric rail operations had been extended to Neuwiederitzsch and beyond to parts of the Leipzig freight ring, but after the outbreak of the First World War it was closed in the first few days of August 1914 so that the materials could be completely recovered. According to Tetzlaff, the whole line to Leipzig Hauptbahnhof was taken into operation by electric traction in June 1914, but this is considered unlikely.|$|R

In this paper we report the effects of surface roughness on <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients of water droplets on micro- and nano-patterned surfaces. Both advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients have been measured, analyzed and compared on smooth, one-tier (with micropillars), and two-tier (with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) grown on micropillars) surfaces {{over a wide range}} of <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> velocities and droplet volumes. Our results indicate that superhydrophobic surfaces with CNTs on top of micropillars can significantly decrease both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients. In comparison, both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients on smooth surfaces were more than ten times larger than those on superhydrophobic surfaces. However, droplets on one-tier surfaces with only micropillars exhibit different dynamic behaviors on advancing and receding movements. We experimentally investigated the Wenzel-Cassie transition on micropillar structures and found that the receding motion on micropillars is dominated by the Wenzel behavior, which leads to higher receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficients on one-tier surfaces. However, there is a high tendency for an advancing droplet to exhibit Cassie-type behaviors on one-tier surfaces. As a result, advancing <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> friction coefficient is considerably mitigated on micropillars. On two-tier superhydrophobic surfaces, it was the Cassie–Baxter behavior that dominates both the advancing and receding <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> motions giving rise to less friction coefficients.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 We {{study the}} {{evaporation}} of liquid droplets on flat and curved heated substrates. We derive an evolution equation for the drop thickness to evaluate its shape as it evaporates on a curved substrate. We adopt a one-sided model with thermal control which, {{together with the}} lubrication approximation, results in an evolution equation for the local height of the droplet. Without requiring any pre-assumption for {{the shape of the}} drop, we formulate the problem for the two modes of evaporation: (i) pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> and (ii) moving <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> with fixed <b>contact</b> angle. For each evaporation mode, we solve the problem numerically for flat and curved solid substrates, separately. We first analyze the simplified evolution equation for the case of flat solid substrates. For the pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> case, we observe that after a time interval the contact angle, i. e. the angle between the solid and the interface at the <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> dynamics become nonlinear and, interestingly, the local contact angle goes to zero in advance of total evaporation of the drop. For the case of moving <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> in which the singularity at the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is treated by a numerical slip model, we find that the droplet nearly keeps its initial circular shape and that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> recedes with constant speed. We then analyze the problem for various periodic and quasi-periodic substrate profiles. For the case of pinned <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> we find the results to be very similar to the flat case. For the case of moving <b>contact</b> <b>line,</b> we study the dynamics of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> and the apparent contact angle, i. e. the angle that the liquid appears to make with the solid surface when viewed at such a coarse resolution that the substrate appears flat (the angle between the horizon and the interface at the <b>contact</b> <b>line).</b> In contrast with our results for a flat substrate, for which the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> recedes at a nearly constant speed, we observe that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> speed and position show significant time variation and that the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> moves in an approximately step-like fashion on relatively steep substrates. For the simplest case of a periodic substrate, we find that the apparent contact angle is periodic in time. For doubly periodic substrates, we find that the apparent contact angle is again periodic and that the problem exhibits a phase-locking behavior. For multi-mode quasi-periodic substrates, we find the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> behavior to be temporally complex and not only limited to an approximately step-like motion. In all cases, we find that the overall evaporation is increased relative to the flat substrate...|$|R

A local force balance {{in the context of}} diffuse interfaces is introduced to explain the equilibrium states of droplets on chemically patterned surfaces. It is shown that, when the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is pinned on a hydrophobic-hydrophilic boundary, different contact angles can be interpreted as the variation of the length of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> occupied by each component. The stick-slip-jump behavior of evaporating droplets on chemically patterned surfaces is well captured by the LB simulations. Particularly, a slow movement of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> is clearly observed during the stick (pinning) mode, which shows that the pinning of the <b>contact</b> <b>line</b> during droplet evaporation on chemically stripe-patterned surfaces is actually a dynamic pinning process and the dynamic equilibrium is achieved by the self-adjustment of the <b>contact</b> <b>lines</b> occupied by each component.
