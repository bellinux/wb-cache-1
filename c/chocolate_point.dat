The World Cat Federation has also adopted this classification, treating the color point Short hair as a distinct breed.|$|E
5000|$|The colorpoint {{pattern is}} most {{commonly}} associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter {{version of the same}} color {{on the rest of the}} body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal <b>points</b> (dark brown), <b>chocolate</b> <b>points</b> (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or flame points (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a temperature sensitive mutation in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.|$|R

40|$|Journal ArticleBackground: Two {{theories}} {{explain how}} negative mood primes smoking behaviour. The stimulus-response (S-R) account argues {{that in the}} negative mood state, smoking is experienced as more reinforcing, establishing a direct (automatic) association between the negative mood state and smoking behaviour. By contrast, the incentive learning account argues that in the negative mood state smoking {{is expected to be}} more reinforcing, which integrates with instrumental knowledge of the response required to produce that outcome. Objectives: One differential prediction is that whereas the incentive learning account anticipates that negative mood induction could augment a novel tobacco-seeking response in an extinction test, the S-R account could not explain this effect because the extinction test prevents S-R learning by omitting experience of the reinforcer. Methods: To test this, overnight-deprived daily smokers (n∈=∈ 44) acquired two instrumental responses for tobacco and <b>chocolate</b> <b>points,</b> respectively, before smoking to satiety. Half then received negative mood induction to raise the expected value of tobacco, opposing satiety, whilst the remainder received positive mood induction. Finally, a choice between tobacco and chocolate was measured in extinction to test whether negative mood could augment tobacco choice, opposing satiety, in the absence of direct experience of tobacco reinforcement. Results: Negative mood induction not only abolished the devaluation of tobacco choice, but participants with a significant increase in negative mood increased their tobacco choice in extinction, despite satiety. Conclusions: These findings suggest that negative mood augments drug-seeking by raising the expected value of the drug through incentive learning, rather than through automatic S-R control. MR...|$|R

40|$|Dark {{chocolate}} {{ingredients are}} thought to promote relaxed arteries, and have biochemical effects that may discourage atherosclerosis. However, the special flavanol-enriched formulations of dark chocolate may do little to enhance its vascular benefits [1]. In a randomized, double-blind study, eating dark chocolate—acutely and over weeks—not only improved objective measures of endovascular function, it also improved biochemical markers that reflect leukocyte activation, inflammation, and other signs of atherogenesis. The study further compared normal- vs high-flavanol dark-chocolate consumption by its participants, a few dozen overweight and mildly obese middle-aged male volunteers. It saw few important differences in vascular functional or biochemical effects following ingestion of either formulation of chocolate. Changes in endothelial function were reflected in improved flow-mediated dilation (FMD), blood pressure, and augmentation index (AIX), while "changes in leukocyte-cell counts, plasma cytokines, and leukocyte adherence markers after <b>chocolate</b> consumption <b>point</b> toward a less-activated state of cellular adherence and, hence, a less atherogenic milieu. Extra flavanols did not augment these effects, but did affect taste and had {{a negative effect on}} the motivation to eat chocolate. Beneficial vascular changes and even improved clinical outcomes have long been attributed to consumption of flavanol- and polyphenol-rich foods like chocolate, cinnamon, and tea in both observational and interventional studies.

5000|$|The Hershey Process milk {{chocolate}} {{used in these}} bars uses fresh milk delivered directly from local farms. The process was developed by Milton Hershey and produced the first mass-produced chocolate in the United States. As a result, the Hershey flavor is widely recognized in the United States, but less so internationally, especially in areas where European chocolates are more widely available. The process is a company and trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed, producing butyric acid, which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This flavor gives the product a particular sour, [...] "tangy" [...] taste which the US public has come to associate with the taste of <b>chocolate,</b> to the <b>point</b> that other manufacturers often add butyric acid to their {{milk chocolate}}s.

5000|$|The International Cat Association (TICA) groups {{the breed}} into three coat-pattern {{divisions}} for judging at cat shows: traditional (with stable, rich colors), sepia ("paler and warmer {{than the traditional}} equivalents", and darkening a bit with age), and mink (much lighter than sepia, and developing noticeably with age on the face and extremities). If classified as the Himalayan sub-breed, full point coloration is required, the fourth TICA color division, with a [...] "pale and creamy colored" [...] body even lighter than mink, with intense coloration on the face an extremities. The four TICA categories are essentially a graduated scale of color distribution from evenly colored to mostly colored only at the points. Within each, the coloration may be further classified as solid, tortoiseshell (or [...] "tortie"), tabby, silver or smoke, solid-and-white, tortoiseshell-and-white, tabby-and-white, or silver/smoke-and-white, with various specific colors and modifiers (e.g. <b>chocolate</b> tortoiseshell <b>point,</b> or fawn shaded mink marbled tabby-torbie). TICA-recognized tabby patterns include classic, mackerel, marbled, spotted, and ticked (in two genetic forms), while other patterns include shaded, chinchilla, and two tabbie-tortie variations, golden, and grizzled. Basic colors include white, black, brown, ruddy, bronze, [...] "blue" [...] (grey), chocolate, cinnamon, lilac, fawn, red, cream, with a silver or shaded variant of most. Not counting bi-color (piebald) or parti-color coats, nor combinations that are genetically impossible, there are nearly 1,000 named coat pattern variations in the TICA system for which the Persian/Himalayan qualifies.

50|$|Early this century, a {{group of}} breeders in England again began trying to {{recreate}} {{the vision of the}} early Havana breeders. They made good progress in isolating the chocolate genetics and were consistently producing <b>chocolate,</b> lilac and <b>pointed</b> kittens. In 2011 a registered Havana Brown was imported from Europe and bred back to their Havana orientals. This cats contribution, along with selective breeding for type, began to direct the look of some English Havanas away from its Oriental siblings, and moved them more {{in the direction of the}} Havana Brown. In June 2014 under the breed name Suffolk, this cat gained recognition by the GCCF. The alternative name was used because the GCCF uses the name Havana to refer to a self chocolate Oriental Shorthair, from which they wished to be distinguished. Although a Havana Brown is used in the breeding program of the Suffolk, they are not to be confused as the same breed. The Suffolk is much closer to the Chestnut/Havana Oriental than to the Havana Brown.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of using CBS {{in this research}} {{is to improve the}} physical properties and quality of appereance and structure stability of chocolate bar. Based on chemical composition, CBS and Cocoa butter have different profile, but they have similar physical properties due to high lauric acid content.

5000|$|Up to and {{including}} the 19th century, confectionery of all sorts was typically sold in small pieces to be bagged and bought by weight. The introduction of chocolate as {{something that could be}} eaten as is, rather than used to make beverages or desserts, resulted in the earliest bar forms, or tablets. At some <b>point,</b> <b>chocolates</b> came to mean any chocolate-covered sweets, whether nuts, creams (fondant), caramel candies, or others. The chocolate bar evolved from all of these in the late-19th century as a way of packaging and selling candy more conveniently for both buyer and seller; however, the buyer had to pay for the packaging. It was considerably cheaper to buy candy loose, or in bulk.The production of chocolate specifically meant to be eaten in bars may predate the French Revolution. The Marquis de Sade wrote to his wife in a letter dated May 16, 1779, complaining about the quality of a care package he had received while in prison. Among the requests that he made for future deliveries were for cookies that [...] "must smell of chocolate, as if one were biting into a chocolate bar." [...] This phrasing is highly suggestive of chocolate bars being eaten by themselves and not just grated into chocolate-based drinks, as was a far more common use at this time. Such a product would predate the invention of the cocoa press by Coenraad Johannes van Houten and other innovations which made chocolate bars suitable for mass-production.|$|R
5000|$|The pointed {{pattern is}} a form of partial albinism, {{resulting}} from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated tyrosinase enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures, but becomes active in cooler (< 33 °C) areas of the skin. This results in dark colouration in the coolest parts of the cat's body, including the extremities and the face, which is cooled by the passage of air through the sinuses. All Siamese kittens, although pure cream or white at birth, develop visible points in {{the first few months of}} life in colder parts of their body. [...] By the time a kitten is four weeks old, the points should be sufficiently clearly distinguishable to recognise which colour they are. Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. Originally the vast majority of Siamese had seal (extremely dark brown, almost black) points, but occasionally Siamese were born with [...] "blue" [...] (a cool grey) points, genetically a dilution of seal point; <b>chocolate</b> (lighter brown) <b>points,</b> a genetic variation of seal point; or lilac (pale warm gray) points, genetically a diluted chocolate. These colours were at first considered [...] "inferior" [...] seal points, and were not qualified for showing or breeding. All of these shades were eventually accepted by the breed associations, and became more common through breeding programmes specifically aimed at producing these colours. Later, outcrosses with other breeds developed Siamese-mix cats with points in other cat colours and patterns, including Red and Cream point, lynx (tabby) point, and tortoise-shell ("tortie") point.|$|R
40|$|The thesis reports novel {{scientific}} understanding and findings generated {{on the subject}} of chocolate oral processing. Research was carried out with a view to unravel the role of food (chocolate) - and human-related factors in governing structural and physical transformation of chocolate matrices during human oral processing. Dark and milk chocolate were studied as contrasting model matrices to investigate the influence of composition and physical properties of chocolates on microstructure and physical properties of ready-to-swallow chocolate boluses formed as a consequence of distinct eating and saliva incorporation strategies. Microstructure, and physical/material properties, in particular, particle size distribution, hardness, mechanical and rheological properties of melts, and thermal behaviour and solid fat content (SFC) of the chocolate models were characterised and compared. Differences in particle size distribution between the chocolates, and presence of milk ingredients (milkfat, milk powder, lactose) and surface-active agents (soy lecithin) in the milk chocolate, as opposed to their absence in the dark chocolate, were recognised and discussed as prominent factors contributing to underlying differences in microstructure and physical properties between the chocolate models. The dark chocolate was significantly harder as compared to milk chocolate, and in addition demonstrated greater firmness, consistency, cohesiveness, index of viscosity, yield stress and plastic viscosity of melt. Analysis of melting behaviour suggested that in comparison to milk chocolate, the dark chocolate had a slower melting-rate and greater SFC, and hence demonstrated greater energy requirement for complete liquefaction. This was reflected through the thermal parameters of solid fat index, melting onset, end and peak maximum, and enthalpy of melting assessed using differential scanning calorimetry. A 24 subject human panel study undertaken to investigate eating (mastication and swallowing) strategies of consumers suggested that chocolate eating behaviour varied considerably across consumers. Findings highlighted that chocolate eaters adapted their overall eating strategies in response to differences in physical and related-textural properties of chocolates. In particular, total number of chews and oral processing time for the complete masticatory sequence and until the first perception to swallow, significantly differed between the two chocolates. These eating parameters were greater in the case of dark chocolate as compared to milk chocolate. Furthermore, subjects also conserved their general eating patterns and maintained similar masticatory frequencies between chocolates. Taken together, it was postulated that chocolate composition and physical properties, as well as human-related physiological and behavioural factors influenced dynamics of chocolate oral transformation, and were consequently involved in modulation of mastication and swallowing strategies. Hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance were successfully implemented for segregation of population into three clusters with significant differences in eating parameters. This was followed by principal component analysis which facilitated the selection of 3 test subjects who exercised distinct overall chocolate eating strategies significantly different from each other, and moreover were from a related parent cluster. Regardless of eating strategy, occurrence of several voluntary swallowing events before complete oral clearance of chocolates indicated that only a part of the bolus was ready-to-swallow at the first perception to swallow. Observation of expectorates confirmed that at this <b>point,</b> <b>chocolate</b> boluses constituted a pool of liquid bolus phase (molten chocolate + saliva) as well as cohesive bolus lumps (solid/partially-melted chocolate particles aggregated together by the action of saliva and molten fat). While the liquid phase was swallowed by subjects, cohesive lumps underwent further oral processing to be transformed into a swallowable consistency. Microstructure analysis of bolus liquid phase by optical microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a coarse oil-in-water emulsion microstructure in the case of either chocolate wherein, a relatively denser bolus structure resulting from extensive ingredient and fat globule flocculation was witnessed for dark chocolate boluses. Results further suggested that solid fat content-related physical properties and melting behaviour were related to saliva incorporation. Greater hardness and energy requirements for liquefaction, and slower rate of melting in dark chocolate resulted in relatively longer oral processing time invested by subjects in bolus preparation. This in turn resulted in higher moisture content in ready-to-swallow boluses of dark chocolate (40. 25 wt%) as compared to milk chocolate (32. 20 wt%). Furthermore, these properties also resulted in cohesive-lumps of dark chocolate boluses being significantly firmer and requiring greater work for compression. In contrast, adhesiveness of milk chocolate boluses was greater in comparison with dark chocolate boluses, and was explained through the presence of milk ingredients in its chocolate matrix. Subjects processed both chocolates to similar cohesiveness of bolus lumps, interestingly indicating that this property may not be chocolate-dependent. Nevertheless, bolus saliva contents at the first point of swallow, and all mechanical properties accept adhesiveness of bolus lumps, were subject-dependent. Results indicated that this effect could be largely related to variation in physiological parameters, in particular oral processing time and salivary flow rates. Interestingly, liquid phase viscosities of milk chocolate boluses were similar to that of dark chocolate within-subjects, while this property was also subject-dependent. Adaptation of eating strategies and saliva incorporation demonstrated by subjects in response to differences in chocolate texture, and the presence of a relatively greater percentage of water-soluble solids in milk chocolate were factors which supported the fact that ready-to-swallow boluses of both chocolates had similar viscosities. Subject-dependency of chocolate bolus viscosity was explained through physiological parameters of eating behaviour and saliva flow rate which influence final moisture content in the bolus liquid phase. Considering the importance of the continuous fat-phase in influencing oral processing and bolus formation of chocolates, effect of storage temperature (0 °C, 20 °C, 30 °C) -induced physical changes in dark and milk chocolate on physical properties of ready-to-swallow boluses, and eating and saliva incorporation strategies of selected subjects was investigated. Thermal analysis revealed mainly SFC-related changes in the physical properties of hardness and enthalpy of melting (ΔHmelt). Relative to 20 °C, storage at 0 °C resulted in increased hardness and ΔHmelt for both chocolates, while an inverse effect resulted from storage at 30 °C. In the case of both chocolates, all subjects adapted their oral processing time, number of chews and saliva incorporation strategies in positive relation to increase/decrease in hardness and ΔHmelt. Again, they conserved their general eating patterns, and maintained similar masticatory frequencies to form boluses suitable for swallowing. In the case of both chocolates, significant softening and relatively greater reduction in ΔHmelt of chocolate stored at 30 °C resulted in significantly low firmness and work of spreading of bolus lumps obtained at the point of swallow. Once again, in the case of all subjects, adhesiveness of bolus lumps was independent of these changes in physical properties for either chocolate-type. Lastly, results suggested storage treatments resulted in each subject processing a similar chocolate-type to different endpoints in terms of bolus liquid phase viscosity. Different SFC which governed the relative extent of melting that a chocolate underwent until the point of swallow, may have influenced the degree of bolus dilution, and hence its viscosity. Throughout this study, the excellent within-subject repeatability in eating strategies, saliva incorporation, and rheological properties of ready-to-swallow bolus for a particular chocolate- and/or texture-type was noteworthy...|$|R
