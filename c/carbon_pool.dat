25|$|Soil carbon {{storage is}} an {{important}} function of terrestrial ecosystems. Soil contains more carbon than plants and the atmosphere combined. Understanding what maintains the soil <b>carbon</b> <b>pool</b> {{is important to understand}} the current distribution of carbon on Earth, and how it will respond to environmental change. While much research has been done on how plants, free-living microbial decomposers, and soil minerals affect this pool of carbon, it is recently coming to light that mycorrhizal fungi—symbiotic fungi that associate with roots of almost all living plants—may {{play an important role in}} maintaining this pool as well. Measurements of plant carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi have been estimated to be 5-20% of total plant carbon uptake, and in some ecosystems the biomass of mycorrhizal fungi can be comparable to the biomass of fine roots. Recent research has shown that mycorrhizal fungi hold 50 to 70 percent of the total carbon stored in leaf litter and soil on forested islands in Sweden. Turnover of mycorrhizal biomass into the soil <b>carbon</b> <b>pool</b> is thought to be rapid and has been shown in some ecosystems to be the dominant pathway by which living carbon enters the soil <b>carbon</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{magnitude}} of mycorrhizal fungal inputs to the soil <b>carbon</b> <b>pool,</b> {{some have suggested that}} variation in the recalcitrance of mycorrhizal biomass may be important for predicting soil carbon storage, as it would affect {{the rate at which the}} contribution of mycorrhizal fungi to soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere. The compound glomalin, produced only by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, has been found to accumulate in some soils, and may be a substantial fraction of the soil <b>carbon</b> <b>pool</b> in these ecosystems. However, a recent set of experiments demonstrates the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi results in net losses of soil carbon, calling into question the role of glomalin produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi leading to increased soil carbon storage. Proteomic work has revealed that most of the proteins isolated in the glomalin extraction are not of mycorrhizal origin, and therefore the contribution of this molecule to soil C storage has likely been overestimated.|$|E
25|$|Lipid {{biosynthesis}} also {{occurs in}} the intraradical mycelium. Lipids are then stored or exported to extraradical hyphae where they may be stored or metabolized. The breakdown of lipids into hexoses, known as gluconeogenesis, {{occurs in the}} extraradical mycelium. Approximately 25% of the carbon translocated from the plant to the fungi is stored in the extraradical hyphae. Up to 20% of the host plant's carbon may {{be transferred to the}} AM fungi. This represents the host plant's considerable carbon investment in mycorrhizal network and contribution to the below-ground organic <b>carbon</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the Cerrado Biome, the {{internal}} carbon cycling, the main <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> size, and the fluxes intensity between <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> {{are far from}} to be completely understood. This study presents the main <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and cycling fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems, emphasizing the neotropical savannas. This study will also review literature of internal carbon cycling in the Cerrado. In spite of the science advances, the knowledge of internal carbon dynamics in the Cerrado are scarce. The relation between the <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> size and fluxes intensity and the Cerrado's vegetation phytofisionomies, soil gradient, and climate still remains unknown. The <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and fluxes data analysis show that the Cerrado's aerial <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> are smaller than the forest systems pools. However, the subterranean <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> are equal or greater than the high production forest systems. Scientific estimations showed that 2, 050 Pg of carbon (1 Pg= 10 (elevado a 15) g, or one billion tons) would be stocked in terrestrial ecosystems and 70 % of it would be stocked soils. These data showed that soil is an important atmospheric carbon source and cleaner. In other natural and cultivated exosystems in the Cerrado Biome, the subterranean process needs more studies. 200...|$|R

40|$|A major {{drawback}} {{of current}} soil organic carbon (SOC) models {{is that their}} conceptually defined pools do not necessarily correspond to measurable SOC fractions in real practice. This not only impairs our ability to rigorously evaluate SOC models but also {{makes it difficult to}} derive accurate initial states of the individual <b>carbon</b> <b>pools.</b> In this study, we tested the feasibility of inverse modelling for estimating pools in the Rothamsted carbon model (ROTHC) using mineralization rates observed during incubation experiments. This inverse approach may provide an alternative to existing SOC fractionation methods. To illustrate our approach, we used a time series of synthetically generated mineralization rates using the ROTHC model. We adopted a Bayesian approach using the recently developed DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm to infer probability density functions of the various <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> at the start of incubation. The Kullback-Leibler divergence was used to quantify the information content of the mineralization rate data. Our results indicate that measured mineralization rates generally provided sufficient information to reliably estimate all <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> in the ROTHC model. The incubation time necessary to appropriately constrain all pools was about 900 days. The use of prior information on microbial biomass carbon significantly reduced the uncertainty of the initial <b>carbon</b> <b>pools,</b> decreasing the required incubation time to about 600 days. Simultaneous estimation of initial <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and decomposition rate constants significantly increased the uncertainty of the <b>carbon</b> <b>pools.</b> This effect was most pronounced for the intermediate and slow pools. Altogether, our results demonstrate that it is particularly difficult to derive reasonable estimates of the humified organic matter pool and the inert organic matter pool from inverse modelling of mineralization rates observed during incubation experiments...|$|R

40|$|Globally, remnant {{fragments}} of forests represent the main carbon reservoir of terrestrial ecosystems, but they suffer strong degradation due to uncontrolled wood extraction mainly by tree cut for household fuel use and charcoal production. The present study evaluates the degradation caused by wood extraction on <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and soil nutrient dynamics in temperate forests distributed in remnant fragments located in central Mexico. Four sites with different intensity of wood extraction {{were chosen for}} measuring <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and nutrient fluxes during two years. Both, aboveground carbon biomass and soil organic carbon values decreased with the intensity of forest degradation. The degraded forest (DF) showed total carbon content 55 % lower than that shown by the seminatural forest (SF). Additionally, litterfall production was reduced in DF as compared to SF; the decomposition rate of standing litter was higher in the latter site. As a consequence, DF had lower organic matter inputs to the soil than that presented by SF. Soil extractable ammonium and microbial biomass-carbon and -nitrogen were lower in DF than in SF. It was concluded that the uncontrolled wood extraction in these remnants of temperate forest in Mexico significantly reduced the <b>carbon</b> <b>pools,</b> <b>carbon</b> and nutrient fluxes through litterfall and consequently, the soil nutrient dynamics were disrupted...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to test if alternative carbon sources besides recently photosynthetically fixed CO 2 are used for isoprene formation in the leaves of young poplar (Populus × canescens) trees. In a 13 CO 2 atmosphere under steady state conditions, only about 75 % of isoprene became 13 C labeled within minutes. A considerable part of the unlabeled carbon may be derived from xylem transported carbohydrates, as may be shown by feeding leaves with [U- 13 C]Glc. As a consequence of this treatment approximately 8 % to 10 % of the carbon emitted as isoprene was 13 C labeled. In order to identify further carbon sources, poplar leaves were depleted of leaf internal <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> and the <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> were refilled with 13 C labeled carbon by exposure to 13 CO 2. Results from this treatment showed that about 30 % of isoprene carbon became 13 C labeled, clearly suggesting that, in addition to xylem transported carbon and CO 2, leaf internal <b>carbon</b> <b>pools,</b> e. g. starch, are used for isoprene formation. This use was even increased when net assimilation was reduced, for example by abscisic acid application. The data provide clear evidence of a dynamic exchange of carbon between different cellular precursors for isoprene biosynthesis, and an increasing importance of these alternative <b>carbon</b> <b>pools</b> under conditions of limited photosynthesis. Feeding [1, 2 - 13 C]Glc and [3 - 13 C]Glc to leaves via the xylem suggested that alternative carbon sources are probably derived from cytosolic pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate equivalents and incorporated into isoprene according to the predicted cleavage of the 3 -C position of pyruvate during the initial step of the plastidic deoxyxylulose- 5 -phosphate pathway...|$|R
