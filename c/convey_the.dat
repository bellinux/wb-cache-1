5|$|Ballhaus, at Finerman and Frankel's suggestion, {{composed}} as many shots as possible, whether interiors or exteriors, to {{at least}} partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background, to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York. He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few process shots were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.|$|E
5|$|On 19 October Banksy {{released}} another {{video for}} his tour of New York potentially to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> movement in nature {{that we are}} blind to but it is truly just a vagina with ants crawling out of it.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a combination of a verb ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Development {{started in}} early 2014 and took {{fourteen}} {{months to go}} into full production. The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first {{came up with the}} robots, whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> idea that the Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic {{when he had to}} develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E

5000|$|Hemolysis is {{sometimes}} called hematolysis, erythrolysis, or erythrocytolysis. The words hemolysis (...) and hematolysis (...) both use combining forms <b>conveying</b> <b>the</b> idea of [...] "lysis of blood" [...] ( [...] or [...] + [...] ). The words erythrolysis (...) and erythrocytolysis (...) both use combining forms <b>conveying</b> <b>the</b> idea of [...] "lysis of erythrocytes" [...] ( [...] ± [...] + [...] ).|$|R
5|$|Filipinos awarded {{with the}} rank or title National Artist of the Philippines are not {{considered}} to be national symbols because the title is given in recognition to the recipient's contributions to Philippine arts and letters and not as a symbol that represents traditions and ideals and <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> principles of sovereignty and national solidarity.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Kenneth Mak included Western {{elements in}} his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, {{was a unique}} place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{officers}} and petty officers {{in charge of the}} main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of the guns and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E

5|$|The Kaivalya Upanishad manuscripts vary, {{depending}} on which Veda it is attached to. The one attached to Krishna Yajurveda has 26 verses, while the edition attached to the Atharvaveda has 24 verses with an epilogue. Both <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> same message, but the former is structured as a single chapter, and the latter into two chapters (19 verses in first, 5 verses in second). The text is structured as verses, set to a poetic Vedic meter (exactly same number of syllables per verse of the song).|$|E
5|$|The final {{versions}} of the sonatas <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> impression of a single unit, and were likely notated in close succession during September 1828. The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of}} the last folio of the third sonata the date September 26. As compared to the sketches, the final versions are written much more neatly and orderly, with full notation and greater care for small details.|$|E
5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also {{sees himself as a}} father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took half an hour to put on.|$|E

5000|$|The {{alternative}} term {{mass culture}} <b>conveys</b> <b>the</b> idea that such culture emerges spontaneously from the masses themselves, like popular art did before the 20th century. The expression media culture, on <b>the</b> other hand, <b>conveys</b> <b>the</b> idea that such {{culture is the}} product of the mass media. Another alternative term for media culture is [...] "image culture." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have no time}} to go into details, {{but will}} say, in a word, that while <b>the</b> wind is <b>conveying</b> <b>the</b> seeds of pines into hard woods and open lands, the {{squirrels}} and other animals are <b>conveying</b> <b>the</b> seeds of oaks and walnuts into the pine woods, and thus a rotation of crops is kept up.|$|R
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> failure of the search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case}} of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E

5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
