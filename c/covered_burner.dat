Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A burner was designed and constructed to combine weed control practices of parallel and cross-flaming with the technology of covers and insulation. It involved two covers designed to be placed on the sides of a crop row. The flame under the covers was directed parallel to the crop row. Using uniquely designed vanes to divert heated air, the apparatus was designed to re-circulate a portion of heat emitted from the burners for increased fuel efficiency. The apparatus was evaluated by comparing it with the two open flame practices. This evaluation was performed by moving the burners over an area that would monitor the temperatures at specified heights and locations. Temperatures were measured using thermocouples placed at heights 7 -mm, 150 -mm, and 300 -mm in the crop row and height 7 -mm in the left and right furrows. Burners traveled at a designated speed (2, 3. 5, or 5 km/h) and burner operating pressure combination (207, 276, or 345 kPa). Time versus temperature curves were generated with the data for the temperatures observed. The areas under the curve, above 100 degrees C and within an exposure time boundary were used to compute utilization factors. The utilization factors provided a relative comparison of burner efficiency and performance. At 300 -mm in the row, temperatures never exceeded 100 degrees C. At 150 -mm in the row, temperatures rarely exceeded 100 degrees C. Sometimes temperatures exceeded 100 degrees C for a brief time. These results were evidence the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> re-circulated some heat and excessive amounts of heat were not escaping into the crop canopy. The thermocouples at height 7 -mm provided a good indication of temperature activity with the burners. With areas under the curve in the row at 7 -mm, open cross-flaming showed higher temperatures for than the <b>covered</b> <b>burner.</b> However, the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> had higher utilization factors than open cross-flaming. The <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> utilization factors were greater than open cross or parallel-flaming in the furrows...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 74 - 76). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. A covered infrared burner was designed and constructed so that it could be compared to an open-flame burner. Two covered burners, a high configuration and a low configuration, were constructed. A low configuration covered infrared burner, high configuration covered infrared burner, and an open-flame burner were studied to evaluate the increase in temperature caused by each burner to a target zone. These evaluations were conducted while the burners were traveling at a given speed (2, 3. 5, or 5 km/h) and pressure combination (207, 276, or 345 kPa). The temperature increase was referred to as the heat transfer. The target zone levels were monitored individually by thermocouples on the target sensor, a tool developed specifically to aid in data acquisition for the heat transfer experiments. There were four zone levels that were observed: 3. 5 and 1 cm above ground, ground level, and 0. 5 cm below ground. A set of Temperature versus Time curves was developed for the four zones. The area under the curve, above the threshold boundary, and left of the exposure time boundary was found so that a utilization factor could be calculated. The utilization factor was used as a relative comparison of burner efficiency and performance. Results reveal that there was not a significant rise in temperature in the sub-ground level zone. The observations at the ground level zone varied dramatically due to the intermittent activity of soil particles making contact with the thermocouple. The 1 and 3. 5 cm zone levels were a better indication of temperature activity; therefore, conclusions were drawn from observations at these above ground levels. In comparing the utilization factors of the covered infrared burners and the open-flame burner, it was observed that the covered infrared burner performed better than an open-flame burner at any speed and pressure combination even when the <b>covered</b> <b>burner</b> was utilizing all four burners continuously. When comparing the low and high configuration burner, it was observed that the low configuration burner slightly outperforms the high configuration burner when relating to the average utilization factor. This was attributed to the different forms of ventilation used for the low and high configuration burners...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{influence}} of biological and technical factors {{on the effect of}} flame weeding, as a basis for reducing the energy consumption and increasing the effective ground speed required for good weed control Responses of weeds and test plants were evaluated in the field. Effects of propane dose and ground speed were described by logistic models. The sigmoidal dose-response and speed-response curves imply that propane dose and the ground speed can be adjusted to the required control effect, the weed flora and the developmental stage of the plants, A 95 % reduction in susceptible annual weed species, with 0 - 4 true leaves, was achieved at propane doses of 10 - 20 kg ha^- 1, and the weeds were completely killed at 20 - 50 kg ha^- 1 (900 - 2300 MJ ha^- 1). Considerably higher doses were needed at later stages and for more tolerant species. The most tolerant species could not be controlled with one treatment, regardless of dose. Flamers with different characteristics were studied Flamers with <b>covered</b> <b>burners</b> were generally more effective than an open flamer, especially on larger plants and tolerant species. The effective ground speed was generally higher for flamers with a higher fuel input, but only up to a certain level, A flamer with a relatively high propane consumption of 34 kg h^- 1 per metre working width (440 kW m^- 1) allowed an effective ground speed of 8 km h^- 1 when smaller plants were treated, whereas the effective ground speed was 2, 6 km h^- 1 for a flamer with the more usual burner power of 12 kg h^- 1 m^- 1 (150 kW m^- 1). Temperatures from the flamers were measured above the ground under weed-free conditions in the laboratory. There was generally a high correlation between different thermal parameters, e. g. the maximum temperature and the temperature sum, measured from the flamers in the laboratory, and the weed reduction in the field, although discrepancies were found, Flame weeding is useful although the method could be further improved...|$|R

5000|$|The Trangia stove is {{a popular}} {{commercial}} alcohol stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a sealing <b>cover,</b> allowing the <b>burner</b> to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the O ring seal (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the Sterno heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade beverage can stoves (or [...] "Pepsi can stoves") are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium beverage cans, and come {{in a wide variety}} of different designs.|$|R

40|$|The {{installed}} {{performance of}} cooking exhaust fans was evaluated through residential field experiments conducted on {{a sample of}} 15 devices varying in design and other characteristics. The sample included two rear downdraft systems, two under-cabinet microwave over range (MOR) units, three different installations of an under-cabinet model with grease screens across the bottom and no capture hood, two devices with grease screens covering {{the bottom of a}} large capture hood (one under-cabinet, one wall-mount chimney), four under-cabinet open hoods, and two open hoods with chimney mounts over islands. Performance assessment included measurement of airflow and sound levels across fan settings and experiments to quantify the contemporaneous capture efficiency for the exhaust generated by natural gas cooking burners. Capture efficiency is defined as the fraction of generated pollutants that are removed through the exhaust and thus not available for inhalation of household occupants. Capture efficiency (CE) was assessed for various configurations of burner use (e. g., single front, single back, combination of one front and one back, oven) and fan speed setting. Measured airflow rates were substantially lower than the levels noted in product literature for many of the units. This shortfall was observed for several units costing in excess of $ 1000. Capture efficiency varied widely (from < 5 percent to roughly 100 percent) across devices and across conditions for some devices. As expected, higher capture efficiencies were achieved with higher fan settings and the associated higher air flow rates. In most cases, capture efficiencies were substantially higher for rear burners than for front burners. The best and most consistent performance was observed for open hoods that <b>covered</b> all cooktop <b>burners</b> and operated at higher airflow rates. The lowest capture efficiencies were measured when a front burner was used with a rear backdraft system or with lowest fan setting for above the range systems that do not <b>cover</b> the front <b>burners...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Combustion Induced Vortex Breakdown (CIVB) {{generating}} flame flashback in swirl burners was experimentally investigated. In {{the stable}} regime a bubble {{is created by}} the recirculation zone, which appears downstream of the combustor exit plane. Introduced by small changes of the flow field this bubble propagates upstream and transports the flame from the stable position inside the combustor into the premixing zone. To avoid this form of flashback and the damage of the upstream components due to overheating this phenomenon was investigated in detail. Previous experimental and numerical work identified the interaction of turbulence and chemistry as the root cause for CIVB and revealed that the vortex transport equation is well suited {{for the analysis of}} this interaction. Since the analysis showed that the position of the flame front with respect to the recirculation bubble governs the effects leading to CIVB this aspect was investigated in greater depth. In the experiment a premixed swirl burner without centerbody was investigated. The aerodynamic stabilization is realized with a properly tailored swirling main flow and an axial unswirled jet, which optimizes the vortex breakdown position. The experiments <b>cover</b> different <b>burner</b> geometries. Due to the high dynamics of the flame propagation during flashback High-Speed Particle Image Velocimetry (HS-PIV) and High-Speed Laser Induced Fluorescence (HS-LIF) were applied simultaneously to measure the dynamic change of the flow field and to track the flame front. In this framework the experimental investigations were focused on the tip of the bubble, which is the most relevant section for the onset of CIVB. The results of the experiments essentially confirm the mechanism derived from the analysis of earlier CFD data. In addition, instantaneous data is provided, which explains the observed strongly stochastic fluctuation of the flame tip before flashback due to CIVB occurs...|$|R
40|$|Venting range hoods are {{important}} residential ventilation components that remove pollutants generated by cooking activities {{and natural gas}} cooking burners. To address the lack of data on range hood installations in California, we conducted a survey by examining photographs of homes for sale or rent listed on a popular real estate web site. The survey was conducted in November 2010 and April–May 2011. Posted photos of the homes were reviewed {{to determine if a}} hood was installed, the type of hood, and two installation details that can impact performance, namely the height above the cooktop {{and the degree to which}} the hood <b>covers</b> the cooktop <b>burners.</b> We additionally collected information about the homes, including asking price for purchase or rent, type of building (e. g. detached house, townhouse or apartment), building age, floor area, and cooktop fuel type. Listings were first sampled to focus on homes built since 2005, then randomly sampled to include varied prices and locations around the state. Data were obtained for 1002 homes built between 1865 and 2011 (median year built 1989). Homes for sale varied in asking price from $ 16, 000 to $ 16, 500, 000 (median $ 353, 000) and homes for rent varied from $ 500 to $ 25, 000 (median $ 2125) per month. Approximately 74 % of the sample had natural gas cooktops. In this sample, natural gas cooktops were more prevalent in more expensive homes than in less expensive homes. Across the entire sample, 7. 4 % appeared to have no hood installed, 33 % had a short hood, 13 % had a deep hood and 47 % had a microwave over the range. The percentage of these hoods that vent to the outdoors could not be determined. Hood type was related to coverage of the cooktop. For deep hoods, 76 % appeared to cover most or all of the cooktop burners. For short hoods, 70 % covered about three quarters of the cooktop. And for microwaves the vast majority (96 %) <b>covered</b> the back <b>burners</b> but not the front burners. Hood type was also correlated with asking price or monthly rent, with deep hoods most common in the most expensive homes. Hood type was also correlated with home age, with microwave hoods more common in newer homes. Installation height was related to device type with microwaves installed lower (closer) to the cooktop (median 18 inches), and short hoods (median 28 inches) and deep hoods (median 30 inches) installed higher. Deep range hoods are more common with natural gas cooktops than with electric cooktops, and slightly fewer homes with natural gas cooktops lack a range hood (7 %) than homes with electric cooktops (9 %). This study provides limited but useful information about the characteristics of range hoods in California homes and demonstrates the potential value of non-traditional forms of data collection...|$|R
