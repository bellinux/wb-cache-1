50|$|The {{insolvency}} {{of general}} planner Planungsgemeinschaft Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg International (pg bbi) and {{the dismissal of}} the Gerkan, Marg and Partners architects, who bore partial blame for the problems, had a widespread impact on construction.

Reports have surfaced about <b>cable</b> <b>conduits</b> which hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of 60 km of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary.

50|$|Vitsœ's main product, the 606 Universal Shelving System was {{designed}} by Dieter Rams, in 1960. It is a modular system that can be adjusted and extended to individual needs. It {{is part of the}} collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Over time Dieter Rams has made various improvements and additions to the system. The system is based on vertical posts having shelves, cabinets, panels and desks hanging onto it. The system can be wall-mounted, semi wall-mounted which has the system carry its own weight and compressed between the floor and ceiling. If used in a compressed way, shelves can be added on both sides. The system features two distinct segment widths of 65.5 cm and 90 cm and height increments of 7 cm. Due to the way of mounting, shelves can be mounted either way up and even be mounted on the side to feature as a panel for magnets. Similarly the small desk shelf can be hung either way depending on the preferred desk setup. The system also features accessories like drawer dividers and <b>cable</b> <b>conduits.</b> The system is available in off-white, black and silver and can additionally feature beech tops.|$|E

Fifty years since its ‘removal’, relics of this infrastructure remain buried within the road system.

Though some of this infrastructure, such as <b>cable</b> <b>conduits,</b> is still useful today, the majority of it {{has proven to be}} a burden. Its the hidden existence of this network has had ramifications on work undertaken by the RTA, local Councils and public utility organisations- costing both time and money.

The database, conceived and developed by the Utility Locations Unit (ULU) within the RTA Surveying Section, models where tram tracks are located in relation to the road system today. Thereby fulfilling the unit’s role of locating, and surveying, subterranean features for RTA construction work. The research has resulted in a geodatabase which contains spatial features of the tram network from the period 1921 to 1954, defining changes not only in the tram network but also the road formation of Sydney.

50|$|The tramway {{was one of}} {{very few}} in England {{operated}} with a Griffiths-Bedell Stud contact system in the roadway. This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Cable</b> <b>conduit</b> {{actuation}} {{provides a}} simple yet dexterous mode of power transmission for remote actuation. However, {{they are not}} preferred because of the nonlinearities arising from friction and cable compliance which lead to backlash type of behavior. Unlike most of the current research in backlash control which generally assumes no knowledge {{of one of the}} intermediate states, the controller design in this case can be significantly simplified if output feedback of the system is available. This paper uses a simple feedforward control law for backlash compensation. A novel smooth backlash inverse is proposed, which takes the physical limitations of the actuator in consideration, unlike other designs, and thus makes it more intuitive to use. Implementation of this inverse on physical systems can also improve the system performance over the theoretical exact inverse, as well as other existing smooth inverse designs. Improvement in the performance is shown through experiments on a robot arm of Laprotek surgical system as well as on an experimental setup using polymeric cables for actuation. N I...|$|R

The power supply of the lighthouse demanded special attention. A 6 kV cable was run from the “Robbenplate” lighthouse (Fig. 1) towards “Alte Weser”, jetted in using a special device (“Einspuelstiefel”, Fig. 8) and threaded into the tower through a protective <b>cable</b> <b>conduit.</b> In addition, measures had to be taken to adopt the same cable for the planned “Tegeler Plate” lighthouse (see below). The foundation of the building was safeguarded with stone ballast poured down on bush mats against rinsing and water erosion. In 1964 the light of “Alte Weser” lighthouse went into service (Fig. 9). In 1972 the four keepers were displaced when the lighthouse became automated.|$|R
