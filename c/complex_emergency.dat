50|$|Forest Rangers {{fulfill the}} role of police officers, {{wildland}} firefighters and wilderness first responders. Their duty {{is to protect the}} state's forests and the people who use them from danger. Forest Rangers patrol 4300000 acre of Department-administered public lands and easements by vehicle, boat, ATV, snowmobile, aircraft, bicycle, foot, skis or snowshoes. Each ranger is required to reside within the ranger district in which she/he is assigned but emergencies and special events will require them to work anywhere and at any time. Rangers are often asked to assist other agencies with <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> or law enforcement incidents that have occurred in or near a forested area. Since New York state consists of 18600000 acre of forested lands, rangers are busy year-round.|$|E
50|$|Plans were {{announced}} in 2002 {{for the construction}} of a five-story pavilion adjacent to the Regional Heart Center. The first floor houses a 50,000 square foot, state-of-the-art Emergency Center (EC). The need for a new emergency department was identified as the number one priority by the community with widespread support. Floors two through five are each 40,000 square feet and accommodate future growth, including expanded surgery and intensive care units. The Emergency Center was designed specifically to address the <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> medicine issues that face the community it serves. The new Emergency Center (EC), finished in 2005, doubled in size of the previous facility, which at 20,000 square feet, was designed to accommodate 40,000 visits per year. The current EC, now with 55 beds, a dedicated Fast Track area and a separate 4-pod Behavioral Health Unit sees approximately 95000 visits annually, making it one of the busiest ECs in the Carolinas. Additionally, the hospital's HERT team is capable of erecting a free-standing, collapsible, medical mobile unit in the event of high census or patient quarantine.|$|E
40|$|Almost 172 {{million people}} live in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies</b> {{globally}} resulting from political and/or economic instability. The provision and continuity {{of health care in}} <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies</b> remain a significant challenge. Health agencies are often hesitant to implement tuberculosis programmes in particular because its treatment requires a longer commitment than most acute diseases. However, not treating tuberculosis promptly increases mortality and untreated tuberculosis further increases the incidence of tuberculosis. Given that <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies</b> are increasing globally, there is an urgent need to analyse the available evidence to improve our understanding of how best to deliver tuberculosis programmes in such settings. Using a scoping review method, we selected and analysed fifteen studies on tuberculosis programmes in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies.</b> We found that despite the challenges, tuberculosis programmes have been successful in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies.</b> We identified seven cross-cutting factors that were found to be important: service providers and treatment regime, training and supervision, donor support, adherence, leadership and coordination, monitoring, and government and community support. In general, programmes showed greater creativity and flexibility to adapt to the local conditions and at times, it also meant diverting from the WHO guidelines. We identify areas of further research including the need to study the effectiveness of programmes that divert from the WHO guidelines and their implication on drug resistance...|$|R

5000|$|Dr. Kayla Thornton (Tamera Mowry) A new {{doctor and}} young medical prodigy, Thornton is a fast study at Rittenhouse, {{entering}} residency {{in the beginning}} of the 2004-2005 season and becoming a depended-upon ER regular by the end of that season, despite occasional disbelief by patients that she is a qualified doctor. As she becomes a main character to the show, her personality can be compared to that of a young Dr. Delgado with her ambition and hard work. She decided to become a doctor as a young girl when a brother was shot in the chest by a friend when playing with a hunting rifle. While the friend ran for help, Kayla cradled her dying brother. The nearest doctor was 25 miles away, so therefore Kayla's brother died in her arms. She then decided to become a doctor. Throughout the medical drama's seasons, Thornton rooms with various fellow staff members in her search for affordable housing. First she moves into Dr. Campbell's house, where she spends some of her time helping with Andy's two daughters. After Andy's departure, she rooms with Lana. She was later on selected as Chief Resident after narrowly missing it due to a <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> house call. We find out that she has a twin sister, Keisha (played by real-life twin sister Tia Mowry) who ends up needing 24-hour care for Bipolar Disorder.|$|E

40|$|Essay 1. While recent {{violence}} in Liberia involved {{a reaction against}} the hegemony of the Americo-Liberian minority by the indigenous majority, {{an examination of the}} co-existence of violence and democracy in Liberia demonstrates that its underlying causes were considerably more complex.

The <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> in Darfur has often been described as resulting from ethnic conflict between Arab and indigenous populations. However, a consideration of relevant historical, political, economic, social, and ecological factors shows that, while the causes of this <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> were multidimensional, all may be ascribed to the failure of the Sudanese government to deal with such factors effectively.

40|$|The {{extensive}} {{literature on}} community {{participation in the}} targeting and management of humanitarian food assistance suggests that participatory approaches work best in slow-onset emergencies with no conflict or displacement. Yet the policies of many agencies [...] and compliance with Sphere minimum standards [...] require that the recipient community participate in decisions about the assistance they receive including targeting, regardless {{of the causes of}} the emergency. This paper analyzes current practice in the targeting and management of humanitarian food assistance in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies,</b> the constraints to recipient communities' participation, and the possibilities for participatory approaches to improve targeting. Access and security considerations, limited staff time and capacity, and other constraints have long meant that the actual oversight of food aid distributions in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies</b> is left in the hands of local leaders at the village or camp level. Introduced institutions include Food Relief Committees, or other specially-organized bodies to deal with targeting and distribution questions. Differences in the accountability and legitimacy of these leaders and committees, together with post-distribution dynamics over which agencies have little control, account for much of the way in food assistance is actually distributed and utilized. But much of the process of food aid targeting remains opaque to recipients, who are often not aware of their entitlements or the process of determining who is entitled. The paper concludes with a number of practical suggestions to improve participation in targeting in <b>complex</b> <b>emergencies.</b> Food aid <b>Complex</b> <b>emergencies</b> Community-based targeting Participation Relief committees Governance...|$|R

40|$|With the {{seemingly}} infinite existence of complex emergencies and the overwhelming presence of humanitarian organizations responding to such crises, {{it is essential}} that the assumptions, precepts, and actions of humanitarian organizations be critically examined and understood. The aim of this thesis is to explore differing traditions within humanitarian thought: neutrality and solidarity. In the process, this thesis will determine whether it is possible to maintain clear ideologies {{in the context of a}} <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> and whether the existence of different humanitarian ideologies results in a dichotomy or polarization of humanitarian action. This study is of great import as it delves into the contemporary literature claiming that humanitarianism is currently in a state of crisis – the unsustainability of competing humanitarian ideologies operating together in a <b>complex</b> <b>emergency.</b> Primary documents from both the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) regarding their operations in the 1994 Rwandan <b>complex</b> <b>emergency</b> were examined in order to provide a foundation for the theoretical investigation. Although the ICRC and MSF occupy seemingly polarized positions in the neutrality – solidarity debate, the investigation into their humanitarian activities during the 1994 genocide and the resulting refugee crisis reflected the difficulties of providing relief based upon humanitarian ideals. Due to the complex realities of the 1994 Rwandan crisis, the ideological notions dividing the ICRC and MSF were overshadowed by the simple humanitarian desire to aid those in need. ...|$|E
