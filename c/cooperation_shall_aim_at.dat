We formulate the problem as a two-player zero-sum stochastic game. We prove the existence of the uniform value: if the players are sufficiently patient, both players can guarantee the same mean-average opinion without knowing the exact discount factor. Further, we put forward some elements for the characterization of equilibrium strategies. In general, players must implement a trade-off between a forward-looking perspective, according to which they <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> maximizing the future spread of their opinion in the network, and a backward-looking perspective, according to which they <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> counteracting their opponent's previous actions. When the influence potential of players is small, an equilibrium strategy is to systematically target the agent with the largest eigenvector centrality. Nous proposons une approche analytique au problème de maximisation de l'influence dans un réseau social entre deux joueurs utilisant des stratégies dynamiques. Le problème est formulé comme un jeu stochastique à somme nulle. Nous prouvons l'existence de la valeur uniforme et donnons une caractérisation partielle des stratégies d'équilibre.

We are perfectly familiar with this type, both in men who have, and men who have not, such brilliant parts as Halifax.

Based on which legal and economical grounds has this regulation been made? Which problems may occur when the purpose of the company is to maximize the wealth of its shareholders?

Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate whether a limited liability company primarily <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> maximizing the wealth of its shareholders or not. Delimitations: This thesis only attend swedish limited liability companies. It also only treat swedish corporate law de lege lata. The thesis focus on larger commercial companies which shares are widely spread. It is assumed that the companies act on a market with satisfying competition. It is also assumed that individuals try to maximize their own good, that they can be rational and that they are able to react on stimulus. Finally this thesis focus mainly on the companies shareholders, its management and its employees. Method: The sources that have been used in this thesis are mainly the traditional sources for a swedish layer, namely words of legal acts,legal proposals and legal doctrine. Also economical and ethical doctrine have been of value for this thesis. Result: The purpose of a swedish limited liability company to maximize the wealth of its shareholders is, for a number of reasons, a reasonable starting point. However shareholder wealth maximization may lead to conciderable conflicts of interests when ownership and control are separated. Shareholder wealth maximization may also rise ethical problems. Therefore it is essential that the company takes other interests than those that are represented by the shareholders into account.

40|$|Humanitarian {{demining}} is calamity {{of third}} world countries. The clearing is ceaseless, {{more expensive than the}} spreading, and terrorist return is obtained by weakening of the antagonistic population. The mines are cheapest weapon, built to make horrible injuries, affecting active people, with major falls-off into economic growth. The disaster is notably cruel in Sri Lanka, with anti-person mines spread in the northeast region. After the ceasefire, the international organizations started the mine sweeping, with poor issues, due to politico-economical motivations in direct bond with wants in the technical effectiveness. The pitiable situation is worsened, as most rich lands are removed from farming exploitation, with increasing of the internally displaced persons. Now, clearing is engineering duty, and the humanitarian goal comes to be technical challenge. The advanced robotics fulfils clean and reliable tasks, on condition to upgrade sophistication and cost and to loose third-world appropriateness. The challenge is to turn local machines and awareness into effective robotic aids, willingly used by the local people, and to enhance the on-going outcomes. The analysis, mainly, addresses the following points: -	the engaged technologies need to provide special purpose outfits and to involve operators having adapted uniformity; -	the work-flow pre-setting ought to detail the duty-cycles and to establish the standard achievements; -	the planning has to specify the on-process warning/emergency management and the failure protection rules; -	the operators‟ instruction and training <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> off-process optimized work-flows to circumvent risky issues; -	the effectiveness comes from organized routine agendas, in conformity with allotted tasks and emergency events.

40|$|Palladium-catalyzed carbon-carbon bond {{formation}} {{is one of}} the most widely used reactions for the synthesis of biologically active substances. The DeShong group has demonstrated that hypervalent silicates can be employed for allyl-aryl carbon-carbon bond couplings in the presence of a Pd(0) catalyst. The goals of this dissertation are (1) to demonstrate application of palladium-catalyzed allylic-arylation coupling to the total synthesis of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin and its analogues, and (2) to study the mechanism of allyl-aryl cross coupling reactions. In spite of the potent antitumor and antiviral activity of (+) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin, the use of this compound is limited in clinical applications because of its low natural abundance and lack of a practical scalable synthetic route. In order to test the feasibility of siloxane-based coupling in the synthesis of 7 -deoxypancratistatin, a simplified analogue of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin was synthesized. The key reaction in the synthesis involved stereoselective construction of a carbon-carbon bond between A and C rings via coupling of an aryl siloxane with an allylic carbonate. While siloxane methodology was successfully applied to the synthesis of a (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin analogue, application of this methodology to the natural product (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin proved to be a significant challenge. To understand the causes of the failure of the coupling reaction, a detailed mechanistic study was undertaken. Hammett analysis of the allyl-aryl coupling reaction demonstrated that the rate of the coupling reaction was enhanced by electron-withdrawing groups on the aryl siloxane. The positive slope of the Hammett plot indicated a charged transition state in which negative charge on the aryl ring was stabilized inductively. Furthermore, this study provided useful information regarding the nature of ligands on the palladium. Based on this study, a new family of Pd(0) olefin catalysts was developed. These catalysts were found to be highly efficient and formed carbon-carbon bond even at ambient temperature. Novel Pd(0) olefin complexes were successfully employed in the synthesis of (+/-) - 7 -deoxypancratistatin. The key coupling reaction of allylic carbonate with aryl siloxane produced Hudlicky's intermediate, thus constituting formal total synthesis of the actual product. Though the reaction required higher catalytic loading and proceeded in moderate yields, the ability of the reaction to work at ambient temperature is advantageous for practical synthesis of the natural product. Future studies <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> optimization of the key coupling reaction and application of this methodology to the synthesis of pancratistatin and related derivatives...|$|R
60|$|I will {{state at}} the outset the view which I <b>shall</b> <b>aim</b> <b>at</b> establishing. I believe that the stuff of our mental life, as opposed to its {{relations}} and structure, consists wholly of sensations and images. Sensations are connected with matter {{in the way that}} I tried to explain in Lecture V, i.e. each is a member of a system which is a certain physical object. Images, though they USUALLY have certain characteristics, especially lack of vividness, that distinguish them from sensations, are not INVARIABLY so distinguished, and cannot therefore be defined by these characteristics. Images, as opposed to sensations, can only be defined by their different causation: they are caused by association with a sensation, not by a stimulus external to the nervous system--or perhaps one should say external to the brain, where the higher animals are concerned. The occurrence of a sensation or image does not in itself constitute knowledge but any sensation or image may come to be known if the conditions are suitable. When a sensation--like the hearing of a clap of thunder--is normally correlated with closely similar sensations in our neighbours, we regard it as giving knowledge of the external world, since we regard the whole set of similar sensations as due to a common external cause. But images and bodily sensations are not so correlated. Bodily sensations can be brought into a correlation by physiology, and thus take their place ultimately among sources of knowledge of the physical world. But images cannot be made to fit in with the simultaneous sensations and images of others. Apart from their hypothetical causes in the brain, they have a causal connection with physical objects, through {{the fact that they are}} copies of past sensations; but the physical objects with which they are thus connected are in the past, not in the present. These images remain private in a sense in which sensations are not. A sensation SEEMS to give us knowledge of a present physical object, while an image does not, except when it amounts to a hallucination, and in this case the seeming is deceptive. Thus the whole context of the two occurrences is different. But in themselves they do not differ profoundly, and there is no reason to invoke two different ways of knowing for the one and for the other. Consequently introspection as a separate kind of knowledge disappears.|$|R

Tiers 5 and 6 will have both RX prefixed and non-RX prefixed cards, indicating that while they will both feature a 128-bit memory bus and be targeted at 1080p gaming, the latter will fall short 1.5 teraflops of performance. Tiers 7 and 8 will each have a 256-bit memory bus and will be marketed as 1440p cards. The highest tier, tier 9, will feature a memory bus greater than 256-bit and <b>shall</b> be <b>aimed</b> <b>at</b> 4K gaming. Finally, the third numeral will indicate whether the card is in its first or second revision with either a 0 or 5, respectively. Therefore, for example, the RX 460 indicates that it has at least 1.5 teraflops of performance, 100 GB/s of memory throughput, has a 128-bit memory bus and {{will be able to}} achieve 60 FPS in the previously mentioned games at 1080p.|$|R
