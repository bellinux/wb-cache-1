For all known results on this problem, the achievable tradeoff regions between the normalized storage capacity and repair bandwidth have a single <b>corner</b> <b>point,</b> achieved by a scheme proposed by Shah, Rashmi and Kumar (the SRK point). Since the achievable tradeoff regions of the exact-repair regenerating code problem without any secrecy constraints {{are known to have}} multiple <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> in general, these existing results suggest a phase-change-like behavior, i. e., enforcing a secrecy constraint (ℓ≥ 1) immediately reduces the tradeoff region to one with a single <b>corner</b> <b>point.</b> In this work, we first show that when the secrecy parameter ℓ is sufficiently large, the SRK point is indeed the only <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> of the tradeoff region. However, when ℓ is small, we show that the tradeoff region can in fact have multiple <b>corner</b> <b>points.</b> In particular, we establish a precise characterization of the tradeoff region for the (7, 6, 6, 1) problem, which has exactly two <b>corner</b> <b>points.</b> Thus, a smooth transition, instead of a phase-change-type of transition, should be expected as the secrecy constraint is gradually strengthened.

The shape of these pieces is not predefined, yet the background’s color is. The whole method concerns a recurrent algorithm, which initially, finds the most important <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> around the contour of a piece, afterwards performs color segmentation with a Kohonen’s SOFM based technique and finally uses a comparing routine. This routine {{is based on the}} <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> found before. It compares a set of angles, the color of the image around the region of the <b>corner</b> <b>points,</b> the color of the contour and finally compares sequences of points by calculating the Euclidean distance of luminance between them. At a final stage the method decides which pieces match. If the result is not satisfying, the algorithm is being repeated with new adaptive modified parameter values as far as the <b>corner</b> <b>points</b> and the color segmentation is concerned. ...|$|R
40|$|The linear elastic {{analysis}} of homogeneous, isotropic cracked bodies is a Twentieth Century development. It was recognised that the crack tip stress field is a singularity, {{but it was}} not until the introduction of the essentially two dimensional stress intensity factor concept in 1957 that widespread application to practical engineering problems became possible. The existence of three dimensional <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> effects in the vicinity of a <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> where a crack front intersects a free surface was investigated in the late 1970 s: it was found that modes II and III cannot exist in isolation. The existence of one of these modes always induces the other. An approximate solution for <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> singularities by Bažant and Estenssoro explained some features of <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> effects but there were various paradoxes and inconsistencies. In an attempt to explain these a study was carried out on the coupled in-plane fracture mode induced by a nominal anti-plane (mode III) loading applied to plates and discs weakened by a straight crack. The results derived from a large bulk of finite element models showed clearly that Bažant and Estenssoro’s analysis is incomplete. Some of the results of the study are summarised, together with some recent results for a disc under in-plane shear loading. On the basis of these results, and a mathematical argument, the results suggest that the stress field in the vicinity of a <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> is the sum of two singularities: one due to stress intensity factors and the other due to an as yet undetermined <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> singularity...|$|R

We show here that the hypothesis cannot be discarded. Starting with a symmetric configuration for which the surface height is continuous at the <b>corner</b> <b>point</b> in accordance with the hypotheses of those au-thors, we show that the height can be made discontinuous by an asymmetric domain perturbation that is in an asymptotic sense arbitrarily small, and for which all hypotheses other than that of symmetry remain in force. In a downward directed gravity field, the height f(x, y) of a capillary surface interface is determined, up to an additive constant depending on an eventual volume constraint, as a solution of ∇ · Tf = κf, Tf ≡ ∇f√ 1 + |∇f | 2 (1) corresponding to a (physical) constant κ> 0. On the boundary ∂Ω one finds the condition ν · Tu = cos γ(2) where ν is unit exterior normal, and γ the (prescribed) contact angle between the solution surface and the bounding cylinder walls over ∂Ω. We may assume 0 ≤ γ ≤ pi. The unique existence of solutions of (1) and (2) in a piecewise smooth bounded domain Ω follows from the material in [2], [4], [7] and [8]. It should be noted that Condition (2) is imposed only on the smooth portions of the boundary; no condition is required at <b>corner</b> <b>points,</b> nor is there any a-priori growth restriction at those points.
