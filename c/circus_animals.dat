500|$|To explain each form, Russell {{provides}} illustrations. The {{power of}} mere force {{is like the}} tying of a rope around a pig's belly and lifting {{it up to a}} ship while ignoring its cries. The power of inducements is likened to two things: either conditioning, as exemplified by <b>circus</b> <b>animals</b> which have been trained to perform this-or-that trick for an audience, or group acquiescence, as when the leader among sheep is dragged along by chains to get the rest of the flock to follow. Finally, the power of propaganda is akin to the use of carrot and stick to influence the behaviour of a donkey, {{in the sense that the}} donkey is being persuaded that making certain actions (following the carrot, avoiding the stick) would be more or less to their benefit.

According to PETA, during an undercover investigation of Carson & Barnes Circus, video footage was captured showing animal care director Tim Frisco training endangered Asian elephants with electrical shock prods and instructing other trainers to [...] "beat the elephants with a bullhook as hard as they could and to sink the sharp metal bullhook into the animals' flesh and twist it until they screamed in pain." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1998 in the UK, a {{parliamentary}} working group chaired by MP Roger Gale studied living conditions {{and treatment of}} animals in UK circuses.

[...] The group reported concerns about boredom and stress, and noted that an independent study by a member of the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at Oxford University [...] "found no evidence that circuses contribute to education or conservation." [...] However, in 2007, a different working group under the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, having reviewed information from experts representing both the circus industry and animal welfare, found an absence of [...] "scientific evidence sufficient to demonstrate that travelling circuses are not compatible with meeting the welfare needs of any type of non-domesticated animal presently being used in the United Kingdom." [...] According to that group's report, published in October 2007, [...] "there appears to be little evidence to demonstrate that the welfare of animals kept in travelling circuses is any better or any worse than that of animals kept in other captive environments." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{memories}} begin, Jacob is a 23-year-old Polish American preparing for his final exams as a Cornell University veterinary student when he receives the devastating news {{that his parents}} {{died in a car}} accident. Jacob’s father was a veterinarian and Jacob had planned to join his practice. When Jacob learns that his parents {{have been killed in the}} car crash and their home has been mortgaged to pay for his tuition and is not to become his, he has a breakdown and leaves his Ivy League school just short of graduation. In the dark of night, he jumps on a train, a circus train belonging to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. On the train he is befriended by Camel, an old man and circus veteran, who persuades his companions not to throw Jacob off the train and takes him under his wing, finding him odd menial jobs. When the owner of the circus, Uncle Al, learns of his training as a vet, he is hired to care for the <b>circus</b> <b>animals.</b> This leads Jacob to share quarters with a dwarf named Walter (who is known as Kinko to the circus) and his dog Queenie. A few weeks later Jacob is summoned to take a look at Camel, who, after drinking [...] "Jake" [...] (adulterated Jamaican ginger extract) for many years, can't move his arms or legs. Fearing Camel will be [...] "red-lighted" [...] (thrown off a moving train as punishment or as severance from the circus to avoid paying wages), Jacob hides him in his room.|$|E

5000|$|Kurt Koenigsberger {{describes}} [...] "The <b>Circus</b> <b>Animal's</b> Desertion" [...] as the poet's {{attempt to}} [...] "concede life's detritus," [...] as the [...] "beasts", which represent poetic imagination, disappear {{in his old}} age. He argues that Yeats uses the analogy of the <b>circus</b> <b>animal</b> {{to take the place}} of poetic work and becomes a spectator of his own imagination as he finds himself unable to conjure up a new theme for his poetry. In [...] "Yeats and Postmodernism," [...] Earl Ingersol describes the poem as being one of the early pieces of Postmodern literature suggesting that [...] "The Circus Animals' Desertion" [...] is a poem about writing poems.

2500|$|The most {{successful}} early-twentieth century staging was the 1935/1936 Theatre Guild production, which began on Broadway and subsequently toured all over North America. Starring {{husband and wife}} Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, the show ran for a record 129 performances, and was remounted in 1940 as a fundraiser for the Finnish Relief Fund. Ostensibly directed by Harry Wagstaff Gribble, the production notes indicated that Lunt and Fontanne {{were responsible for the}} [...] "scheme of the production," [...] which most people took to mean they were the real directors. Presented as a rollicking farce involving <b>circus</b> <b>animals,</b> dwarfs, acrobats and clowns, the performers would often involve the audience in the play; latecomers would be heckled by the actors on some nights, whilst on others, the actors would stop the play to politely explain to the latecomers what they had missed. Any particularly loud coughing in the audience would often lead to the entire cast breaking into a fit of coughing. At the end of the play, Katherina and Petruchio ascended into the heavens in a golden chariot, accompanied by choral music. To enhance Katherina's fiery reputation, the production kept her offstage during Act 1, Scene 1. However, none of her lines were cut. Instead, they were all shouted from offstage, and were often accompanied by her flinging objects at the on-stage performers. The fight with Petruchio was also commented upon by many reviewers as being extremely physical. Lunt and Fontanne were the most famous celebrity couple of the time, and their backstage fights were rumoured to be just as ferocious as their on-stage performances. So legendary did the tempestuous reputation of the couple become that Cole Porter's 1948 musical Kiss Me, Kate, about a fiery couple attempting to stage an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew, was based on their real-life antics.|$|E
2500|$|The singer {{had never}} been careful with money and the {{increasing}} pressure on him to provide for his young family caused even more tension {{between him and the}} rest of Cold Chisel. Despite being hugely successful in Australia, the group had still not been able to crack the market internationally and a disastrous tour of the United States in 1981 pulled them even further apart. While the 1982 album <b>Circus</b> <b>Animals</b> provided Cold Chisel with its second consecutive No. 1 album, Barnes returned from the band's German tour in 1983 virtually broke. He asked for a $10,000 advance from the band's management but was refused, as the terms of the group's contract meant that if one member was given such a sum, the rest of them were entitled to the same amount. At a meeting in August, it was decided that Cold Chisel should split up. The group had already begun to fragment, with Ray Arnott having replaced Steve Prestwich earlier in the year. Sessions for the final album were spread across different studios as various members refused to work together {{but at the end of}} the year The Last Stand farewell tour (with Prestwich back in the band) became the highest-grossing concert series by an Australian band ever. The group's final performance was in Sydney on 12 December 1983, reportedly precisely ten years after its original formation. The resultant film of that show remains the best-selling live concert film of any Australian band. Barnes had recorded seven albums with Cold Chisel between 1978 and 1983, including two live albums (the second of which, Barking Spiders Live 1983, was released in 1984), and was arguably now Australia's highest-profile rock singer.|$|E
