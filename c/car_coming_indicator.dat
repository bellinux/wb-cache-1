5000|$|WBUT news {{reporter}} Dave Cubbison {{was on the}} air delivering a live newscast {{when he looked up}} and saw the <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> towards the building, yelling to Minehart [...] "Oh no, there's a <b>car</b> <b>coming...</b> run!" [...] into an open microphone. Knowing the car was going to hit, Cubbison then ran and dove under a desk. Cubbison and Minehart were not hurt, but the driver did sustain minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|Blind Spot Monitoring: The Mk IV Mondeo {{could detect}} <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> within the drivers blind spot areas, {{avoiding}} such issues.|$|R
50|$|Fourth {{full course}} caution came out, as Greg Moore nearly lost the <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> out turn 4. Restart came out at lap 199.|$|R
50|$|Heinz-Harald Frentzen spun {{at the new}} chicane while {{attempting}} to pass Barrichello, the Jordan struggling to keep track position amongst clearly faster <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> through.|$|R
50|$|This {{would be}} the last Formula One race on the {{original}} Nürburgring Nordschleife before the Hohenrain chicane was added to slow the <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> into the pits.|$|R
50|$|Sponsored by Waterair in 1998 the Debora two car {{team did}} a little better {{with one of the}} <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> in 15th a mere 19 laps behind the winner.|$|R
50|$|But {{because many}} roads are narrow roads and {{interchange}} without number {{up or down}} in the southern Gyeonggi Province <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> around me and crowded roads and roads are seldom uncomplicated time.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you finding fault about, Dave Porter?" [...] demanded Pete Barnaby, {{the owner}} of the racing <b>car,</b> <b>coming</b> closer. His nose was very red, and his breath smelt {{strongly}} of liquor.|$|R
5000|$|... 1972: David Pearson escaped a crash between Bobby Isaac and a lapped <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> to {{the white}} flag; he grabbed his first Talladega win and second career win in a Wood Brothers Mercury.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, he swerved {{and crashed}} his car frontally into a <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> from the {{opposite}} direction, killing all three passengers in it, while all passengers in Huidu's car escaped with minor scratches.|$|R
50|$|Laura {{is waiting}} for him at a cafe. As they leave, Matson turns to go phone the airline {{to get away with}} Laura, but is hit by a <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> down the one-way street.|$|R
50|$|Pedestrians {{will walk}} between the station {{platform}} and the parking site via PA Route 2028, {{which will be}} improved to handle the foot traffic. <b>Cars</b> <b>coming</b> from Interstate 80 will also use Route 2028.|$|R
50|$|In January 2004, Kuwait {{decided to}} install a new 217 km iron border barrier along the {{existing}} border. The stated needs were protecting the northern border, and preventing <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> from Iraq from approaching the electricity bars.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm very glad. Fancy a motor <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> {{into the}} garden! It will {{be such a}} treat----" [...] She turned and made as though looking about her. [...] "You-- you haven't seen any one have you--perhaps?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the night}} of August 3, 1994, Amtrak's {{westbound}} Lake Shore Limited derailed near Batavia. Despite 118 passengers and crew being injured, and fourteen of the train's eighteen <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> off the tracks, there were no fatalities.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, The New York Times {{described}} minivans [...] "the hot <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> out of Detroit," [...] {{noting that}} [...] "analysts say the mini-van {{has created an}} entirely new market, one that may well overshadow the... station wagon." ...|$|R
50|$|Before teaming with Rollie MacDonald {{following}} the 1998 season Fraser primarily raced <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> {{out of his}} own shop. He learned how to build and work on race cars from Canadian racing legend Junior Hanley as well as his father Frank.|$|R
40|$|MAGINE THAT I AM IN MY CAR, {{approaching}} a junction I know well. It {{is the middle}} of the night, there are rarely other cars and the chances that I would see a <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> if there was one are pretty good. Of course, there is a small chance that there is another <b>car</b> <b>coming,</b> and that if I speed through I will not see it, and, in that case, at the speed I am going, a crash would probably involve fatalities. On the other hand, if I get home more quickly, I can send an important email before the London stock exchange opens, and potentially save a lot of people a lot of money. Is it morally permissible for me to speed through the junction without stopping? What if we stipulate that there is no <b>car</b> <b>coming?</b> I cannot know it, but let us say that speeding through would in fact be perfectly safe. The question is about how rightness is determined. Is it determined by what is actually the case, or by what I believe to be the case? A longstanding debate within moral theory, and consequentialis...|$|R
60|$|Again {{there was}} a brief silence. The clamour of exclamations from the little groups of people still filled the air outside. They could hear <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> and going. The man whom Hunterleys and Mr. Grex were tying up was still groaning and cursing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, mater, {{dear old}} soul," [...] said Reggie hastily, [...] "I think you'd better tear {{yourself}} away and what not. If you're catching the twelve-fifteen, {{you ought to}} be staggering round to see you haven't forgotten anything. There's the <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> round now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chicago, Nebraska, Minnesota, Montana," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "There are the <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> in. Just out of Castle Garden, and it's {{because of the}} city {{improvements}} disorganizing traffic they're bringing them this way. They're the advance guard, you see, {{and there are more}} of them coming." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{youngest}} Rover pointed {{with his}} finger, and there, to the astonishment {{of every one}} in the party, they beheld a small touring <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> across the plains at a speed of twelve or fifteen miles an hour. It was running in a curiously haphazard fashion.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{key points}} to the track layout at this {{juncture}} - firstly there was no designated deceleration lane for <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> into the pits, and secondly that just before the main straight there was the slightest right-hand kink in the road just after where Hawthorn started braking.|$|R
60|$|One afternoon, as Lane was {{returning}} from the woods, he met a <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> out of the grassy road that led down to his cottage. As {{he was about to}} step aside, a gay voice hailed him. He waited. The car came on. It contained Holt Dalrymple and Bessy Bell.|$|R
50|$|El Guabo {{is a town}} in El Oro, a {{province}} in Ecuador. It is the seat of El Guabo Canton. It is located a few kilometers from the provincial capital, Machala. The town has a bypass, so <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> mainly from Guayaquil or Naranjal can drive towards Machala without passing it.|$|R
50|$|The Cannon-Bard theory, {{which was}} {{conceptualized}} by Walter Cannon and Phillip Bard, suggests that emotions and their corresponding physiological responses are experienced simultaneously. Using the previous example, when someone sees the <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> toward {{them in their}} lane, their heart starts to race and they feel afraid at the same time.|$|R
60|$|At {{this the}} other {{passengers}} also yelled and sprang from the car, fearing a collision; and the motorman, knowing something was wrong, followed suit. The wax lady, seeing the others run, jumped from the car last of all, and {{stepped in front of}} another <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> at full speed from the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|During 2012, Michael {{was staying}} at Santa Rosa, California to train for {{upcoming}} competitions. On one of his training rides, on 30 June, Michael {{was hit by a}} <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> around a bend. The then 25-year-old was thrown off his bike and hit the car windshield, breaking his arm and almost killing him.|$|R
5000|$|Driver David Shale raced an Austin Healey 100S. [...] It {{is known}} that Shale gained at least 13 podium {{finishes}} in the <b>car,</b> <b>coming</b> 1st in 4 of those races. [...] "EVV", as the car is colloquially known, sold for £673,500 at the Bonhams Goodwood Festival of Speed auction on 27 June 2014.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{most famous}} outing was the [...] "Press-on-Regardless" [...] WRC in the United States, in Michigan, 1974. The Rally was the USA {{section of the}} World Rally Championship. The car that won the rally was a Renault 17 Gordini driven by Jean-Luc Thérier and Christian Deiferrer, with a similar <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> third.|$|R

60|$|I {{often think}} I'll quit him. I {{say to my}} wife that that man had better not provoke me too far; or some day I'll just step {{into his office and}} tell him exactly what I think of him. I'd like to. I often say it over to myself in the street <b>car</b> <b>coming</b> home.|$|R
50|$|The Lotus 81 was a Formula One {{racing car}} built by Colin Chapman's Lotus {{team for the}} 1980 Formula One season. Unlike many of its illustrious Lotus forebears the 81 was not a terribly {{innovative}} or competitive <b>car,</b> <b>coming</b> as it did {{at a time when}} Chapman's interest in his racing activities was waning.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must take}} care of Tom's machine!" [...] cried Sam, and leaped {{over the back of}} the automobile. The machine had cut down the bushes, so the path was clear and he ran with might and main to the roadway. At the top of the hill was the second <b>car,</b> <b>coming</b> along at a good speed.|$|R
50|$|Olson Tower {{is located}} at the end of FR 717, a spur from FR 18. Both roads are gravel but can easily be traversed by normal {{passenger}} <b>cars</b> <b>coming</b> from U.S. Route 219 in the west. While FR 18 provides excellent views of Blackwater Canyon east of FR 717, this section of the road is only traversable by high-clearance vehicles. Passenger car travel is not recommended.|$|R
