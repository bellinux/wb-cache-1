25|$|Modern terra sigillata is made {{by adding}} a {{deflocculant}} such as sodium silicate to a watery clay/water slip mixture and then allowing the clay particles to separate into layers by weight. For undisturbed deflocculated slip settling in a transparent container, these layers are usually visible within 24 hours. Siphoning off the topmost layers of slip, which contain the smallest and lightest clay particles, produces terra sigillata. The remaining heavier settled layers of deflocculated <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> are discarded.|$|E
25|$|The {{making of}} {{earthenware}} began to replace stone utensils in Mexico began around the Purrón period (2300-1500 BCE). Many of these first ceramics were gourd or squash shaped, a carry over from when these vegetables {{were used to}} carry liquids. This earthenware developed into a pottery tradition that mostly used clay thinly coated with a fine <b>clay</b> <b>slip.</b> Most clays in Mexico need temper to regulate water absorption, with one significant exception being the clay used in the Fine Orangeware of the Gulf Coast.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, put simply, {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. The outlines of the intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy <b>clay</b> <b>slip.</b> Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E

5000|$|Like the Ancient Greeks, the Maya created <b>clay</b> <b>slips</b> from {{a mixture}} of clays and minerals. The <b>clay</b> <b>slips</b> were then used to {{decorate}} the pottery. By the fourth century, {{a broad range of}} colors including yellow, purple, red, and orange were being made. However, some Mayan painters refrained from using many colors and used only black, red, and occasionally cream. This series of ceramics is termed the [...] "Codex-style", it being similar to the style of the Pre-Columbian books.|$|R
25|$|Detail {{in other}} colours, like white or red, were applied at this point. The relief line was {{probably}} drawn with a bristle brush or a hair, dipped in thick paint. The {{suggestion of a}} hollow needle seems somewhat unlikely. The application of relief outlines was necessary, as the rather liquid glossy clay would otherwise have turned out too dull. After the technique's initial phase of development, both alternatives were used, so as to differentiate gradations and details more clearly. The space between figures {{was filled with a}} glossy grey <b>clay</b> <b>slip.</b> Then, the vases underwent triple-phase firing, during which the glossy clay reached its characteristic black or black-brown colour through reduction, the reddish color by a final re-oxidation. Since this final oxidizing phase was fired using lower temperatures, the glazed parts of the vase did not re-oxidize from black to red: their finer surface was melted (sintered) in the reducing phase, and now protected from oxygen.|$|E
2500|$|The Seljuks also {{developed}} the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background. [...] These {{are produced by}} a technique which consists of coating the white fritware body with a thick black slip, out of which the decoration is then carved. [...] Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied. [...] According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries. [...] The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> instead.|$|E
2500|$|Painted parallel-line decors of Ayios Onouphrios I Ware {{were drawn}} with an iron-red <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> that would fire red under {{oxidizing}} conditions {{in a clean}} kiln but under the reducing conditions of a smoky fire [...] turn darker, without much control over color, which could range from red to brown. A dark-on-light painted pattern was then applied. ( [...] , [...]) From this beginning, Minoan potters already concentrated on the linear forms of designs, perfecting coherent designs and voids that would ideally suit {{the shape of the}} ware. Shapes were jugs, two-handled cups and bowls. The ware came from north and south central Crete, as did Lebena Ware of the same general types but decorated by painting white patterns over a solid red painted background (...) [...] The latter came from EM I tombs.|$|E

5000|$|Using paper clay {{require less}} {{technical}} skill than conventional clay, so beginners can {{focus more on}} the creative expression of their ideas. For example, handles of soft paper clay can be added to a completely dry paper clay pot without distorting the form. Other forms built with coils no longer need to be correctly joined before drying, instead, after drying the form, paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> may be applied to join the coils and fill any gaps. Breaks and cracks in both dry and fired paper clay work can be repaired with paper <b>clay</b> <b>slip.</b>|$|E
50|$|Type III. In {{the first}} quarter of the 5th century, the {{workshop}} of the potter Euphronios develops a four-colour painting style using a combination of shiny <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> and mineral paints. The images are made up of outline drawings in shiny slip and coloured areas in mineral paint. This style is used especially on pyxides and cups. Some details, such as fruit, jewellery, weaponry or vessels are can be executed in <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> in such a fashion as to attain a slight plasticity, additionally they may be gilded. The paints used are limited to tones of red and brown, yellow, white and black.|$|E

5000|$|To {{create these}} motifs, a potter would begin by {{engraving}} the {{design in the}} body. Next, the engravings would be filled with contrasting colored <b>clay</b> (or <b>slip).</b> Finally, the bowl is then covered it with a transparent glaze.|$|R
50|$|Structural mud bricks {{are almost}} always made using clay, often clay soil and a binder are the only {{ingredients}} used, but other ingredients can include sand, lime, concrete, stone and other binders.

50|$|Gnomes may be {{made from}} {{terracotta}} <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> (runny clay) poured into molds. This is allowed {{to set up and}} the excess emptied from the centre, leaving a clay shell. The gnome is removed from the mold when firm, allowed to dry and then fired in a kiln until hard. Once cooled, the gnome is painted. More modern gnomes are made from resins and similar materials.|$|E
5000|$|In pottery, luting is a {{technique}} for joining pieces of unfired leather-hard clay together, using a wet <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> or slurry as adhesive. The complete object is then fired. Large objects are often built up in this way, for example the figures of the Terracotta Army in ancient China. The edges being joined might be scored or cross-hatched to promote adhesion, but clay and water are the only materials used.|$|E

50|$|Salt {{can also}} be used as a {{decorative}} element on selected individual pots. Biscuit ware can be soaked in a brine solution to create salted patterns. Rope and other textiles {{can also be}} soaked in brine and wrapped around biscuit ware. Salt can also be added, in solution, to coloured <b>clay</b> <b>slips</b> and can be sprinkled onto biscuit ware in protective, ceramic containers called saggars. A related technique, soda firing, substitutes soda ash and / or sodium bicarbonate for common salt. Whilst the application method is a little different, the alternatives need to be sprayed into the kiln, results are similar to salt glazing but for subtle differences in texture and colour.|$|R

50|$|West Slope pottery was {{especially}} {{widespread in the}} Eastern Mediterranean region. The name was coined in 1901 by Carl Watzinger, based on finds from the western slope of the Acropolis at Athens. West Slope pottery is a subtype of Black-glazed Ware. It was additionally decorated with white, yellow and pink <b>clay</b> <b>slip,</b> incisions, vertical ribbing and imprinted roulette decoration. The type developed during the 4th century BC out of a pottery style with applied yellowish-orange plastic ornaments that imitated gilding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{is associated with}} several Malian ethnic groups, but the Bambaran version has become best known outside Mali. In the Bambara language, the word [...] "bògòlanfini" [...] is a composite of bɔgɔ, meaning [...] "earth" [...] or [...] "mud"; lan, meaning [...] "with" [...] or [...] "by means of"; and fini, meaning [...] "cloth".Although usually translated as “mud cloth,” bogolan actually refers to a <b>clay</b> <b>slip</b> with a high iron content that produces a black pigment when applied to handspun and handwoven cotton textiles.|$|E
50|$|Buncheong is characterised {{by the use}} of a dark, {{iron bearing}} <b>clay,</b> white <b>slip</b> for {{decoration}} and a clear glaze.

While <b>Clay</b> <b>slips</b> off to fish (instead of working on the house), the town prepares for the arrival of their new minister. Enjoying himself at the river, Clay meets a stranger, who joins him, and Clay tells him about the old granddad of all fish - and offers him a drink from a bottle he calls [...] "insect repellent". Later, the man comments that he finds the [...] "repellent" [...] to be [...] "somewhat numbing". It is in fact moonshine, and the man hooks [...] "old granddad". When the fish gets away, Clay launches into a profanity-laden tirade. The man chides him for his salty speech, and then - right before he plunges head first into the river - reveals that he's Preacher Goodman (Wally Cox), the town's new minister. When he and Clay, drunk and drenched, stumble into town, he is now disgraced to everyone.|$|R
50|$|Slipcasting or {{slip casting}} is a {{technique}} for the mass-production of pottery and ceramics, especially for shapes not easily made on a wheel. Slipcast ware {{should not be confused}} with slipware, which is pottery formed by any technique that is decorated using slip. In slipcasting, a liquid <b>clay</b> body <b>slip</b> (usually mixed in a blunger) is poured into plaster moulds and allowed to form a layer, the cast, on the inside walls of the mould.|$|R
