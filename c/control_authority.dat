5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord rudder, giving it limited yaw <b>control</b> <b>authority.</b> Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow rudder.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator <b>control</b> <b>authority.</b> For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The company {{aimed to}} have two {{aircraft}} operative in June 1984, and be fully operational with 35 to 40 employees and four aircraft by 1985, when all-year oil drilling would start in the Norwegian Sea. Use of aircraft for oil spill reduction {{was at the time}} established in the United Kingdom, and Norsk Forurensningskontroll aimed to create a similar preparedness for Norway in cooperation with the Norwegian Pollution <b>Control</b> <b>Authority.</b> The cost of the four aircraft was stipulated to approximately NOK35 million. Operation started in May 1984 with an aircraft on dry lease from Widerøe (LN-BNS), which was also used as system development platform. The airline stated that they hoped to have 30 to 50 operations per year.|$|E

40|$|In the article, {{the author}} has proven that state <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> had an {{important}} function in the organizational structure of the government authorities of our country. The author also drives {{attention to the fact}} that, in the Soviet period, government leaders implemented the idea of a system of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> that were to a substantial extent composed of blue collars. An extensive network of <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> operating on location was active in the 80 ies of the 20 th century. The historical experience of regional <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> is considered in article, and Moscow <b>controlling</b> <b>authorities</b> are taken as an example. The author demonstrates that the Moscow City Committee, regional committees, groups and posts of people's control organized at enterprises and other organizations drove particular attention to the issues of construction, the building industry as a whole and to the accomplishments of the municipal economy; they also supervised over the implementation of ecological and nature protection actions, monitored the condition and repairs of public health service buildings; they resolved the issues of education, culture, available housing, housing preparation for the winter season, etc. Actions taken in the aftermath of inspections held by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> were aimed at the improvement of the ecological condition of Moscow, and they resolved the problems of urban construction. Multiple assignments performed by people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> made it possible to substantially improve the quality of their inspections and to combine the controlling efforts {{within the framework of the}} municipal economy. Coordination of combined inspections promoted reduction in the overall number of inspections. The present-day building sector of the Russian capital can benefit from the experience of Moscow people's <b>control</b> <b>authorities,</b> their well-coordinated <b>controlling</b> activities within the construction industry and the prior accomplishments of the municipal economy. Отмечено, что государственный контроль занимал важное место в структуре органов власти нашей страны, создавалась широкая сеть органов контроля на местах, которая в 1980 -е гг. была разветвленной и имела массовый характер. На примере г. Москвы показано, что органы народного контроля уделяли особое внимание вопросам строительства и благоустройства городского хозяйства. Принятые по результатам проверок меры способствовали устранению выявленных недостатков и благоустройству города...|$|R
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the national park and the protection {{is based on the}} Svalbard Environmental Protection Act, which takes its mandate from the requirements in the Svalbard Treaty to protect the environment of the archipelago. The overall responsibility for protection lies with the Norwegian Ministry of the Environment, which has delegated management to the Norwegian Directorate for Nature Management and the Governor of Svalbard. The latter performs all day-to-day practical management, including registration and inspection. In aspects related to cultural heritage, the Governor reports to the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage, and in issues relating to pollution, to the Norwegian Pollution <b>Control</b> <b>Authority.</b> While it has no authority, the Norwegian Polar Institute performs monitoring, mapping and research.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in <b>control</b> <b>authority.</b> In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E

25|$|Wind {{gradient}} is also {{a hazard}} for aircraft making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident. The rolling moment generated by the different airflow over each wing can exceed the aileron <b>control</b> <b>authority,</b> causing the glider to continue rolling into a steeper bank angle.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of the An-10 and An-10A was relatively good and was shown to have lower seat/mile cost than the contemporary Tupolev Tu-104 jet airliner, but continued to exhibit control and stability problems, culminating in a fatal crash on 16 November 1959 when CCCP-11167 dived into the ground while on approach to L'vov airport, due to reduced stability, abrupt nose drops at low airspeed and reduced elevator authority at low airspeed. On 26 February 1960, again at L'vov, CCCP-11180 crashed at the same location due to reduced longitudinal stability and <b>control</b> <b>authority</b> caused by icing of the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The first Tu-124A {{prototype}}, SSSR-45075, first flew on 29 July 1963. On 22 October 1963, {{the prototype}} British BAC One-Eleven, {{which had a}} similar layout, crashed {{with the loss of}} all crew while testing its stalling properties. The aircraft had entered pitch-up: the high-mounted tailplane became trapped in the turbulent wake produced by the wings (deep stall), which prevented recovery from the stall. As a result, the tailplane on Tu-124A was enlarged by 30% for greater <b>control</b> <b>authority.</b> Since Aeroflot's requirements dictated a larger aircraft than initially planned, the Soloviev Design Bureau developed the more powerful D-30 low-bypass turbofan engines. On 20 November 1963, the new airliner was designated Tu-134.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{what drives}} national regulators’ attitudes towards and engagement with EU regulatory co-ordination as facilitated by EU agencies and offices. It {{suggests that a}} bureaucratic politics perspective can counteract shortcomings of explanations conventionally advanced in the EU governance literature by showing that national regulators’ attitudes towards co-ordination are driven by the aim to protect their turf. This is empirically demonstrated by a comparison of attitudes to co-ordination across maritime safety and food <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> in the UK and Germany that draws on original document analysis and semi-structured interviews with British, German and EU officials. UK and German food <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> have a positive attitude towards EU co-ordination, but the maritime safety authorities contest it. While the food <b>control</b> <b>authorities</b> use EU co-ordination to enhance their bureaucratic turf vis-à-vis lower-level authorities, the maritime safety authorities perceive EU coordination to threaten their established position in the International Maritime Organization...|$|R
25|$|Multiculturalism – Although the {{theoretical}} foundations of psychology {{are rooted in}} European culture, {{there is a growing}} recognition that there exist profound differences between various ethnic and social groups and that systems of psychotherapy need to take those differences into greater consideration. Further, the generations following immigrant migration will have some combination of two or more cultures—with aspects coming from the parents and from the surrounding society—and this process of acculturation can play a strong role in therapy (and might itself be the presenting problem). Culture influences ideas about change, help-seeking, locus of <b>control,</b> <b>authority,</b> and the importance of the individual versus the group, all of which can potentially clash with certain givens in mainstream psychotherapeutic theory and practice. As such, there is a growing movement to integrate knowledge of various cultural groups in order to inform therapeutic practice in a more culturally sensitive and effective way.|$|E
