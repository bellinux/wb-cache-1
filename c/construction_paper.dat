5|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kenny {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.|$|E
5|$|The show's {{style of}} {{animation}} {{is inspired by}} the paper cut-out cartoons made by Terry Gilliam for Monty Python's Flying Circus, of which Parker and Stone have been lifelong fans. <b>Construction</b> <b>paper</b> and traditional stop motion cutout animation techniques {{were used in the}} original animated shorts and in the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes have been produced by computer animation, providing a similar look to the originals while requiring a fraction of the time to produce. Before computer artists begin animating an episode, a series of animatics drawn in Toon Boom are provided by the show's storyboard artists.|$|E

Lisa tries to escape the situation by telling Ralph she is not ready to be romantic, but Ralph uses his position as Chief Wiggum's son to get her tickets to Krusty the Clown's upcoming 29th Anniversary Special, as well as a leading part for himself in a President's Day pageant in which Lisa also stars. Ralph receives the role of George Washington opposite Lisa as Martha Washington.|$|E

5|$|The show's {{producers}} and creators presented material in a narrative format {{instead of the}} more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. and revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research {{was part of the}} creative and decision-making process in the production of the show and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{episode was}} written by South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and was {{directed}} by Parker; it was made on a budget of $300,000. Similarly to Parker and Stone's Christmas shorts, the original pilot was animated entirely with traditional cut paper stop motion animation techniques. This laborious process involved creating hundreds of <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> cutouts – including individual mouth shapes, {{and many of the}} characters in several different sizes –, and photographing every frame of the show with an overhead camera, to the dialog that had been recorded earlier. Assistants helped with the cutting and pasting of the cutouts, while the animation was primarily done by Parker, Stone, and South Park animation director Eric Stough. The episode took between three and three and a half months to complete, and animation took place in a small room at Celluloid Studios, in Denver, Colorado, during the summer of 1996. Additional animation techniques involved creating the starry night sky by putting holes into a black posterboard and illuminating it from behind, and having the pooling of Kenny's blood simulated by drawing an initial dot with a red marker pen, and drawing more to it with every frame. The characters who are not speaking rarely move, saving time in the animation process.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, the duo sought to give Comedy Central {{executives}} {{an idea of}} what the series would be like and how each show could differ from the others. Parker and Stone also said they would not write another script until the network signed off on the full show with a season of at least six episodes. Comedy Central liked the script and agreed to commit to a series. While [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] was created almost entirely with <b>construction</b> <b>paper,</b> [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was the first South Park episode made completely using computers. It was created in little over a month in a studio in Westwood, California, by about 15 animators using PowerAnimator, the Alias Systems Corporation animation program most commonly known as [...] "Alias", which would be used in subsequent episodes. In the future, South Park shows would be created within a week of their broadcast dates and require about 40 animators. [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] was animated in chronological order from beginning to end. Although Parker and Stone sought to improve the details and textures of the characters and overall animation, they also specifically chose Alias because it would allow the animation to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> in The Spirit of Christmas and [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-founders Trey Parker and Matt Stone. After the South Park pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", drew poor test audience results, Comedy Central requested a script for one more new episode before deciding whether or not to commit to a full series. The resulting script for [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] helped the network decide to pick up the show. Although the second episode to be produced, it was originally broadcast as the third episode. It was also the first South Park episode created completely using computers rather than <b>construction</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
500|$|During Craig McCracken's {{first year}} in the {{character}} animation program of CalArts, he created a series of short cartoons based on a character called [...] "No Neck Joe". In June 1991, he created a drawing of two girls and a boy on a small sheet of orange <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> as a birthday card design for his brother. The following year he included the two girls as the main characters of his short film Whoopass Stew! The Whoopass Girls in: A Sticky Situation. Initially, McCracken wanted to animate four Whoopass Girls shorts, but only one came to be. McCracken's shorts were selected to be shown at Spike and Mike's Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation in 1994.|$|E

When asked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa, in which Stan also appeared. Stan next appeared on August 13, 1997, when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It was {{inspired}} by the 1997 disaster films Volcano and Dante's Peak, both of which Parker and Stone strongly disliked. The plot was also based on the large amount of hunting Parker and Stone witnessed while growing up in Colorado; Stan's hesitation about the sport mirrors Parker's real-life feelings about hunting. [...] "Volcano" [...] was the third episode produced, but it was broadcast as the second. Parker and Stone felt the computer animation in [...] "Volcano" [...] had greatly improved compared to the early episodes; they were particularly pleased with the lava, which was made to resemble orange <b>construction</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|E
500|$|The speech Big Gay Al gave {{while taking}} Stan {{on a boat}} ride through his animal {{sanctuary}} were based on actual speeches animation director Eric Stough made {{while working as a}} [...] "jungle cruise director" [...] at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. The dirt smudges on the football player's helmets and uniforms were intentionally designed to look like smudges on <b>construction</b> <b>paper.</b> This was done to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> in [...] "The Spirit of Christmas" [...] and the pilot episode, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe". The characters Butters Stotch and Clyde Donovan are featured during the football game, although neither had been identified by name yet in the series. During a football crowd scene, a white character can be seen that looks identical to Token Black, an African-American character introduced later in the series. The background character is wearing the same shirt Token wears, which Parker explained was the result of an animator placing a different head on the body {{in order to create a}} filler character for the crowd. The moment when Big Gay Al says, [...] "My work here is done" [...] and disappears into a suitcase is Stone's favorite part of the episode, even though he admitted, [...] "It makes no sense". Parker said that the moment was written that way simply because the duo could not decide how to [...] "get rid of" [...] the character. Parker said, [...] "We didn't want him around all the time, (so we asked) how do we not make him a character each week".|$|E

500|$|South Park animators {{spent the}} first four episodes of the show trying to perfect the {{animation}} of the characters. By [...] "Volcano" [...] – which was produced after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] –, Parker and Stone felt the textures were improved, as well as smaller details like the lines around {{the eyes of the}} characters. While the series pilot [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" [...] was animated with <b>construction</b> <b>paper,</b> subsequent episodes were made using computers. Nevertheless, Parker and Stone wanted the show to maintain its crude paper look; for example, they specifically asked for the night sky in this episode to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars, just {{as it was in the}} pilot episode. Stone and Parker were especially proud of the animation of the lava, which they said took hours to perfect, although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange <b>construction</b> <b>paper.</b> The lava ball shooting out of the volcano and almost killing Kenny was directly inspired by the Volcano film. Parker and Stone came up with the character of Scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they simply started drawing the character, and decided to add a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for no particular reason. Scuzzlebutt also appeared in a second episode, [...] "City on the Edge of Forever" [...] from the second season. Scuzzlebutt turning out to be a real character rather than a ridiculous story was the first instance of a common characteristic of the Cartman character, in which Cartman says outrageous and completely unrealistic things that turn out to be true. Stone commented, [...] "He's right more often than he's wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{which first}} aired April 1, 1998, was an April Fools' Day prank by Parker and Stone on South Park fans, who were anxiously waiting {{to learn the}} {{identity}} of Cartman's father after the cliffhanger ending of [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", the first season finale. Instead, Parker and Stone presented an episode entirely focused on a Terrance and Phillip cartoon, with nothing in the story about Cartman's father. Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to Comedy Central {{within a week of}} the episode's original broadcast, and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast. Stone said to Entertainment Weekly in response to the fan backlash, [...] "If you get that pissed off because you don't know who a little <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> kid's father is, then there's really something wrong with you." [...] Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune said Comedy Central was [...] "punking out" [...] with the decision.|$|E
500|$|An unnamed {{precursor}} to Kyle {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado. The character was composed of <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> cutouts and animated using stop motion. When asked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, which was the first appearance of Kyle styled as he is in the series, he is given his first name. When developing the character, Parker recalled there being only one Jewish student in his entire hometown of Conifer, Colorado, and described her as being [...] "the token Jewish person". Stone, himself Jewish, also recalled his own experiences as a youth in a predominantly Christian neighborhood, and both he and Parker decided to incorporate these aspects into the character. Kyle next appeared on August 13, 1997, when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone met in film {{class at}} the University of Colorado in 1992 and {{discovered}} a shared love of Monty Python, which they often cite {{as one of their}} primary inspirations. They created an animated short entitled The Spirit of Christmas. The film was created by animating <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> cutouts with stop motion, and features prototypes of the main characters of South Park, including a character resembling Cartman but named [...] "Kenny", an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle. Brian Graden, Fox network executive and mutual friend, commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video Christmas card. Created in 1995, the second The Spirit of Christmas short resembled the style of the later series more closely. To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short {{is often referred to as}} Jesus vs. Frosty, and the second short as Jesus vs. Santa. Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the internet, where it became one of the first viral videos.|$|E
500|$|A {{precursor}} to Cartman {{first appeared in}} the first The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Frosty, created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the University of Colorado.

[...] was exclaimed when the character representing Cartman was killed by an evil snowman. The character was composed of <b>construction</b> <b>paper</b> cutouts and animated through the use of stop motion. When commissioned three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a video Christmas card that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated The Spirit of Christmas short, dubbed Jesus vs. Santa. In this short, his character first appears as he does in the series, and is given the name [...] "Cartman", while the character of Kenny appears as the character is depicted today and given Cartman's moniker from the previous short. Cartman next appeared on August 13, 1997, when South Park debuted on Comedy Central with the episode [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".|$|E
