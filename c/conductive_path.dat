30|$|The {{change in}} {{electrical}} resistance with applied pressure {{can be explained}} by considering several phenomena that happens simultaneously in the composite system: breakdown of existing <b>conductive</b> <b>paths,</b> formation of new <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> and change or redistribution of <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> [21]. Formation of this conducting path occurs by direct contact between electrically conductive CNTs and when the inter particle distance between CNTs is only few nanometers. There exists a threshold value of 1.8 nm [22] for this inter particle gap at which electrons can easily jump across the gap (electron tunneling). Application of high pressure reduces this electron tunneling gap, thereby leading the composites to exhibit high conductivity at high applied pressure.|$|R
500|$|Naively, Bird {{appears to}} have {{expected}} Pulvermacher not to use this testimonial in his advertising. [...] When Pulvermacher's company did so, Bird suffered some criticism for unprofessional behaviour, although it was never suggested that Bird benefited financially, and Bird stated in his defence that the testimonial was only ever intended as a letter of introduction to physicians in Edinburgh. [...] Bird was particularly upset that Pulvermacher's company had used quotations from Bird's publications {{about the benefits of}} electrical treatment and misrepresented them as describing benefits of Pulvermacher's product. [...] Bird also criticised Pulvermacher's claim that the chain could be wrapped around an affected limb for medical treatment. [...] Although the flexible nature of its design lent itself to wrapping, Bird said that it would be next to useless in this configuration.

500|$|By April 1853 the {{situation}} had become very acrimonuous. [...] Meinig had been using extracts from the testimonial provided by Bird without permission in order to bolster the Company's, medically largely unsupported, quack advertising claims. Bird threatened a legal injunction but Meinig refused to desist and tried to imply that Bird was benefitting from the publicity. [...] A letter writing campaign by one Dr. McIntyre against the Pulvermacher advertisements led to an exchange of letters in the Association Medical Journal. [...] Bird made plain that he had only ever recommended the chain as a convenient source of electricity and did not support any of the claimed curative powers, most especially those {{that were supposed to}} produce instant results (a typical course of electrotherapy at the time could last several months). [...] He criticised some of the chains being sold as delivering [...] "too feeble" [...] a current to be of any medical use and pointed out that the proposed procedure of wrapping the device around an affected limb would make it useless since a <b>conductive</b> <b>path</b> through the skin across each cell would prevent a useful voltage being developed at the terminals (Pulvermacher even suggests in his patent that contact with the body generates enough electricity to be effective even without electrolyte).

40|$|AbstractA {{link between}} the {{morphological}} characteristics and the electric properties of amorphous layers is established by means of atomic, conductive, electrostatic force and thermal scanning microscopy. Using amorphous Ta 2 O 5 (a-Ta 2 O 5) semiconductive layer, {{it is found that}} surface profile gradients (morphological gradient), are highly correlated to both the electron energy gradient of trapped electrons in interactive Coulombic sites and the thermal gradient along <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> and thus thermal and electric properties are correlated with surface morphology at the nanoscale. Furthermore, morphological and electron energy gradients along opposite <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> of electrons intrinsically impose a current stability anisotropy. For either long <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> (L> 1 μm) or along symmetric nanodomains, current stability for both positive and negative currents i is demonstrated. On the contrary, for short <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> along non-symmetric nanodomains, the set of independent variables (L, i) is spanned by two current stability/intability loci.

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} energy and current levels {{associated}} with lightning (currents can be in excess of 150,000 amps), and the very rapid rise time of a lightning strike, no protection system can guarantee absolute safety from lightning.

2500|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{lightning protection}} systems use a shielded cable system. [...] These systems consist {{of one or}} more conductors enclosed by a conductive shield. [...] The cable has both conductors of one end connected to a grounding element. [...] This is intended to provide protection from electromagnetic interference. [...] Such systems reduce the electromagnetically induced voltage in a shielded conductor. [...] This is intended to provide protection against induced electromagnetic interference from lightning. [...] This network provides a normally-high impedance which breaks down to a very low impedance in response to a momentary voltage surge electromagnetically induced in the shield. [...] This establishes a <b>conductive</b> <b>path</b> between the shield and ground. [...] Any surge voltage from lightning creates a current through the cable.

2500|$|Another type of PTC {{thermistor}} is {{the polymer}} PTC, which is sold under brand {{names such as}} [...] "Polyswitch" [...] "Semifuse", and [...] "Multifuse".

[...] When the plastic is cool, the carbon grains are all in contact with each other, forming a <b>conductive</b> <b>path</b> through the device. [...] When the plastic heats up, it expands, forcing the carbon grains apart, and causing {{the resistance of the}} device to rise, which then causes increased heating and rapid resistance increase. [...] Like the BaTiO3 thermistor, this device has a highly nonlinear resistance/temperature response useful for thermal or circuit control, not for temperature measurement. [...] Besides circuit elements used to limit current, self-limiting heaters can be made in the form of wires or strips, useful for heat tracing. [...] PTC thermistors 'latch' into a hot / high resistance state: once hot, they stay in that high resistance state, until cooled. [...] In fact, Neil A Downie showed how you can use the effect as a simple latch/memory circuit, the effect being enhanced by using two PTC thermistors in series, with thermistor A cool, thermistor B hot, or vice versa.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another <b>conductive</b> <b>path,</b> such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E

30|$|Ignoring the {{engineering}} and fabrication processes, {{the mechanisms of}} thermal conductivity improvement can be further phenomenologically discussed. At low filler fractions, long-range thermally <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> are not steadily formed, i.e. BNNPs are not effectively contacted with each other. As a result of silane treatment, although filler dispersion might be improved, thermal resistance actually exists at the interfaces between filler and matrix, which causes serious phonon scattering and deficiency. At high filler fractions, however, long-range thermally <b>conductive</b> <b>paths</b> are formed as there are enough BNNPs involved in the heat conduction. In this case, agglomeration of highly concentrated fillers and dispersion {{of them in the}} matrix become the other problems. These problems can be partially overcome by silane treatment to BNNPs. As is mentioned above, silane coupling agent can enhance interfacial adhesion between polymer matrixes and inorganic fillers thus improving the dispersion and preventing serious agglomeration of the fillers. Although interfacial thermal resistance still exists, which may cause deficiency in heat conduction, the improvement of thermal conductivity is greater due to the suppressed phonon scattering at interfaces. In our study, silane treatment works most effectively at 60 % BNNP fraction for the thermal conductivity improvement.|$|R
