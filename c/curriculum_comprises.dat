A <b>curriculum</b> <b>comprising</b> the key tenets of cognitive-behaviour modification was developed and taught over a 9 -week period to a group of 12 Year 7 adolescent students selected from a primary school in the Brisbane metropolitan district, Queensland, Australia. Six of the participants for the investigation were identified as 'at-risk' of engaging in disruptive behaviours based on extensive observations from members of the school administration team. The remaining students served as role models of prosocial behaviours throughout the intervention. Each session incorporated group discussions and physical challenges that were formulated to facilitate investigation of key concepts of cognitive- behavioural therapy. The findings that emerged from the investigation provide support for the use of group therapy for this form of intervention. Griffith Health, School of Human Services and Social WorkFull Tex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the ICT (information and {{communication}} technology) curriculum in New Zealand secondary schools and gendered participation patterns in different specialist ICT subjects. New Zealand has a permissive ICT <b>curriculum,</b> <b>comprising</b> a variety of subjects and characterised by choice and variation in the curriculum in practice at the local level. The data that are reported include results of (i) a national questionnaire survey of secondary schools, and (ii) a qualitative case study conducted in a large, coeducational New Zealand secondary school and involving classroom observations and interviews with teachers and students. It is suggested that the permissiveness of the curriculum, which ostensibly caters {{for the needs of}} students by providing choices, may, in some circumstances, effectively reinforce gender stereotypes relating to computer interests and practices. This is a paradox of choice. Questions are raised {{about the nature of the}} ICT curriculum in New Zealand and how it may contribute to or challenge gender stereotypes, future curriculum developments and, more broadly, how we can account for persistent gendered participation patterns in ICT subjects in schools...|$|R
