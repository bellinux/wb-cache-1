40|$|Abstract: A Xe plasma flat lamp, {{which has}} been noticed as a new {{eco-friendly}} LCD (liquid crystal display) backlight, requires {{the improvement of the}} luminance and the luminous efficiency although it has several advantages. To improve the performance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lamp,</b> it is necessary to understand the effects of discharge variables on the luminous characteristics of the lamp. Since it is difficult to diagnose <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> discharge experimentally, the numerical analysis can be used instead. In this study, the luminous characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planar type Xe plasma flat lamp were analyzed with the variation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> input voltage and a pulse frequency. The numerical analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lamp</b> discharge was then performed using a RCT (relaxation continuum) model and a LFA (local field approximation) model. The comparison with the experimental results showed that the RCT model is valid for the numerical analysis of the flat lamp. The numerical analysis also showed that the modifications <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high frequency component and a voltag...|$|R
