5|$|Since the {{completion}} of I-96 in 1977, several changes to the freeway have taken place. Beginning in 1984, {{an extension of the}} US27 freeway (later to become I-69) bypassing Lansing opened; US27 was then <b>cosigned</b> with I-96 along the western side of Lansing. Three years later, the I-69 designation was applied to this new bypass, resulting in a triple concurrency (I-96/I-69/US27) that existed until 2002, when US27 was decommissioned in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|The current {{alignment}} of PA378 was first constructed from West Broad Street in Bethlehem {{to the current}} interchange with the Lehigh Valley Thruway. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the Lehigh Valley Thruway was <b>cosigned</b> as the {{alignment of}} I-78. Upon completion of the freeway in 1968, the new highway was designated I-378, a spur off of I-78. However, in1970, as I-78 was realigned to a new bypass {{to the south of}} Bethlehem, I-378 was decommissioned and replaced with the alignment of PA378 the following year.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the south}} at Business I-85/US29/US70, the route travels north out of Thomasville in Davidson County as National Highway, a name which {{referred}} to the former routing of US 29/70 (later US 29A/70A) along this segment. Crossing from Davidson County into neighboring Guilford County {{and the city of}} High Point, NC 68 is <b>cosigned</b> with English Road. Approximately one mile within the city limits, NC68 turns left onto Westchester Drive, a boulevard that bypasses High Point's downtown area. Arriving at the Main Street interchange, the city's busiest, NC68 continues onto Eastchester Drive, another boulevard. After passing Oak Hollow Mall, I-74/US311 (High Point East Belt), and the Wendover Avenue interchange, NC68 and Eastchester Drive continue north into neighboring Greensboro.|$|E

5|$|The first {{business}} loop in Marshall was a Business US Highway12 (Bus. US12) {{that was}} designated in 1960 after the I-94/US12 freeway was completed {{north of the}} city. It followed US27 (Kalamazoo Avenue) to Michigan Avenue. From there, Bus. US12 followed the current routing of BL I-94 along Michigan Avenue and Partello Road. The business route was redesignated as BL I -94 in late 1961. The section of BL I-94 along US27 (Kalamazoo Avenue) became Bus. US27 with {{the completion of the}} I-69/US27 freeway bypass in 1967. BL I-94 was rerouted and <b>cosigned</b> with Bus. US27 along Michigan Avenue and the new freeway on the west end. The concurrency with Bus. US27 was removed in 1972. On January 11, 2001. BL I-94 inside the city of Marshall was designated as a Michigan Heritage Route (now called a Pure Michigan Byway).|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of US195 {{designated}} as part of Washington's state highway system was codified in 1913 from Colfax to Spokane as the Inland Empire Highway and from the Idaho state line to Pullman as the Second Division of the Eastern Route of the Inland Empire Highway. The two highways were included as part of State Road3 in 1923 and US195 during {{the creation of the}} US Highway System on November 11, 1926. Originally, the northern terminus of the highway was at US95 in Sandpoint, but was truncated to Spokane after US2 was extended west from Bonners Ferry in 1946. US195 was <b>cosigned</b> with Primary State Highway3 (PSH3) from US95 to Spokane and PSH6 from Spokane to Newport from the creation of the primary and secondary state highways in 1937 until the 1964 highway renumbering. US195 was extended south into Idaho after the relocation of US95, designated as the North and South Highway in 1916, onto its present freeway in 1975. Bypasses of Pullman, Rosalia, and Plaza were completed during the early 1970s, converting portions of US195 into a divided highway.|$|E

500|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the future US27 {{corridor}} through Charlotte {{was part of the}} original M-29. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO and the new US27 replaced M-29 through Coldwater. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from downtown Charlotte along US27 to run northeasterly toward Lansing. The highway through downtown Charlotte was first designated Bus. US27 after the 1961 completion of a non-freeway bypass, a two-lane, limited-access highway east of the city. At that point I-69 only existed in the southern parts of Michigan. That freeway was not extended up to the city when the southernmost segment of I-69 was completed in 1967. [...] By 1971, I-69 was completed to Charlotte and at the time US27 was <b>cosigned</b> with I-69, the bypass being incorporated into I-69. For three years the business loop in Charlotte was not signed as BL I-69, but it was so designated in 1974 and Bus. US27 was decommissioned in and near Charlotte.|$|E

500|$|Harrison was {{defeated}} in the November 1892 election by former president Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, who returned to the White House in March 1893. President Harrison left office proclaiming the nation's prosperity, but in May, amid economic uncertainty that caused many people to convert assets into gold, the stock market crashed, and many firms went bankrupt. The depression that ensued {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. Among those who became insolvent in 1893 was a McKinley friend, Robert Walker. McKinley had co-signed promissory notes for Walker, and thought the total to be $17,000. Walker had deceived McKinley, telling the governor that fresh loans were renewals of old ones, and the total indebtedness, for which McKinley had made himself liable, was over $130,000. That sum was beyond McKinley's means, and he planned to resign and earn the money as a lawyer. He was rescued by Hanna and other wealthy supporters, who raised the money to pay the loans. According to McKinley biographer Kevin Phillips, the governor's backers [...] "paid off the <b>cosigned</b> notes so that McKinley—by now, the probable next president—did not {{need to go back to}} practicing law".|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of 43Street, the former alignment of Highway4 in Lethbridge was along Mayor Magrath Drive, <b>cosigned</b> with Highway5 to 3Avenue in south Lethbridge, which was then Highway3.

[...] In 1992, 43Street in south Lethbridge was widened from two to four lanes, although it did not carry the Highway4 designation at this time. [...] Ordinarily, Alberta begins to consider upgrading to a divided highway when traffic levels reach 10,000 vehicles per day. [...] The majority of Highway4 remains well below this threshold, but it is a component of the CANAMEX Corridor in southern Alberta, to which Alberta had made a commitment to upgrading in the late 1980s. Plans for a divided highway were confirmed by 1989, and reiterated as a priority by annual reports published by Alberta Transportation through the 1990s. [...] The highway was the southernmost component of what was then called the Export Highway, which also included Highways2 and 3, which were given priority for twinning {{in the first half of}} the 1990s. [...] In 1993, federal and provincial funding was announced for various twinning projects in Alberta, including the entirety of Highway4.|$|E

[...] The proposed beltway in New Jersey was designated as FAI Corridor 104 and later received the I-287 designation in 1958. The southern segment of I-287 was planned in the 1950s as the Middlesex Freeway, which was to run from the Outerbridge Crossing to Staten Island and follow the Route440 corridor to Edison, where it would connect to the New Jersey Turnpike before continuing west to I-78. From here, the freeway would parallel US202 north to the New York border. The anticipated cost of building I-287 in New Jersey was $235 million.
