5|$|The Ford Cosworth DFV was {{produced}} by Cosworth in Northampton and {{had been used in}} Formula One since 1967. It is a 2,993cc (183cu in) normally aspirated four-stroke engine with two banks of four cylinders at 90degrees to each other in a 'V8' configuration. It has an aluminium alloy engine block with cylinder liners. Each of its <b>crossflow</b> cylinder heads has a single spark plug and four valves, activated by gear-driven double overhead camshafts. This, combined with the flat-plane crankshaft, provides a relatively simple exhaust layout, in which the exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block. The engine is water-cooled, with water and oil radiators mounted in the left and right sidepods respectively. In 1980, a revised version of the DFV was introduced in which ancillaries such as the water and oil pumps were reduced in size and grouped further forwards on the flanks of the engine to provide more clearance for ground effect tunnels under the cars.|$|E

40|$|CFD {{simulations}} of <b>crossflows</b> around a 2 -D circular cyliner {{and the resulting}} vortex shedding from the cylinder are conducted in the present study. The capability of the CFD solver for vortex shedding simulation from a circular cylinder is validated {{in terms of the}} induced drag and lifting forces and associated Strouhal numbers computations. The validations are done for uniform horizontal fluid flows at various Reynolds numbers in the range 10 to the 3 rd to 5 x 10 to the 5 th. <b>Crossflows</b> around the circular cylinder beneath a free surface are also simulated in order to investigate the characteristics of the interaction between vortex shedding and a free surface at Reynolds number 5 x 10 to the 5 th. The influence of the presence of the free surface on the vortex shedding due to the cylinder is discussed. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Liquid jets in subsonic <b>crossflows</b> find varied {{applications}} in propulsion systems which include gas turbine combustors, aircraft afterburners and liquid fuelled ramjets. In {{the wake of}} environmental concerns and rising fuel costs, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the detailed study of sprays and its characterization as applicable to propulsion systems. An optimal fuel concentration is desirable for propulsion systems to achieve stable ignition, high efficiency and lower emissions. In a gas turbine afterburner, fuel is injected transversely into the air stream through a plain orifice injector from fuel manifolds, distributed across the combustor cross section. In a conventional ramjet, air is captured and decelerated to a subsonic velocity by an inlet diffuser, before fuel is added to the air stream. Therefore the liquid jet break-up processes leading {{to the development of the}} spray plume along with its ensuing droplet distribution downstream must be reasonably well understood. Although there have been many studies on the break-up and penetration of jets in subsonic <b>crossflows,</b> the literature pertaining to conditions relevant to ramjets and afterburners which is characterized by significant cross stream velocities (Mach 0. 25 - 0. 5) is very scarce. Among the investigations reported almost all of them have concentrated on the macroscale penetration aspects and detailed information about the spray characteristics such as drop size distribution in the near and far field is lacking. In this work the structure of spray plumes from water jets injected into high subsonic <b>crossflows</b> of Mach numbers between 0. 3 - 0. 6 were experimentally investigated using high speed imaging and laser diffraction techniques to measure the penetration and drop size distribution...|$|R

25|$|Another type of {{vertical}} axis is the Parallel turbine, {{which is similar}} to the <b>crossflow</b> fan or centrifugal fan. It uses the ground effect. Vertical axis turbines of this type have been tried for many years: a unit producing 10kW was built by Israeli wind pioneer Bruce Brill in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the widest}} uses of heat {{exchangers}} is for air conditioning of buildings and vehicles. This class of heat exchangers is commonly called air coils, or just coils {{due to their}} often-serpentine internal tubing. Liquid-to-air, or air-to-liquid HVAC coils are typically of modified <b>crossflow</b> arrangement. In vehicles, heat coils are often called heater cores.|$|E
25|$|<b>Crossflow</b> is {{a design}} {{in which the}} air flow is {{directed}} perpendicular to the water flow (see diagram at left). Air flow enters one or more vertical faces of the cooling tower to meet the fill material. Water flows (perpendicular to the air) through the fill by gravity. The air continues through the fill and thus past the water flow into an open plenum volume. Lastly, a fan forces the air out into the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Underneath the bonnet was the Kent <b>Crossflow</b> engine {{also used}} in the {{smallest}} capacity North American Ford Pinto. Diesel engines on small family cars were rare, and the Escort was no exception, initially featuring only petrol engines– in 1.1L, and 1.3L versions. A 940 cc engine was also available in some export markets such as Italy and France. This tiny engine remained popular in Italy, where it was carried over for the Escort Mark II, but in France it was discontinued during 1972.|$|E
25|$|The Bluebird 810 {{was sold}} in export markets as the Datsun 160B, Datsun 180B, Datsun 200B and Datsun 810. Australian {{magazine}} Wheels called the 200B 'a 180B with 20 more mistakes.' In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on the rear deckled that identified emission control technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new <b>crossflow</b> Z engines, based on the L.|$|E
25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the <b>crossflow</b> design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E
3000|$|Urban {{air quality}} is an {{important}} problem nowadays because of the close proximity of sources and receptors in densely built environment. Gaussian plume models have been commonly employed in the industry to estimate air pollution impact over open terrain for decades. However, they should be applied cautiously to urban environment {{in view of the}} complicated recirculating flows and turbulence-generation mechanism in the wakes around/over buildings. In particular, one of the key components in Gaussian plume models, dispersion coefficient σz, is usually determined empirically based on atmospheric stratification that might overlook the effect of rough urban surfaces in the bottom of atmospheric boundary layer, resulting in prediction uncertainty. In this paper, we report our recent study of the transport processes over idealized rough surfaces (repeated ribs in <b>crossflows)</b> to simulate the flows and transport processes after a ground-level pollutant source in <b>crossflows</b> over hypothetical urban areas. The effect of aerodynamic resistance (controlled by the rib separation b) on pollutant plume dispersion (measured by vertical dispersion coefficient σz) is critically examined. First of all, analytical solution shows that σz is proportional to x 1 / 2 [*]×[*]δ 1 / 2 [*]×[*]f 1 / 4, where x is the downwind distance after the pollutant source, δ the turbulent boundary layer thickness, f (=[*] 2 u [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{abnormal}} nitrate values due to redox {{conditions were}} excluded from the validation process as non-representative; their screening was based on previous hydrogeochemical assessments (Tziritis 2009, 2010) and it was further confirmed by their statistical population which were compiled by outliers, falling below the range of m −  2 s (where “m” is the mean statistical value and “s” is the standard deviation). Accordingly, the borehole samples which were proved to be affected by lateral <b>crossflows</b> and contaminant migration {{were excluded from}} the validation process too. The screening was performed on hydrogeological, hydrogeochemical and isotopic criteria from previously conducted researches (Tziritis 2009, 2010).|$|R
30|$|Wind-tunnel {{experiments}} and LES are conducted concurrently {{to examine the}} plume dispersion over hypothetical urban areas {{in the form of}} identical ribs in <b>crossflows.</b> The tracer concentrations over arrays of street canyons of different ARs (aerodynamic resistance) exhibit the conventional Gaussian profiles of concentration. Along with the analytical derivation, an improved parameterization of pollutant plume dispersion coefficient is demonstrated such that σz[*]∝[*]x 1 / 2 [*]×[*]δ 1 / 2 [*]×[*]f 1 / 4. Unlike the conventional dispersion coefficient for Gaussian models. The newly proposed parameterization can be employed to estimate plume dispersion in response to the aerodynamic resistance over urban areas in isothermal conditions.|$|R
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas recirculation system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new <b>crossflow</b> cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E

Inviscid, compressible flow about the elliptical cross-section of the jet is solved numerically, using a procedure modeled after that of Godunov. External boundary layer analysis along the surface of the elliptical cross-section allows determination of an effective drag associated with the jet, which balances centripetal forces resulting from jet deflection. Mass and momentum balances performed along the jet, with and without the inclusion of mass loss due to droplet shedding, are then incorporated so that liquid jet trajectories and bow shock penetration may be calculated.

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} study into the flow and heat transfers associated with both inclined and orthogonally impinging axisymmetric air jets. The majority of previously reported studies have been mainly confined to orthogonally impinging jets in stagnant surroundings. In this investigation, free jets as well as the effects of <b>crossflows</b> are considered. This investigation is Primarily concerned with local heat transfer variations. The experimental tests were. conducted with a single 12. 7 mm diameter jet impinging on a flat surface, and heat transfers were evaluated using a heat-mass transfer analogy (t e Chilton-Colburn analogy). The sublimation of naphthalene was employed as the mass transfer technique. The flowfield associated with impinging jets has a significant influence on their heat transfer characteristics., In view of the present limited level of understanding of this 'complex' flowfield, extensive flow visualisation techniques were employed in this present investigation. Those were primarily intended to aid interpretation of the experimental heat transfer results, and also to provide further physical understanding of the flowfields resulting from the interactions between impinging jets and <b>crossflowing</b> streams. The flow and heat transfer tests conducted in the programme of work reported in this thesis covered typical ranges of flow parameters of interest in many practical applications of jet impingement systems. Jet inclinations of 45 °, 600, and 90 °, nozzle to target spacings of 2, 11, and 8 nozzle diameters were studied.

The chemistry term is affected by the mixing of pollutant species. In the near fields, streamwise advection is counterbalanced by vertical diffusion and chemistry. In the far field, pollution chemistry becomes more important when the NO plume is fully developed, and the mixing of NO and O 3 is more sufficient. Comparing to pollutant dimensionless vertical profiles, it is also found that different terms arrive their peaked values at the plume centre.|$|R
