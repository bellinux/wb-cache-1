The plant consists of a stoker <b>chamber,</b> <b>fermentation</b> vessel, two-stage distillation column, a condenser and the ethanol receptacle. The conditioned feedstock, freshly harvested cassava, was feed into the fermentation vessel, allowed 48 h fermentation with enzymes and yeast added. The ethanol was distilled and allowed to pass through a condenser and finally the ethanol was collected. The ethanol unit prototype was evaluated using tests on three varieties of cassava. The degree of recovery of the distilled sample ranged from 18. 28 % ethanol for 3 - 5 mm Cassava chips to 62. 03 % ethanol by volume for sieved cassava liquor on one hand, and ranged from 49. 37 % of ethanol for a packing size of 3 - 6 mm to 62. 81 % of ethanol for a packing size of 8 - 10 mm. Mean values of some tests parameters were also determined. These parameters as quantitatively analysed using ANOVA, showed high significant difference (p< 0. 01) for the conditioned samples effect on volume of sample, percentage ethanol, density and refractive index, but was just significant (p< 0. 05) for the effect of variety of feedstock on density and percentage ethanol while having no {{significant effect on the}} volume of sample and refractive index. With the change in the design figuration of the condenser, the ANOVA result showed high significant (p< 0. 01) effect on volume of sample, significant (p< 0. 05) effect on percentage ethanol, density and refractive index.

Recombinant antibody engineering involves antibody production {{by the use}} of viruses or yeast, rather than mice. These techniques rely on rapid cloning of immunoglobulin gene segments to create libraries of antibodies with slightly different amino acid sequences from which antibodies with desired specificities can be selected. The phage antibody libraries are a variant of phage antigen libraries. These techniques can be used to enhance the specificity with which antibodies recognize antigens, their stability in various environmental conditions, their therapeutic efficacy and their detectability in diagnostic applications. <b>Fermentation</b> <b>chambers</b> have been used for large scale antibody production.|$|R
40|$|Typical {{methods for}} {{determining}} ethanol production from biomass feedstocks involve {{the use of}} High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) or Gas Chromatography (GC). Such methods require expensive instruments and {{the time required to}} process a large number of samples can delay experimental campaigns and process development. The object {{of this study was to}} develop a simple, high-throughput, low-cost ethanol assay using CO 2 as a surrogate for ethanol production during fermentation. A chemi-visual sensor was developed based on visually measuring color change due to pH in a buffered indicator solution separated from the <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> by a CO 2 -permeable membrane. Carbon dioxide was introduced into the <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> of the chemi-visual sensor while the pH and red-green-blue (RGB) color values of the phenol red indicator solution were recorded. A CCD camera (WebCam) and image analysis software package developed in Matlaby was used to record the RGB values of the chemi-visual solution at each CO 2 loading. Calibration curves were developed for the following relationships: CO 2 vs. pH, pH vs. RGB, and CO 2 vs. RGB. The chemi-visual sensor solution was used to monitor CO 2 production in a series of glucose fermentations. The CCD camera recorded the RGB signal and samples of the fermentation broth were taken throughout the experiments. The use of green signal change in the chemi-visual solution as a predictor for ethanol production can account for approximately 92 % of the change in actual ethanol content for real-time ethanol production values. Multiple fermentations were conducted in order to calibrate the chemi-visual sensor and to characterize the accuracy of ethanol predictions. It was determined that it would be most appropriate to use this sensor as a predictor of final ethanol production values since dynamic effects of fermentation kinetics, gas transfer, and green signal variability make predictions of real-time ethanol values less reliable...|$|R

Here, we describe the macroscopic anatomy of the GIT of a captive, adult lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). While similar to equids in terms of the overall design and, in particular, the two mentioned isthmuses, the proximal colon of the tapir appeared less pronounced than in other perissodactyls, resulting in a GIT in which the caecum appeared as the most voluminous <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber.</b> This finding is supported by the particular location of the ileo-caecal junction, which does not visibly separate the caecum from the colon, or the caecum head from the caecum body, but enters the caecum body in its upper third...|$|R

40|$|The {{function}} of the pyloric caeca of fish has been uncertain since their detailed description in 345 B. C. by Aristotle.

Our results for trout, cod, largemouth bass, and striped bass support the third but not {{the first or second}} of Aristotle's theories. In all four species, the caeca prove to be a major site of sugar, amino acid, and dipeptide uptake, contributing more uptake than the entire remaining alimentary tract in trout and cod. Caecal brush-border membranes contain hydrolytic enzymes. X-ray plates taken at various times after trout had ingested radioopaque marker, and observations of trout fed blue dye plus glass beads of graded sizes, show that caeca fill and empty of food with the same time course as proximal intestine.

50|$|Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, {{which have}} a conical bottom and a {{cylindrical}} top. The cone's aperture is typically around 60°, an angle {{that will allow the}} yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters <b>fermentation</b> <b>chambers,</b> the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally.

5000|$|A hopback is a {{traditional}} additional chamber {{that acts as a}} sieve or filter by using whole hops to clear debris (or [...] "trub") from the unfermented (or [...] "green") wort, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase hop aroma in the finished beer.

Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber.</b> Hopbacks utilizing a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed. Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend {{to make it through the}} hopback).

The sensor is composed of a near infra red fluorescent solvatochromic dye, nile blue methacrylamide polymerized into a polyethylene (glycol) dimethacrylate matrix. The dye can typically exhibit two or more wavelength dependent shifts in the fluorescence intensities based on its different micropolar environments. Two different concentrations of the nile blue methacrylamide dye were prepared and polymerized into homogenous films. The fluorescence properties of the two different films were investigated with a view to determining their ethanol sensing capabilities. The sensor was immersed in a water-ethanol solvent mixture.

Woodland cover had a clear effect on diet quality (estimated by the rate of gas production of digestive contents) and DFC weight of animals. In fact, deer from the most forested landscapes showed heavier DFCs and fed on poorer quality diet (lower gas production) than their counterparts from the most open landscapes. RR mass was less influenced by the landscape openness, being the age of animals the main factor for understanding the variations of this digestive feature in our study area. We can conclude that colonizing agricultural landscapes increases the access to highly energetic and digestive resources...|$|R
30|$|Researchers {{have found}} that plants and insects {{establish}} different types of relationships with microbial associates that influence the outcomes of plant–insect interactions (Sugio et al. 2014). Plant primary and secondary metabolites and/or plant defenses against insects may be modulated by microbes, which may benefit the insects. Similarly, microbes may affect insect biology, including changing metabolism and behavior. For example, Rickettsia {{has been found to}} spread rapidly (6  years) in natural populations of the sweet potato whitefly Bemisia tabaci in the southwestern USA and to considerably increase the performance of infected whiteflies compared with uninfected whiteflies (Himler et al. 2011). Likewise, the Enterobacter Erwinia sp., which infects the thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, can be beneficial for its hosts depending on which plant the thrips are feeding upon (Vries et al. 2004). Many insect-associated microorganisms can even promote the capacity of insects to utilize diets with low or unbalanced nutritional content by providing specific nutrients that the insect cannot synthesize, including essential amino acids, B vitamins and sterols (Douglas 2015). For example, when Buchnera bacteria are eliminated from aphids using antibiotics, the aphids lose the ability to synthesize essential amino acids (Febvay et al. 1999; Douglas et al. 2001). The microorganisms located in the hindgut <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> of insects mediate the slow enzymatic degradation of the cellulose and hemicellulose components of plant tissue to sugars, which are then available to the insects (Calderóncortés et al. 2012).|$|R

It was the aim of our study to investigate whether the transmitter content of intrinsic nerves changes with the developmental stage. The neurochemical code of myenteric neurons in the rumen from suckling lambs, fattened lambs and adult sheep was determined by using quadruple immunohistochemistry against choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), substance P (SP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). Three neurochemically distinct subpopulations were identified within the rumen. They expressed the code ChAT/–, ChAT/SP and NOS/VIP. The number of ChAT/SP neurons did not change during development. It was 62 % in the newborn lamb and remained stable in fattened lambs (63 %) and adult sheep (63 %). By contrast, the number of ChAT/– neurons decreased significantly from 20 % in suckling lambs to 11 % and 7 % in fattened lambs and adult sheep, respectively. Simultaneously, the proportion of NOS/VIP neurons increased from 16 % in suckling lambs to 29 % in adult sheep. The increase {{in the proportion of}} NOS/VIP immunoreactive neurons indicates an adaptation to large volumes of ingesta at the beginning of roughage intake and rumination. We conclude that the age-associated changes in neurochemical code of myenteric neurons in the forestomach are related to the adaption of the rumen to different functional properties during development...|$|R

The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.|$|R

A recent study showed that ostriches produce as much methane (CH 4) as expected for a similar-sized, non-ruminant mammalian herbivore. We hypothesized that emus and rheas produce less CH 4 than ostriches. We individually measured, by chamber respirometry, the amount of O 2 consumed as well as CO 2 and CH 4 emitted from six adult rheas (body mass 23. 4 ± 8. 3 kg) and two adult emus (33. 5 and 32. 0 kg) during 23 -hour periods on a pelleted lucerne diet. In contrast to previous studies, which classified emus as non-producers, we measured CH 4 emissions at 7. 39 and 6. 25 L/day for emus and 2. 87 ± 0. 82 L/day for rheas, which is close to values expected for similar-sized non-ruminant mammals for both species. O 2 consumption was of a similar magnitude as reported previously. Across ratites CH 4 yield (L/kg dry matter intake) {{was positively correlated with}} mean retention time of food particles in the gut, similar to findings within ruminant species. In ratites, this relationship leads to similar body mass-specific CH 4 production for a high intake/short retention and a low intake/long retention strategy. Therefore, when investigating CH 4 production in herbivorous birds, it is advisable to consider various CH 4 measures, not only yield or absolute daily amount alone...|$|R

With this cycle, a final ethanol concentration of 5. 20 ± 0. 68 g L− 1 was obtained, or nearly 3. 5 -fold that of the control fermentation. Sonication at 10 % and 20 % cycles appeared to stimulate yeast growth compared to the control fermentation, but 40 % duty cycle had a measureable adverse impact on cell growth. Sonication at 10 % and 20 % cycles enhanced both the extracellular and the intracellular levels of -galactosidase enzyme. Although at the highest duty cycle sonication reduced cell growth, cell viability remained at ≥ 70 % {{during most of the}} fermentation. Sonication at a controlled temperature can be used to substantially enhance productivity of bioethanol fermentation...|$|R
50|$|The common ostrich is well {{adapted to}} hot, arid environments through {{specialization}} of excretory organs. The common ostrich has an extremely long and developed colon {{the length of}} approximately 11 - 13 m between the coprodeum and the paired caeca, which are around 80 cm long. A well developed caeca is also found and {{in combination with the}} rectum forms the microbial <b>fermentation</b> <b>chambers</b> used for carbohydrate breakdown. The catabolism of carbohydrates produces around 0.56 g of water that can be used internally. The majority of their urine is stored in the coprodeum, and the faeces are separately stored in the terminal colon. The coprodeum is located ventral to the terminal rectum and urodeum (where the ureters open). Found between the terminal rectum and coprodeum is a strong sphincter. The coprodeum and cloaca are the main osmoregulatory mechanisms used for the regulation and reabsorption of ions and water, or net water conservation. As expected in a species inhabiting arid regions, dehydration causes a reduction in faecal water, or dry feces. This reduction is believed to be caused by high levels of plasma aldosterone, which leads to rectal absorption of sodium and water. Also expected is the production of hyperosmotic urine; cloacal urine {{has been found to be}} 800 mosmol/L. The U:P (urine:plasma) ratio of the common ostrich is therefore greater than one. Diffusion of water to the coprodeum (where urine is stored) from plasma across the epithelium is voided. This void is believed to be caused by the thick mucosal layering of the coprodeum.|$|R
30|$|The rodents {{were fed}} with diet {{comprising}} of products made of soy and corn, {{equivalent to a}} herbivorous diet. Identical animal feed was maintained throughout the study without the change of vendor or food variant, and the non-alteration of diet preserves the condition in the gut favoring the dominant E. coli strain (Blyton et al. 2013). Introduction of different diets would disturb the gut ecosystem leading to the colonization of a different E. coli strain (Grønvold et al. 2010). Sexually mature healthy rodents (Kempermann et al. 1997; Sengupta 2013) were selected because the dominant commensal E. coli strains would have successfully established stable colonization in the gut flora (Tenaillon et al. 2010) and good health ensured no shifting of host physiological condition (Grønvold et al. 2010), possibly displacing dominant E. coli strains in unhealthy animals. The isolation of commensal E. coli only from females in {{this study suggests that}} host gender could influence the distribution of E. coli and this was similar to human E. coli strains (Gordon et al. 2005), even though the number of rodent strains in this study was relatively small to draw a definite conclusion. In terms of the gut anatomy, E. coli is inclined to flourish in hosts (herbivores and omnivores) with intestinal tracts resembling a microbial <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> such as a caecum (Gordon and Cowling 2003; Gordon et al. 2005) and all rodents possess a caecum (Gordon and Cowling 2003). In addition, the likelihood of isolating E. coli increases with the body mass of animals (Gordon et al. 2005). This was not the case in our study however, where smaller mice contributed to > 80  % (11 / 13) of the isolated commensal E. coli strains.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cattle {{and other}} {{ruminants}} have evolved {{the ability to}} derive most of their metabolic energy requirement from otherwise indigestible plant matter through a symbiotic relationship with plant fibre degrading microbes within a specialised <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber,</b> the rumen. The genetic changes underlying {{the evolution of the}} ruminant lifestyle are poorly understood. The BPI-like locus encodes several putative innate immune proteins, expressed predominantly in the oral cavity and airways, which are structurally related to Bactericidal/Permeability Increasing protein (BPI). We have previously reported the expression of variant BPI-like proteins in cattle (Biochim Biophys Acta 2002, 1579, 92 – 100). Characterisation of the BPI-like locus in cattle would lead {{to a better understanding of}} the role of the BPI-like proteins in cattle physiology Results We have sequenced and characterised a 722 kbp segment of BTA 13 containing the bovine BPI-like protein locus. Nine of the 13 contiguous BPI-like genes in the locus in cattle are orthologous to genes in the human and mouse locus, and are thought to play a role in host defence. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the remaining four genes, which we have named BSP 30 A, BSP 30 B, BSP 30 C and BSP 30 D, appear to have arisen in cattle through a series of duplications. The transcripts of the four BSP 30 genes are most abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity and airways. BSP 30 C transcripts are also found in the abomasum. This, as well as the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous differences between pairs of the BSP 30 genes, is consistent with at least BSP 30 C having acquired a distinct function from the other BSP 30 proteins and from its paralog in human and mouse, parotid secretory protein (PSP). Conclusion The BPI-like locus in mammals appears to have evolved rapidly through multiple gene duplication events, and is thus a hot spot for genome evolution. It is possible that BSP 30 gene duplication is a characteristic feature of ruminants and that the BSP 30 proteins contribute to an aspect of ruminant-specific physiology. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to test the {{potentially}} of using rice straw substrate for the cultivation of four Pleurotus species including Pleurotus florida, Pleurotus djamor, Pleurotus sajor-caju and Pleurotus ostreatus {{and the effect of}} these species on the chemical composition, cell wall degradation and digestibility of rice straw. Rice straw soaked in water for 24 h and then it was pasteurized at 100 °C for 6 h. Rice straw was inoculated with spawns of four Pleurotus fungi (Pleurotus florida, Pleurotus djamor, Pleurotus sajor-caju and Pleurotus ostreatus) and packed in the plastic bags and incubated in a <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> at 23 - 27 °C and 75 - 85 % relative humidity. After 60 th day, rice straw samples from all groups were taken and analyzed for chemical composition and in vitro digestibility. The data obtained were analyzed according to the complete randomized design model consisting of four treatments plus one control and four replicates. The results of this study showed that fungal treatment increased (p< 0. 05) the Crude Protein (CP), silica, Ca and P contents of the rice straw but the hemicellulose, Organic Matter (OM), Acid Detergent Fiber (ADF), Neutral Detergent Fiber (NDF) and Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL) contents decreased. However, the ability of the fungi to degrade these components varied among the species. The ability of Pleurotus sajor-caju and Pleurotus ostreatus were higher than the other species in decreasing the hemicellulose, NDF, ADF and ADL contents. The highest Biological Efficiency (BE) was produced by sajor-caju species with 56. 02 and the lowest was belong to Pleurotus djamor species with an average 51. 17 %. All species of fungi incubated on rice straw showed increased (p< 0. 05) the in vitro dry mater and organic matter digestibility. Rice straw treated with sajor-caju fungus had the highest in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) with 80. 10 and 82. 18 %, respectively. In general this experiment cleared that treatment with sajor-caju can improve the quality of rice straw to be useful feed for ruminant nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} are strict aerobes, capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetic acid {{in the presence}} of oxygen. Considering that acetification is an exothermal process, with high need for oxygen supply, efficient mass transfer between the gaseous and aqueous phase and efficient heat transfer in the fermentation medium, pose as the main challenges when focusing process improvement. Throughout time, several setups have been tested and used for improving efficiency in acetic fermentations, ranging from open barrel to automated acetator setups with air injection. This work demonstrates the use of a constricted oscillatory mesotube reactor for acetic fermentations, as an alternative to common acetification setups. The constricted mesotube reactor combined with oscillatory flow leads to high mass and heat transfer within the <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber,</b> due to the combination between axial mixing of the fermentation media, promoted by pistons, and the periodic constrictions, which function as baffles. Hydrodynamic properties of this type of setup have already been described, demonstrating an improved gas diffusion in liquid media. Furthermore, this type of reactor has been tested for several chemical and biological processes, and demonstrated high potential in process improvement. In this work, acetic fermentations were performed in an oscillatory constricted mesotube reactor, using an Acetobacter sp. inoculum in a synthetic medium containing acetic acid and ethanol. Acetifications were carried out at 30 ºC with air injection at 0. 18 vvm. Biomass growth, total acidity and ethanol-acetic acid conversion were monitored during the process, being observed that stationary phase was reached at about 70 hours, for an increase in biomass concentration of about 0. 2 ± 0. 1 g L- 1 (expressed in dry weight) and a final total acidity of 4. 2 ± 0. 6 %, with an ethanol-acetic acid conversion efficiency of 97. 4 ± 9. 28 % of the theoretical yield and a GK efficiency of 96. 7 ± 16. 7 %. These results indicate that oscillatory flow in a constricted mesotube reactor has high potential for the application to the acetification process, due to the high yields and efficiency, attaining performance values similar to the ones reported for other common acetification setups, with a smaller air supply...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{chemical}} and botanical {{analyses of the}} reticulo-rumen content (RR) and the fill of the digestive system were carried out in free-living Norwegian reindeer {Rangifer t. tarandus) on South Georgia (SG) in summer (mean body mass (BM) = 74 kg, n - 10), and in northern Norway in late summer (NS) (mean BM = 77 kg, n = 6) and winter (NW) (mean BM = 60 kg, n = 11). The RR of SG reindeer contained mainly grasses, while grasses dominated in NS reindeer and woody plants and lichens in NW reindeer. Mean ruminal plant cell-wall contents (CWC) comprised 37 % of organic dry matter (OM) in SG reindeer and 50 and 69 % in NS and NW reindeer, respectively. The high CWC in NW reindeer was due to high intake of lichens containing as much as 45 % hemi-cellulose. Mean ruminal content of lignin was as low as 5 % of OM in SG reindeer, which was different (P < 0. 05) from NS (14 %) and NW reindeer (15 %), respectively. The mean total gastro-inresrinal tract (GIT) (fill and tissue) weight was 27 % of BM in SG reindeer, different (P < 0. 05) from NS (18 % of BM) and NW reindeer (22 % of BM), respectively. Wet weight RR content was 14. 5 % of BM in SG reindeer, not different from NS (12. 2 % of BM) and NW reindeer (14. 2 % of BM). The ratio between the wet weight content of the distal <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> (DFC) and the RR wet weight content was 1 : 10 in SG reindeer, different (P < 0. 05) from NS (1 : 14) and NW reindeer (1 : 14). We {{did not find any}} significant differences between the intestinal lengths of the groups investigated. It was concluded that the degree of fill of the different parts of GIT in reindeet seems {{to be related to the}} lignin content of plants eaten and not only of seasonal changes in appetite and availability of plants. Our data stress the fact that reindeer are highly adaptable to a wide range of different dietary plants, even in the southern hemisphere. </p...|$|R
40|$|Estimates {{of feeding}} rates, {{alimentary}} tract structure and temporal patterns of food processing obtained from twelve species of nominally herbivorous fishes {{on the northern}} Great Barrier Reef were compared. These included members of the families Acanthuridae, Scaridae and Kyphosidae. Based on an analysis of diet and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles from a previous study we initially partitioned the twelve species into four dietary categories, as follows: (a) Category 1 : herbivores with a diet of macroscopic brown algae and high SCFA profiles in the hindgut region (Naso unicornis, Kyphosus vaigiensis); (b) Category 2 : herbivores feeding on turfing and filamentous red and green algae with moderate SCFA profiles in the hindgut region (N. tonganus, K. cinerascens, Zebrasoma scopas, Acanthurus lineatus); (c) Category 3 : zooplankton feeders with moderate SCFA profiles (N. vlamingii, N. brevirostris); (d) Category 4 : species feeding on detrital and sedimentary materials {{with low levels of}} SCFA (Chlorurus microrhinos, Scarus schlegeli, Ctenochaetus striatus, A. olivaceus). The purpose of this comparison was to determine whether measures of feeding activity, alimentary tract structure, and food processing were concordant with diet. A dichotomy in feeding rates was observed. Species with a diet of algae and zooplankton (categories 1 – 3) had slower feeding rates than those feeding on detrital aggregates and sediment (category 4). The pattern of food processing also followed the same dichotomy with species of categories 1 – 3 retaining food in the alimentary tract overnight and commencing the feeding day with substantial amounts of food in the intestine and hindgut. Category- 4 species commenced the feeding day with empty alimentary tracts suggesting a rapid turnover of gut contents. Within the herbivorous and zooplankton-feeding species neither alimentary tract structure nor food processing mode were predicted by diet or SCFA profiles. A hindgut <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> was present in K. vaigiensis but not in N. unicornis, a species with high levels of SCFA in the hindgut region and a diet of brown macroscopic algae. In contrast N. vlamingii, with a diet dominated by animal matter, retained large amounts of food material in a hindgut chamber over the entire feeding cycle. In tropical perciform fishes, herbivory and fermentation are not associated with the alimentary tract structures that characterise herbivorous terrestrial vertebrates. Estimates of the abundance of the different groupings of nominally herbivorous fishes indicated that the dominant elements in the reef grazing and browsing fauna were consumers of detrital and sedimentary materials. These could not be classified as herbivores. Members of this group were dominant in all habitats investigated. Explicitly herbivorous taxa were a minority component in all habitats investigated...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{fermentation}} end {{products were}} investigated in Svalbard reindeer at two different locations, on Nordenskioldland (NL) (n= 7) {{and in a}} marginal area on Nordaustlandet (NA) (n= 11), at different seasons. The pH ranged from 6. 51 - 6. 70 in rumen contents and from 6. 78 - 7. 17 in the distal <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> (DFC=caecum and proximal part of the colon) on NL compared to 6. 10 - 6. 71 in rumen contents and 6. 50 - 7. 35 in DFC contents on NA. The ruminal volatile fatty acid concentration ([VFAJ) was 84. 5 &plusmn; 9. 5 mmol/l compared to 63 - 9 &plusmn; 17. 6 mmol/kg in the DFC on NL in winter. In autumn, ruminal and DFC [VFA] was high at 113. 5 &plusmn; 13. 0 mmol/l and 90. 4 &plusmn; 10. 9 mmol/kg, respectively. On NA ruminal [VFA] was 85. 7 &plusmn; 12. 4 mmol/l and 59 - 6 &plusmn; 1. 3 mmol/kg in the DFC in winter, compared to 107. 3 &plusmn; 18. 4 mmol/l and 102. 0 &plusmn; 12. 7 mmol/kg in rumen and DFC, respectively, in summer. Mean acetate/propionate (A/P) ratios in the rumen indicate fermentation in favour of plant fibre digestion in winter (4. 8) but not in autumn (3. 0) on NL. On NA, the mean A/P ratio was 5. 1 in winter, compared to 4. 6 in summer. In all DFC investigated the A/P ratio was higher than 8. 9. The initial ruminal [VFA] did not reflect the VFA production measured. On NL, the production rate of VFA was low or not detectable in rumen and DFC in winter, while in autumn the total production rate of VFA was 59. 3 kJ/kgW 0 75 /d, of which 6. 5 % originated from the DFC. On NA in winter, a total of 121. 3 kJ/kgW 0 7 S/d was estimated of which 17 % originated from the DFC, compared {{to a total of}} 380. 4 kj/kgW 0. 75 /d in summer where the DFC only contributed 2. 7 %. Plants (grasses and mosses) with low quality in winter do not seem to contribute significantly to the VFA production in rumen and DFC. VFA production in the DFC seems to be of significant importance in reindeer when pastures have low availability but high quality. The concenttation and the rate of VFA production in the DFC contents were not related {{to the size of the}} chamber, but to the diet eaten...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{species are}} a serious {{economic}} and ecological threat throughout the world. When {{it comes to}} aboveground insects like the emerald ash borer or the gypsy moth, the ecological impacts caused by their presence has been well documented. However, {{in the case of}} invasive insects that spend the majority of their life underground, their effects on soil processes are far less apparent. Since its introduction almost a century ago, the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Newman (JB) has managed to invade most of the eastern United States. The larval stage is a serious pest, feeding on the soil, thatch, and roots of turfgrass and numerous horticultural crops. In order to break down the relatively nutrient poor soil matrix, the larval hindgut is modified into a multi-lobed, bulbous, microbe-rich <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber</b> where symbiotic microbes aid digestion. However, the origin and composition of these gut microbes, {{and whether or not they}} modify interactions between JB larvae and the soil is unclear. ^ The goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the interactions between Japanese beetle (JB) larvae and their subterranean environment. Specific objectives include (1) quantifying the impact of JB larvae on soil microbial activity and functional diversity, (2) characterizing the microbiota associated with the JB larval gut and (3) identifying linkages between soil and gut microbes. Using GC/MS, CO 2 emissions from microcosms containing JB-infested and uninfested soil were measured as a surrogate for the impact of JB larvae on soil microbial activity. Coarse changes in the functional diversity of soil microbes were also examined using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). Findings of the microcosm study support the idea that JB larvae cause significant changes to soil microbial activity resulting in increased soil respiration. These changes were accompanied by changes in microbial diversity that was characterized by shifts in soil microbial populations toward bacteria and away from fungi and protozoa. ^ In contrast to the information provided by PLFA analysis, which broadly characterized the functional composition of the soil microbial community by the percentages of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, 16 S rRNA sequencing of JB-infested and uninfested soil provide little evidence that JB larval infestation have a major influence on soil bacteria. Bacterial communities of JB-infested and uninfested soils share similar taxonomic and functional profiles. Taken together these findings suggest that changes in soil microbial communities resulting from JB larval infestation may be largely due to effects on eukaryotic microbes. ^ Characterizations of JB larval gut bacteria reveal that the whole gut bacterial community experiences major taxonomic shifts during larval development. These differences were likely due to in-gut selection; first instar larval gut microbiota was similar to that of the soil, 3 rd instar larval gut bacterial communities were less diverse and dominated by groups with greater cellulolytic competence. Although the functional profiles of 1 st and 3 rd instar JB larval gut microbiota paralleled their taxonomic trends there appeared to be a higher degree of functional convergence. This finding supports the idea that despite the increased microbial diversity that may result from the community’s environmental sourcing of gut microbes, functional convergence of these microbial communities may occur in response to the physiological needs of the host. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{there are}} countless types of beer, all ofthem {{can be broken down}} into either lagers or ales. This has to do with whether active {{fermentation}} occurs on the top or the bottom of the <b>fermentation</b> <b>chamber.</b> For the purposes of home brewing, lagering is slightly more impractical. For this reason, I have created three different home brewed ales. These different types of beer range in a variety of color, brewing process, and alcohol content. There are two majorly accepted types of home brewing: extract and all grain. Extract brewing is where the IImash" or slurry of grains has been condensed into a thick syrup. This type of brewing requires less equipment and less time investment on the brewing day itself. All grain brewing is where the brewer starts from scratch. I have created one extract batch and two all grain batches. Furthermore, a written analysis of my brewing and researching experience is given. After the brewing process was complete, I chemically analyzed a few of their characteristics. I will collect light spectroscopy data, pH, and hydrometer data. With the art of brewing, there are a few different standard characteristics that are important to the consumer: color, alcohol content and bitterness. By utilizing light spectroscopy, the darkness of the beer can be made quantitative. This is a useful tool when it comes to comparison of similar industrial brews. Alcohol content is another important characteristic that was analyzed. A hydrometer was used to obtain data {{in order to make a}} rough estimate of percent alcohol. lastly, I will analyze the bitterness of each beer through the pH. Once the lab analysis is complete, I plan to hold a beer-tasting event at an off-campus venue. Here I will discuss the brewing process, chemical analysis, and personal experience. Because this project is not a full scale "research" project, I have created a compilation of my work. There are multiple sections in this compilation including: scientific review of the fermentation process, data section, step-by-step personal brewing experience, and photo documentation of my work. The reason that I chose this process is that it intertwines both science and art. The brewing process and chemical analysis are rooted in my major (biochemistry). Furthermore, the art of brewing is something that I have wanted to pursue. After I graduate with a biochemistry degree, I plan to go on to a graduate program for brewing. This project will be a great a stepping stone and resume builder for my career. This being said, my target audience is the scientific community of ages 21 or older. Through this project, I hope to show Ball State University's future chemistry students that chemistry can be creative and fun. Furthermore, I feel as though people from other majors can appreciate the work put into this project. I feel that this project has the potential to attract undecided students to the chemistry department. To many, brewing seems like an intangible process. I believe this to be a misconception. By providing a written breakdown of the brewing process, I hope to change preconceived notions of intangibility into something very real and comprehendible. It is important to know exactly what you are putting into your body. I hope to educate others on not only what they are consuming, but where it came from. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
