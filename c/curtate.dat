50|$|In mathematics, in geometry, a cyclogon is {{the curve}} traced by a vertex of a polygon that rolls without {{slipping}} along a straight line. There are no {{restrictions on the}} nature of the polygon. It can be a regular polygon like an equilateral triangle or a square. The polygon need not even be convex: it could even be a star-shaped polygon. More generally, the curves traced by points other than vertices have also been considered. In such cases it would be assumed that the tracing point is rigidly attached to the polygon. If the tracing point is located outside the polygon, then the curve is called a prolate cyclogon, and if it lies inside the polygon it is called a <b>curtate</b> cyclogon.|$|E
50|$|A cyclogon is {{obtained}} when a polygon rolls over a straight line. Let it {{be assumed that}} the regular polygon rolls {{over the edge of}} another polygon. Let it also be assumed that the tracing point is not a point on the boundary of the polygon but possibly a point within the polygon or outside the polygon but lying in the plane of the polygon. In this more general situation, let a curve be traced by a point z on a regular polygonal disk with n sides rolling around another regular polygonal disk with m sides. The edges of the two regular polygons are assumed to have the same length. A point z attached rigidly to the n-gon traces out an arch consisting of n circular arcs before repeating the pattern periodically. This curve is called a trochogon — an epitrochogon if the n-gon rolls outside the m-gon, and a hypotrochogon if it rolls inside the m-gon. The trochogon is <b>curtate</b> if z is inside the n-gon, and prolate (with loops) if z is outside the n-gon. If z is at a vertex it traces an epicyclogon or a hypocyclogon.|$|E

The computation of instantaneous tractive efficiency requires the instantaneous measurement of the input torque, the drawbar pull and the forward travel of the tractor. The instantaneous wheel motion was recorded by two pens mounted 180 degrees from each other on the wheels. These pens described <b>curtate</b> cycloid curves from which data could be obtained for 90 degrees of wheel rotation.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a laser can {{efficiently}} accelerate charged particles if a magnetic field is introduced to improve the coupling between the particle and the wave. Solving the relativistic equations of motion for an electron in a uniform magnetic field and superposed, circularly polarized electromagnetic wave, {{it is found that}} in energy-position phase space an electron traces out a <b>curtate</b> cycloid: it alternately gains and loses energy. If, however, the parameters are chosen so that the electron's oscillations in the two fields are resonant, it will continually accelerate or decelerate depending on its initial position within a wavelength of light. A laboratory accelerator operating under these resonant conditions appears attractive: in a magnetic field of 10, 000 gauss, and the fields of a 5 x 10 to the 12 th W, 10 micron wavelength laser, an optimally positioned electron would accelerate to 700 MeV in only 10 m...|$|E
40|$|Long-time {{evolution}} of positrons accelerated in an oblique shock wave in an electron-positron-ion plasma is studied with relativistic, electromagnetic, particle simulations. In the early stage, some positrons move nearly {{parallel to the}} external magnetic field in the shock transition region and gain energy from the parallel electric field. The acceleration can become stagnant owing to the deformation of the wave profile. After {{the recovery of the}} shock profile, however, the acceleration can start again. By the end of simulation runs, omega_pet= 5000, positron Lorentz factors reached values ~ 2000. In this second stage, three different types of acceleration are found. In the first type, the acceleration process is the same as that in the early stage. In the second type, positrons make gyromotions in the wave frame and gain energy mainly from the perpendicular electric field. In the third type, particle orbits are similar to <b>curtate</b> cycloids. Theoretical estimate for this energy increase is given...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurement}} of the flow rate of various liquids and gases is critical in industrial automation. Rotary positive displacement meters (rotary PD meters) are highly accurate flowmeters that are widely employed in engineering applications, especially in custody transfer operations and hydraulic control systems. This paper presents a high pressure rotary PD meter containing a pair of internal cycloid rotors. It has the advantages of concise structure, low pressure loss, high accuracy and low noise. The curve of the internal rotor is designed as an equidistant <b>curtate</b> epicycloid curve with the external rotor curve as its conjugate. The calculation method {{used to determine the}} displacement of the cycloid rotor flowmeter is discussed. A prototype was fabricated, and experiments were performed to confirm measurements over a flow range of 1 – 100 L/min with relative errors of less than ± 0. 5 %. The pressure loss through the flowmeter was about 3 bar at a flow rate of 100 L/min...|$|E
40|$|The {{adiabatic}} perturbation {{is shown}} to be singular from the exact solution of a spin- 1 / 2 particle in a uniformly rotating magnetic field. Due to a non-adiabatic effect, its quantum trajectory on a Bloch sphere is a cycloid traced by a circle rolling along an adiabatic path. As the magnetic field rotates more and more slowly, the time-energy uncertainty, proportional to {{the distance of the}} quantum trajectory, calculated by the exact solution is entirely different from the one obtained by the adiabatic path traced by the instantaneous state. However, the non-adiabatic Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase, measured by the area enclosed by the exact path, approaches smoothly the adiabatic Berry phase, proportional to the area enclosed by the adiabatic path. The singular limit of the time-energy uncertainty and the regular limit of the geometric phase are associated with the arc length and arc area of the cycloid on a Bloch sphere, respectively. Prolate and <b>curtate</b> cycloids are also traced by different initial states outside and inside of the rolling circle, respectively. The axis trajectory of the rolling circle, parallel to the adiabatic path, {{is shown to}} be an example of transitionless driving. The non-adiabatic resonance is visualized by the number of complete cycloid arcs. Comment: 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Statistical Lifetime-Models follows on from Applied Probability. Models {{introduced}} {{there are}} {{examined in the}} first part of the course more specifically in a life insurance context where transitions typically model the passage from ‘alive ’ to ‘dead’, possibly with intermediate stages like ‘loss of a limb ’ or ‘critically ill’. The aim is to develop statistical methods to estimate transition rates and more specifically to construct life tables that form the basis in the calculation of life insurance premiums. We will then move on to survival analysis, which is widely used in medical research, in addition to insurance, in which we consider the effect of covariates and of partially observed data. We also explain demographic concepts, and how life tables are adapted to the context of changing mortality rates. Synopsis Survival models: general lifetime distributions, force of mortality (hazard rate), survival function, specific mortality laws, the single decrement model, <b>curtate</b> lifetimes, life tables, period and cohort. Estimation procedures for lifetime distributions: empirical lifetime distributions, censoring, Kaplan-Meier estimate, Nelson-Aalen estimate. Parametric models, accelerated life models including Weibull, log-normal, log-logistic. Plot-based methods for model selection. Proportional hazards, partial likelihood, semiparametric estimation of survival functions, use and overuse of proportional hazards in insurance calculations and epidemiology.

40|$|This thesis {{about the}} German-American {{political}} scientist Hans J. Morgenthau investigates {{in the development}} of his Weltanschauung. It grew out of a discomfort with structuralist and post-structuralist interpretations of Morgenthau’s thought which are distorted, <b>curtate,</b> and/or selective. This Weltanschauungsanalyse contributes to the understanding of Morgenthau and his oeuvre in three distinctive ways and negotiates hitherto existing shortcomings. First, it provides a panoptic rather than selective reading by considering all of Morgenthau’s major published and unpublished writings. It is, second, unifying rather than segregative {{in the sense that it}} reflects all aspects of Morgenthau’s thought and sets it into relation with each other. Finally, it is inclusive rather than exclusive meaning that the contexts in which Morgenthau developed his Weltanschauung are considered. This Weltanschauungsanalyse accentuates three dimensions in Morgenthau’s thought which are of relevance for contemporary theorising in International Relations. First, Morgenthau promoted a normative concept of power which is not to be confounded with violence, but to be considered as a group-dynamic element enabling to actively create a socio-political life world. Second, Morgenthau was one of the first IR-scholars to emphasise the conditionality of knowledge and political order, which makes his Weltanschauung a rich source for arguing that socio-political life is constructed and reason is limited as it enables to question “grand theories”. Finally, studying Morgenthau’s Weltanschauung concedes an important societal role to scholarship in the sense of dissidence. It is a sceptical appraisal of the socio-political status quo while being committed to a humanist normativity. To achieve this contribution to the current discourse on Morgenthau and elucidate his relevance for contemporary International Relations, this thesis applies Pierre Bourdieu’s concepts of field and habitus. It proceeds by, first, elaborating the field of Continental iv European intellectuals of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries in which Morgenthau’s thought was formed. Based upon its findings it is possible to dissect Morgenthau’s Weltanschauung into its constitutive parts: ontology, epistemology, and political agency. Material for this analysis was procured in the Library of Congress, the Bodleian Library, the Hoover Institution, the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève, and the Archive for Christian-Democratic Policy of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung.
