Most important of all, he taught and promoted amateur gardening before it was acceptable among the gardening establishment, and helped to found the whole <b>consumer</b> <b>industry</b> in amateur gardening that we have today.|$|E

5000|$|While some convict and {{involuntary}} transportees do assimilate {{into their}} new planets' societies, most band together against the original colonists of whatever world {{they end up}} on.

The welfare state demanded by the influx of Terrans from the Welfare Islands who do not have the concept of [...] "work" [...] in their mental universes requires cheap energy, <b>consumer</b> <b>industry,</b> and an unrealistically large tax base. Even without explicit knowledge of the agenda of the socialists, the productive members of each planet's society are outraged by encroachments and banditry forcing them to yield lands or businesses which they have worked hard to establish.|$|E

50|$|A picture {{archiving}} {{and communication}} system (PACS) {{is a medical}} imaging technology which provides economical storage and convenient access to images from multiple modalities (source machine types). Electronic images and reports are transmitted digitally via PACS; this eliminates the need to manually file, retrieve, or transport film jackets, the folders used to store and protect X-ray film. The universal format for PACS image storage and transfer is DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine). Non-image data, such as scanned documents, may be incorporated using <b>consumer</b> <b>industry</b> standard formats like PDF (Portable Document Format), once encapsulated in DICOM. A PACS consists of four major components: The imaging modalities such as X-ray plain film (PF), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a secured network for the transmission of patient information, workstations for interpreting and reviewing images, and archives for the storage and retrieval of images and reports. Combined with available and emerging web technology, PACS {{has the ability to}} deliver timely and efficient access to images, interpretations, and related data. PACS reduces the physical and time barriers associated with traditional film-based image retrieval, distribution, and display.|$|E
50|$|More {{significant}} than sheer numbers of scientific personnel were their quality and distribution. The total numbers masked wide variations in educational background and quality, lumping together graduates of two-year institutions {{or those who}} had attended secondary or post secondary schools during periods of low standards with those who had graduated from major institutions in the early 1960s or the 1980s, that is, {{before or after the}} period of the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution had removed an entire generation from access to university and professional training, creating a gap in the age distribution of the scientific work force. The scientific community included a small number of elderly senior scientists, often trained abroad before 1949, a relatively small group of middle-aged personnel, and a large number of junior scientists who had graduated from Chinese universities after 1980 or returned from study abroad. In the mid-1980s many of the middle-aged, middle-rank scientists had low educational and professional attainments, but generally they could be neither dismissed nor retired (because of China's practice of secure lifetime employment); nor could they be retrained, as colleges and universities allocated scarce places to younger people with much better qualifications. Scientists and engineers were concentrated in specialized research institutes, in heavy industry, and in the state's military research and military industrial facilities, which had the highest standards and the best-trained people. A very small proportion of scientists and engineers worked in light industry, <b>consumer</b> <b>industry,</b> small-scale collective enterprises, and small towns and rural areas.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the extent to which Management Commentary section in the annual reports of listed companies in Bursa Malaysia fulfils compliance requirements of IFRS's Practice Statement of 2010. Using a sample of 100 largest companies, we constructed a disclosure index from the annual reports, and used multiple regression to analyse data. The results indicate that the compliance with the Practice Statement is low as the compliance levels range from the low of 22 % to the high of 67 % with an average disclosure of 47. 4 %. The compliance pattern suggests that most firms, on average, place greater emphasis on disclosures regarding the internal workings of the firm but less so on the external factors and influences. We also report that firm profitability, institutional ownership, age of the firm, and <b>consumer</b> <b>industry</b> are the main determinants of Management Commentary disclosures in the Malaysian context. management commentary; IFRS compliance; Malaysia; determinants; firm size; firm age; firm profitability; leverage; institutional ownership; compliance; disclosure choices; corporate characteristics; annual reports; <b>consumer</b> <b>industry...</b>|$|E
