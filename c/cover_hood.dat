Such bonds are used {{for the production of}} micromechanical components and for stabilizing ultrathin membranes. Conventional bonding techniques require a long time outlay and entail the risk of contamination. The device according to the invention uses the anodic bonding effect. The device consists of several tins whose bases and lids form electrodes and are designed to receive the parts to be bonded. The lids are guided and are vertically movable in layers, said layers being arranged in a common holder. The holder is firmly connected to a <b>cover</b> <b>hood</b> which can be moved vertically or horizontally by means of a pneumatic device. In order to prevent the bonded parts from adhering to the tin lid, a wiping device is provided. The device is designed for use in a process line and exhibits a high throughput of parts to be bonded...|$|E
