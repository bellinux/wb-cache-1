The lines of those webs were as thick as <b>coarse</b> <b>threads,</b> and pretty strong, as I had reason to know; for when walking back to camp the same evening, meditating deeply on our unfortunate detention, I ran my head into the middle of a spider's web, and was completely enveloped in it, so much so that it was with considerable difficulty I succeeded in clearing it away. I was as regularly netted as if a gauze veil had been thrown over me.|$|E

50|$|<b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> {{are more}} {{resistant}} to stripping and cross threading because they have greater flank engagement. <b>Coarse</b> <b>threads</b> install much faster as they require fewer turns per unit length.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to present {{regression}} models for predicting resistance of joints made with screw and plywood members. Joint members were out of hardwood plywood that were 19 mm in thickness. Two types of screws including <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>thread</b> drywall screw with 3. 5, 4 and 5 mm in diameter and sheet metal screw with 4 and 5 mm were used. Results have shown that withdrawal resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws, diameter and penetrating depth. Joints fabricated with <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws were higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. Finally, average joint withdrawal resistance of screwed could be predicted by means of the expressions Wc= 2. 127 ×D 1. 072 ×P 0. 520 for <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws and Wf= 1. 377 ×D 1. 156 ×P 0. 581 for fine thread drywall screws by taking account the diameter and penetrating depth.

50|$|GM ceased {{production}} of the Northstar series in July 2010, with the final cars to receive it, the Cadillac DTS, Buick Lucerne, and Cadillac STS, rolling off the line in 2011. Newer Cadillac V8 models like the CTS-V use the GM LS small-block OHV engine, marking {{a return to a}} simpler push rod engine design. The North star has been plagued from the beginning with reliability issues, particularly head gaskets that fail when head bolts pull out of the block, allowing coolant to seep into the oil system. To exacerbate the situation, the entire engine must be completely removed to replace the head gasket, and a solution implemented to repair the head bolts. The cost to repair is usually upwards of $3000, and involves adding inserts (Normserts, timeserts) in the block to better grip the bolts. The LC3 supercharged variant, with its sealed deck design, has been largely immune from these issues. Cadillac implemented design changes throughout the Northstar's run (particularly 2000 and 2004), lengthening the head bolts and making the threads coarser, but even the 2004+ engines have experienced head gasket failures. The only way to bulletproof the engine is to tap deeper, drill extremely <b>coarse</b> <b>threads,</b> and stud the head to the block.|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{improvement}} in computer performance over {{the last twenty years}} has come from faster transistors and architectural advances that increase parallelism. Historically, parallelism has been exploited either at the instruction level with a grain-sie of a single instruction or by partitioning applications into <b>coarse</b> <b>threads</b> with grain-sies of thousands of instructions. Fine-grain threads fill the parallelism gap between these extremes by enabling tasks with run lengths as small as 20 cycles. As this fine-g rain parallelism is orthogonal to ILP and <b>coarse</b> <b>threads,</b> it complements both methods and provides an opportunity for greater speedup. This paper describes the efficient communication and synchronization mechanisms implemented in the Multi-ALU Processor (MAP) chip, including a thread creation instruction, register communication, and a hardware barrier. These register-based mechanisms provide 10 times faster communication and 60 times faster synchronization than mechanisms that operate via a shared onchip cache. With a three-processor implementation of the MAP, fine-grain speedups of 1. 2 - 2. 1 are demonstrated on a suite of applications...|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{predicting}} bending moment resistance plywood of screw (<b>coarse</b> and fine <b>threads)</b> joints using regression models. Thickness {{of the member}} was 19 mm and compared with medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard with 18 mm thicknesses. Two types of screws including <b>coarse</b> and fine <b>thread</b> drywall screw with nominal diameters of 6, 8 and 10 mm and 3. 5, 4 and 5 cm length respectively and sheet metal screw with diameters of 8 and 10 and length of 4 cm were used. The {{results of the study}} have shown that bending moment resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws diameter and penetrating depth. Screw Length was found to have a larger influence on bending moment resistance than screw diameter. Bending moment resistance with <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws was higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. The highest bending moment resistance (71. 76 N. m) was observed in joints made with coarse screw which were 5 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth of penetration. The lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having fine screw with 3. 5 mm diameter and 9 mm penetrations. Furthermore, bending moment resistance in plywood was higher than those of medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard. Finally, it has been found that the ultimate bending moment resistance of plywood joint can be predicted following formula Wc = 0. 189 ×D 0. 726 ×P 0. 577 for <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> drywall screws and Wf = 0. 086 ×D 0. 942 ×P 0. 704 for fine ones according to diameter and penetrating depth.
