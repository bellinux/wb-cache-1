50|$|Experts have {{recorded}} Seventy species of waterbird {{at the site}} with estimated maximum numbers of 30,000 birds.The common species are Egretta garzetta, E. gularis, Glareola pratincola, Charadrius hiaticula and Sterna hirundo. The breeding waterbirds include G. pratincola, <b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius</b> and Sterna albifrons.The Black heron (Egretta ardesiaca) is considered sacred and protected by local taboos.|$|E
50|$|Kittlitzâ€™s plover (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius)</b> {{is a small}} shorebird (35-40 g) in {{the family}} Charadriidae that breeds near coastal and inland saltmarshes, sandy or muddy riverbanks or {{alkaline}} grasslands with short vegetation. It is native to much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile Delta and Madagascar. It {{is thought to be}} mainly monogamous and has monomorphic plumage.|$|E
50|$|Breeding pairs {{may have}} one {{breeding}} territory {{close to the}} high water mark {{that they are able}} to feed in, or have two territories that are defended, one for feeding and one for nesting. Nesting territories have an average size of 1.6 ha, and nests can be as close as 16.2 m to each other. The size and boundaries of these territories do not appear to differ much between years of breeding, and site fidelity was recorded as 97.3% for pairs that stayed together between years. Territories are defended against neighbouring birds of the same species, and can also be defended against other species that are in the vicinity, such as sanderlings and Kittlitz's plover (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius).</b> Defensive behaviour often consists of low-level aerial attack, running at the intruder with lowered head, or aggressive forward-hunched postures. Non-territorial birds also exist, and as long as they keep to 'ordinary' behaviour pattens (feeding at a specific point and then flying away to a roosting site), the territorial birds appear to tolerate them.|$|E
50|$|Very little {{wildlife}} {{can exist}} {{here during the}} harsh dry season of strong hot winds and only salt water, but following a rain the pan becomes an important habitat for migrating animals including wildebeest and one of Africa's biggest zebra populations, and the large predators that prey on them. The wet season also brings migratory birds such as ducks, geese and great white pelicans. The pan is home of {{one of only two}} breeding populations of greater flamingos in southern Africa, and only on the Soa pan, {{which is part of the}} Makgadikgadi pans. The other breeding population is at Etosha, in the Northern part of Namibia. The only birds here in the dry season are ostriches, chestnut-banded plover (Charadrius pallidus) and Kittlitz's plover (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius).</b> The grasslands on the fringes of the pan are home to reptiles such as tortoises, rock monitor (Varanus albigularis), snakes and lizards including the endemic Makgadikgadi spiny agama (Agama hispida makgadikgadiensis).The region's salt water is home to the cladoceran crustacean Moina belli.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{relative}} contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to population structure and genetic diversity {{is a central}} goal of conservation and evolutionary genetics. One way to achieve this is through comparative population genetic analysis of sympatric sister taxa, which allows evaluation of intrinsic factors such as population demography and life history while controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and geography. We used ten conserved microsatellites to explore the population structure and genetic diversity of three sympatric and closely related plover species in southwestern Madagascar: Kittlitz's plover (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius),</b> white-fronted plover (C. marginatus), and Madagascar plover (C. thoracicus). Bayesian clustering revealed strong population structure in the rare and endemic Madagascar plover, intermediate population structure in the white-fronted plover, and no detectable population structure in the geographically widespread Kittlitz's plover. In contrast, allelic richness and heterozygosity were highest for the Kittlitz's plover, intermediate for the white-fronted plover and lowest for the Madagascar plover. No evidence was found {{in support of the}} "watershed mechanism" proposed to facilitate vicariant divergence of Madagascan lemurs and reptiles, which we attribute to the vagility of birds. However, we found a significant pattern of genetic isolation by distance among populations of the Madagascar plover, but not for the other two species. These findings suggest that interspecific variation in rarity, endemism, and dispersal propensity may influence genetic structure and diversity, even in highly vagile species...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} body size, parental behaviour and timing of breeding on the chick growth and energetics of three precocial shorebird (Charadrii) species in a warm sub-tropical environment: the Kittlitz's Plover <b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius,</b> Blacksmith Lapwing Vanellus armatus, and Crowned Lapwing V. coronatus. The three species exhibited slower growth, longer pre-fledging periods and lower energy expenditure during the pre-fledging period than Arctic and temperate zone relatives of similar size. It was found that relative growth rates of charadriid and scolopacid species increased by 1. 77 % per degree latitude. Blacksmith and Crowned Lapwings are of similar size (i. e. about 160 g), about four times the mass of Kittlitz's Plovers. Taking body mass into account, the resting metabolic rate and daily energy expenditure of the three study species were similar. The relative amounts of energy needed for chicks to grow from a hatchling to a fledgling were low for the three species studied. The relative amount of energy needed to complete growth in charadriid and scolopacid species increased by 2. 54 % per degree latitude. Because Crowned Lapwings exhibited faster growth than Blacksmith Lapwings but similar daily energy expenditure we suggest that Blacksmith Lapwings compensate for greater energy expenditure in colder weather by growing more slowly. We suggest that small growth rate coefficient, low resting metabolic rate and low daily energy expenditure are adaptations to lower food availability and milder ambient temperatures in sub-tropical breeding habitats compared to temperate or Arctic regions...|$|E
40|$|Mating {{opportunities}} {{may differ}} between closely related species, although {{the evidence for}} such variation is scant. Here we compare remating opportunities and courtship behaviour between three shorebird species: the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, the Kittlitz's plover, <b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius,</b> and the white-fronted plover, Charadrius marginatus, using data and an experimental approach from a previous study of the Kentish plover. By experimentally creating unmated males and females, we found that remating opportunities differed between these closely related plover species: remating times were shorter for females than males in a Kentish plover population that had a male-biased adult sex ratio, and in which most brood care after hatching {{was carried out by}} males. In contrast, remating times were male-biased in the uniparental Kittlitz's plover and unbiased in the biparental white-fronted plover. Male Kentish plovers spent significantly more time on courtship than females, whereas courtship behaviour was not sex biased in the other two plover species. The mate removal experiments also provided insights into pair bond stability. In the Kittlitz's plover, all 16 newly formed pairs remained together after the release of their former mates from captivity, whereas newly established pairs were replaced by their former mates upon release in all 12 white-fronted plover pairs. Taken together, these results are important in highlighting interspecific variation in mating activities, and suggest that both operational sex ratio and pair bond stability may differ between closely related species. These variations, in turn, may influence mating systems and parental care...|$|E
40|$|Nest {{predation}} {{is one of}} {{the principle}} constraints on bird breeding success, accounting for 20 to 80 % of all nest failures. It can be exacerbated by anthropogenic factors and the resultant increased predation pressure has caused the decline of numerous bird species worldwide. Identifying management strategies to reduce nest predation is consequently a priority for biodiversity conservation. Many lethal and non-lethal methods of predator control can be ineffective, unethical, time-consuming and expensive to implement. An alternative is the use of Conditioned Food Aversion (CFA), a method by which animals are deliberately induced to avoid nests following consumption of eggs treated with an illness-inducing toxin. Previous studies suggest that this technique is effective but many have been subject to several methodological flaws that limit their applicability. Here I employ an improved experimental design that uses both spatial and temporal controls and incorporates quantification of predator identity and abundance. By so doing the resultant effects can be attributed to CFA treatment with higher certainty. In the Berg River Estuary, South Africa, nest losses of the Kittlitz's Plover (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius)</b> are high due to Pied Crow (Corvus albus) nest predation. I used this common plover as a model species to test whether CFA {{can be used as a}} conservation management tool to reduce nest predation. I used a field experiment to assess whether provisioning quail eggs treated with carbachol, an illness-inducing chemical, resulted in reduced nest predation. To assess the effects of treatment, nest survival data for both artificial plover nests containing quail eggs and natural Kittlitz's plover nests, as well as predator abundance were compared across three experimental phases (pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment) and according to treatment type (carbachol versus water) ...|$|E

Camouflage {{is one of the}} most widespread antipredator defences, and its mechanistic basis has attracted considerable interest in recent years. The effectiveness of camouflage depends on the interaction between an animal's appearance and its background. Concealment can therefore be improved by changes to an animal's own appearance, by behaviorally selecting an optimal background, or by modifying the background to better match the animal's own appearance. Research to date has largely focussed on the first of these mechanisms, whereas there has been little work on the second and almost none on the third. Even though a number of animal species may potentially modify their environment to improve individual-specific camouflage, this has rarely if ever been quantitatively investigated, or its adaptive value tested. Kittlitz's plovers (<b>Charadrius</b> <b>pecuarius)</b> use material (stones and vegetation) to cover their nests when predators approach, providing concealment that is independent of the inflexible appearance of the adult or eggs, and that can be adjusted to suit the local surrounding background. We used digital imaging and predator vision modeling to investigate the camouflage properties of covered nests, and whether their camouflage affected their survival. The plovers' nest-covering materials were consistent with a trade-off between selecting materials that matched the color of the eggs, while resulting in poorer nest pattern and contrast matching to the nest surroundings. Alternatively, the systematic use of materials with high-contrast and small-pattern grain sizes could reflect a deliberate disruptive coloration strategy, whereby high-contrast material breaks up the telltale outline of the clutch. No camouflage variables predicted nest survival. Our study highlights the potential for camouflage to be enhanced by background modification. This provides a flexible system for modifying an animal's conspicuousness, to which the main limitation may be the available materials rather than the animal's appearance. J. T., J. W-A. and M.
