5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter,</b> which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> was unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, on 6 April 1965, the Bell 533 {{became the}} first {{rotorcraft}} to reach 217knots (250mph, 402km/h). In addition to the higher speeds, Bell test pilots were able {{to demonstrate that the}} additional thrust from the auxiliary engines allowed the <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> to maintain sustained 2g turns at 60-degree bank angles.|$|E
25|$|Proposed Advanced <b>Compound</b> <b>Helicopter</b> {{technology}} demonstrator, partly {{funded by}} the Ministry of Defence. Announced in May 1998, the ACH was planned to be powered by RTM322 engines with variable area exhaust nozzles and a gearbox from the Westland 30-200; they have wings attached at cabin roof level and BERP rotor blades. It was predicted to fly approximately 50% faster than a standard Lynx.|$|E

50|$|The Piasecki 16H was {{a series}} of <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{produced}} in the 1960s. The first version of the Pathfinder, the -1 version, first flew in 1962. The similar but larger Pathfinder II, the 16H-1A, was completed in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|In {{most cases}} gyroplanes and <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{use the same}} primary method of lift {{throughout}} flight without any conversion needed, so they are generally not regarded as convertiplanes.

25|$|In 1951, the Air Force {{announced}} a competition {{to develop a}} <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter,</b> an aircraft that could take off and land vertically, like a helicopter, but could cruise at higher airspeeds than conventional helicopters. The joint research program was being conducted by the Air Force's Research and Development Command and the Army's Transportation Corps. Bell Aircraft submitted the design for the XV-3, Sikorsky Aircraft submitted the S-57, a retracting rotor design, and McDonnell submitted a design modified from its Model M-28 design.|$|E
500|$|The Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne was {{an attack}} {{helicopter}} developed by Lockheed for the United States Army. [...] It rose from the Army's Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program to field the service's first dedicated attack helicopter. Lockheed designed the Cheyenne using a four-blade rigid-rotor system and configured the aircraft as a <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> with low-mounted wings and a tail-mounted thrusting propeller driven by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. [...] The Cheyenne {{was to have a}} high-speed dash capability to provide armed escort for the Army's transport helicopters, such as the Bell UH-1 Iroquois.|$|E
500|$|On 26 March 1964, the Army Chief of Staff redesignated the FAS {{program as}} the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS). The {{development}} objectives document (QMDO) for the AAFSS was approved in April 1964, and on 1 August 1964, the Transportation Research and Engineering Command contacted 148 prospective contractors with {{a request for}} proposals (RFP). Bell submitted the D-262, a modification of the D-255, but still a conventional helicopter design. Sikorsky submitted the S-66, which featured a [...] "Rotorprop" [...] that {{would serve as a}} tail rotor but as speeds increased would rotate 90° to act as pusher propeller. Lockheed submitted the CL-840 design, a rigid-rotor <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> with both a pushing propeller and a conventional tail rotor mounted {{at the end of the}} tail.|$|E
50|$|The Piasecki Aircraft Corporation (PiAC) {{was founded}} by American {{vertical}} flight pioneer Frank Piasecki to develop <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> and other advanced rotorcraft after he was ousted from the leadership of his first company, Piasecki Helicopter, which was renamed Vertol Corporation and later acquired by Boeing.|$|R

25|$|Gyrodynes {{are also}} known as <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> or <b>compound</b> gyroplanes. A {{gyrodyne}} has the powered rotor of a helicopter with a separate forward thrust system of an autogyro. Apart from take-off and landing the rotor may be unpowered and autorotate. Designs may also include stub wings for added lift.|$|R
2500|$|Several major {{elements}} of the EC155, such its rotor system (albeit modified to operate at slower rotational speeds), {{were used in the}} Eurocopter X3, an experimental high-speed <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> which set an unofficial speed record of [...] in 2013. In 2015, a EC155 was also used by Airbus Helicopters as a flying testbed for new aerodynamic features, such as the rotor blades, biplane stabilizer and canted fenestron, for the developing Airbus Helicopters H160 helicopter.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 533 was a {{research}} helicopter built by Bell Helicopter under contract with the United States Army during the 1960s, to explore the limits and conditions experienced by helicopter rotors at high airspeeds. The helicopter was a YH-40—a preproduction version of the UH-1 Iroquois—modified and tested in several helicopter and <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter</b> configurations. The Bell 533 {{was referred to as}} the High Performance Helicopter (HPH) by the Army, and reached a top speed of [...] in 1969, before being retired.|$|E
2500|$|The US Army {{issued a}} request for {{proposals}} (RFP) for its Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) program on 1 August 1964. [...] Lockheed offered its CL-840 design, a rigid-rotor <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter.</b> [...] Sikorsky submitted the S-66, which featured a [...] "Rotorprop" [...] serving as a tail rotor but as speeds increased would rotate 90° to act as pusher prop. [...] The S-66 had short, fixed wings and was powered by a [...] Lycoming T55 turboshaft engine. [...] The design {{was to have a}} speed of [...] with the ability for [...] for brief periods.|$|E
50|$|Rotorcraft have {{spinning}} blades {{called a}} rotor which spins in the horizontal plane to provide lift. Forward thrust is usually obtained by angling the rotor disc slightly forward {{so that a}} proportion of its lift is directed backwards; these are called helicopters. Other rotorcraft are <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> and autogyros which sometimes use other means of propulsion, such as propellers and jets.|$|R
5000|$|Convair {{selected}} the coleopter layout for their Model 49 proposal, {{entered into the}} Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS). AAFSS asked for a new high-speed helicopter design for the attack and escort roles, and gathered {{an impressive array of}} <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters,</b> dual-rotor designs and similar advances on conventional designs, but nothing was as unconventional as the Model 49. The Army [...] "went conventional" [...] however, and {{selected the}} AH-56 Cheyenne and Sikorsky S-66 for further development.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{controls}} are modified {{with the addition}} of a manual propeller pitch override on the collective lever for the ring tail. This is the only visible change to the aircraft's existing mechanical controls in the cockpit. The other controls needed to operate the <b>compound</b> <b>helicopter's</b> systems are integrated into the aircraft's existing mechanical controls to reduce pilot workload. The weight added to the X-49A demonstrator aircraft is estimated at about 1,600 lb (725 kg) due to the requirement to not modify the existing mechanical control system.|$|R

5|$|As a result, the Army Material Command (AMC) {{conducted}} a study {{to determine if the}} development objectives were feasible and also established a program office for the Fire-support Aerial System (FAS). AMC recommended to narrow the competition to <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters,</b> as they were considered the only helicopter configuration at the time capable of being developed to meet the objectives. In March 1964, the Secretary of the Army advised DDRE that modification of existing aircraft would not approach the required performance of the FAS program; the Army would continue using the armed UH-1B until development of the FAS could proceed.|$|R

40|$|A {{kinematic}} {{study of}} a helicopter main rotor control system is carried out to investigate loads in servo actuators and non-rotating scissors during high speed and high load factors maneuvers. The kinematic model is then used to optimize the servo-actuators placement and pre-inclination {{in order to minimize}} static and dynamic loads in the three servo-actuators and in the non-rotating scissors. The inputs for the model (blade pitch link loads and pilot input to trim the aircraft) are taken from flight tests measurements, current rotor computations being unable to predict blade root torsion moments vs azimuth with enough accuracy. The analysis is based on X 3 demonstrator flight tests, which showed high control system loads that used to reduce flight envelope during the first flight test campaign. Flight tests measurements are used to validate the kinematic model used for the optimization. Computations made for X 3 case at 220 kts showed a reduction of 40 % of maximum static load and 45 % of maximum dynamic load on servo-actuators compared to the initial placement of the servo actuators. With appropriate servo actuators pre-inclination, dynamic loads in the non-rotating scissors are decreased by 95 % at high speed trim flight. This paper shows how it is possible to keep a conventional rotor control system for <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters.</b> The optimization algorithm presented in this paper can be used for conventional helicopters to reduce loads in the control system and then limit command reinjection because of control system flexibility, and on <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> to expand the flight envelope and to remove control system loads as the first limit factors at high speed...|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{helicopters}} {{get both}} their propulsion and lift {{from the main}} rotor, and by using a dedicated propulsion device such as a propeller or jet engine, the rotor burden is lessened.If wings are also used to lift the aircraft, the rotor can be unloaded (partially or fully) and its rotational speed further reduced, enabling higher aircraft speed. <b>Compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> use these methods, but the Boeing A160 Hummingbird shows that rotor-slowing is possible without wings or propellers, and regular helicopters may reduce turbine RPM (and thus rotor speed) to 85% using 19% less power. Alternatively, research suggests that twin-engine helicopters may decrease consumption by 25%-40% when running only one engine, given adequate height and velocity well inside the safe areas of the height-velocity diagram.|$|R
5000|$|Helicopters were {{developed}} and built {{during the first}} half-century of flight, with the Focke-Wulf Fw 61 being the first operational helicopter in 1936. Some helicopters reached limited production, {{but it was not}} until 1942 that a helicopter designed by Igor Sikorsky reached full-scale production, with 131 aircraft built. [...] Though most earlier designs used more than one main rotor, it is the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration that has become the most common helicopter configuration. Tandem rotor helicopters are also in widespread use due to their greater payload capacity. Coaxial helicopters, tiltrotor aircraft, and <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> are all flying today. Quadcopter helicopters pioneered as early as 1907 in France, and other types of multicopter have been developed for specialized applications such as unmanned drones.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, to fund expansion, Piasecki sold a 51% {{interest}} in the company to Laurance Rockefeller and A. Felix du Pont, Jr. for $500,000. Don R. Berlin was brought in as {{president and director of}} Piasecki Helicopters in 1953, while Frank Piasecki was chairman of the board. The majority owners eventually lost faith in Frank Piasecki's leadership and by May 1956 {{he was out of the}} company. He had formed a new company, Piasecki Aircraft Corporation to pursue the development of <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> and other rotorcraft. In two successive special stockholders' meetings the board then changed the name of Piasecki Helicopter to Vertol (for vertical take-off and landing) Aircraft Corporation and amended the bylaws to bar Piasecki's re-election as a director, on the grounds that he was running a rival company.|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of <b>compound</b> <b>helicopters</b> utilizing lift-offset rotors are examined, {{in the context of}} short-haul, medium-size civil and military missions. The analysis tools used are the comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II and the sizing code NDARC. Following correlation of the comprehensive analysis with existing lift-offset aircraft flight test data, the rotor performance model for the sizing code was developed, and an initial estimate was made of the rotor size and key hover and cruise flight conditions. The rotor planform and twist were optimized for those conditions, and the sizing code rotor performance model updated. Two models for estimating the blade and hub weight of lift-offset rotors are discussed. The civil and military missions are described, along with the aircraft design assumptions. The aircraft are sized for 30 passengers or 6600 lb payload, with a range of 300 nm. Civil and military aircraft designs are described for each of the rotor weight models. Disk loading and blade loading were varied to optimize the designs, based on gross weight and fuel burn. The influence of technology is shown, in terms of rotor hub drag and rotor weight...|$|R
