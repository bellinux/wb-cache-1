50|$|The {{companies}} that supply foodservice operators are called foodservice distributors. Foodservice distributors sell goods like small wares (kitchen utensils) and foods.

40|$|Food {{labels are}} able to support {{consumers}} in making more sustainable food choices in out-of-home consumption situations. Thereby, the effect of changing consumption behaviour depends on the format of food labels and on the information it provides. In order to assess {{the importance of the}} amount of information as well as the <b>design</b> of food <b>labels</b> displaying sustainability aspects, we test different formats of food labels using a best-worst choice design. So far, no research tested a variation of information depth while keeping <b>label</b> <b>designs</b> fixed. We find clear preferences across both dimensions. Results indicate that consumers regard labels with a higher information depth as more helpful in order to choose a sustainable meal. For the <b>label</b> <b>design</b> it became obvious that the slider-design is preferred over footprints and traffic light <b>label</b> <b>design...</b>|$|R

5000|$|From {{their early}} years through about 1931, the ornate <b>label</b> <b>design</b> {{was like the}} 1921 label (shown above) with only changes in the {{ownership}} info along the bottom. Starting in 1932 or so, the label changed to a gold color with the same overall design. For {{a very short time}} in 1935, the colors were inverted to a black label with gold printing. Collectors consider this short-lived style highly desirable (and a few good selling gold label issues were pressed using this rarer <b>label</b> <b>design).</b> Later in 1935, the label was changed to a black scroll label with a scroll covering most of the <b>label</b> <b>design.</b> In 1937, the label was changed again to a blue with gold printing and the legend [...] "full range recording" [...] along the top. In 1938 through 1941, the blue label was simplified (see the Armstrong reissue above).|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "pink scroll" [...] <b>label</b> <b>design</b> was {{the first}} <b>label</b> <b>design</b> used on LPs {{released}} by the Charisma label. In the UK, they were used from Charisma's inception in 1969 until mid-1972, starting {{with the release of}} Lindisfarne's Dingly Dell LP (CAS 1057). This was replaced by the large Mad Hatter <b>label,</b> <b>designed</b> by Paul Whitehead of Genesis sleeve design notability. In the USA, the pink scroll labels were used in late 1973 and early 1974 on releases distributed by Buddah Records. Releases distributed by Atlantic Records used the small Mad Hatter design. Because Charisma had many bands who were relatively unknown when they were signed, many original pressings of early UK issues of albums from Charisma bands like Genesis, Audience and Van der Graaf Generator with pink scroll labels have become quite rare and sought after by collectors. They were distributed by B&C Records.|$|R

50|$|At this point, Island {{introduced}} the second pink label. It {{is known as}} the black block label, as it featured a thick, block-like letter i at the bottom, dotted by a black eyeball in the centre of the label. This was very quickly replaced by the third pink label, featuring a small white letter i logo. Due to variations in catalogue number assignation and the actual release dates of the records, there is a small cross-over period between the three pink <b>label</b> <b>designs.</b> The original <b>label</b> <b>designs</b> for the following LPs are detailed in parentheses.|$|R
50|$|Some wineries place great {{importance}} on the <b>label</b> <b>design</b> while others do not. There are wineries {{that have not}} changed their <b>label's</b> <b>design</b> in over 60 years, {{as in the case}} of Château Simone, while others hire designers every year to change it. Labels may include images of works by Picasso, Chagall, and other artists, and these may be collector's pieces. The elegance of the label does not determine the wine's quality. Instead, it is the information contained within the label that can provide consumers with such knowledge.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} a series of pink <b>label</b> <b>designs</b> was used for singles WIP-6000 to WIP-6051, inclusive. Sometimes {{referred}} to as the [...] "eye" [...] <b>label</b> <b>design,</b> it featured an orange and black elliptical device on the left-hand side of the label which could be said to resemble a grotesque eyeball when viewed sideways. [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] sides were clearly delineated on this early series of pink label singles, thus: WIP-6050-A (Traffic's [...] "Medicated Goo") and WIP-6050-B (the same band's [...] "Shanghai Noodle Factory").|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{explore the}} effects on {{perceptions}} of labelling food for genetically modified content. Background: there is increasing public pressure for the compulsory labelling of genetically modified food content on all food products, and yet {{little is known about}} how the design and content of such food labels will influence product perceptions. The current research draws upon warning label research - a field in which the effect of <b>label</b> <b>design</b> manipulations on perceptions of, and responses to, potential or perceived risks is well documented. Method. Two experiments are reported that investigate how <b>label</b> <b>design</b> features influence the perception of genetically modified foods. The effects of label colour (red, blue and green), wording style (definitive vs. probabilistic and explicit vs. non-explicit) and information source (government agency, consumer group and manufacturer) on hazard perceptions and purchase intentions were measured. Results. Hazard perceptions and purchase intentions were both influenced by <b>label</b> <b>design</b> characteristics in predictable ways. Any reference to genetic modification, even if the label is stating that the product is free of genetically modified ingredients, increased hazard perception, and decreased purchase intentions, relative to a no-label condition. Conclusion. <b>Label</b> <b>design</b> effects generalise from warning label research to influence the perception of genetically modified foods in predictable ways. Application.
