5|$|Polygamy {{caused a}} breach between Smith {{and his first}} wife, Emma. Although Emma knew of some of her husband's marriages, she almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know {{the extent of his}} {{polygamous}} activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated a revelation directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have mounted archers, {{as this was}} an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are {{unsuitable}} for use on horseback. As for the infantry, the archery capability of the Rhine Germans has traditionally been seen as negligible, due to the 6th-century writer Agathias's comment that the Franks {{did not know how}} to use bows. But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E
5|$|The stele almost <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{originate}} {{in the town of}} Rashid (Rosetta) where it was found, but more likely came from a temple site farther inland, possibly the royal town of Sais. The temple from which it originally came was probably closed around AD 392 when Eastern Roman emperor Theodosius I ordered the closing of all non-Christian temples of worship. The original stele broke at some point, its largest piece becoming what we now know as the Rosetta Stone. Ancient Egyptian temples were later used as quarries for new construction, and the Rosetta Stone probably was re-used in this manner. Later it was incorporated in the foundations of a fortress constructed by the Mameluke Sultan Qaitbay (c. 1416/18–1496) to defend the Bolbitine branch of the Nile at Rashid. There it lay for at least another three centuries until its rediscovery.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

25|$|The 1966 model's frontal {{appearance}} was mildly altered with an eggcrate grille insert {{to replace the}} previous horizontal bars, and the coupe lost its roof-mounted extractor vents, which had proven inefficient. Corvettes also received an emblem {{in the corner of}} the hood for 1966. Head rests were a new option, one of the rarest options was the Red/Red Automatic option with power windows and air conditioning from factory which records show production numbered only 7 convertibles and 33 coupes. This relative lack of change reflected plans to bring out an all-new Corvette for 1967. It <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> reflect a fall-off in the car's popularity, however. In fact, 1966 would prove another record-busting year, with volume rising to 27,720 units, up some 4,200 over 1965s sales.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} this became almost a {{mandatory}} exercise {{and although it}} may seem to many to be a gross act of indecency, it was generally well received by the sometimes up to hundreds of tourists and locals. The Kai Tais or Beanie Boys, as the trans women were referred to by Anglophone white visitors, <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> mind either. By the mid-70s Singapore started a crackdown on this type of lewd behaviour and sailors were arrested at gunpoint by the local authorities for upholding the tradition. By this time those sailors brave enough to try it were dealt with severely and even shipped home in disgrace. Though many locals accepted this part of Singaporean culture, many conservative Singaporeans {{felt that it was}} a disgrace and it defaced Singapore's image.|$|E
25|$|In 219 BC, Hannibal {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Saguntum, which stood under the special protection of Rome. According to Roman tradition, Hannibal {{had been made to}} swear by his father never to be a friend of Rome, and he <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take a conciliatory attitude when the Romans berated him for crossing the river Iberus (Ebro), which Carthage was bound by treaty not to cross. Hannibal did not cross the Ebro River (Saguntum was near modern Valencia – well south of the river) in arms, and the Saguntines provoked his attack by attacking their neighboring tribes who were Carthaginian protectorates and by massacring pro-Punic factions in their city. Rome had no legal protection pact with any tribe south of the Ebro River. Nonetheless, they asked Carthage to hand Hannibal over, and when the Carthaginian oligarchy refused, Rome declared war on Carthage.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, {{after years}} of living in poverty on the meager sum {{provided}} by Johnson and any money she could acquire through menial jobs, Jack brought Scott to court demanding $1,000 per month to support herself and her son, and a share of whatever interests Scott held in Scotty's Castle and the gold mine Jack still believed he had. The lawsuit failed because Scotty {{did not have any}} legal interests in mining or the castle, and <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have the funds to pay her $1,000 per month. Jack then immediately turned her suit against Johnson himself, accusing him of manipulating her husband and hiding his finances so as to thwart her. Johnson, of course, had no legal obligation to pay Jack any money at all, nor to give her a share in any of his property, so Jack's lawsuit again failed. Johnson took pity on her, however, and raised the monthly amount he gave her to $75.|$|E
25|$|Petre <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> obtain {{his many}} {{important}} commissions {{because of a}} lack of competing architects. The equally versatile R. A. Lawson was responsible for several important buildings in the city including the neoclassical ANZ Bank building and the Gothic revival Presbyterian First Church. W. B. Armson designed the Italian Renaissance Bank of New Zealand building in 1879, and George Troup was responsible for the magnificent Dunedin Railway Station. Nor did Petre obtain work, with the possible exception of the Sacred Heart Basilica at Wellington, because of his family connections. On the contrary, his Catholicism, at the height of the British Empire, possibly lost him more ecclesiastical commissions than those for which he was ever engaged. What stood out was his engineer's practicalities at overcoming almost impossible difficulties. St. Joseph's Cathedral was built not only on the side of a hill, but also in a gully. His pioneering work with concrete and steel was of enormous value in a country where earthquakes were a constant risk.|$|E
25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the {{engagement}} at Plum Point, the River Defense Fleet was again in action against the Western Gunboat Flotilla, but conditions were far from the same. One change {{may or may not have}} had a significant effect on the battle. The strange divided command system of the fleet, in which the guns were manned by artillerymen who were not part of the crews, unraveled in the face of mounting Confederate losses that affected morale adversely. The gunners and rivermen were increasingly at odds, and on at least one occasion the soldiers refused to accompany the fleet on a minor mission. Finally, on 5 June 1862, Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson removed his men. This would certainly have been serious if the rams had been intended to rely on their guns. As it was, the departure of the soldiers affected the fleet only marginally, although it <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> help.|$|E

500|$|This {{ambiguity}} over terminology {{has made}} historical {{analysis of the}} use of [...] "keeps" [...] problematic. While the term remains in common academic use, some academics prefer to use the term donjon, and most modern historians warn against using the term [...] "keep" [...] simplistically. The fortifications that we would today call keeps <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> necessarily form part of a unified medieval style, nor were they all used in a similar fashion during the period.|$|E
500|$|It is possible, therefore, that a {{historical}} king named Ælle existed, who {{arrived from the}} continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered {{much of what is}} now Sussex. [...] He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time. [...] This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain. [...] The battles listed in the Chronicle are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years. [...] His area of military control may have extended as far as Hampshire and north to the upper Thames valley, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead {{makes the}} startling {{observation}} that [...] "life is comparatively deficient in survival value." [...] If humans can only exist {{for about a}} hundred years, and rocks for eight hundred million, then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place; as Whitehead humorously notes, [...] "they <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them." [...] He then observes that the mark of higher forms of life {{is that they are}} actively engaged in modifying their environment, an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living, living well, and living better. [...] In other words, Whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction. [...] Without such a goal, he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible.|$|E
500|$|Despite the Mayo Foundation's {{arguments}} otherwise, the Court {{ruled that}} [...] "student" [...] was a sufficiently ambiguous term {{to state that}} Congress has specifically addressed the issue. The Court also noted that Congress in the past had specifically singled out medical residents when making exemptions available, which in the Court's eyes made the Mayo Foundation's arguments about unambiguity unreasonable. Therefore, according to Chevron, {{the role of the}} courts should solely be to determine whether the Treasury Department made a reasonable decision—and the Court concluded that the Treasury did just that. In writing for the Court, Roberts stated that [...] "The [...] department <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> act irrationally in concluding that these doctors – 'who work long hours, serve as high [...] skilled professionals, and typically share {{some or all of the}} terms of employment of career employees' – are the kind of workers that Congress intended to both contribute and benefit from the Social Security system".|$|E
500|$|The poor {{steaming}} {{characteristics of}} the class had {{been the result of}} rushed production, which was another factor that led to the bad reputation of the Clan Class. [...] Furthermore, they suffered from complaints regarding a lack of pulling power, although this can be attributed to indifferent handling and firing techniques, which <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> help the situation. [...] However, had the Modernisation Plan been delayed, and the correct amount of investment made for undertaking the relevant modifications, such as streamlining of the steam passages and increased diameter blastpipe in a double-chimney layout, the Clans would have been free-steaming workhorses worthy of complementing the 'Britannias'. [...] Without modification, they were still capable machines when handled properly, as various feats testifying this included regular ascents of Shap and Beattock with 14carriages without the assistance of a banking locomotive. [...] Other arduous duties that the class frequently undertook were the regular turns on the Settle to Carlisle route, which has some of the steepest gradients and harshest working conditions of any British mainline. [...] The Midland region was always short of top-link motive power and the Clan Class proved to be a very welcome addition to the fleet.|$|E
