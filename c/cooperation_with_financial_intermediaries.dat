40|$|This paper {{studies the}} nature of {{monetary}} policy in a cash-in-advance model with indivisible labor and <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> that provide loans for working capital. Monetary policy occurs through money injections either directly to families or to <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Injections to families produce an inflation tax while injections directly to <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide an inflation subsidy that improves output, consumption, and welfare. This model helps explain why monetary policy based on growth in monetary aggregates can have ambiguous output effects, why central bankers usually prefer interest rate rules to monetary aggregate rules, and why estimated money demand equations tend to be unstable. ...|$|R

We study an economy <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> that issue debt and equity to buy risky assets. Asset substitution alone cannot cause bubbles {{because it is}} priced into the intermediaries׳ securities. But incomplete contracts and managerial agency problems can make intermediaries take excessive risk to exploit limited liability, bidding up risky asset prices.

40|$|Purpose - Assessment of African {{financial}} development dynamic convergences in money, credit, {{efficiency and}} size. Design/Methodology - The empirical evidence is premised on 11 homogenous panels based on regions (Sub-Saharan and North Africa), income-levels (low, middle, lower-middle and upper-middle), legal-origins (English common-law and French civil-law) and religious dominations (Christianity and Islam). We examine convergence in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> dynamics of depth, efficiency, activity and size. Findings - Findings suggest that countries <b>with</b> small-sized <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> depth, efficiency, activity and size are catching-up countries <b>with</b> large-sized <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> depth, efficiency, activity and size respectively. We also provide the speeds of convergence and time {{necessary to achieve}} a full (100 %) convergence. Practical implications - The presence of strong links among African banking sectors may present little opportunity for portfolio diversification. The convergence patterns show positive steps towards regional integration. As a policy implication, African governments should not relent in structural and institutional reforms. Originality/value - It is the first critical assessment of convergence in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development dynamics in the African continent...|$|R
30|$|On the contrary, in a bank-based {{financial}} system, most firms deal {{almost exclusively}} <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> {{and the possibility}} of substituting market debt for bank debt is limited to a very few large firms. In this context, an increase in the information asymmetry can impair the access to bank debt (De Andrés Alonso et al. 2005; García-Teruel et al. 2014 b) and create bank credit rationing (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981). Consequently, there is an incentive for constrained firms to use more trade credit as a short-term financing alternative, since suppliers might be better skilled at overcoming informational asymmetries and enforcement problems than financial institutions (Love 2011).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{an estimated}} dynamic stochastic {{general equilibrium model}} to study the role of labor reallocation between production and organizational tasks within a firm in movements in measured TFP in Japan. Allocating more labor to organizational tasks strengthens the <b>financial</b> relationship <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and helps firms to mitigate a widening in credit spread during financial difficulties. However, doing so reduces the labor allocated to production tasks and hence the measured TFP. Our quantitative analysis indicates that labor reallocation contributes to the observed procyclicality in measured TFP.

40|$|This paper assesses two {{theories}} {{regarding the}} historical determinants of international differences in financial development. The law and finance theory holds that legal traditions differ {{in terms of}} the priority they attach to protecting the rights of private investors vis-a-vis the State and this has important implications for financial development. The endowment theory argues that the disease and geographical environment influence the formation of long-lasting institutions that influence financial development. Using a sample of former colonies, we explore whether the legal system brought by colonizers and/or the initial disease/geographical endowments encountered by colonizers explain financial development today. The empirical results indicate that both the legal systems brought by colonizers and the initial endowments in the colonies are important determinants of stock market development and private property rights protection. However, initial endowments are more robustly associated <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> development than legal origin and initial endowments explain more of the cross-country variation in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> and stock market development than legal origin. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1960 s, Tobin has {{set himself}} the {{objective}} of developing a macroeconomic model more general than that specified by Keynes in the General Theory.

This paper critically analyses Tobin's theory and shows that this theory overlooks an important function of banks highlighted by Keynes, and that the specification of this banks' function is the necessary condition to highlight the most significant aspects of what Keynes calls a monetary economy. These points enable us to draw some observations about the question of the financial system regulation...|$|R
30|$|As {{documented}} by Claus and Grimes (2003), two principal strands {{exist in the}} theoretical underpinnings {{of the literature on}} the linkage between <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and information sharing. The first strand investigates liquidity provision by financial institutions, while the second focuses on the capacity of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> to modify the risk characteristics of assets. Both strands are founded on the essential economic role of financial intermediation, which is to augment efficiency in allocation by reducing the cost of conveying mobilized deposits from depositors to borrowers. The theories underlying the mission of financial intermediation are based on the literature of imperfect information in the market. Accordingly, the primary task of financial intermediation is to reduce transaction and information costs arising from information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Therefore, the establishment of information-sharing bureaus is a channel through which such information can be consolidated. These underpinnings are consistent with the pioneering literature on the relevance of information sharing in <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> efficiency; most notably on models of credit rationing (see Williamson 1986; Stiglitz and Weiss 1981; Jaffee and Russell 1976), ex-post and ex-ante information asymmetry (Diamond and Dybvig 1983), communication on potential borrowers to investors by banks (Leland and Pyle 1977), and diversification <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (Diamond 1984).|$|R

The covenant package is now less restrictive and the types of covenants used are more heterogenous. We also survey a sample of 41 recent Australian private debt contracts. These contracts contain a greater number, variety and, collectively, more restrictive set of financial covenants than those public debt contracts we survey, supporting theory which suggests that covenant restrictive and renegotiation-flexible contracts are more suited to borrowers contracting <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in private debt markets.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{quantitative}} monetary DSGE model <b>with</b> <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> that face endogenously determined balance sheet constraints. We {{then use the}} model to evaluate {{the effects of the}} central bank using unconventional monetary policy to combat a simulated financial crisis. We interpret unconventional monetary policy as expanding central bank credit intermediation to offset a disruption of private financial intermediation. Within our framework the central bank is less efficient than private intermediaries at making loans but it has the advantage of being able to elastically obtain funds by issuing riskless government debt. Unlike private intermediaries, it is not balance sheet constrained. During a crisis, the balance sheet constraints on private intermediaries tighten, raising the net benefits from central bank intermediation. These benefits may be substantial even if the zero lower bound constraint on the nominal interest rate is not binding. In the event this constraint is binding, though, these net benefits may be significantly enhanced. ...|$|R
