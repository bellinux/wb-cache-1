2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} the AW119 Koala {{has developed a}} reputation as one of the safest helicopters in its class. Nicknamed [...] "Volvo of light helicopters" [...] by operators and technicians, it has proven a forgiving platform when exposed to extreme conditions and operational tempos. The AW119 incorporates a level of system redundancy unparalleled in its class; a few examples being: duel hydraulic pumps driven directly by its main rotor transmission on opposite sides, two separate stability augmentation systems, electronic engine control system coupled with a direct throttle <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> to fuel metering unit and mechanical governor allowing for a MANUAL mode, two fuel tank boost pumps in addition to engine driven fuel pump, two heading GMU sensors, two independent VHF systems available, and primary and secondary GPS sources. A high-inertia rotor system coupled with a robust box structure and separated fuel bladder tank setup has contributed greatly to crash survivability.|$|E

50|$|The {{prototype}} (registration G-CAVO) {{was first}} flown at the Cartierville airport on 23 September 1928 by Martin Berlyn.

50|$|The only {{completed}} S-33, registration N322LA, {{crashed in}} a test flight July 25, 2006 in Spanish Fork, Utah, killing the two test pilots aboard, Glenn Maben and Nathan Forrest. The aircraft rolled right immediately after takeoff, reaching a 90 degree angle before the wingtip struck the ground. The preliminary NTSB report revealed that the <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> had been connected backwards during maintenance after the previous flight, resulting in opposite control output (a left roll input on the control stick resulting in the aircraft rolling right).|$|E
50|$|For 1966, the twin-cable {{shift and}} park control {{mechanism}} (a holdover from the push-button operation) {{was replaced by}} a solid shift <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> consisting of a series of pushrods, rotating rods and levers. The rear pump was eliminated, which simplified and cost-reduced the transmission but rendered push-starting impossible; Chrysler engineers reasoned that improved electrical and fuel systems reduced the need to push-start vehicles, and safety concerns weighed against doing so. The gated shift quadrants also permitted the deletion of the reverse safety blocker valve which, in TorqueFlites made through 1965, had shifted the transmission harmlessly into Neutral if the Reverse position were selected with the vehicle moving forward above approximately 3 mph.|$|E

5000|$|Underneath the Maxi's {{practical}} and spacious bodyshell lay an all-new {{front wheel drive}} chassis, which was interlinked with an innovative five-speed manual transmission. The latter suffered from notorious problems with its <b>control</b> <b>linkage,</b> especially in early models which had a cable-operated linkage prone to cable stretch and other problems. These were noted by autotesters such as Vicar in Today's Driver (1969), who wrote: [...] "This is probably a good idea that just needs {{a little bit of}} working on." [...] The later rod linkage was less problematic. All models were prone to problems brought on by the [...] "cogs in the sump" [...] layout, whereby the gearbox and engine shared a common oil supply.

50|$|The board {{found that}} the crash was survivable and that {{deficiencies}} in the seating, restraint systems, and the cabin configuration contributed {{to the deaths of}} seven of the occupants who appeared to have survived the initial impact. The primary cause of the accident was found to be a failure in the flight control systems, specifically a separation of the fore/aft bellcrank from the pitch <b>control</b> <b>linkages</b> in the aircraft's mixing unit. The failure in the flight control systems was ultimately found to be caused by systematic errors and deficiencies in the maintenance program employed by 817 Squadron {{at the time of the}} accident.

25|$|A {{conventional}} {{fixed-wing aircraft}} {{flight control system}} consists of flight control surfaces, the respective cockpit <b>controls,</b> connecting <b>linkages,</b> and the necessary operating mechanisms to control an aircraft's direction in flight.

5000|$|... ==How It Works == The {{steering}} wheel {{is connected to}} the hydraulic control unit, which contains a slide valve, the control gears and linkage, and the centring piston and cam. The steering rack pinion {{is connected to the}} hydraulic control unit through an adjuster, to allow setting of the centre point of the steering. This then drives one of the control gears, the other being driven by the {{steering wheel}}. The <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> consists of two gears coupled with rods through ball-joints. When the gears are turned relative to each other, the rods move the slide valve, allowing fluid in or out of the rack. This moves the rack, which in turn moves its pinion, turning the control gears back to their centre position. Compare this with a conventional power steering system, which relies on the flexing of a strong spring to control the valve.|$|E
50|$|The MAK's {{preliminary}} report, {{issued the}} week of 25 September 2006, attributed the accident to pilot error, while finding {{that there was no}} problem with the engines or the aircraft.The autopilot and thrust controller were switched off by the crew at a height of 100m and could not have any effect on the landing and landing run. The couplings linking the thrust controller to the engine <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> were uncoupled and were not connected to the linkage any more. No steering commands given by the thrust controller computer were recorded. The results of the investigation of the electronic guidance and engine control system (FADEС) testify to the efficiency of the system right up to when the airplane collided with the barriers. The airplane landed in the touchdown zone at Irkutsk airport at 22:43:40 in wheel control mode with engines running at idle. After landing, the spoilers were automatically deployed and the automatic braking system (ABS) was automatically switched on in LOW mode. 1.5 seconds after touchdown, the airplane captain set the reverse thrust lever for the right engine to the reverse mode. The right engine correctly went into reverse thrust mode. The reverse thrust lever for the left engine was not applied.|$|E
40|$|It appears most {{probable}} that the Watts linkage {{of the aircraft}} has experienced a tensile overload superimposed with bending stresses during {{which one of the}} bolts of the fork connector between the pogo stick and the frame got sheared off. Evidences also suggest that both the bolts of the fork connector were present at the time of failure and there were no abnormalities in the assembly. Tell tale marks on the inner surface of the fork of the link assembly suggest that the bolt connecting the lever and the link assembly of the <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> port PFCU was present prior to the accident. Evidences also suggest that this joint has experienced compressive force due to impact leading to shearing off of the bolt and subsequent dislodgement of all the attaching parts. Certain damages were seen on the bolts and/or nuts of <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> starboard PFCU and engine throttle <b>control</b> <b>linkage</b> in question, which probably have been caused by split pins. This means that split pins were present in these bolts at some given time during their service life. It was not possible to ascertain whether or not these bolts were fitted with split pins prior to the accident. ...|$|E
50|$|If {{the points}} are rigidly {{connected}} to the switch control mechanism, the <b>control</b> mechanism's <b>linkages</b> may be bent, requiring repair before the switch is again usable. For this reason, switches are normally set to the proper position before performing a trailing-point movement.|$|R
50|$|Tailslides will transiently {{reverse the}} airflow on many {{aircraft}} surfaces, giving abnormal forces compared with forward flight. The <b>control</b> surface <b>linkages</b> {{must be able}} to handle these forces without damage or deformation. Not all airplanes capable of aerobatics are capable of tailslide maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial rotors are {{a pair of}} rotors mounted {{one above}} {{the other on the}} same shaft and turning in {{opposite}} directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects of dissymmetry of lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and swashplates for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and <b>control</b> <b>linkages</b> for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system.|$|R

50|$|Upon Kurzenberger’s {{retirement}} in 1983 at age 65, he started {{work on his}} replica. Like Langhurst, Kurzenberger purchased a junked PT-19 fuselage, mainly to use its fixed landing gear but also to salvage any useable 4130 Chromalloy tubing and re-use the <b>control</b> <b>linkages</b> and rod ends which had stainless steel needle bearings and would give the replica Stuka’s flight controls a smoother feel. Kurzenberger also acquired a Lycoming GO-435 C model aero engine through a publication called Trade-A-Plane. It came complete with a three-blade constant speed propeller. Kurzenberger simplified some of the forms on his Stuka, especially around {{the nose of the}} plane, so it did not adhere as faithfully as Langhurst’s to the original Ju-87 dive-bomber’s lines. He also chose to omit the swastika emblems on the tail. In overall appearance, however, there was no mistaking what historical plane it represented.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{the large}} space {{buildings}} {{are in the}} event of fire, the mechanical smoke exhaust system must start safely and reliably with the smoke spreading quickly.

40|$|SummaryCyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) play central {{roles in}} {{bacterial}} pathogenesis and innate immunity. The mammalian enzyme cGAS synthesizes a unique cyclic dinucleotide (cGAMP) containing a 2 ʹ– 5 ʹ phosphodiester linkage essential for optimal immune stimulation, but the molecular basis for linkage specificity is unknown. Here, {{we show that}} the Vibrio cholerae pathogenicity factor DncV is a prokaryotic cGAS-like enzyme whose activity provides a mechanistic rationale for the unique ability of cGAS to produce 2 ʹ– 5 ʹ cGAMP. Three high-resolution crystal structures show that DncV and human cGAS generate CDNs in sequential reactions that proceed in opposing directions. We explain 2 ʹ and 3 ʹ linkage specificity and test this model by reprogramming the human cGAS active site to produce 3 ʹ– 5 ʹ cGAMP, leading to selective stimulation of alternative STING adaptor alleles in cells. These results demonstrate mechanistic homology between bacterial signaling and mammalian innate immunity and explain how active site configuration <b>controls</b> <b>linkage</b> chemistry for pathway-specific signaling...|$|R
