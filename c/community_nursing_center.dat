40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the health promotion interventions of nurses serving a low-income urban population in an academic <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> <b>center</b> (CNC) in Wisconsin. MethodsThe Omaha System (OS) was used to code client problems and nursing interventions for 9, 839 visits at the CNC. A dataset created by the Automated Community Health Information System (ACHIS), a computerized clinical information system, was used. A pilot testing was performed with the ACHIS data repository. Each intervention was linked to a nursing diagnosis coded with modifiers as either actual or potential problems or health promotion issues. The Lundeen's Comprehensive Community-based Primary Health Care Model (CCPHCM) which emphasizes primary prevention and health promotion activities served as the conceptual framework for this study. ResultsA total of 58, 747 modifiers were documented for 58, 747 nursing diagnoses where a total of 9, 836 nursing interventions were provided to 9, 839 community center visits at the CNC. Although a majority of the nursing diagnoses (61. 8 %) were coded as actual problems as might be expected for this vulnerable population, 38 % of the client problems were documented as potential problems (20. 6 %) and health promotion issues (17. 7 %.) Health Teaching, Guidance and Counseling (38. 9 %) and Case Management (25. 8 %) were the most frequently coded interventions. ConclusionThis research adds to the understanding of the importance of nurses' interventions toward health promotion with the vulnerable population. This preliminary analysis suggests that the ACHIS provide a clinical information system for collecting, storing, processing, retrieving, and managing clinical data in a data repository.

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that faith <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> are not expected to provide patient care in the church or at a patient's home but rather to be a source of referrals for services in the community. They coordinate existing services and supplement them with a holistic dimension of health and caring.A parish nurse program or faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> program can operate in several different ways. Models include: 1) one church supporting its own full or part-time nurse, 2) several churches supporting one nurse, 3) a group of volunteer nurses supporting one or several churches or four) a nurse related to a hospital or clinic who supports a church or churches as part of his or her job.

40|$|This paper {{contains}} a comparative study on <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, {{carried out in}} the region around Maastricht, where the borders of the three countries meet. The well-known problem of comparative studies (the incomparability of concepts and data) has been solved by using the same measuring instruments in the three countries. The comparison between the countries was on three aspects: the level of care dependency of the patients, the type and number of services provided and the nurses' job interpretation and job satisfaction. During 1 week in June or September 1991, 89 <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> made records of all their home visits and nursing activities. In total the <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> paid 5165 home visits to provide care to 1796 patients. The results indicate that both the level of care dependency of the patients as well as the type of care provided differs between the three countries. Belgian <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> have the highest number of patients {{with a high level of}} care dependency. Curative services like technical nursing care and domestic care are most frequently provided by the German and Belgian <b>community</b> <b>nurses.</b> Informing, educating and supporting care is most frequently provided by the Dutch <b>community</b> <b>nurses.</b> The German <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> spend less time on administration activities. With respect to job interpretation and job satisfaction the following results were found. The Dutch <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> mentioned in their job interpretation many more preventive tasks, whereas the German <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> more often mentioned domestic tasks. Concerning the hygienic and technical tasks, no significant differences were found between the three countries. Finally, job satisfaction is lowest in the Netherlands.

40|$|Background: People with {{dementia}} require {{a high level}} of care and this care is mostly provided by informal caregivers with support from professionals. The growing population of elderly people was reason for a policy change that has led to a transition in care since January 2015. Specialized dementia care is now performed by <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> and <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> also assess care for clients {{with dementia}} since January 2015. Recent research shows that since the transition took place, there has been a decrease in assessments and prescriptions in specialized dementia care. Aim: The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe how <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> shape the care assessment process for dementia clients in primary care and to identify the experience of <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> with care assessments for dementia clients in primary care. Methods: A qualitative approach was chosen. The research sample consists of fifteen <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> working in primary care in the Netherlands. Data collection and analysis were carried out between January 2016 and April 2016. Data collection consists of observations and interviews with <b>community</b> <b>nurses.</b> Observations and interviews were analysed using the QUAGOL method. Results: In the analysis, five main topics were discovered; care needs, dementia process and symptoms, <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> and specialized dementia care, structured list and education. Conclusion: Classification methods used by <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> are only focussed on activities of daily living. <b>Community</b> <b>nurses</b> do not have the knowledge and tools to assess the full spectrum of care needs of clients with dementia. Recommendations: Research is needed to develop a dementia tool for care assessments, which embodies the full spectrum of dementia care. <b>Community</b> <b>nurses</b> need education to be able to assess specialized dementia care...|$|R
40|$|Australian nursing {{claims a}} common history with Britain, yet an {{inconsistency}} exists in that <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> in Britain {{is a highly}} valued area of nursing practice, whereas in New South Wales <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> is of less value than institution based nursing practice.

This study explains why <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> in New South Wales is unlike <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> in Britain even though hospital based nursing in New South Wales is very similar to the British system.

40|$|Objective: Our study {{describes}} the services faith- <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> provide to a community- dwelling sample {{of patients with}} elevated blood pressure. Design and Sample: The faith- <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> completed a survey describing services provided to study participants at each patient encounter. We describe the type of contact and the frequency and types of services provided to these patients. From October 2006 to October 2007, we conducted a partnered study with a faith- <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> program and enrolled 100 adults with elevated blood pressure from church health fairs. Measures: Patient demographics and faith- <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> services provided. Results: Data from 63 of 108 (58 %) visits to faith- <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> made by 33 participants were collected from surveys completed by the nurses. The {{majority of the participants}} were female (64 %), Latino (61 %), with an average age of 59 (SD= 11) years and incomes below US$ 30, 000 (83 %).

Issues around a lack of resources, community nurses' educational needs and the late referral of patients with non-malignant long-term conditions to <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> were also identified...|$|R
40|$|M. Cur. An {{exploratory}} {{descriptive study}} was undertaken, focusing on {{sexually transmitted diseases}} among teenagers. The aim {{of the study was}} to explore and describe the possible reasons for the high rate of sexually transmitted diseases in teenagers. The knowledge, attitudes and opinions of teenagers and <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> involved in the teenage clinic in a specific predominantly black area were assessed. Twenty teenagers and five <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> in a specific predominantly black area, were participants in the study. Focus group interviews are used. The study is conducted in two phases: teenagers representing phase one (1) and <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> as phase two (2). It can be concluded that the attitudes of <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> may have an influence on the high rate of sexually transmitted diseases, and the knowledge of the teenagers about sexually transmitted diseases is based on myths and misconceptions. The recommendations made are that the training standards for all <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> should be reviewed and adapted to meet the needs of teenagers attending the teenage services. The policy on in-service training must be reviewed and monitored. Community nurses' intensive training on teenage service delivery and sexually transmitted diseases services should be in correlation with the principles of Primary Health Care. <b>Community</b> <b>nurses</b> need to attend intensive courses on interpersonal skills specifically related to teenagers. Selection procedures for recruiting <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> to attend specifically to teenagers should be researched. The attitude of <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> and teenagers should be the core of the service delivery. Teenagers should be involved in planning programmes and the teenage clinic should be evaluated frequently to improve the standards. The availability of teenage services should result in a decrease in sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers...|$|R

40|$|Faith <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> {{is one of}} {{the newest}} {{specialized}} practices of professional <b>nursing.</b> A faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> is an actively registered professional nurse, who serves as a paid or volunteer staff member in a faith community. The faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> promotes health and wholism of the faith community, its groups, families, and individual members. A faith community, as in a church, synagogue or mosque, is an organization of individuals and families who share common beliefs, values, religious doctrine, and faith practices that influence their lives. The faith community functions as a client system for the faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to gain an understanding of the experiences of Protestant faith <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> 2 ̆ 2 living the call 2 ̆ 2 to health ministry. Previous researchers have explored the roles of the faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse,</b> but have not specifically investigated the experience of living the call. A hermeneutical phenomenological methodology was used to answer the question, 2 ̆ 2 What is the lived experience of faith <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> living the call to health ministry? 2 ̆ 2 The participants were ten Caucasian female faith <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> residing in four regions in the Commonwealth of Virginia. All participants acknowledged receiving a 2 ̆ 2 call 2 ̆ 2 to health ministry. A structured interview of 60 to 90 minutes was conducted with each participant. The interview consisted of structured and semi-structured questions and explored the meaning of living the call to health ministry. Data were analyzed using the phenomenological method of Max van Manen. Five themes emerged including: 1) the calling; 2) relating to God in living the call; 3) practice in living the call; 4) challenges in living the call; and 5) blessings in living the call. Participants described the experiences of the callings to health ministry, consistent communications with God and the challenges and blessings of faith <b>community</b> <b>nursing.</b> The practices of faith <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> were also described by the participants. The findings provide a glimpse into the lifeworld of the faith <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> living the call to health ministry. This study may be helpful to others wanting to gain a deeper understanding of the meaning of the calling to health ministry as well as the experiences of relating to God, practice, challenges, and blessings...|$|R
40|$|Aims. To {{investigate}} how general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> value {{the support that}} they receive from a nurse case manager with expertise in palliative care, whether they think the case manager is helpful in realizing appropriate care and what characteristics of the patient and case management are associated with this view. Background. For sustainable palliative care in an ageing society, basic palliative care is provided by generalists and specialist palliative care is reserved for complex situations. Acceptance of and cooperation with specialist palliative care providers by the general practitioner and <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> is pivotal. Design. Cross-sectional questionnaire study. Methods. Questionnaire data from 168 general practitioners and 125 <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> were analysed using chi-square tests, univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Data were gathered between March 2011 -December 2013. Results. Of general practitioners, 46 % rated the case manager as helpful in realizing care that is appropriate for the patient; for <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> this was 49 %. The case manager did not hinder the process of care and had added value for patients, according to the general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>nurses.</b> The tasks of the case manager were associated with {{whether or not the}} case manager was helpful in realizing appropriate care, whereas patient characteristics and the number of contacts with the case manager were not. Conclusion. General practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>nurses</b> are moderately positive about the support from the case manager. To improve cooperation further, case managers should invest in contact with general practitioners and <b>community</b> <b>nurses...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Community</b> <b>nursing</b> {{originated}} in the care given to families, mostly by the women, in primitive societies. The Christian religion had a marked influence {{on the development of}} community care with the deaconnesses being regarded as the first visiting nurses. Throughout the middle ages there were nursing orders who worked in the community but social reforms after the industrial revolution led to the emergence of secular district nursing services. The services rendered however tended to become specialised and thus fragmented. <b>Community</b> <b>nursing</b> today involves comprehensive family centered care to individuals and groups in the community by professionally qualified nurses. They work independently and are accountable for their own actions. The nature of the service rendered depends on the community being served. The population profile, disease profile and health care needs differ vastly between highly developed and developing communities. However, irrespective of the type of community being served the <b>community</b> <b>nurse</b> is a co-ordinator in the health team and must render a comprehensive and family-centred health service. Basic nursing education alone does not prepare the nurse adequately for the comprehensive <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> task. It is suggested that <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> for registration should be an option in the integrated basic nursing courses. Provision must be made for a program for registration for those who did not include <b>community</b> <b>nursing</b> in their basic course, and for advanced formal programs and informal continuing education programs in <b>community</b> <b>nursing...</b>|$|R
