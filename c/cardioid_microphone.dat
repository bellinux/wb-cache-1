2500|$|Schweitzer {{developed}} a technique for recording {{the performances of}} Bach's music. Known as [...] "The Schweitzer Technique", it is a slight improvement on what {{is commonly known as}} mid-side. The mid-side sees a figure-8 microphone pointed off-axis, perpendicular to the sound source. Then a single <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone</b> is placed on axis, bisecting the figure-8 pattern. The signal from the figure-8 is mult-ed, panned hard left and right, one of the signals being flipped out of polarity. In the Schweitzer method, the figure-8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other. The information that each capsule collects is unique, unlike the identical out-of-polarity information generated from the figure-8 in a regular mid-side. The on-axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser. The technique has since been used to record many modern instruments.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone</b> is {{effectively}} a superposition of an omnidirectional and a figure-8 microphone; for sound waves {{coming from the}} back, the negative signal from the figure-8 cancels the positive signal from the omnidirectional element, whereas for sound waves coming from the front, the two add to each other. A hyper-cardioid microphone is similar, but with a slightly larger figure-8 contribution leading to a tighter area of front sensitivity and a smaller lobe of rear sensitivity. [...] A super-cardioid microphone {{is similar to a}} hyper-cardioid, except there is more front pickup and less rear pickup. [...] While any pattern between omni and figure 8 is possible by adjusting their mix, common definitions state that a hypercardioid is produced by combining them at a 3:1 ratio, producing nulls at 109.5°, while supercardioid is produced with about a 5:3 ratio, with nulls at 126.9°. The sub-cardioid microphone has no null points. It is produced with about 7:3 ratio with 3-10dB level between the front and back pickup.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{unidirectional}} microphone is a <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone,</b> {{so named because}} the sensitivity pattern is [...] "heart-shaped", i.e. a cardioid. The cardioid family of microphones are commonly used as vocal or speech microphones, since they are good at rejecting sounds from other directions. In three dimensions, the cardioid is shaped like an apple centred around the microphone which is the [...] "stem" [...] of the apple. The cardioid response reduces pickup from the side and rear, helping to avoid feedback from the monitors. Since these directional transducer microphones achieve their patterns by sensing pressure gradient, putting them {{very close to the}} sound source (at distances of a few centimeters) results in a bass boost due to the increased gradient. This is known as the proximity effect. The SM58 has been the most commonly used microphone for live vocals for more than 50 years demonstrating the importance and popularity of cardioid mics.|$|E

These compensate for the bass roll-off of the <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphones</b> and also add expansiveness. A 3-meter spaced microphone pair, situated 2-3 meters behind front array, is used for the surround channels.

An estimation of the current position of the talking person is obtained by comparing the left and right signals captured with two <b>cardioids</b> <b>microphones</b> that are placed in the left side and right side of the meeting room, respectively [Neumann 2009]. The distance separating the two microphones is fixed to a constant value L (figure 1). The idea of using two <b>cardioids</b> <b>microphones</b> is inspired from the human ears, which act as two sound sensors, enabling human beings to find the exact direction of a talking person with great precision.

For evaluation, recordings of five different species were used, from which bird vocalization parts were chosen using a simple VAD system. The results imply an improvement of classification success almost by 10 % when using HFCCs and a hypercardioid microphone. When using HFCCs and a <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone,</b> the improvement is by about 1 %. On average, the total success for classification of five different species is 85 % when using MFCCs and 90 % when using HFCCs.|$|E
30|$|This work studies a {{wind noise}} {{reduction}} approach for communication applications {{in a car}} environment. An endfire array consisting of two microphones is considered {{as a substitute for}} an ordinary <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone</b> capsule of the same size. Using the decomposition of the multichannel Wiener filter (MWF), a suitable beamformer and a single-channel post filter are derived. Due to the known array geometry and the location of the speech source, assumptions about the signal properties can be made to simplify the MWF beamformer and to estimate the speech and noise power spectral densities required for the post filter. Even for closely spaced microphones, the different signal properties at the microphones can be exploited to achieve a significant reduction of wind noise. The proposed beamformer approach results in an improved speech signal regarding the signal-to-noise-ratio and keeps the linear speech distortion low. The derived post filter shows equal performance compared to known approaches but reduces the effort for noise estimation.|$|E
50|$|All the {{above-mentioned}} microphone arrays take up considerable space, making them quite ineffective for field recordings. In this respect, the double MS (Mid Side) technique is quite advantageous. This array uses {{back to back}} <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphones,</b> one facing forward, the other backwards, combined with either one or two figure-eight microphone. Different channels are obtained by sum and difference of the figure-eight and cardioid patterns. When using only one figure-eight microphone, the double MS technique is extremely compact and therefore also perfectly compatible with monophonic playback. This technique also allows for postproduction changes of the pickup angle.|$|R
50|$|The OCT-Surround (Optimum <b>Cardioid</b> Triangle-Surround) <b>microphone</b> array is an {{augmented}} {{technique of}} the stereo OCT technique {{using the same}} front array with added surround microphones.The front array is designed for minimum crosstalk, with the front left and right microphones having supercardioid polar patterns and angled at 90 degrees relative to the center microphone. It is important that high quality small diaphragm microphones are used for the L and R channels to reduce off-axis coloration. Equalization {{can also be used}} to flatten the response of the supercardioid microphones to signals coming in at up to about 30 degrees from the front of the array. The center channel is placed slightly forward. The surround microphones are backwards facing <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphones,</b> that are placed 40 cm back from the L and R microphones. The L, R, LS and RS microphones pick up early reflections from both the sides and the back of an acoustic venue, therefore giving significant room impressions. Spacing between the L and R microphones can be varied to obtain the required stereo width.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} time-invariant beamformers is often posed as an {{optimization}} problem using practical design constraints.

30|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a wind noise {{reduction}} approach for a closely spaced microphone array {{consisting of two}} MEMS microphones, which is considered {{as a substitute for}} an ordinary <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone</b> capsule. The decomposition of the MWF in a beamformer and a single-channel post filter is used similar to [29] as well as the assumption that the wind noise is uncorrelated at the microphones. But in contrast to [29], we assume that the noise powers at the microphones may differ. Since the geometry of the microphone array and the location of the desired speech source are known, additional assumptions about the speech and noise signal properties can be made to design a low-complexity wind noise reduction algorithm. Even for distances of only a few centimeters, the variation in the microphone signals can be used to reduce wind noise significantly. The coherence properties of speech and wind noise signals are exploited to form a beamformer, as well as to obtain estimates of the speech and noise PSDs for the post filter. Simulations with recorded wind noise show that the proposed approach improves the signal-to-noise-ratio, while keeping the linear distortion of the speech signal low.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{design process}} for time-invariant {{acoustic}} beam-formers often {{assumes that the}} microphones have an omnidi-rectional directivity pattern, a flat frequency response {{in the range of}} interest, and a 2 D environment in which wavefronts propagate as a function of azimuth angle only. In this paper we investigate those cases in which {{one or more of these}} assumptions do not hold, considering a Minimum Variance Distortionless Response (MVDR) -based solution that is optimized using mea-sured directivity patterns as a function of azimuth, elevation and frequency. Robustness to modelling error is controlled by a regularization parameter that produces a suboptimal but more robust solution. A comparative study is made with the 4 -element <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphone</b> array employed in Microsoft Kinect for Windows, whose beamformer weights are calculated with directivity patterns using (a) 2 D cardioid models, (b) 3 D cardioid models and (c) 3 D measurements.

The L, R, LS and RS microphones should be placed in a square formation, with L/R and LS/RS angled at 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the center microphone respectively. Spacing between these microphones should be about 1.8 meters. This square formation is responsible for the room impressions. The center channel is placed a meter in front of the L and R channels, producing a strong center image. The surround microphones are usually placed at the critical distance (where the direct and reverberant field is equal), with the full array usually situated several meters above and behind the conductor.|$|R

Audio engineers use highly directional <b>cardioid</b> <b>microphones</b> and various electronic devices, such as equalizers and, since the 1990s, automatic feedback detection devices to prevent these unwanted squeals or screeching sounds, which detract from the audience's enjoyment of the event. On the other hand, since the 1960s, electric guitar players in rock music bands using loud guitar amplifiers, speaker cabinets and distortion effects have intentionally created guitar feedback to create a sustained sound. The sound of guitar feedback {{is considered to be}} desirable musical effect in heavy metal music, hardcore punk and grunge. Jimi Hendrix was an innovator in the intentional use of guitar feedback in his guitar solos to create unique sound effects not possible with more traditional playing techniques.
