50|$|Cut-and-sewn gloves {{can be made}} by a <b>cut-resistant</b> {{material}} or by conventional materials with full or palm lining of <b>cut-resistant</b> materials. The materials are cut to shape and sewn into a glove.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cut-resistant</b> gloves {{are those}} {{designed}} to protect the wearer's hands from cuts while working with sharp tools. They can be divided into metal mesh gloves, cut-and-sewn, and seamless knitted gloves.|$|E
50|$|Superior Glove {{manufactures}} and distributes {{work and}} safety gloves, industry gloves, <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves and protective arm sleeves for every industry. The company sponsors projects that benefit the local communities where it operates.|$|E
50|$|Mail {{continues}} {{to be used in}} the 21st century as a component of stab-resistant body armour, <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves for butchers and woodworkers, shark-resistant wetsuits for defense against shark bites, and a number of other applications.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, {{the company}} {{developed}} a non-metallic <b>cut-resistant</b> protective glove for meat processors and industrial applications. The glove had greater dexterity and was warmer to wear than the chain-mail glove products then in use. It manufactured these gloves for 17 years until selling the product line to Wells Lamont in 1996.|$|E
50|$|UHMWPE {{are used}} as {{composite}} plates in armour, in particular, personal armour and on occasion as vehicle armour. Civil applications containing UHMWPE fibres are <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves, bow strings, climbing equipment, fishing line, spear lines for spearguns, high-performance sails, suspension lines on sport parachutes and paragliders, rigging in yachting, kites, and kites lines for kites sports. Spectra is also used as a high-end wakeboard line.|$|E
50|$|Any form of PPE {{that acts}} as a barrier between the skin and the agent of {{exposure}} can be considered skin protection. Because much work is done with the hands, gloves are an essential item in providing skin protection. Some examples of gloves commonly used as PPE include rubber gloves, <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves, chainsaw gloves and heat-resistant gloves. For sports and other recreational activities, many different gloves are used for protection, generally against mechanical trauma.|$|E
50|$|Most {{commonly}} used in commercial kitchens, <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves (also referred to as cutting gloves) are used on the opposite hand to the cutting hand. They are for protecting this hand should the knife slip and slice into the user's off hand. They are typically made of kevlar or metal mesh. Other uses for cutting gloves in kitchens include using or cleaning meat/cheese slicers, hand mixing very hot or cold food items, and cleaning or using any type of sharp bladed machine.|$|E
50|$|Kevlar {{is used as}} a {{material}} in more than 200 applications, including tennis rackets, skis, boats, airplanes, ropes, cables, tires, and bullet-proof vests. It has been used for car tires, fire fighter boots, hockey sticks, <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves and armored cars. It has also been used for protective building materials like bomb-proof materials, hurricane safe rooms, and bridge reinforcements. During the week of Kwolek's death, the one millionth bullet-resistant vest made with Kevlar was sold. Kevlar is also used to build cellular telephones; Motorola's Droid RAZR has a Kevlar unibody.|$|E
50|$|Teijin Aramid, {{formerly}} known as Teijin Twaron, is a company in The Netherlands that produces various high-strength fibers for industrial purposes, most notably their Kevlar-like para-aramid, Twaron. Twaron finds applications in numerous markets, such as automotive (tires, hoses, belts), aerospace, civil engineering, construction, leisure goods (e.g. boats), protective clothing (bullet-, fire- and <b>cut-resistant</b> clothing), optical fiber cables, friction and sealing materials and more. The company {{has been part of}} the Japanese Teijin Group since 2000, prior to this they were a division of Akzo Nobel, division Industrial Fibers.Next to Twaron, the company markets Technora, Sulfron and TeijinConex as well.|$|E
50|$|Divers {{working in}} a dangerously {{contaminated}} environment wear a full drysuit with integral boots. <b>Cut-resistant</b> dry-gloves and helmet will seal directly to the drysuit, leaving no skin exposed to the environment. The diver will generally use a free flow diving helmet which continually supplies more air than the diver needs to breathe {{so that there is}} a constant outflow through the exhaust valve, as the internal pressure must be slightly higher than ambient to maintain the flow. A free flow helmet has a significantly lower risk of leakage back through the exhaust valve compared to a standard demand helmet where the exhaust valve must maintain a watertight seal against a slightly higher external pressure during inhalation. The risk of leakage through the exhaust valve of a demand system can be reduced in three ways. A series system of valves can be used - the exhaust gases must pass through two sets of exhaust valves before reaching the contaminated environment, and therefore contaminated water would have to leak back through both sets of valves to get to the diver. Positive pressure systems maintain a slightly higher pressure inside the mask or helmet than the ambient pressure on the outside, ensuring that any leaks flow from inside to outside, and reclaim type systems duct the exhaled breathing gas back to the control panel on the surface, but do not necessarily reclaim the exhaust gas. Combinations of these methods are possible depending on the assessed risk.|$|E
40|$|We {{quantified}} protection {{given by}} a variety of gloves against bat bites by using steel indenters to simulate teeth and measuring forces needed to puncture the gloves. Level of protection given by gloves was compared to expected bite forces and tooth sharpness of bats. Cotton, plastic-coated synthetic fabric, and proprietary materials advertised as puncture- and <b>cut-resistant</b> were easy to penetrate compared to leather gloves. Split leather gives the highest level of protection, but with reduced dexterity. These are best for handling larger bats (3 ̆e 40 g) or if higher safety is preferred. Deerskin gives reasonable protection without much loss in dexterity for handling bats 3 ̆c 40 g. DOI: 10. 2193 / 2008 - 29...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Knife is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used single weapon in the UK, being 32 % of the weapons used in violent incidents. Studies reveal that the majority (63. 3 %) of the knife-inflicted wounds were slash-type and could be disfiguring or life threatening if the blood vessels are ruptured. The stab-resistant armors currently available do not protect the arms, neck, and face as they are very rigid to be worn comfortably and are expensive and heavy for everyday use by the civilian population. The main objectives of this research program are to (a) develop and characterize a novel <b>cut-resistant</b> and slashproof material that is lightweight, comfortable, and efficient and (b) integrate barrier properties in such garments that would incorporate suitable antimicrobial and other suitable chemicals to provide protection against a range of microorganisms. During this research program, various composite yarns were thoroughly investigated, at different proportions, to determine the most appropriate yarn for the slashproof material. The slashproof fabric structures were developed by using knitting technology as it offers significant advantages in terms of cost, design flexibility, and versatility. The fabrics were characterized by using Hom...|$|E
40|$|Background The complex {{environment}} of the operative setting provides multiple opportunities for health care workers to sustain scalpel injuries; scalpels are the second most frequent source of sharps injuries in this setting. Little evidence has been published detailing the effectiveness of proposed safety procedures and devices. Methods A systematic search strategy was used to identify relevant studies. Studies were included based on {{the application of a}} predetermined protocol, an independent assessment by 2 reviewers, and a consensus decision. Nineteen articles formed the evidence base for this review. Results Little high-level evidence was available. The results of studies reporting on 5 different devices/procedures were identified: the use of <b>cut-resistant</b> gloves/liners decreased the number of glove perforations in comparison with double latex gloves alone but lessened the wearer's dexterity and tactile sensation; the benefit derived from the use of the hands-free passing technique seemed equivocal; "sharpless surgery" was found to be feasible; a single-handed blade remover prevented at least as many injuries as a safety scalpel; and some shoe materials provided superior foot protection. Conclusion The lack of available evidence highlights the need for the generation of a methodologically rigorous, clinically relevant, and statistically valid body of primary research in this area to support appropriate and effective safety interventions.
