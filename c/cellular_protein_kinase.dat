50|$|NS5A {{is derived}} from a large polyprotein that is {{translated}} from the HCV genome, and undergoes post translation processing by nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) viral protease. Despite no inherent enzymatic activity being attributed to NS5A, its function is mediated through interaction with other nonstructural (NS) viral and cellular proteins. NS5A has two phosphorylated forms: p56 and p58, which differ in the electrophoretic mobility. p56 is basally phosphorylated by host <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> at the center and near the C terminus, whereas p58 {{is a form of}} hyperphorylated NS5A {{at the center of the}} serine-rich region. It has been predicted that the N-terminal 30 aa of NS5A form an amphipathic α-helix with a highly preserved feature, which is essential to modulate the association between NS5A and ER membrane. The IFN-sensitivity determining region (ISDR) at the C-terminal of NS5A has been reported to perform strong trans-activating activities, suggesting that NS5A likely functions as a transcriptional activator.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the activity and cellular distribution of protein kinase C during the dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and hypoxanthine-induced differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia cells. Most of the <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity {{was found in}} the soluble fraction of unstimulated Friend cells. Within 15 min of the addition of DMSO or hypoxanthine, protein kinase C underwent a dramatic and prolonged reversal of this distribution which was accompanied by a gradual decline in total <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C activity over the ensuing 5 days. The loss of total activity was found to be dose dependent although maximal translocation from soluble to insoluble components occurred at even lower concentrations of the inducers tested. Two clones of Friend cells, selected for their failure to differentiate in response to DMSO, showed alterations in protein kinase C activity and/or distribution following DMSO addition when compared to wild-type Friend cells. These data show that different inducers of Friend cell differentiation have similar effects on <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C, that the protein kinase C changes accompanying this process are immediate but prolonged, and that changes in protein kinase C activity and distribution are associated with Friend cell differentiation...|$|E

We have now purified this protein kinase by monitoring its ability to phosphorylate bacterially expressed, unphosphorylated P protein. Biochemical studies showed that the kinase is indistinguishable from casein kinase II, a ubiquitous cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase present {{in a wide variety}} of eukaryotic cells and tissues. Functional VSV transcription could be reconstituted with viral L protein, N-RNA template, and P protein phosphorylated by either purified <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> or purified casein kinase II.

However, more recent studies suggest that it may also play an important regulatory role in HCV RNA replication as well as modulate host intracellular signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of NS 5 A {{appears to be a}} highly regulated process and several <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> responsible for NS 5 A phosphorylation have been identified in vitro. Studies utilizing the HCV replicon cell culture system have suggested a provocative role for the differential phosphorylation of NS 5 A in the regulation of viral RNA replication through its association with the viral replication complex, including several host cell factors. Importantly, recent in vivo data linking loss of NS 5 A hyperphosphorylation to non-productive HCV replication in the chimpanzee model have provided high validation for targeting the cellular kinases involved, particularly the kinases responsible for NS 5 A phosphorylation, for antiviral therapeutic intervention. Understanding the process of NS 5 A phosphorylation and the definite identification of the culprit <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase(s)</b> will shed light on the mechanisms of HCV RNA replication and/or pathogenesis...|$|R

The ability of HIV- 1 to infect and replicate in cells blocked by staurosporine was investigated. The results show that blocked, non-cycling cells can be productively infected by HIV- 1, steadily releasing infectious progeny virus for several weeks.

40|$|Phosphorylation of the P {{proteins}} of nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses {{is critical}} for their function as transactivators of the viral RNA polymerases. Using unphosphorylated P protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV 3) expressed in Escherichia coli, we {{have shown that the}} <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> that phosphorylates P in vitro is biochemically and immunologically indistinguishable from <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C isoform zeta (PKC-zeta). Further, PKC-zeta is specifically packaged within the progeny HPIV 3 virions and remains tightly associated with the ribonucleoprotein complex. The P protein seems also to be phosphorylated intracellularly by PKC-zeta, as shown by the similar protease digestion pattern of the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylated P proteins. The growth of HPIV 3 in CV- 1 cells is completely abrogated when a PKC-zeta-specific inhibitor pseudosubstrate peptide was delivered into cells. These data indicate that PKC-zeta {{plays an important role in}} HPIV 3 gene expression by phosphorylating P protein, thus providing an opportunity to develop antiviral agents against an important human pathogen...|$|E

Thus, chronic TPA-induced ‘desensitization’ or ‘depletion’ of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C is more apparent than real, {{and is not a}} valid means for evaluating the role of C-kinase in hormone action...|$|E
40|$|Adenovirus makes {{extensive}} use of alternative RNA splicing to produce {{a complex set of}} spliced viral mRNAs. Studies aimed at characterizing the interactions between the virus and the host cell RNA splicing machinery have identified three viral proteins of special significance for the control of late viral gene expression: L 4 - 33 K, L 4 - 22 K, and E 4 -ORF 4. L 4 - 33 K is a viral alternative RNA splicing factor that controls L 1 alternative splicing via an interaction with the <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>Kinase</b> A (PKA) and DNA-dependent <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> (DNA-PK). L 4 - 22 K is a viral transcription factor that also has been implicated in the splicing of a subset of late viral mRNAs. E 4 -ORF 4 is a viral protein that binds the <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> phosphatase IIA (PP 2 A) and controls Serine/Arginine (SR) -rich protein activity by inducing SR protein dephosphorylation. The L 4 - 33 K, and most likely also the L 4 - 22 K protein, are highly phosphorylated in vivo. Here we will review the function of these viral proteins in the post-transcriptional control of adenoviral gene expression and further discuss the significance of potential <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> phosphorylating the L 4 - 33 K and/or L 4 - 22 K proteins...|$|R
30|$|Protein {{phosphorylation}} by <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> {{represents a}} fundamental mechanism underlying diverse biochemical and cellular {{processes that are}} important for the proliferation of eukaryotic cells (Hanks et al. 1988). <b>Protein</b> <b>kinases</b> are a family of enzymes that catalyze {{the transfer of the}} gamma phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to a protein substrate and, as a result, induce a change in the conformation and function of the protein substrate. A large body of evidence suggests that deregulating this process can lead to various pathological disorders in humans, including cancers (Lahiry et al. 2010). Therefore, deregulated <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> may represent attractive targets for the development of therapeutics against various human disorders. However, unlike initial expectations, targeting <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> has proven difficult largely because of the similarities in their primary sequences and conserved structural motifs around the ATP-binding site. Nevertheless, recent advances in our understanding of this family of enzymes have allowed us to overcome these obstacles and develop a sizable number of clinically applicable therapeutic agents. According to the <b>Protein</b> <b>Kinase</b> Inhibitors in Oncology Drug Pipeline Update 2015, small-molecule inhibitors were reported against nearly half of a total of 518 <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases.</b> Among them, more than 35 inhibitors are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical applications, and approximately 500 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for further development.|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} {{that all the}} structural proteins of simian virus 40 (SV 40) are phosphoproteins. Virus phosphorylated in vivo could be further phosphorylated with exogenous <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> in a cell-free system containing γ- 32 P-ATP as phosphate donor. In intact infectious virus only polypeptides 1 and 2 (mol wt 49, 000 and 40, 800, respectively) were further phosphorylated in vitro. However, when infectious SV 40 was partially disrupted, treated with nucleases, and then phosphorylated in vitro, all five structural polypeptides accepted additional phosphate groups. Similarly, all polypeptides of intact empty capsids, derived from infected cells, were further phosphorylated in vitro. Phosphorylation of empty capsids and infectious SV 40 in vitro was enhanced from 4 - to 11 -fold after prior treatment of virus with alkali. The phosphate group was linked only to serine residues of the viral polypeptides phosphorylated both in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAddition of 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate to RIE- 1 rat {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cells}} stimulated a rapid (mean 3 -fold) {{increase in the}} subsequent binding of 125 I-labelled angiotensin II which was reversed or prevented when <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C was depleted. The increased binding was due, in part, to an up-regulation {{in the number of}} AT 1 angiotensin receptors on RIE- 1 cells, without any significant change in their binding affinity. Since this rapid up-regulation was independent of receptor synthesis, it may result from an increased availability (to extracellular ligand) of preformed, but previously ‘cryptic’, AT 1 angiotensin receptors...|$|E
40|$|In {{the nervous}} system, many {{intracellular}} responses to elevated calcium are mediated by CaM kinases (CaMKs), {{a family of}} protein kinases whose activities are initially modulated by binding Ca 2 + /calmodulin and subsequently by protein phosphorylation. One member of this family, CaMKII, is well-established for its effects on modulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. However, recent studies indicate that some actions on neuronal development and function attributed to CaMKII may instead or in addition be mediated by {{other members of the}} CaMK cascade, such as CaMKK, CaMKI, and CaMKIV. This review summarizes key neuronal functions of the CaMK cascade in signal transduction, gene transcription, synaptic development and plasticity, and behavior.

The latter response {{has been shown to}} be mediated by protein kinase C-dependent and-independent pathways. We studied the role of protein kinase C in the transformation-induced activation of the GT gene. Transformation of fibroblasts by either the v-fps or the Ki-ras oncogene rapidly increased the levels of GT mRNA. Either viral oncogene remained capable of stimulating the GT gene after depletion of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C by prolonged pretreatment of fibroblasts with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate.

The phosphorylation reaction was stimulated several-fold in the presence of spermine. Spermidine was somewhat less effective, whereas putrescine, cadaverine and 1, 6 -hexanediamine were minimally active. Phospho amino acid analysis of 32 P-labelled spermine-binding protein indicated that phosphoserine was the only labelled phospho amino acid. Spermine-binding protein did not undergo autophosphorylation, or modify the stimulative effect of spermine on the phosphorylation of other substrates such as non-histone proteins. In situ the phosphorylation of spermine-binding protein in tissue from castrated rats was markedly diminished as compared with the normal. Since the phosphorylation of spermine-binding protein appears to be mediated by cyclic AMP-independent <b>protein</b> <b>kinase(s)</b> whose activity in the prostate is under androgenic control, it is suggested that androgen-dependent modulation of the <b>protein</b> <b>kinase(s)</b> exerts a regulatory control (via phosphorylation-dephosphorylation) on the spermine-binding activity and stability of this protein in vivo.

40|$|AbstractThe HIV- 1 matrix (MA) protei n {{contains}} two subcellular localization signals with opposing effects. A myristoylated N-terminus governs particle assembly at the plasma membrane, and a nucleophilic motif facilitates import of the viral preintegration complex into {{the nucleus of}} nondividing cells. Here, we show that myristoylation acts as the MA dominant targeting signal in HIV- 1 producer cells. During virus assembly, a subset of MA is phosphorylated on the C-terminal tyrosine by a virion-associated <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase.</b> Tyrosine-phosphorylated MA is then preferentially transported to the nucleus of target cells. An MA tyrosine mutant virus grows normally in dividing cells, but is blocked for nuclear import in terminally differentiated macrophages.

40|$|The conserved alphaherpesviral serine/threonine kinase US 3 causes {{dramatic}} changes in the actin cytoskeleton, consisting of actin stress fiber breakdown and protrusion formation, associated with increased viral spread. In this report, we show that US 3 expression leads to RhoA phosphorylation at serine 188 (S 188), one of the hallmarks of suppressed RhoA signaling, and that expression of a non-phosphorylatable RhoA variant interferes with the ability of US 3 to induce actin rearrangements. Furthermore, inhibition of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> A (PKA) abrogates the ability of US 3 to induce S 188 RhoA phosphorylation, pointing to a role for PKA in US 3 -induced RhoA phosphorylation. Hence, the US 3 kinase leads to PKA-dependent S 188 RhoA phosphorylation, which contributes to US 3 -mediated actin rearrangements. Our data suggest that US 3 efficiently usurps the antagonistic RhoA and Cdc 42 /Rac 1 /PAK signaling branches to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton...|$|E

These early events of MCMV infections {{are dependent on}} cellular regulatory mechanisms, primarily protein phosphorylation. In the present study, <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitors were used to explore the role of protein phosphorylation mediated by <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> C (PKCs) {{in the very early}} events of MCMV infection. Inhibitory effects were determined by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of MCMV IE 1 and E 1 protein expression and by production of infectious virions in cell culture. It was found that H- 7, a broadly specific inhibitor of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases,</b> prevented virus replication in a dose-dependent and reversible manner, and that the block in replication occurred very early in infection. More specific PKC inhibitors (sangivamycin, calphostin C and bisindolylmaleimide II), Ca 2 + /calmodulin inhibitors (EDTA and W 7) and phorbol esters (PMA) were used to dissect PKC-subclass contribution in the very early events of MCMV replication. The results indicate that the role of diacylglycerol/phorbol ester-dependent but calcium-independent PKCs is essential for establishment of MCMV infection in the host cell, starting at a very early stage of infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleolar}} factor UBF is phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) at serine residues {{within the}} C-terminal acidic domain which {{is required for}} transcription activation. To investigate the biological significance of UBF modification, we have compared the trans-activating properties of cellular UBF and recombinant UBF expressed in Escherichia coli. Using a variety of assays we demonstrate that unphosphorylated UBF is transcriptionally inactive {{and has to be}} phosphorylated at multiple sites to stimulate transcription. Examination of cDNA mutants in which the serine residues within the C-terminal domain were altered by site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that CKII-mediated phosphorylations of UBF contribute to, but are not sufficient for, transcriptional activation. Besides CKII, other <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> phosphorylate UBF at distinct sites in a growth-dependent manner. The marked differences in the tryptic peptide maps of UBF from growing and serum-starved cells suggest that alterations in the degree of UBF phosphorylation may modulate rRNA synthetic activity in response to extracellular signals...|$|R

40|$|UBF is a DNA binding protein which {{interacts with}} both the {{promoter}} and the enhancer of various vertebrate ribosomal RNA genes and functions as a transcription initiation factor for RNA polymerase I (pol I). We have purified murine UBF to apparent molecular homogeneity and demonstrate that its transactivating potential, but not its DNA binding activity, is modulated in response to cell growth. In vivo labelling experiments demonstrate that UBF is a phosphoprotein and that the phosphorylation state is different in growing and quiescent cells. We show that UBF is phosphorylated in vitro by a <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> which by several criteria closely resembles casein kinase II (CKII). A major modification involves serine phosphoesterifications in the carboxy terminal hyperacidic tail of UBF.

In Jurkat cells, overexpression of Cdk 9 -dn specifically inhibited Tat transactivation and HIV- 1 replication but had no inhibitory effect on induction of CD 69, CD 25, and interleukin- 2 following T-cell activation. In U 937 cells, overexpression of Cdk 9 -dn sensitized cells to apoptosis, especially after phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment to induce differentiation to macrophage-like cells.

We previously showed that the levels of Wee- 1 correlate with Vpr-mediated apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that Vpr-induced G 2 arrest correlated with delayed degradation of Wee- 1 at G 2 /M. Experimental depletion of Wee- 1 by a small interfering RNA directed to wee- 1 mRNA alleviated Vpr-induced G 2 arrest and allowed apparently normal progression through M into G 1. Similar results were observed when cells were arrested at G 2 following gamma irradiation. Thus, Wee- 1 is integrally involved as a key cellular regulatory protein in the signal transduction pathway for HIV- 1 Vpr-induced cell cycle arrest...|$|E

To identify the <b>cellular</b> <b>proteins</b> that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during transformation, a 32 P-labeled RSV-transformed chicken embryo cell extract was analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. After slicing the gel into approximately 60 slices, phosphoamino acid analyses were carried out on the protein recovered from each gel slice. Phosphotyrosine was found in every gel slice, with two major peaks of this phosphoamino acid around Mr's of 59 and 36 kilodaltons. When the same analysis was performed with cells infected with a transformation-defective src deletion mutant of RSV (tdNY 101), significant and reproducible peaks of phosphotyrosine were found in only 2 of 60 gel slices. These gel slices corresponded to Mr's of 42 and 40 kilodaltons. Identical results were obtained with normal uninfected chicken embryo fibroblasts. We conclude from these observations that pp 60 src or the combined action of pp 60 src and pp 60 src -activated <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> cause the tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of {{a very large number of}} cellular polypeptides in RSV-transformed cells.

From this screen we identified three structurally related 5 -aminopyrazine compounds (XMD 7 - 1, - 2 and - 27) that inhibited HCMV replication in virus yield reduction assays at low micromolar concentrations. Kinase selectivity assays indicated that each compound was a kinase inhibitor capable of inhibiting a range of <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases.</b> Western blotting and RNA sequencing demonstrated that treatment of infected cells with XMD 7 compounds resulted in a defect {{in the production of}} the major HCMV transcriptional transactivator IE 2 proteins (IE 2 - 86, IE 2 - 60 and IE 2 - 40) and an overall reduction in transcription from the viral genome.

40|$|Phosphorylation of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) core protein {{has recently been}} shown to be a prerequisite for pregenomic RNA encapsidation into viral capsids, but the host cell kinases mediating this essential step of the HBV replication cycle have not been identified. We detected two kinases of 95 and 115 kDa in HuH- 7 total cell lysates which interacted specifically with the HBV core protein and phosphorylated its arginine-rich C- terminal domain. The 95 -kDa kinase was purified and characterized as SR protein-specific kinase I (SRPK 1) by mass spectrometry. Based on this finding, the 115 -kDa kinase could be identified as the related kinase SRPK 2 by immunoblot analysis. In vitro, both SRPKs phosphorylated HBV core protein on the same serine residues which are found to be phosphorylated in vivo. Moreover, the major cellular HBV core kinase activity detected in the total cell lysate showed biochemical properties identical to those of SRPK 1 and SRPK 2, as examined by measuring binding to a panel of chromatography media. We also clearly demonstrate that neither the cyclin- dependent kinases Cdc 2 and Cdk 2 nor <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> C, previously implicated in HBV core protein phosphorylation, can account for the HBV core <b>protein</b> <b>kinase</b> activity. We conclude that both SRPK 1 and SRPK 2 are most likely the <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> mediating HBV core protein phosphorylation during viral infection and therefore represent important host cell targets for therapeutic intervention in HBV infection...|$|R

Furthermore, the activity of a specific protein kinase has not yet been correlated to steps in the hepadnaviral life cycle. In this study we show that capsids from various sources encapsidate active protein kinase Calpha, irrespective {{of hepatitis}} B virus genotype and host cell. Treatment of a virion expressing cell line with a pseudosubstrate inhibitor showed that inhibition of protein kinase C phosphorylation did not affect genome maturation but resulted in capsid accumulation and inhibited virion release to the medium.

We also show that TAK activity is elevated upon activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes and upon differentiation of U 1 and U 937 promonocytic cell lines to macrophages.

The subcellular distribution of protein kinase C in both unstimulated osteo sarcoma cell lines was similar; in an EDTA- and leupeptin-containing homogenization buffer, between 70 and 80 % of the total enzyme activity was cytosolic. Short (< 60 min) incubations with PMA induced marked decreases in cytosolic enzyme activity and parallel increases in particulate protein kinase ('; thereafter, total measured <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinase...</b>|$|E
40|$|Synaptic {{neurotransmission}} in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) requires the precise control of the duration and the magnitude of neurotransmitter action at specific molecular targets. At the molecular level, neurotransmitter signaling is dynamically regulated by a diverse set of macromolecules including biosynthetic enzymes, secretory proteins, ion channels, pre- and postsynaptic receptors and transporters. Monoamines, 5 -hydroxytryptamine or serotonin (5 -HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) play an important modulatory role in the CNS and are involved in numerous physiological functions and pathological conditions. Presynaptic plasma membrane transporters for 5 -HT (SERT), NE (NET), and DA (DAT), respectively, control synaptic actions of these monoamines by rapidly clearing the released amine. Monoamine transporters are the sites of action for widely used antidepressants and are high affinity molecular targets for drugs of abuse including cocaine, amphetamine, and 3, 4 -methylenedioxymetamphetamine (MDMA) “Ecstasy”. Monoamine transporters also serve as molecular gateways for neurotoxins. Emerging evidence indicates that regulation of transporter function and surface expression can be rapidly modulated by “intrinsic” transporter activity itself, and antidepressant and psychostimulant drugs that block monoamine transport {{have a profound effect on}} transporter regulation. Therefore, disregulations in the functioning of monoamine transporters may underlie many disorders of transmitter imbalance such as depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. This review integrates recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of monoamine transporter regulation, in particular, posttranscriptional regulation by phosphorylation and trafficking linked to <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases,</b> <b>protein</b> phosphatases, and transporter interacting proteins. The review also discusses the possible role of psychostimulants and antidepressants in influencing monoamine transport regulation...|$|R
40|$|Replication {{of human}} {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) {{is subject to}} regulation by <b>cellular</b> <b>protein</b> <b>kinases.</b> Recently, we and others reported that inhibition of cyclin-dependent <b>protein</b> <b>kinases</b> (CDKs) or the viral CDK ortholog pUL 97 can induce intranuclear speckled aggregation of the viral mRNA export factor, pUL 69. Here we provide the first evidence for a direct regulatory role of CDKs on pUL 69 functionality. Although replication of all HCMV strains was dependent on CDK activity, we found strain-specific differences {{in the amount of}} CDK inhibitor-induced pUL 69 aggregate formation. In all cases analyzed, the inhibitor-induced pUL 69 aggregates were clearly localized within viral replication centers but not subnuclear splicing, pore complex, or aggresome structures. The CDK 9 and cyclin T 1 proteins colocalized with these pUL 69 aggregates, whereas other CDKs behaved differently. Phosphorylation analyses in vivo and in vitro demonstrated pUL 69 was strongly phosphorylated in HCMV-infected fibroblasts and that CDKs represent a novel class of pUL 69 -phosphorylating kinases. Moreover, the analysis of CDK inhibitors in a pUL 69 -dependent nuclear mRNA export assay provided evidence for functional impairment of pUL 69 under suppression of CDK activity. Thus, our data underline the crucial importance of CDKs for HCMV replication, and indicate a direct impact of CDK 9 -cyclin T 1 on the nuclear localization and activity of the viral regulator pUL 69...|$|R
