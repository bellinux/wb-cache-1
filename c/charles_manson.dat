5|$|As {{a result}} of a chance {{encounter}} in late spring 1968, according to some accounts, drummer Dennis Wilson was driving through Malibu when he picked up two hitchhiking women of the Manson Family, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, and brought them to his house in Pacific Palisades for a few hours. Returning home in the morning of the following day from a night time recording session with The Beach Boys, Wilson was unexpectedly greeted in the driveway of the residence by the Family's leader, <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson.</b> At first, Wilson was frightened by Manson, but Manson assured him he came with no intent to harm Wilson and began kissing his shoes. The two struck a friendship and, over the next few months, members of the Manson Familymostly women who were treated as servantswere housed at Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, reportedly costing him approximately $100,000 (U.S.).|$|E

Only this time it won't be the same." [...] He noted {{that one of the}} crimes of which Manson had been convicted, killing a pregnant woman, did not allow Manson to rank very high in prison social structures (Bugliosi cited an informant whom he quoted as saying that [...] "it's like being a child molester...guys like that are gonna do hard time wherever they are") and that Manson's notoriety had become his own worst enemy, with any convict seeking a reputation being willing to attack, and kill, Manson. As noted below, in September 1984, at least one such convict did indeed so attack Manson, with intent to kill.|$|R
25|$|However, during Beausoleil's March 1970 trial, Brunner repudiated her {{testimony}} that Beausoleil murdered Hinman and Beausoleil produced an affidavit signed by Brunner stating {{that he did}} not stab Hinman.

25|$|The Cornerstone {{investigation}} spanned {{from interviews}} with over 100 of Warnke's personal {{friends and acquaintances}} to his ministry's tax receipts. The investigation revealed a number of inaccuracies and evidence of fraud and deceit in Warnke's accounts.

Rather than showing an emaciated drug-addict sporting long fingernails and waist-length hair, the pictures showed Warnke as a typical 'square' of the mid-1960s. The investigation also revealed Warnke's claims that he and <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> had attended a Satanic ritual to be false; Manson was in federal prison at the time, having no known ties to Satanic churches.|$|E
25|$|After <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> incited {{the murder}} of five people, {{including}} McQueen's friends Sharon Tate and Jay Sebring, at Tate's home on August 9, 1969, it was reported McQueen was a potential target of the killers. According to his first wife, McQueen began carrying a handgun at all times in public, including at Sebring's funeral. Two months after the murders, police found a hit list with McQueen's name on it, a result of McQueen's company having rejected a Manson screenplay. In 2011, {{it was revealed that}} Sebring had invited McQueen to the party at Tate's house {{on the night of the}} murders. According to McQueen, he had invited a girlfriend to come along, but she instead suggested an intimate night at home, which probably saved his life.|$|E
25|$|As the {{psychiatrist}} Jan Ehrenwald has pointed out, {{the question as}} to how a possibly mentally ill Hitler could have gained millions of enthusiastic followers who supported his policies until 1945 has often been neglected. Daniel Goldhagen argued in 1996 that Hitler's political ascent was not in any way related to his psychopathology, but rather was a consequence of the precarious social conditions that existed at that time in Germany. On the other hand, some authors have noted that figures such as <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> and Jim Jones, who have been described as suffering from crippling mental illness such as schizophrenia, nonetheless succeeded in having a tremendous influence on their groups of followers. Early on, the view was also expressed that Hitler was able to handle his psychopathology skillfully, and was aware of how he could use his symptoms to effectively steer the emotions of his audience. Still other authors have suggested that Hitler's followers themselves were mentally disturbed; evidence for this claim however was not produced. The question how Hitler's individual psychopathology might have been linked with the enthusiasm of his followers was first discussed in 2000 by the interdisciplinary team of authors Matussek/Matussek/Marbach.|$|E

500|$|In {{the context}} of the {{turbulent}} political climate of 1968, [...] "Piggies" [...] was adopted by the counterculture as an anti-establishment theme song. It was also among the tracks on The Beatles that cult leader <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> used as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Inspired especially by the line [...] "What they need's a damn good whacking", Manson's followers left clues relating to the lyrics at the scenes of the Tate–LaBianca murders in August 1969.|$|E
500|$|Lucy {{investigates the}} murders {{and becomes a}} target of the Grim Reaper.

500|$|... "Blue Jay Way" [...] {{was a rare}} Beatles song {{released}} {{before their}} 1968 self-titled double album that <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> adopted {{as part of his}} theory of an impending social revolution in the United States, a scenario that led to his followers carrying out a series of murders in Los Angeles during the summer of 1969. Finding parallels between the Beatles' lyrics and the Book of Revelation, and believing himself to be the messiah, Manson interpreted Harrison's opening verse and chorus as the Beatles calling out to Jesus Christ.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by the American rock band the Beach Boys, credited to Dennis Wilson, and released as the B-side to the group's [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] single on December 2, 1968. In 1969, [...] "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was included on the Beach Boys' 15th studio album 20/20. The song was actually an altered version of [...] "Cease to Exist", composed by aspiring folk singer-songwriter and later convicted murder-conspirator <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson.</b> Musically, Wilson deviated from Manson's blues influence, reworking it to fit the band's pop-oriented approach.|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers have {{dismissed}} the song as monotonous, {{many others have}} admired its yearning quality and dark musical mood. The website Consequence of Sound describes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] as [...] "a haunted house of a hit, adding an ethereal, creepy mythos to the City of Angels". Among its continued links with Los Angeles, the song {{was one of the}} first Beatles tracks that cult leader <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> adopted as the foundation for his Helter Skelter theory of an American race-related countercultural revolution. Artists who have covered the song include Bud Shank, Colin Newman, Tracy Bonham, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Greg Hawkes.|$|E
500|$|<b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> {{first heard}} the album not long after it was released. He had already claimed to find hidden {{meanings}} in songs from earlier Beatles albums, but in The Beatles he interpreted prophetic significance {{in several of the}} songs, including [...] "Blackbird", [...] "Piggies" [...] (particularly the line [...] "what they need's a damn good whacking"), [...] "Helter Skelter", [...] "Revolution 1" [...] and [...] "Revolution 9", and interpreted the lyrics as a sign of imminent violence or war. He played the album repeatedly to his followers, the Manson family, and convinced them that it was an apocalyptic message predicting an uprising of oppressed races, drawing parallels with chapter 9 of the Book of Revelation.|$|E
500|$|Psychedelic trends climaxed in the 1969 Woodstock festival, {{which saw}} {{performances}} {{by most of}} the major psychedelic acts, including Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead. By the end of the 1960s, psychedelic rock was in retreat. In 1966, LSD had been made illegal in the US and UK. In 1969, the murders of Sharon Tate and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by <b>Charles</b> <b>Manson</b> and his [...] "family" [...] of followers, claiming to have been inspired by Beatles' songs such as [...] "Helter Skelter", has been seen as contributing to an anti-hippie backlash. At the end of the same year, the Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by the Rolling Stones, became notorious for the fatal stabbing of black teenager Meredith Hunter by Hells Angel security guards.|$|E
