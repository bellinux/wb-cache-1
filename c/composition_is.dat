5|$|Besides {{religious}} imagery, the frescoes of the Donja Kamenica church {{also include}} eleven portraits of contemporary historical figures, separated into four compositions. Three of the compositions are uncaptioned, making {{the identification of}} the people practically impossible. The first <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> located in the cella and depicts two men preserved from the waist up, of which one holds a model of the church, and a child, of which only the head is visible today. The second composition was painted on the upper west wall of the narthex and portrays a man, a woman, a boy and a girl, with the man also holding a model of the church, a common symbol of donorship. Art historian Dragana Frfulanović believes that the images of men holding models in both compositions depict the same person, the main donor. The third <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> in the cella and depicts two men: a monk and a priest.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% {{of the visible}} asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E

5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore {{the date of the}} <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled juxtaposition of biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an anonymous author. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da gamba and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning point, when the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E

5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements {{and the fact that}} its <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.|$|E

40|$|We {{surveyed}} presolar grains in primitive enstatite chondrites by isotopography {{using the}} HokuDai isotope microscope system.

The chemical <b>compositions</b> <b>are</b> determined for eight silicate and ten carbonaceous presolar grains. Presolar grains of pyroxene <b>compositions</b> <b>are</b> dominant in the enstatite chondrites.

5|$|The shield is {{the core}} of heraldry, but other {{elements}} are placed above, below, and around the shield, and are usually collectively called external ornaments. The entire <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> called the achievement of arms or the armorial bearings. Some of these accessories are unique to Church armory or differ notably from those which normally accompany a shield.|$|E
5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, {{but this is an}} {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> somewhat spoilt by the later porch and the fact that two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there has}} been {{speculation}} about earlier works, Sorabji's earliest known (albeit lost) <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> a transcription dating from 1914 of Delius's In a Summer Garden. His early works are predominantly piano sonatas, songs and piano concertos. Of these, Piano Sonatas Nos. 1–3 (1919; 1920; 1922) are compositionally the most ambitious and significant. They are characterised mainly by {{their use of the}} single-movement format and by their athematism. The main criticism levelled at them is that they lack stylistic consistency and organic form. Sorabji himself developed a largely unfavourable view of his early works, to the extent that late in his life he even considered destroying many of their manuscripts.|$|E

5|$|Bach's {{original}} {{score is}} lost. The music survives in a copy made by C F Penzel, one of Bach's last pupils, after the composer's death. The date of <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> not known, and sources differ {{as to when}} and where Bach composed the work. However, the balance of opinion has moved towards a date {{at the beginning of}} Bach's career. It is not currently in dispute that it is one of Bach's earliest surviving cantatas.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that microbes at this level could be soaking up ultraviolet light from the Sun {{as a source of}} energy, which could be a possible explanation for dark patches seen on UV images of the planet. Large, non-spherical cloud particles have also been detected in the cloud decks. In 2012, the abundance and vertical distribution of these unknown ultraviolet absorbers in the Venusian atmosphere have been investigated from analysis of Venus Monitoring Camera images, but their <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> still unknown. In 2016, disulfur dioxide has been identified as a possible candidate for causing the so far unknown UV absorption of the Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The <b>composition</b> <b>is</b> {{built from}} the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E
