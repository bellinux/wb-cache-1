40|$|In {{this thesis}} a Finite Element Modelling (FEM) {{approach}} is proposed for modelling the visco-plastic creep effects that a PTFE-faced thrust bearing would undergo during normal operating conditions. A thermal elastic hydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) model is developed, which uses the Reynolds equations for a fluid film, coupled with Hertzian contact {{theory and the}} energy equation to predict the pressure and film thickness on the PTFE face {{as well as the}} temperature and thickness of the fluid. These variables are then used with a Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> to predict the secondary creep effects on the PTFE surface. This change in PTFE thickness due to visco-plastic effects are taken into account within the film thickness equations and the effects over a bearing’s operational life span studied. The Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> is obtained from experimental creep results conducted on filled PTFE samples at the University of Leeds. This experimental method allowed for the displacement of the samples to be recorded over a 7 day test period at a representative range of pressure and temperature conditions and a Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> to be obtained from the results. The Norton <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> was then included within the simulations to allow for the visco-plastic creep effects to be studied. Results obtained showed that whilst the secondary creep had a small effect on the pressure profile of the pad, the peak pressure was significantly affected during the duration of the pads operational life. It was concluded that this was due to the pad deformation changing, meaning a smaller peak pressure was observed, but the tilt angle did not change greatly, meaning the profile did not change. The pad and film thickness also changed as time passed, with the pad getting thinner in areas of high pressure and temperature, due to the secondary creep effects. It was also observed that the peak temperature of the pad also decreased as time passed, due to the film thickness increase in areas of high temperature. ...|$|E

40|$|Modeling {{the early}} age {{evolution}} of concrete properties {{is necessary to}} predict the early age behavior of structures. In case of restrained shrinkage or application of prestress load [1], creep {{plays an important role}} in the determination of the effective stress. The difficulty lies in the fact that the modeling of creep must be based on experimental data at early age and this data must be obtained automatically because the hardening process of the concrete takes place rapidly during the first hours and also the first days. This paper presents a new methodology to model basic creep in compression since setting. Two kinds of tests are used : classical loadings and repeated minute-scale-duration loadings.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effective transport properties of heterogeneous media {{in which there is a}} high contrast between the phase diffusivities. In this case the transient response of the slow phase induces a memory effect at the macroscopic scale, which needs to be included in a macroscopic continuum description. This paper focuses on the slow phase, which we take as a dispersion of inclusions of arbitrary shape. We revisit the linear diffusion problem in such inclusions in order to identify the structure of the effective (average) inclusion response to a chemical load applied on the inclusion boundary. We identify a chemical <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> (similar to the <b>creep</b> <b>function</b> of viscoelasticity), from which we construct estimates with a reduced number of relaxation modes. The proposed estimates admit an equivalent representation based on a finite number of internal variables. These estimates allow us to predict the average inclusion response under arbitrary time-varying boundary conditions at very low computational cost. A heuristic generalisation to concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient is also presented. The proposed estimates for the effective transient response of an inclusion can serve as a building block for the formulation of multi-inclusion homogenisation schemes. Comment: 24 pages, 9 figures.
