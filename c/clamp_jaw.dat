The maximum transmission pile {{driving force of}} pile {{clamping mechanism}} of hydraulic static pile driver was analyzed. The static forces of pile clamping mechanism and prefabricated pile were researched and analyzed. The contact between prefabricated pile and pile <b>clamping</b> <b>jaws</b> under pile driving was investigated.

40|$|AbstractCarbon fiber {{reinforced}} composites (CFRP) {{are mostly}} manufactured near net shape. Nevertheless, a final milling step {{at the edges}} of the cured components is still necessary. Damages which occur during milling or drilling of CFRP lower the durability of the components and increase the production costs. Requirements concerning the clamping system for milling or drilling CFRP are rising simultaneously with increasing complexity of the components. This stresses the need for complex clamping systems like linear <b>clamping</b> <b>jaws</b> around the whole workpiece. However such types of clamping systems induce poor accessibility to the component being worked on and hence longer machining time. As a result to the need for complex clamping systems, the production costs are increased. Therefore, several benefits can be achieved by increasing the distances between the clamping points of the clamping system to reduce machining time and production costs. This paper discusses investigations of milling tests with variable clamping conditions of the workpieces. In the experiments a linear milling operation the edge of the workpiece is examined. The clamping of the planar specimens was realized with a clamping system which enables the adjustment of different distances between the clamping points of the specimen. The process forces and the resulting damage at the workpiece surfaces were measured during the experiments. These results are compared with a linear clamping system to examine the influence of rising clamping distances. The results demonstrate that the distance of the clamping points while milling the edge of the workpiece has a significant influence on the process forces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUltrahigh {{strength}} steels like press hardened 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL {{make good}} construction materials, however when fusion welded they bring {{the disadvantage of}} softening in heat affected zones (HAZ). State of the art research of Laser welding ultrahigh strength steels shows that neither increasing the welding velocity, nor {{post weld heat treatment}} {{have an effect on the}} strength and hardness drop in the HAZ. The key to improving these material characteristics is to increase heat dissipation out of the workpiece. To do so, the cooling conditions while laser welding press hardened 22 MnB 5 and S 1100 QL were dramatically increased. Experiments were carried out at subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C by using a mixture of liquid and gaseous nitrogen. To further improve heat dissipation, the <b>clamping</b> <b>jaws</b> were entirely made of copper. Hardness measurements and tensile tests were conducted to compare joints welded at room temperature with those welded at - 98 °C. Whilst an improvement of the hardness values could be achieved for the press hardened 22 MnB 5 and the S 1100, no change in the mechanical behavior regarding tensile tests could be observed. Thus, it can be noticed that there is no possibility to improve the strength levels of martensitic steels throughout varying process parameters (like welding velocity) or utilizing an active cooling, even if subzero temperatures down to - 98 °C are applied. A further improvement at lower temperatures is unlikely because heat dissipation in the work piece itself is the limiting factor...|$|R

For this reason, {{the aim of}} this study was to evaluate the vertical biomechanical behavior of two techniques for the anatomic repair of coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments after an AC injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen human cadaveric shoulders in which repair using a coracoclavicular suspension device was initiated after injury to the acromioclavicular joint were included in the study. Three groups were formed; group I (n = 6) : control; group II (n = 6) : repair with a double tunnel in the clavicle and in the coracoid (with two CC suspension devices); group III (n = 6) : repair in a "V" configuration with two tunnels in the clavicle and one in the coracoid (with one CC suspension device). The biomechanical study was performed with a universal testing machine (Electro Puls 3000, Instron, Boulder, MA, USA), with the <b>clamping</b> <b>jaws</b> set in a vertical position. The force required for acromioclavicular reconstruction system failure was analyzed for each cadaveric piece. RESULTS: Group I reached a maximum force to failure of 635. 59 N (mean 444. 0 N). The corresponding force was 939. 37 N (mean 495. 6 N) for group II and 533. 11 N (mean 343. 9 N) for group III. A comparison of the three groups did not find any significant difference despite the loss of resistance presented by group III. CONCLUSION: Anatomic repair of coracoclavicular ligaments with a double system (double tunnel in the clavicle and in the coracoid) permits vertical translation that is more like that of the acromioclavicular joint. Acromioclavicular repair in a "V" configuration does not seem to be biomechanically sufficient. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
