40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} the acquisition rate for gender acquisition in Spanish and to show whether individual variability and language contact may affect this rate. The participants were intermediate second language Spanish (first language English) learners in the study abroad and at-home contexts over a 4 -month period. The participants received grammaticality judgment tests coded for morphological class of the modified noun as well as attributive and predicative adjectives. Data were also collected on social behavior and language contact in Spanish and English in order to explain data outcome. The findings suggest that no difference exists between the two learning contexts and that social behavior and language <b>contact</b> <b>abroad</b> have minimal influence on acquisition rate...|$|E

Three hundred and twenty-five attendees who had travelled abroad in the preceding 3 months completed anonymous self-administered questionnaires about their sexual behaviour during these recent journeys abroad. There were 112 women and 213 men (185 heterosexuals and 28 homosexuals). Twenty-two (19. 6 %) women, 56 (31 %) heterosexual men and 13 (42 %) homesexual men had a sexual contact with a new partner while abroad.

40|$|A {{two year}} {{longitudinal}} {{study examined the}} influence of social <b>contact</b> <b>abroad</b> on student sojourners' cultural adjustment and intergroup affect. Social contact was measured {{with regard to the}} three people that sojourners (exchange students) spent most time with. Both the quality of the relationship with each contact and the cultural background (host national, co-national) of each contact were measured, that is contact quality and contact source, respectively. The data were analysed through repeated measures multilevel modelling. Results indicate that good quality contact (independent of source) is associated with higher cultural adjustment in sojourners and lower levels of stress. Contact quality however, was not associated with intergroup affect. Source of contact was found to matter, especially over time. Specifically, in the later stages of the sojourn, having more co-national contacts among ones three most frequent contacts, was associated with higher levels of stress, reduced cultural adjustment and higher secondary outgroup derogation. These findings suggest that who sojourners have contact with, matters for both cultural adjustment and intergroup affect. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

Even though the programmatic articles published by him in 1899 and 1900 do not clarify his exact relationship with Symbolism, his 1902 volume Fecioara în alb ("The Virgin in White") was described by researchers as the first product of mature Symbolism in Romania, while his Solii păcii ("The Messengers of Peace") is rated as the first Symbolist work in Romanian drama.|$|R

In December 1976 Bergmann took part in the founding of the Charter 77 movement. Together with Rudolf Battěk he founded the Independent Socialistic Movement in Czechoslovakia. The main reason for the establishment of this movement was to link the movement for human rights in Czechoslovakia with political structures of the democratic West.|$|R

50|$|AE began life in December 1931 as {{a journal}} {{organised}} by doctrinaire monarchists. It was edited by Ramiro de Maeztu. Drawing in {{followers of the}} former Prime Minister Antonio Maura and the ultra-conservative wings of Social Catholicism and Carlism, the group that developed around this journal promised to revive a strong Catholic monarchy. AE soon adopted an antisemitic discourse in imitation of similar movements in Europe. It soon built up <b>contacts</b> <b>abroad,</b> notably with Action Française, the Integralismo Lusitano and National Syndicalist movements in Portugal, and individual members of the National Fascist Party of Italy. The group's close links with Portuguese groups were driven by a strong belief in Hispanidad {{and a desire to}} see a return to the values of La Raza, which they felt had been abandoned in Spain.

40|$|The article {{underlines the}} {{importance}} of training of managers {{and the role of}} students from different cultural environments. As a result of economic growth on an international level, the role of training managers on such a level has become increasingly important. This training method also offers an excellent opportunity for networking, which is very important in business today, especially for smaller countries. Main source of competitiveness today consists of a combination of know-how, technology and motivational environment with the ability to react fast to any changes on the market (access and flow of information). Thus it can be concluded that post-graduate studies abroad must have a much higher importance for countries in transition in comparison to studies offered in recently established organizations in the country of origin. Latter, nevertheless are trying to cooperate with similar institutions abroad, but this can never be compared to the possibility of gaining experience and making <b>contacts</b> <b>abroad...</b>|$|R

Upon his return in April, he passed through Yugoslavia, being welcomed by the Union of Yugoslav Writers. Owing to his new <b>contacts</b> <b>abroad,</b> Baconsky began publishing his work in international reviews, among them France's Cahiers de L'Herne; Austria's Literatur und Kritik and Die Presse; and West Germany's Die Welt, Akzente and Das Ensemble.

His own lyrics were published in a Hungarian translation, authored by poet Sándor Kányádi.

[...] Ursu did in fact author informative notes on the people he <b>contacted</b> <b>abroad,</b> which were subsequently made available to the press, but the CNSAS indicated the Securitate had required such information from any person allowed to travel outside Communist Romania.
