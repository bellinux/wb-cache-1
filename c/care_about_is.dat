These particles are sometimes described as being fundamental, since they have an unknown substructure, and it is unknown {{whether or not they are}} composed of smaller and even more fundamental particles. Of central importance is the [...] Standard Model, a theory that is concerned with electromagnetic interactions and the weak and strong nuclear interactions. The Standard Model is supported by the experimental confirmation of the existence of particles that compose matter: quarks and leptons, and their corresponding [...] "antimatter" [...] duals, as well as the force particles that mediate interactions: the photon, the W and Z bosons, and the gluon. The Standard Model predicted the existence of the recently discovered [...] Higgs boson, a particle that is a manifestation of a field within the Universe that can endow particles with mass. Well, actually, they don’t. What they really <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>is</b> the Higgs field, because it is so important.|$|E

The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.|$|E
