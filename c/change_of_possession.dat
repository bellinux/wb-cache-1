5|$|In {{his senior}} season for the 2002 Wolverines, one of June's notable {{performances}} was his individual effort to stop a bootleg play against Notre Dame on September 14, which forced a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> to give Michigan the ball with just over two minutes remaining. On September 28 against Illinois, he had a sack and made a notable lead block on the interception return of a fellow defensive back. In the October 12 victory over Penn State, he made a key defensive play that almost resulted in an interception {{as part of an}} overtime goal line stand to hold Penn State to a field goal. In the 2321 victory over Purdue on October 19, he recovered the final onside kick by Purdue. A collision on October 26 in a game with Iowa halted play for ten minutes while June received medical attention after leaving the game on a stretcher. At the time, he had movement in his extremities. He was hospitalized after the incident, but was released from the hospital the following morning. June was sidelined for the Michigan – Michigan State Paul Bunyan Trophy game against Michigan State on November 2, but participated in two plays during the subsequent Michigan–Minnesota Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota on November 9. June was healthy in time for the 2003 Outback Bowl against Florida, where he recorded a season-high nine tackles. Over the course of the season, June had 36 tackles, 17 assists, four tackles for loss, and two sacks. He had 102 career tackles and 36 career assists, 10 tackles for loss, and six sacks.|$|E

After the kick is made, <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> occurs and subsequent penalties are assessed against either the spot where the ball is caught, or the runback.|$|E
25|$|The Bulldogs scored {{first when}} Jarrett Berry blocked a Bo Freelend punt that was {{returned}} seven-yards by Thomas Davis for a touchdown. The Georgia defense then held the Crimson Tide and forced a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> on downs {{to give the}} Bulldogs the ball at the Alabama 44-yard line. Five plays later, D. J. Shockley threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jamario Smith for a 23–3 lead. After Ramzee Robinson fumbled the kickoff that ensued, Georgia took possession and four plays later led 30–3 when Kregg Lumpkin scored on a one-yard run. On their next possession, Alabama managed to score their first touchdown on an 18-yard Spencer Pennington pas to Dre Fulgham that made the score 30–10. The Crimson Tide defense did get a stop on their next possession to force a Georgia punt; however, on the first offensive play for Alabama, Pennington fumbled to give the Bulldogs possession at their 29-yard line. With only 0:30 left in the quarter, Georgia made the halftime score 37–10 when David Greene threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin Watson.|$|E

2500|$|After {{suffering}} many {{a heartbreaking}} defeat to the Bulldogs with a conference championship at stake, coach Galen Hall's 1984 Florida Gators entered the contest undefeated in the SEC. [...] The Gators dominated early, building a 17–0 lead by {{early in the}} second half. [...] But the Bulldogs seemed to come alive in the third quarter, mounting a long drive; however, Georgia's drive died {{in the shadow of the}} Gators' goal line when they were stuffed on fourth down, checking the Bulldogs momentarily but pinning the Gators deep in their own territory. [...] On the third play following the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> Gators quarterback Kerwin Bell dropped back into his own end zone and lofted a long pass to streaking receiver Ricky Nattiel, who went 96 yards for a touchdown.

2500|$|Regarding the NFL's {{position}} of a simultaneous catch with both players on the ground, Mike Florio wrote for Pro Football Talk, [...] "In reality, the outcome was determined before the players hit the ground. [...] That’s when Jennings first gained 'control' of the ball, regardless of whether Tate eventually secured simultaneous 'possession' of it...The relevant portion of the official 2012 rules comes from Rule 8, Section 1, Article 3, Item 5: [...] 'It is not a simultaneous catch if a player gains control first and an opponent subsequently gains joint control.' [...] (Emphasis added.) [...] Thus, it doesn’t matter whether the officials determined that Tate and Jennings jointly had 'possession' when they landed; {{the question is whether}} Jennings 'gained control' first." [...] The New York Times columnist Greg Bishop disputed the touchdown, writing, [...] "Another defender, M. D. Jennings, leapt from behind Tate. The ball appeared to land in Jennings’s hands. Tate’s hands were there, too, as Jennings fell to the ground and pulled the ball to his chest. Tate eventually wrestled the ball away." [...] Bishop further noted that, in waving his arms, back judge Rhone-Dunn appeared to be signaling a touchback for a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> via interception, which would have ended the game with a Packers victory.|$|E
2500|$|The Bulldogs {{started the}} game on offense after Florida {{deferred}} to the second half. [...] Neither team was able to score on their opening possessions as both defenses force the teams to punt. [...] Georgia {{was able to get}} into the red zone and attempted a field goal from the 20-yard line, which was missed by kicker Blair Walsh. [...] On the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> the Gators capitalized with a 5-minute 80-yard drive finished off with a Percy Harvin rushing touchdown. [...] With this touchdown, Percy scored a TD in every game thus far in the season. [...] Florida's defense shut out Georgia in the first quarter, but Georgia was able to put points on the board with a 35-yard field goal cutting Florida's lead to 4. [...] Georgia attempted an onside kick following the score, but was unable to recover the ball setting up the Gators at the Georgia 41-yard line. [...] It took only 7 plays for Tim Tebow to cap the drive with a 1-yard rushing touchdown, bringing the score to 14-3. [...] Florida's defense kept Georgia QB Matthew Stafford and Georgia RB Knowshon Moreno out of the end zone after Georgia got to the Florida 10-yard line. [...] After having to settle for another field goal attempt, Georgia kicker Blair Walsh missed his second of the game. [...] Neither the Gators nor the Bulldogs were able to score anymore in the half, bringing the score to 14-3 at the half.|$|E
2500|$|The Gators {{opened the}} game on offense and set the pace early. [...] The first drive of {{the game on}}ly took 1:38 for an early score with a Percy Harvin {{touchdown}} off a tipped pass on the third play of the game. [...] Florida's defense stopped LSU on their first possession with a quick three and out and turned the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> into a Gator field goal extending their lead 10-0. [...] Their momentum continued finishing the first quarter 17-0 after a second touchdown by Percy Harvin, which was a career first for receiving TDs in a game. [...] The Gators defense continued to pressure LSU and forced LSU QB Jarrett Lee to have a pass picked off by Florida linebacker Brandon Spikes. [...] Although Florida wasn't able {{to capitalize on the}} turnover, LSU turned the ball over on their next possession with a Charles Scott fumble recovered by Gator AJ Jones. [...] Florida was unable to create points with their second gained turnover. [...] After having scored 17 points in the first quarter, the Gators were only able to put 3 points on the board in the second quarter extending their lead 20-0. [...] With less than a minute {{in the first half and}} down 20-0, LSU put together a 60-yard drive in less than one minute scoring a touchdown with 5 seconds remaining in the half, bringing the halftime score to 20-7.|$|E
50|$|The 14 point underdog Falcons were outrushed and outpassed, but the Falcons {{jumped out}} to a 14-0 lead after two touchdowns {{on the first two}} possessions.

Derek Mahoney {{attempted}} a 26-yard field goal in the third quarter, but the kick fell short. The Falcons took advantage of the miss, driving 80 yards while scoring early in the fourth quarter. The Falcons scored {{what turned out to be}} the winning points on a Smith touchdown run, though the Bulldogs clawed back on a Barsotti touchdown pass. There were three <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> for the rest of the game, with the last proving to be the most crucial.|$|R
25|$|Hereafter, the war progressed further {{towards the}} many smaller {{states of the}} Western Regions. The nature of the battles varied through time with many {{casualties}} during the <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> or loss <b>of</b> actual control over the western states near the frontier regions. Regional alliances also tended to shift or get broken forcibly depending on the situation as one party gained {{the upper hand in}} a certain territory over the other. The Han empire's political influence expanded deeply into Central Asia. As the situation deteriorated for the Xiongnu, civil war befell and weakened the confederation. Eventually, the Southern Xiongnu submitted to the Han empire while the Northern Xiongnu continued to resist. Marked by significant events involving the conquests over various smaller states for control and many large-scale battles, the war resulted in the total victory of the Han empire over the Xiongnu state in 89 AD.|$|R

2500|$|With {{afternoon}} showers {{rolling through}} Gainesville, field conditions weren't ideal for either team early on. [...] The Gamecocks first drive ended after just four plays {{resulting in a}} punt. [...] As Florida drove down the field on the following possession, true freshman Jeff Demps fumbled the ball near the South Carolina 40-yard line. [...] Carolina's and Florida's offensives woes continued in each of their next drives with a South Carolina QB Chris Smelley pass being intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Brandon Spikes. [...] Similar to the prior week, South Carolina head coach and Florida alum Steve Spurrier rotated quarterbacks after nearly every offensive snap. [...] On the following South Carolina offensive possession, Gator DB Ahmad Black intercepted another Chris Smelley pass after it was deflected by Gator linebacker Brandon Hicks. [...] This was Black's sixth, and team-leading, interception of the season. [...] It only took one offensive play for the Gators {{to capitalize on the}} Carolina turnover. [...] Percy Harvin ran the ball for 26 yards resulting in a touchdown extending the Gators' lead 14-0 late in the first quarter. [...] South Carolina continued to make mistakes. [...] On the following kickoff, the South Carolina returner threw a lateral pass to his teammate who fumbled the catch. [...] Florida senior long snapper James Smith collected the ball and ran it just one foot shy of the goal line. [...] Tim Tebow ran the ball in for a touchdown on the resulting <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession.</b> [...] Florida's 21 points were off of 3 South Carolina turnovers and only took 2:15 to score.|$|E
2500|$|The Gators {{opened the}} second half on offense, but {{struggled}} to move the ball and were forced to punt back to Oklahoma after a 3 and out. [...] The Sooners didn't fare much better on their opening possession of the half. [...] After just nine plays, Oklahoma punted the ball back to Florida where the Gators would start a drive taking over 5 minutes. [...] Starting at the Florida 25-yard line, the Gators moved the ball effectively, needing only three plays to get to midfield. [...] On a 2nd and 4 at the Oklahoma 13, true freshman RB Jeffery Demps ran {{the ball to the}} 2-yard line before Oklahoma was called for a facemask while tackling Demps. [...] This put the ball at the 1-yard line and the Gators had a fresh set of downs on which to score. [...] After failing to run the ball in from one yard, Tim Tebow attempted a pass to TE Aaron Hernandez, which was nearly caught. [...] The next play called was a direct snap to WR Percy Harvin, who made his first appearance since getting injured against Florida State two games earlier. [...] Harvin was able to rush from two yards out and score a TD, putting the Gators up 14–7. [...] Oklahoma's following drive did not move as much down the field as their previous drives. [...] On the first play of the drive, Dustin Doe and Carlos Dunlap sacked Sam Bradford, dropping him for a four-yard loss. [...] After getting to the Florida 32-yard line, the Sooners attempted a field goal, which was blocked by the Gators. [...] After the <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession,</b> the Gators went 3 and out to close the third quarter. [...] The Gators entered the fourth quarter with a lead of 14-7.

30|$|Processes {{of dying}} and killing {{belong to the}} type ‘material’ since they realize a {{phenomenon}} of the outer physical world. These processes are further subclassified into ‘creative’, if {{the result of the}} process is the coming into existence of the Medium, and ‘transformative’, if the outcome is a change in an already existing Medium (Halliday and Matthiessen 1999, 2004, 2014). Since death and killing affect already existing participants, the congruent realizations will be classified as transformative processes. Moving to the right in delicacy, transformative processes are subdivided {{depending on the type of}} transformation that the participant undergoes into ‘elaborating’ (for physical changes), ‘extending’ (for <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> or accompaniment), and ‘enhancing’ (for changes in motion and location). The congruent realizations of the processes in question can therefore be classified under ‘material: transformative: elaborating’. Following Halliday and Matthiessen (2014), who present numerous examples of the more delicate subclassifications of process type, and Hasan (1996), who illustrates how the system closes at the lexis end by expanding to the right the network of material processes of disposal, this classification can be further extended in delicacy.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> {{may also}} occur in other ways. A <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> can occur [...] "on downs", if the {{offensive}} team fails {{to achieve a}} first down or a touchdown in a specified number of consecutive attempts, known as [...] "downs" [...] (four in American football; three in Canadian football). Another way is through a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> play, when the offensive team (having perhaps surmised the unlikelihood of scoring or of achieving a first down within the allowed consecutive attempts to do so) kicks the ball away in {{what is known as}} a punt. A touchdown (and subsequent conversion attempt, whether successful or not) or successful field goal attempt will be followed by a kickoff. Kickoffs and field goal attempts are not considered true <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>possession</b> plays.
