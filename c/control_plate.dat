2500|$|Designed by Fender, Walker and Sterling Ball (Sterling was a {{beta tester}} for the instrument), the StingRay bass {{appeared}} in 1976 and, though physically {{similar to a}} Fender Precision Bass, was a highly innovative instrument. It employed an [...] "MM" [...] humbucking pickup and an active pre-amp powered by a 9-volt battery. The early versions had 2-band EQ (i.e., bass and treble controls), and the range was later augmented {{by the addition of}} a 3 band EQ (bass, mid and treble) model, and then piezo pickups located in the bridge became an option with the 3-band model. The StingRay's 3-band equalization system made it possible to boost midrange frequencies as well as low and high. [...] Along with its electronic improvements, the StingRay had physical attributes that set it apart from other Fender-inspired designs, such as a heavy satin finish {{on the back of the}} neck to allow players' hands to slide effortlessly up and down during play, a symmetrical egg-shaped pickguard ("the toilet seat lid") and separate chromed [...] "boomerang" [...] <b>control</b> <b>plate,</b> and its distinctive [...] "3+1" [...] headstock (on which three tuning machines are situated on the top and one on the bottom) made it an instantly recognizable and distinguishable instrument.|$|E

5000|$|This {{instrument}} is a tremolo guitar, ice blue (now aged to green) {{with a matching}} headstock. It has only five switches - four pickup controls (one per pickup - on/off/phased) plus a [...] "lead/rhythm" [...] Jaguar style upper-bout switch. It has two sets of volume/tone pots - rollers on top <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> (rhythm position) and traditional pots on the lower <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> (lead position).|$|E
50|$|JB: Similar to Fender's {{original}} Jazz Bass design, featuring traditional pickguard, alnico J pickups, metal <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> {{and black}} bakelite knobs.|$|E
50|$|Fender also {{produced}} models without a pickguard and <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> featuring flamed or quilted maple tops (FMT/QMT), gold hardware and bound necks with white pearloid rectangular block-shaped position markers from 2003 to 2007.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an electromagnetic actuator consisting of rectangular permanent magnetic chips and a cylindrical coil, which is applicable to bending moment <b>control</b> of <b>plates.</b> The analytical expression for obtaining the control force against the control current is obtained {{based on the}} electromagnetic theory. A control method is presented for producing the required deflection of the plate {{by means of the}} bending-type electromagnetic actuator. Numerical calculations are carried out for some typical problems which will be of practical importance. It is clarified that the actuator and the method of control presented are valid for <b>controlling</b> <b>plate</b> shapes...|$|R
30|$|The {{wear test}} {{involved}} two multidirectional pin-on-plate machines each with four test stations, four control pins and four <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> which were soaked with saline, and four TXA-soaked pins and four-TXA soaked plates. Another two pins and two plates {{were used as}} controls to measure the weight changes caused by lubricant absorption. This was deducted from the test specimens at every gravimetric assessment.|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to its implication in the virulence of Streptococcus pyogenes, the hyaluronic acid capsule produced by this bacterium renders it resistant to infection by bacteriophage. A method employing S. pyogenes and a bacteriophage incorporated into an agar plate was devised as a screen to detect compounds that inhibit {{the formation of the}} hyaluronic acid capsule. Filter-paper discs saturated with experimental compounds were applied to the surface of test plates containing host plus phage and <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> of host only. After incubation, inhibition of capsule synthesis was indicated by the presence of clear zones where phage infection and lysis had occurred. Zones of growth inhibition on <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> represented classical antibacterial activity. During the testing of over 6, 000 fermentation samples, anticapsin, a unique metabolite, was discovered. Modification of incubation temperature, thickness of agar layers, and host-phage input ratios resulted in a quantitative assay method having a dose-response range of 4 to 160 μg of anticapsin...|$|R
50|$|The '51 {{combines}} {{aspects of}} several of Fender's best-known instruments. The body and neck pickup resemble that of the Fender Stratocaster, while the single-ply pickguard and the <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> is borrowed from the original incarnation of the Fender Precision Bass. The neck and headstock design are reminiscent of a Fender Telecaster.|$|E

5000|$|The AA568 version (introduced May, 1968) was {{met with}} popular dislike by Fender's customers. It is {{referred}} to at times as the [...] "silverface" [...] circuit, referring to the brushed aluminum <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> used from 1968 to 1974. The circuit change and the cosmetic change didn't happen at the same time; some 1967 and early 1968 Bandmasters still possessed the AB763 circuitry.|$|E
40|$|Twelve yeast strains {{isolated}} {{from the surface of}} Italian typical dry-cured hams, belonging to D. hansenii, D. maramus, C. famata, C. zeylanoides and H. burtonii species, and previously selected for their ability to grow in dry-cured ham-like substrates, were screened for antagonistic activity against a toxigenic strain of P. nordicum and inhibition of ochratoxin A (OTA) biosynthesis. On average, yeast inhibitory activity was lowered by increasing fungal inoculum and enhanced by NaCl presence. In the assay conditions, H. burtonii and C. zeylanoides were the most effective, both in inhibiting P. nordicum growth and OTA production. D. hansenii was the species with the lowest inhibitory activity, especially in the absence of salt. OTA production dropped from the range < LOD − 5000 ppb in P. nordicum <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> to the range < LOD − 200 ppb in yeast-added plates. OTA production increased in the presence of NaCl in P. nordicum <b>control</b> <b>plates,</b> while salt enhanced inhibition against OTA production in yeast-added plates...|$|R

(open jet 215 -millimeter diameter) and at supersonic velocities (open jet 110 by 130 millimeters) {{in order to determine the}} effect of various wing forms on the air forces and moments. Three-component measurements were taken, and one model was also investigated with deflected <b>control</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
30|$|Data was {{evaluated}} without being {{regulated by the}} Abbott formula {{because there was no}} mortality in <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> (Abbott, 1925). Statistical analyses were carried out by SAS software (Version 9.1. 3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC (1990)). The experiment was established in a completely randomized design with a factorial treatment arrangement consisting of four nematode species and four application rates. Mean values were separated using Tukey Multiple Range Test (P[*]<[*] 0.05).|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the Tele Bass was {{modified}} in some aspects. A new neck plate with Micro Tilt {{system for a}} more precise neck adjustment. The old-style pickguard was redesigned to eliminate the <b>control</b> <b>plate,</b> and the single-coil pickup was replaced with a larger, more powerful, humbucking unit. The Telecaster Bass was produced alongside the contemporary Precision Bass through all the 1970s. The decal logo had changed from silver to gold, with black outlining.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactor core}} {{assembly}} {{is contained in}} an 8-ft (2.44-m)-diameter pressure vessel located {{in a pool of}} water. The top of the pressure vessel is 17 ft (5.18 m) below the pool surface. The <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> drive mechanisms are located in a sub-pile room beneath the pressure vessel. These features provide the necessary shielding for working above the reactor core and greatly facilitate access to the pressure vessel, core, and reflector regions.|$|E
50|$|The Fender Tele Jr. is {{a variant}} of the Fender Telecaster {{electric}} guitar that the Fender Custom Shop produced in a limited run of 100 units in the early 1990s. It uses a Telecaster body shape, scale length, and electronics controls (albeit, with a reversed <b>control</b> <b>plate).</b> However, many of its construction and electronic features—for example its set-in neck and P-90-style pickups—are similar to those of a Gibson Les Paul Junior and Gibson Les Paul Special electric guitars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Quartz <b>Control</b> <b>Plates</b> used as {{standards}} for the quality control of polarimetric and saccharimetric measurements have to be calibrated with low uncertainty. A set-up for this is operated at PTB, and INMETRO is building a similar one. In both set-ups, the null detection of the polarimetric signal is of high importance. A novel procedure for this is proposed and tested which avoids {{the use of an}} electronic feedback loop...|$|R
40|$|A new passive {{aerodynamic}} {{control method}} is proposed. The system uses TMD-like mechanism {{to activate the}} <b>control</b> <b>plates,</b> which generate flutter-stabilizing airflow near the bridge section. Effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by experimental and analytical study. In addition, various parameters of the proposed system and applicability to a long span bridge were investigated. According to the research results, the proposed model is very effective in suppressing flutter. The model also shows remarkable robustness...|$|R
50|$|The fuel {{region is}} {{surrounded}} by a concentric ring of beryllium reflector approximately 1 ft (0.30 m) thick. This in turn is subdivided into three regions: the removable reflector, the semi permanent reflector, and the permanent reflector. The beryllium {{is surrounded by}} a water reflector of effectively infinite thickness. In the axial direction, the reactor is reflected by water.The <b>control</b> <b>plates,</b> in the form of two thin, nuclear poison-bearing concentric cylinders, are located in an annular region between the outer fuel element and the beryllium reflector. These plates are driven in opposite directions to open and close a window at the core mid-plane. Reactivity is increased by downward motion of the inner cylinder and the upward motion of the four outer quadrant plates. The inner cylinder is used for shimming and power regulation and has no fast safety function. The outer control cylinder consists of four separate quadrant plates, each having an independent drive and safety release mechanism. All <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> have three axial regions of different neutron poison content designed to minimize the axial peak-to-average power-density ratio throughout the core lifetime. Any single quadrant plate or cylinder is capable of shutting the reactor down.|$|R
50|$|Also in 2013, Squier {{released}} a Bass VI {{as part of}} the Vintage Modified series. This model was similar to the traditional Bass VI design with four switches (on/off for each pickup and a strangle switch) and a Jaguar-style <b>control</b> <b>plate.</b> It continued the trend set by the Squier Vintage Modified Jaguars and Jazzmasters of having a non-locking tremolo plate. It is available in a three-color sunburst finish, Olympic White with a brown tortoiseshell pick guard and black with a white pickguard.|$|E

50|$|Colin Gibb, from ‘Black Lace’ who {{had been}} a great lover of ‘custom’ guitars, and a great admirer of John Birch guitars (having {{borrowed}} one for the ‘Superman’ video) commissioned the company to build an 8-string bass, in 2001. The instrument was based on what Fender ‘may’ have produced, if they ever made an 8-string, in the 60s, Having a ‘hockey stick’ headstock (similar to the Fender electric 12-string), and chrome <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> (as on the bass V1) but being mainly designed around the Fender Precision Bass.|$|E
40|$|Calcium sulfate bone void fillers are {{increasingly}} being used for dead space management in infected arthroplasty revision surgery. The presence of these materials as loose beads close to the bearing surfaces of joint replacements gives the potential for them to enter the joint becoming trapped between the articulating surfaces; the resulting damage to cobalt chrome counterfaces and the subsequent wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene is unknown. In this study, third-body damage to cobalt chrome counterfaces was simulated using particles of the calcium sulfate bone void fillers Stimulan® (Biocomposites Ltd., Keele, UK) and Osteoset® (Wright Medical Technology, TN, USA) using a bespoke rig. Scratches on the cobalt chrome plates were quantified {{in terms of their}} density and mean lip height, and the damage caused by the bone void fillers was compared to that caused by particles of SmartSet GMV PMMA bone cement (DePuy Synthes, IN, USA). The surface damage from Stimulan® was below the resolution of the analysis technique used; SmartSet GMV caused 0. 19 [*]scratches/mm with a mean lip height of 0. 03 [*]µm; Osteoset® led to a significantly higher number (1. 62 [*]scratches/mm) of scratches with a higher mean lip height (0. 04 [*]µm). Wear tests of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene were carried out in a six-station multi-axial pin on plate reciprocating rig against the damaged plates and compared to negative (highly polished) and positive <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> damaged with a diamond stylus (2 [*]µm lip height). The wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene was shown to be similar against the negative <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> and those damaged with third-body particles; there was a significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) rate of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene wear against the positive <b>control</b> <b>plates.</b> This study showed that bone void fillers of similar composition can cause varying damage to cobalt chrome counterfaces. However, the lip heights of the scratches were not of sufficient magnitude to increase the wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene above that of the negative controls...|$|R
30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} was performed by SPSS (Version 11.0) statistical software package. Data was evaluated without being regulated by the Abbott formula {{since there was no}} mortality in <b>control</b> <b>plates</b> (Abbott, 1925). The significance of the main effects was determined by factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). Mean values were separated using Tukey’s multiple range test (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Estimation of the lethal concentration required to kill 50 % (LC 50) and 90 % (LC 90) of the pest population for each nematode isolates was calculated using Probit Analysis.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} free-solution, {{label-free}} method for quantitative characterization of macromolecular interactions using dynamic light scattering, a temperature <b>controlled</b> <b>plate</b> reader, and a multiwell concentration gradient. This nondestructive technique enabled determination of stoichiometry of binding, equilibrium dissociation constant, and thermodynamic parameters, {{as well as}} the impact of temperature, buffer salinity, and a small-molecule inhibitor. The low volume capability of dynamic light scattering reduced the required sample to 426 pmol/experiment, with detection limits for 150 -kDa proteins anticipated to be in the low femtomole range...|$|R

50|$|A {{fuel cycle}} for the HFIR {{normally}} consists of full-power operation at 85 MW {{for a period}} of 21 to 23 days (depending on the experiment and radioisotope load in the reactor), followed by an end-of-cycle outage for refueling. End-of-cycle refueling outages vary as required to allow for <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> replacement, calibrations, maintenance, and inspections. Experiment insertion and removal may be accomplished during any end-of-cycle outage. Interruption of a fuel cycle for experiment installation or removal is strongly discouraged to avoid impact on other experiments and neutron scattering.|$|E
50|$|The LeMans was {{specially}} {{designed to be}} extremely thin much like a Gibson SG. The guitar is fitted with a single bridge pickup to allow for an extra strong neck joint which allows extra transference between neck and body. Another feature to make the guitar simple and easy to maintain is the <b>control</b> <b>plate</b> with a single volume control and jack input, the short and simple circuit also reduces capacitance for a clear tone. One of the first LeMans models were built for American hard rock band Burning Brides guitarist and vocalist Dimitri Coats.|$|E

Through shifting and tilting, the non-rotating <b>plate</b> <b>controls</b> the rotating <b>plate,</b> which in turn controls the individual blade pitch.|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] {{aim of this study}} was the improvement of embryo production in wheat anther culture. Three butanol alcohols, n-butanol, sec-butanol and tert-butanol, were evaluated for their effect on microspore embryogenesis in two spring cultivars of wheat, Pavon and Caramba. Application of n-butanol, at 0. 1 and 0. 2 % (v/v) in the induction media for five hours, highly improved embryo production in both cultivars. Sec- and tert-butanol performed similarly to <b>control</b> <b>plates.</b> Regeneration ability was unaffected by any butyl-alcohol treatment. As a consequence of the higher embryo production after n-butanol treatment, the number of green regenerated plants increased up to 5 times in cultivar Pavon and up to 3 times in cultivar Caramba. The percentage of green plants was improved or unaffected by the treatment. Doubled haploid plant production was between 2 and 4 times higher after n-butanol treatment than in <b>control</b> <b>plates.</b> Therefore, n-butanol was successfully applied in the production of wheat doubled haploids. This primary alcohol is known as an activator of phospholipase D and has been previously reported to disrupt cortical microtubules and detach them from the plasma membrane in plants. Its effects on androgenetic induction could confirm the importance of microtubule regulation in plant cell fate, specifically in microspore development. A possible implication of phospholipase D is discussed. [URL] reviewe...|$|R
