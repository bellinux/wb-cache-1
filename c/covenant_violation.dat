40|$|I {{study the}} impact of loan <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> on {{corporate}} liquidity management. Specif-ically, I find that firms exhibit a strong tendency to save cash out of their cash flows after <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> (as represented by a positive and greater cash flow sensitivity of cash), sug-gesting that firms turn to internally-generated cash for liquidity after breaching external credit contracts. Moreover, {{the increase in the}} cash saving rate after <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> is more pronounced among firms that are likely to be financially constrained, firms that have greater hedging needs, and firms that depend more on external finance. These findings are consistent with the argument that <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> lead to a tightening of external credit, which then causes firms to rely more on self-produced cash for liquidity. Additional tests suggest that this effect is not driven by other alternative explanations or selection bias. Collectively, the empirical evidence supports a predicted relationship between a firm's external financing condition and its internal liquidity management policy...|$|R

We find that cash collateral {{is most likely to}} be used when the contract is governed by law that is favorable to debtors and that out-of-state borrowers who use favorable law pay higher yield spreads. In addition, when the law is favorable to lenders, there are significantly fewer <b>covenant</b> <b>violations,</b> and the repercussions of covenant violations—measured as changes in the borrower’s investment policy—are more severe. We also compare the characteristics of relevant parties across states, and the results provide support for the theory that there is a market for contracts similar to the market for incorporations...|$|R

We document cross-sectional variations in the observed fee differential with respect to the level of reliance on financial covenants, the type of covenants violated, and waiver decisions. Moreover, we find that the observed audit fee increases are associated with more favorable movements in borrowing costs and the adoption of more conservative investment policies post violation.

40|$|Are borrowers {{rewarded for}} repaying their loans? This paper investigates the {{consequences}} of <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> on subsequent loans to the same borrower using a hand-collected sample of US syndicated loans during the 1996 to 2010 period. We find that <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> have substantial negative effects for borrowers in subsequent loans. Our {{results show that the}} loan spread increases by 22 basis points in the loan following the violation. We also find that the new contract includes more financial covenants which are also more restrictive. Switching banks after a violation does not reduce these effects and even leads to a further increase in loan spreads. We also provide empirical evidence that borrowers who have violated covenants in the previous contract are significantly more likely to violate covenants again in the next loan. Moreover, they violate earlier compared to borrowers who have not violated covenants before. Most importantly, these borrowers also exhibit a substantially higher likelihood to default, particularly in the first 100 days after a violation. Our results suggest that there is an important role for covenants in monitoring borrowers and that <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> provide an early warning signal for a severe deterioration of borrower credit quality. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{documents}} significant trading by insiders {{around a}} first-time debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> disclosure in an SEC filing and is interesting from {{a research and}} regulatory standpoint because of three considerations - delay and relative infrequency of new <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> disclosures {{lack of attention to}} disclosure issues by regulators and dearth of research. Importantly we find a lead relation between net insider selling in the 12 months before a debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> disclosure and investors' negative returns and net insider buying up to 12 months after disclosure and investors' positive returns. This relation is robust to the presence of other information. These results support our contention that insiders' trades around a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> disclosure may benefit from an information advantage unavailable to other market participants. The aggregate return to insiders - the sum of the losses avoided from selling and the gains from buying - approaches almost two billion dollars over an eight-year study period...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} documents {{a negative}} stock price {{reaction to the}} announcement of debt covenant violations. However, not all covenant violations are disclosed because firms are able to obtain <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> waivers and renegotiate debt contracts with their lenders before being required to disclose a violation in the financial statements. Exploiting the fact that over half of all private debt contracts contain a debt covenant based on some variation of accounting earnings, I construct a sample of firms with debt contracts that contain at least one earnings-based covenant. Combining earnings-based-covenant contract values with information publicly available, I construct a measure of implied debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> and find evidence that investors are able to price the likelihood of an earnings-based debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> on the earnings announcement date. Furthermore, I find {{no evidence of a}} negative stock price reaction to the disclosure of a debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> when there was a high likelihood of such a violation implied by previously-reported earnings.

40|$|We {{examine how}} {{contract}} term restrictions influence debt issuance behaviour {{and find that}} debt covenant violations impact firms’ debt maturity structure, costs, syndicate structure, collateralization and placement choice. Using the issuance of debt by non-financial firms between 1996 and 2008, we find that debt maturity decreases following a firm’s debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> while debt costs and covenant intensity increase. Debt seniority {{does not appear to}} have a strong relationship with covenant violations – firm size and firm quality have the biggest impact on seniority of debt issuance. We also show that the use of syndication and secured debt increases following a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation.</b> Our analysis demonstrates that the majority of the impact of the change in our dependent variables is observed following the first violation. Our analysis also includes the choice between public and private debt. We show that, following a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation,</b> firms are more likely to place their debt privately.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines whether banks {{influence their}} borrowers 2 ̆ 7 disclosure choices {{in order to}} maintain or enhance their information advantage relative to competing capital providers. Banks that actively monitor borrowers acquire private information that gives them an information advantage relative to competing potential lender banks and dispersed bondholders and shareholders, who are relatively more reliant on public disclosures to obtain information about the firm. Banks benefit from this information advantage and, therefore, prefer less public dissemination of information that is available to them privately. I test this theory by examining changes in firms 2 ̆ 7 disclosures choices around <b>covenant</b> <b>violations,</b> which shift the control rights to creditors, who can then use their enhanced bargaining power to impose their preferences on various firm policies, including disclosure policies.

40|$|Our study {{establishes}} {{linkages between}} two extensively researched areas, debt financing {{and the quality}} of earnings. Debt can have a 'positive influence'on earnings quality because managers are likely to use their accounting discretion to provide private information about the firms' future prospects to lower financing costs. For high debt, it can also have a 'negative influence' on earnings quality as managers use accruals aggressively to manage earnings to avoid <b>covenant</b> <b>violations.</b> Using accruals quality as a proxy for earnings quality, we document a non-monotonic (curvilinear) relation between debt and earnings quality. The relationship is positive at low levels of debt and negative at high debt levels with an inflection point around 41 %. Our results suggest that firms that rely heavily on debt financing might be willing to bear higher costs of borrowing from lower earnings quality because the benefits from avoiding potential debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> exceed the higher borrowing costs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate but related essays investigating new determinants of the underpricing of seasoned equity offering (SEOs). It also examines new mechanisms and channels that affect the pricing of SEOs. The first essay examines the impacts of earnings smoothing on SEO underpricing. It aims to investigate whether earnings smoothing can add value to firms by reducing the degree of SEO underpricing. The findings show that smoothing earnings performance resulting from discretionary accruals is negatively related to SEO underpricing and improve earnings informativeness. This essay contributes specifically to the current literature on earnings smoothing by demonstrating that high quality firms that expect larger quantity of cash flow {{in the near future}} are more likely to actively smooth earnings via discretionary accruals before SEOs to reduce underpricing. The second essay explores the role of lines of credit in pricing seasoned equity offerings via market timing activities. This essay provides evidence that lines of credit, while not perfect substitutes for cash holdings, give firms the option to delay equity offerings until market conditions become more favorable, thereby creating value for current shareholders. Interestingly, these effects are not observed when firms are financially constrained. The third essay investigates the impact of <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> on SEO underpricing. It also directly quantifies the changes in implied cost of equity surrounding <b>covenant</b> <b>violations.</b> The results show that seasoned equity offerings are more underpriced after <b>covenant</b> <b>violations.</b> The findings show that firms that violate a covenant, on average, experience an 8. 4 % increase in the implied cost of equity. This suggests that creditors may force violating firms to issue equity to lower leverage, thereby resulting in a higher degree of SEO underpricing through the SEO episodes. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the {{actions taken by}} the creditor and {{the impact on the}} borrower’s firm value upon a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> across jurisdictions. By analyzing 342 loan facilities concerning 259 borrowers from four jurisdictions with either a pro-creditor or pro-debtor bankruptcy regime over a period of five years (2002 - 2007), we find that the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated plays an important factor on how its stock price will respond to a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> announcement even though it may not affect the creditors ’ decision to provide waivers or change covenants. In addition, contrary to prior findings, the study also shows that creditors do not always reduce allowable borrowings nor tighten existing covenants when the loan agreement is renegotiated after a <b>covenant</b> <b>violation.</b> Instead, new restrictive covenants are often imposed to control the way the borrower utilizes the funds.

40|$|Abstract This study aims to {{determine}} whether companies with high level of political costs, close to debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation,</b> issuing equity or bonds, applying a bonus based earnings, achieving and/or exceeding analyst's forecasts, have effect on earnings management. In addition, this study examines whether this relationship are influenced by some company financial conditions, such {{as the level of}} profitability, size, leverage, growth, liquidity, and investment. Previous studies generally focus only on one type of motivation to perform earnings management. Therefore, this study enhances the literatures by studying comprehensively various events that may motivate companies to perform earnings management. The results show the level of political costs, bonus based earnings, and benchmarking financial analyst forecasts have significant positive effects on earnings management. Meanwhile, the events of debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation,</b> issuance of equity or bond have no effect on earnings management. The company financial condition moderated the association between each motive to earnings management, although there is no significant direct impact between financial conditions to earnings management.

40|$|This study quantifies {{costs that}} firms {{are willing to}} incur to avoid {{violation}} of private debt covenants. The results indicate that as firms approach <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> they engage in income-increasing earnings management, which increases their tax liability. By estimating the extent of income-increasing activities and the additional tax costs incurred, this study arrives at a lower-bound estimate {{of the cost of}} violating private debt covenants. The mean (median) firm with relatively tight debt covenants increases its current tax liability by an amount equivalent to increasing the cost of debt financing by between 12. 92 (10. 72) and 22. 72 (12. 81) basis points (where firms with relatively loose debt covenants serve as the baseline). The magnitude of this estimate indicates that the expected costs of <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> are meaningful. Combined with recent evidence that private debt covenant violations occur frequently (Dichev and Skinner, 2002; Roberts and Sufi, 2007 a), this implies debt covenants and expected violations are economically important.

40|$|Positive {{accounting}} theory {{proposes that}} it is costly to violate debt covenants and, hence, that managers will be motivated {{to try to prevent}} violations from occurring (Watts and Zimmerman 1986). While early research in the debt covenant literature simply assumed that default was costly, a recent trend has been to examine firm-specific conditions in an effort to more accurately describe the nature of the costs (Beneish and Press 1993). This study is comparable in that firm-specific conditions are used to shed new light on the effects of debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation.</b> This paper, however, focuses on the long-term consequences, as opposed to the short-term costs, of debt <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> and on {{the degree to which the}} market's perception of violation is a function of these consequences. Thus, the findings presented herein reveal (1) what happens to firms when they violate their debt covenants, and (2) how accurately and efficiently the financial markets impound this information. The current study utilizes a sample of 162 firms having initial debt covenant defaults between 1978 and 1988. Relative frequency analyses reveal that only 40 % of these firms violate their covenants once. The remaining 60 % have subsequent incidents of either technical default, monetary default, bankruptcy or liquidation. Firms forced into bankruptcy or liquidation comprise approximately 20 % of the sample, suggesting that covenant violations, indeed, are not inconsequential events. In support of this, the capital markets tests reveal that equity holders do not take covenant violations lightly. Sample firms are found to experience significant increases in systematic risk and significant decreases in share prices. Furthermore, share price reactions to initial <b>covenant</b> <b>violation</b> announcements are found to be associated with the specific subsequent events (i. e., subsequent technical default, monetary default, bankruptcy and liquidation) that are faced by the violating firms. Thus, this paper reveals that the market is capable of distinguishing, at the date of initial default, between firms that will have no future default problems and firms that will face more severe consequences, such as monetary default, bankruptcy and liquidation...|$|E

40|$|Parties to lending {{agreements}} {{can create}} priority rankings in two ways: by securing a lender or by protecting the lender's debt with financial covenants. Protected debt turns into high priority debt because the early lender will permit <b>covenant</b> <b>violations</b> only if a later lender agrees to subordinate its claim. The Bankruptcy Code sustains both forms of priority by according secured debt senior status and by enforcing subordination agreements among creditors. The latter priority is not controversial but several recent reform proposals {{would reduce the}} secured lender's priority. This article argues that creditors who lend early in a firm's life are concerned about debt dilution, which can occur even {{when all of the}} borrower's later projects have positive values. It then shows that the equilibrium financial contract for private debt has strong borrowers protecting the early debt with financial covenants, and it suggests that weak borrowers protect the early debt with security. Thus security and financial covenants may be substitutes. "Covenant equilibria" are argued to be efficient. That these equilibria closely resemble "security equilibria," and that arguments for the inefficiency of the secured lender's priority are weak, both argue that the Bankruptcy Code's current respect for both forms of priority should continue. The article also argues that financial covenants should be made binding on later lenders whose advances would cause <b>covenant</b> <b>violations.</b> ...|$|R
