40|$|Using {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} methods the layer by layer analysis of the bulk hardened superior quality rails is carried out and the quantitative parameters of structure, phase state and defect substructure gradients are established. The gradient character of changing of structure-phase states and dislocation substructure along the <b>cross</b> section of <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> is revealed. The oil bulk hardening of superior quality rails is accompanied by the formation of morphologically different structure, being produced according to the shear and diffusion of γ-α transformation. The base structure volume is formed by the diffusion mechanism and is consisted of plate pearlite grains, free ferrite grains and grains of ferrite-carbide mixture. The presence of the bend extinction contours testifying to curvature-torsion of crystal lattice is revealed on electron microscope images. The analysis of far acting internal field stresses created by interfaces of cementite plates of pearlite grains and interfaces of pearlite and ferrite grains is carried out. It is shown that the interface boundaries globular cementite particles-matrix are the possible places of microcracks initiation...|$|R

40|$|Rail defects are {{currently}} managed mainly by ultrasonic rail defect detection. Detecting and managing transverse cracks caused in <b>rail</b> <b>heads</b> {{is particularly important}} because they may affect transport. In general, a transverse crack branches off from a horizontal crack called a squat as shown in Fig. 1 and develops toward {{the bottom of the}} rail. In on-site ultrasonic defect detection, transverse cracks are sometimes difficult to detect because of damage on or under the <b>rail</b> surface (<b>head</b> checks or horizontal cracks) or <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> deformation due to wear. There was also a need for longitudinal continuous detection. In light of those, we have developed a rail defect detection device that detects defects from the upper fishing surface of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> (hereinafter, “underside of the rail head”) using phased array technology...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{study on the}} effects of {{grinding}} of <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> on rolling contact fatigue of rails, residual stress measurements were conducted for rails processed under different grinding conditions. In this study, residual stresses in rails used for a service line were measured with the method of X-ray stress measurement. The triaxial stress analysis was conducted using a new method for an area detector type X-ray stress analysis proposed by the authors. Four grinding conditions were used to rail specimens. The distributions of residual stresses in the surface layer of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> were obtained. It was found that the tensile residual stresses were generated at the field-side of the ground rai 1, and that the triaxial stress state was formed in the surface of the <b>rail</b> <b>head</b> widely...|$|R
