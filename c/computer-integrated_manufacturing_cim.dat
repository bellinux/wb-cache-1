40|$|Computer-aided process {{planning}} (CAPP) {{is an important}} interface between computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided <b>manufacturing</b> (CAM) in <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> environments (<b>CIMs).</b> In this paper, {{process planning}} problem is described based on a weighted graph, and an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is improved {{to deal with it}} effectively. The weighted graph consists of nodes, directed arcs, and undirected arcs, which denote operations, precedence constraints among operation, and the possible visited path among operations, respectively. Ant colony goes through the necessary nodes on the graph to achieve the optimal solution with the objective of minimizing total production costs (TPCs). A pheromone updating strategy proposed in this paper is incorporated in the standard ACO, which includes Global Update Rule and Local Update Rule. A simple method by controlling the repeated number of the same process plans is designed to avoid the local convergence. A case has been carried out to study the influence of various parameters of ACO on the system performance. Extensive comparative experiments have been carried out to validate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed approach...|$|R

50|$|Digital {{manufacturing}} is {{an integrated}} approach to manufacturing that is centered around a computer system.

50|$|The MAC began {{following}} a 1990 survey of 550 Western Pennsylvania manufacturers by the Department of Industrial Engineering that revealed {{the need for}} manufacturing support services {{in this part of}} the state. In response a concept of shared manufacturing was created by Pitt School of Engineering professors Dr. Bopaya Bidanda and Dr. David I. Cleland, and a proposal describing how the MAC would meet this need resulted in a $2.3 million grant from the Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The center's purpose is to provide research and educational support to the University of Pittsburgh, as well as to provide small and mid-sized manufacturers of Western Pennsylvania with the tools to compete in the global marketplace. As such, area manufacturers can receive demonstrations on new equipment and manufacturing processes, perform pilot manufacturing, and conduct limited production utilizing the resources available in the MAC labs. In addition to these services, the MAC also provides training on computer numerical control (CNC) machining, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (<b>CIM),</b> plus a variety of other concepts, such as materials requirements planning, total quality management, and team development, that are utilized by modern manufacturing organizations. Working in partnership with private industry, the MAC is part of the development of the regional RoboCorridor, promoting automation and agile robotics.|$|E

30|$|<b>Computer-integrated</b> <b>{{manufacturing}}</b> is {{a modern}} manufacturing system in which computers are used to control the production processes. All units of a CIM system are connected to each other by a computer network; therefore, the manufacturing system can be more efficient (Miller et al. 2010). Integration of AMTs makes CIM systems very effective (Nagalingam and Lin 1999). Nevertheless, CIM systems are capable of exploiting local resources only (Wang 2007). To overcome this limitation of CIM, a new system called virtual <b>computer-integrated</b> <b>manufacturing</b> (VCIM) is being developed. VCIM is a pretty new concept, defined as a network of interconnected CIM systems which are globally and/or locally distributed (Nagalingam and Lin 1999).|$|R
