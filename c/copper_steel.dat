25|$|Materials are {{important}} as well. A pipe filled with hair restricts {{the flow of}} water more than a clean pipe of the same shape and size. Similarly, electrons can flow freely and easily through a copper wire, but cannot flow as easily through a steel wire of the same shape and size, and they essentially cannot flow at all through an insulator like rubber, regardless of its shape. The difference between <b>copper,</b> <b>steel,</b> and rubber is related to their microscopic structure and electron configuration, and is quantified by a property called resistivity.|$|E

It also is used to make sodium chlorate, which is added along with sulfuric acid and water to manufacture chlorine dioxide, an excellent oxygen-based bleaching chemical. The chlorine dioxide process, which originated in Germany after World War I, is becoming more popular because of environmental pressures to reduce or eliminate chlorinated bleaching compounds. In tanning and leather treatment, salt is added to animal hides to inhibit microbial activity {{on the underside of}} the hides and to attract moisture back into the hides.|$|E

The new data about the mechanisms of solid plastic flow of metal during the rolling on the smooth pinion ring have been obtained. The effective rolling process of thick plates in the low-plastic <b>copper</b> <b>steels</b> of 12 DN 2 F type, which provides for the high quality of their surface, has been developed. The process reserves to rise the surface quality of thick plates in the <b>copper</b> <b>steels</b> of 12 DN 2 F type at the stage of rolling conversion have been determined.

25|$|Rogers' {{success in}} the oil {{industry}} began with Charles Pratt in 1866, when he invented the process by which Naptha was separated from crude oil, making oil refining possible. John D. Rockefeller bought his and Pratt's business in 1874, and Rogers rose rapidly in Standard Oil. He designed the idea of a very long pipeline for transporting oil, as opposed to using railway cars. The 1880s, he broadened his interests beyond oil to include <b>copper,</b> <b>steel,</b> banking, and railroads, as well as the Consolidated Gas Company that provided coal gas to major cities. By the 1890s, as Rockefeller was withdrawing from the oil business, Rogers was a dominant figure at Standard Oil. In 1899 Rogers set up the Amalgamated Copper trust, based in Butte, Montana, that dominated an industry in high demand as the nation needed wire to build its electric networks. His last major enterprise was building the Virginian Railroad to service the West Virginia coal fields. After 1890, he became a prominent philanthropist, as well as a friend and supporter of Mark Twain and Booker T. Washington.|$|E
