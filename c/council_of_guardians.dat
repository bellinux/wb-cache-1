25|$|In 1981, {{after the}} {{assassination}} of Mohammad-Ali Rajai, Khamenei was elected President of Iran by a landslide vote (97%) in the Iranian presidential election, October 1981 in which only four candidates were approved by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians.</b> Khamenei became the first cleric {{to serve in the}} office. Ruhollah Khomeini had originally wanted to keep clerics out of the presidency but later changed his views. Khamenei was reelected in Iranian presidential election, 1985 where only three candidates were approved by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians,</b> receiving 87% of the votes. The only Iranian presidential election that had fewer candidates approved by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> was the Iranian presidential election, 1989, where only two candidates were approved by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> to run, and Rafsanjani easily won 96% of the votes.|$|E

It took control of 338 out of 393 local government bodies, county <b>councils,</b> boards <b>of</b> <b>guardians</b> and rural district councils across the whole island. It should be noted however that the county and rural district elections saw virtually no contests outside of Ulster.|$|R
5000|$|The Local Government (Elections) Act 1896 gave county councils {{the power}} to make {{appointments}} to any district or parish <b>council</b> or board <b>of</b> <b>guardians</b> where elections were found to be defective, or had not been held.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1979 a new {{constitution}} giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist Supreme Leader and a clerical <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an Assembly of Experts for Constitution. The new constitution was approved by referendum in December 1979.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the president, the new constitution included a more powerful post of guardian jurist ruler intended for Khomeini, with {{control of the military}} and security services, and power to appoint several top government and judicial officials. It increased the power and number of clerics on the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> and gave it control over elections as well as laws passed by the legislature.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, which {{monitors}} states' {{compliance with}} the CRC, urged Iran to immediately stay all executions of child offenders and to abolish {{the use of the}} death penalty in such cases. In the summer of 2006, the Iranian Parliament reportedly passed a bill establishing special courts for children and adolescents. However, it has not yet been approved by the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians,</b> which supervises Iran's legislation to ensure conformity with Islamic principles. During the past four years, the Iranian authorities have reportedly been considering legislation to ban the death penalty for child offenders. Recent comments by a judiciary spokesperson indicates that the proposed law would only prohibit the death penalty for certain crimes, and not all crimes committed by children.|$|E
50|$|Little else {{is known}} of Lachlann's {{activities}} until 1299. A report of an English spy at an important <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> Scotland in August of this year reveals that news of devastations beyond the Firth of Forth committed by Lachlann and Alexander Comyn (died 1308), younger brother of John Comyn, Earl of Buchan (died 1308), was brought before leading Scottish magnates. According to the English informant, the severity of this news immediately quelled a heated quarrel that threatened the assembly itself.|$|R

500|$|Clement's close {{association}} with the late King Alexander II and {{his reputation as a}} successful bishop made him a key political figure during the minority of Alexander III. Clement was on the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians,</b> the small group of nobles and clerics who were to [...] "govern" [...] Scotland until the end of Alexander III's boyhood. The governing Council broke down around two rival factions, one centred on Walter Comyn and the other around Alan Durward. There is little evidence about Clement's activities in regard to the Council, but he was associated with the Comyn faction, who enjoyed the ascendency after Walter gained control of government in 1251. In 1255, the Durwards staged a coup at Roxburgh and ousted the [...] "Comyn faction" [...] from effective power. Unfortunately for Alan Durward, Comyn's supporter Gamelin, who had been placed in the bishopric of St Andrews and excluded from his diocese by Durward, had fled to the papal court and convinced the Pope to excommunicate Alan. The sentence was delivered by Bishop Clement and the abbots of Melrose and Jedburgh. This is Clement's last known act.|$|E

Mahmood Kashani, {{the son of}} Abol-Ghasem Kashani, [...] "one of the top members of the current, ruling élite" [...] whom the Iranian <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> has twice approved {{to run for the}} presidency, denies there was a coup d'état in 1953, saying Mosaddegh was obeying British plans to undermine the role of Shia clerics.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, in {{the first}} {{election}} {{after the end of}} his presidency, Rafsanjani ran again for Parliament. In the Tehran contest, Rafsanjani came in 30th, or last, place. At first, he was not among the 30 representatives of Tehran elected, as announced by the Iranian Ministry of the Interior, but the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians</b> then ruled numerous ballots void, leading to accusations of ballot fraud in Rafsanjani's favor. Rafsanjani thus became a Majlis representative, but resigned before being sworn in. He explained that he felt he was [...] "able to serve the people better in other posts".|$|E

50|$|Vance later joins this {{incarnation}} <b>of</b> the <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the Galaxy {{and helps}} to rescue Peter Quill from Blastaar. He later joins Rocket Raccoon's team on their mission to stop the War of Kings. After Adam Warlock loses control and becomes Magus, Vance is killed when his shield is thrown back at him by Magus, opening his suit up and causing him to age rapidly. However, he is later seen to be alive, but in suspended animation and a prisoner of the Magus, along with Mantis, Phyla-Vell, Cosmo and Gamora. He later breaks free with the other Guardians (excluding Phyla-Vell - apparently slain by the revived Thanos), reuniting with {{the other half of}} the team. After Thanos is incapacitated by Star-Lord, Major Victory and all the other Guardians reunite in Knowhere. It's also revealed, during a <b>council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> All Galaxies - that reunites the <b>Guardians</b> <b>of</b> the whole Multiverse - that the Major Victory currently in Earth 616 is a time displaced one from an alternate, unidentified dimension. During this council three other versions of Major Victory appear: one identical to Earth-616 one with the original uniform, another with the symbiotic outfit of 1994-1995 and finally another with the pre-symbiotic costume appearance and the Captain America-themed uniform.|$|R
50|$|After a long absence, Matt {{returns with}} a blind man from a distant village called the Village of Healing. The man is {{interestingly}} enough wearing a blue shirt - something that Kira's people don't do {{due to the lack}} of knowledge thereof. It turns out that he is the father who Kira thought was dead: Christopher. It is revealed that he had been attacked years before by another hunter who was jealous of his immediate potential of being a member on the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Guardians.</b> First, he was beaten and then had his face stabbed - thus losing his sight. Being taken to the fields to die amongst the other rejected ailed, injured, and dying citizens of their society, he was rescued by some people he could not see - who took him to the Village he now lives in. The community in which he now lives is made up of injured and disabled people who help one another, rather than bicker and fight for their lives as Kira's does. Matt excitedly explains that in this Village they know the way to make blue threads, bringing plants that will allow Kira to do the same.|$|R
2500|$|On 24 April 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini {{issued a}} decree {{convening}} an Assembly for Revising the Constitution. It made several {{changes in the}} constitution, in Articles 5, 107, 109, 111, {{eliminating the need for}} the Leader to be a marja or to be chosen by popular acclaim. [...] It made permanent the Expediency Discernment Council to work out disagreements between the Parliament and <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians,</b> and eliminated the post of Prime Minister. [...] The amendments were thought to be established because no marja had given strong support for Khomeini's policies - The amendments were approved by the voting public on 28 July 1989 (in same election as Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected to the first of two terms as President of Iran).|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004 Parliament elections, the <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> <b>Guardians,</b> {{a council}} of twelve members, {{half of whom}} are {{appointed}} by Ali Khamenei, disqualified thousands of candidates, including many of the reformist members of the parliament and all the candidates of the Islamic Iran Participation Front party from running. It did not allow 80 members of the 6th Iranian parliament (including the deputy speaker) {{to run in the}} election. Apart from Ali Khamenei, many conservative theorists as Emad Afrough supported the decision of Guardian council and accused the reformist parliament members of [...] "being liberal, secular and with no Iranian identity". Referring to 7th parliament members, Ali Meshkini said that the list of candidates had signed by Imam Mahdi: [...] "...I have a special gratitude for Honorable Baqiyatullah (aj), whom when seven months ago during the Night of Power the Divine angels presented him with the list of the names and addresses {{of the members of the}} (new) parliament, His Eminency signed all of them...".|$|E

Thus, in the event of their death, their estate could pass to a competent heir. These officers were required to hold to account the prytanes (councillors), strategoi (generals) and hipparchoi (cavalry officers) of the preceding year until their accounts had been audited. [...] "The <b>Council</b> <b>of</b> Areopagus was <b>guardian</b> <b>of</b> the laws, and kept watch over the magistrates to see that they executed their offices in accordance with the laws.

He pointed out that the boundary had been arrived at arbitrarily but consisted of the [...] "City of London and a number of surrounding parishes, which had been gradually added to by successive Registrar-Generals, and appeared to have been formed on no pre-conceived plan, but simply as considerations of convenience might from time to time dictate."
