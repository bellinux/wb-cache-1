As all life processes are ultimately based on chemistry it is natural that detection and passing on of the external input will involve chemical events.

To be physically addicted to a substance means that the normal release of neurotransmitter has been obstructed {{by the presence of}} a chemical of abuse. The reward center of the brain gets overstimulated with the pleasurable response of drug or alcohol use and adapts to accommodate these increase levels of <b>chemical</b> <b>input.</b> This creates a neural environment for addiction development.

The bottom part is a quinoline molecule which is a receptor for hydrogen ions. The logic gate operates as follows.Without any <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> of Ca2+ or H+, the chromophore shows a maximum absorbance in UV/VIS spectroscopy at 390 nm. When calcium is introduced a blue shift takes place and the absorbance at 390 nm decreases.

This system represents a XNOR logic gate in absorption and a XOR logic gate in transmittance.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all of {{the water}} {{entering}} Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora {{is derived from the}} groundwater system that underlies the gravel-dominated strata of the Central Canterbury Plains. The groundwater system is fed from two sources of recharge: rainfall incident on the plains and subterranean seepage from the Rakaia and Waimakariri Rivers. The exception to this is periods of persistent rainfall, usually during winter when discharge into Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora is supplemented by surface flow derived from the foothills from the Rakaia Gorge to Darfield. This illustrates why Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora has undergone significant ecological transformation in recent years as land use practices in the catchment area have changed. Little detail is known about water level regimes, internal circulation or sedimentation regimes of such lagoons, however it is known that they are significantly vulnerable to human use of the surrounding land and contributing catchments through changes to their hydrological regimes, as well as their sediment and <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> loads.|$|E

In this study, Allen and Morishima elasticities of substitution are estimated to {{study the effects of}} these price changes on energy use, <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> use, capital formation and employment. Panel data methods, Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and instrument exogeneity tests are used to specify and estimate technology and substitution elasticities. Results indicate that indirect price policy may be effective in controlling energy consumption. The sustained increases in energy and <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> prices have worked together to restrict energy and <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> use, and the substitutability between energy, capital and labour has prevented the capital shrinkage and agricultural unemployment situations from being worse. The Hungarian push towards lower energy intensity may be best pursued through sustained energy price increases rather than capital subsidies. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{study was}} {{conducted}} in order to compare soil faunal activity in four experimental farming systems using different tillage, <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> and crop rotation practices: a conventional system with deep-ploughing (CT), an integrated system with reduced tillage and minimum <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> (IN), a system with reduced tillage and high <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> (RT) and a system with minimum tillage and high <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> (MT). In nine experimental fields with two sampling points each, earthworms were sampled and biogenic structures were identified and counted in topsoil profiles (0 - 14 cm depth). Components of these profiles were identified by morphological features. Quantitative analyses of these morphological features provided information about soil compaction, earthworm and enchytraeid activity and distribution of roots and crop residues in the soil matrix. The dominant species in the earthworm community was the endogeic Aporrectodea rosea. Earthworm densities were unexpectedly lowest under reduced tillage (6 specimens per m(2)), and highest under deep-ploughing (67 specimen per m 2), the reverse effect being observed with enchytraeid worms, as ascertained by deposition of their faecal pellets in topsoil profiles. Strong very fine granular structure (STVFGR) was most frequent in the integrated farming system (IN). We concluded that in the studied site embracing four farming systems, enchytraeids {{play an important role in}} creating a stable soil structure and porosity at the low level of earthworm densities found in the integrated system (IN) ...|$|E

Of the 110 study fms chosen from a stratified random sample, {{less than half}} said they documented and measured their toxics use reduction progress. During on-site visits with twenty-eight of these fms, roughly half measured their progress accurately. Toxics use reduction measurement errors were most frequently due to one {{or a combination of}} five causes: use of poor normalization factors, inaccurate math calculations, materials accounting mistakes, incorrect chemical balances, and poor production unit definitions. In reconciling these errors, <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> data was found to be more accurate than byproduct and emission data. Using <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> data, the study documented over 2. 4 million pounds of toxics use reduction at 28 metal-intensive fms.

40|$|The {{integration}} of biomolecular logic gates with field-effect devices the basic element of conventional electronic logic gates and computing - {{is one of}} the most attractive and promising approaches for the transformation of biomolecular logic principles into macroscopically useable electrical output signals. In this work, capacitive field-effect EIS (electrolyte-insulator-semiconductor) sensors based on a p-Si-SiO 2 -Ta 2 O 5 structure modified with a multi-enzyme membrane have been used for electronic transduction of biochemical signals processed by enzyme-based OR and AND logic gates. The realised OR logic gate composes of two enzymes (glucose oxidase and esterase) and was activated by ethyl butyrate or/and glucose. The AND logic gate composes of three enzymes (invertase, mutarotase and glucose oxidase) and was activated by two <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> signals: sucrose and dissolved oxygen. The developed integrated enzyme logic gates produce local pH changes at the EIS sensor surface as a result of biochemical reactions activated by different combinations of <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> signals, while the pH value of the bulk solution remains unchanged. The pH-induced charge changes at the gate-insulator (Ta 2 O 5) surface of the EIS transducer result in an electronic signal corresponding to the logic output produced by the immobilised enzymes. The logic output signals have been read out by means of a constant-capacitance method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Molecular logic gates, {{which have}} {{attracted}} increasing research interest and are {{crucial for the}} development of molecular-scale computers, simplify the results of measurements and detections, leaving the diagnosis of disease either "yes" or "no". Prion diseases are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that happen in human and animals. The main problem with a diagnosis of prion diseases is how to sensitively and selectively discriminate and detection of the minute amount of PrP(Res) in biological samples. Our previous work had demonstrated that dual-aptamer strategy could achieve highly sensitive and selective discrimination and detection of prion protein (cellular prion protein, PrP(C), and the diseases associated isoform, PrP(Res)) in serum and brain. Inspired by the advantages of molecular logic gate, we further conceived a new concept for dual-aptamer logic gate that responds to two <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> signals (PrP(C) or PrP(Res) and Gdn-HCl) and generates a change in fluorescence intensity as the output signal. It was found that PrP(Res) performs the "OR" logic operation while PrP(C) performs "XOR" logic operation when they get through the gate consisted of aptamer modified reusable magnetic microparticles (MMPs-Apt 1) and quantum dots (QDs-Apt 2). The dual-aptamer logic gate simplifies the discrimination results of PrP(Res), leaving the detection of PrP(Res) either "yes" or "no". The development of OR logic gate based on dual-aptamer strategy and two <b>chemical</b> <b>input</b> signals (PrP(Res) and Gdn-HCl) is an important step toward the design of prion diseases diagnosis and therapy systems...|$|E
