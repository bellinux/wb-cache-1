40|$|Metal-insulator-metal (MIM) {{capacitors}} play {{an important}} part in many integrated electronic circuits in the areas of analog, microwave, and radio frequency systems. However the transverse dimensions of current MIM capacitors are in the micrometer scale. If integrated circuits continue to be miniaturized, the capacitor, alongside other components, must also be miniaturized to realize nanoelectronic circuits and systems. This article presents a novel device, the nanocapacitor, of which the dimensions are constrained to nanoscale in longitudinal and transverse directions, and discusses the effects of material properties on their operation.

40|$|As the {{communications}} revolution continues {{there is an}} ever increasing demand for integrated transmitters and receivers on silicon in devices such as mobile phones and networking products. The demand to integrate complete systems onto a single die has driven a need to minimise the area of transmitters {{which has led to}} research into combining digital to analogue converters and RF mixers to minimise their area. The drive for increasing speeds and smaller transistors has resulted in higher <b>capacitance</b> <b>densities</b> and lower operating voltages, the latter making it more difficult to implement conventional transmitter circuits. Therefore {{there is a need for}} passive transmitter systems that maximise the output power to the load by minimising the voltage overhead on the output signal. This thesis proposes and demonstrates that it is possible to use a digital to analogue converter that performs RF up conversion using direct capacitive discharge to the load, which takes advantage of the large <b>capacitance</b> <b>densities</b> of a modern 40 nm CMOS process. The DAC uses charge sharing in a similar manner to a charge sharing DAC without the bandwidth limitations imposed by an output amplifier. The RF frequency up conversion at the DAC data clock rate is produced using two DACs that differentially output the complement of each other on different halves of the clock cycle (one outputting while the other is charging) thereby emulating a passive switched mixer.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} {{improvements in}} microelectronics performance over that {{past few decades}} have been accompanied by a severe reduction {{in the size of}} memory and logic devices. This scaling has required drastic decreases of the SiO 2 dielectric film thickness to achieve ever-higher <b>capacitance</b> <b>densities.</b> Fundamental limits of SiO 2 as a dielectric material, imposed by electron tunneling, will be reached as this SiO 2 film thickness approaches ~ 1 nm. By 2005, an as yet undetermined alternate high-k interlayer dielec-tric material will be needed to replace SiO 2 as a capacitor and gate dielectric material. Numerous alternate high-k materials are being actively investigated, ranging from Al 2 O 3 (k ~ 9) to perovskites (k ~ 102 – 104). High-k materials hold the promise of achieving very high <b>capacitance</b> <b>densities</b> with relatively thick films. These thicker films should preclude the excessive tunneling currents observed for very thin SiO 2 films. However, finding a high-k material is a major challenge because the high-k material must have a high resistivity, act as a good barrier layer, be thermally stable, and form an ideal interface with silicon. SiO 2 films can be conveniently formed via oxidation of the silicon substrate. In contrast, alternate high-k materials must be formed by deposi-tion. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has emerged as a very promising technique for depositing alternate high-k thin films for the microelectronics industry. ALD can deposit films with atomic layer thickness control and conformally coat high aspect ratio structures. Most high-k dielectric materials have been successfully deposited by ALD. ALD is also very well suited for depositing various types of composites that combine the desirable properties of different materials. 10. ...|$|R
