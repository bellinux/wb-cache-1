40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} EU's {{development}} policy {{in relation to}} the Pacific members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group (ACP). It considers the particular characteristics and challenges faced by these island economies before turning to their trade relations with the EU and the <b>Community's</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> It considers both the regional assistance programme and the particular experience of Fiji, the largest economy of the South Pacific. Finally, it attempts to draw some more general conclusions as to the effectiveness of EU aid administration and to identify those issues that remain to be addressed including monitoring, performance criteria, deconcentration and policy coherence.

Australia has also funded the installation of water tanks on Funafuti, which project also involved improving roof and gutter systems of households to capture more fresh water. In July 2012 a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.|$|R
40|$|Understanding European <b>Community</b> <b>aid</b> {{sets out}} to remedy ignorance of the EC's <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> It {{provides}} an overview of the evolution of EC aid and examines the legal and political basis for current assistance programmes; how EC <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> are managed; the source of EC aid; and the main aid instruments. It provides a framework for comparing, across regions and countries, different categories of aid delivery and different sectors receiving aid. EC aid to each of the main recipient regions is examined in detail, through both statistical and institutional analysis. The final chapter places EC aid in a global context, comparing the regional spread and sectoral emphasis of EC aid with those of the major OECD donors.

40|$|The European Union {{has emerged}} as one of the world's largest aid donors. However, its {{multilateral}} <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> while well-placed to set a new standard in development assistance, suffers from problems of democratic accountability confronting all transnational actors in an increasingly global community. Examination of the rules governing the European Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> to Asian and Latin American countries reveals a pattern of perverse incentives facing private consultants and a lack of access to information that makes the programme virtually unaccountable to both European taxpayers and citizens in recipient countries. Case material from the Philippines illustrates the problems in the Commission's <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Proposals for reform are presented that are both politically feasible and capable of making the programme significantly more transparent and accountable. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of recent changes in the organisation and activity of Canada's foreign <b>aid</b> <b>programme.</b> Three conceptually distinct categories form the theoretical framework of the study: (a) contending approaches {{to the study of}} international relations; (b) contending conceptions of economic growth and development; and (c) contending approaches to the aid policy-making process. The study examines the multiple objectives underlying Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> develops and interprets a series of "aid quality" indices, and undertakes a detailed examination of the aid policy process. Emphasis is placed on tracing the specific combination of domestic "push" and international "pull" factors which have pressured Ottawa into initiatives promoting a closer linkage of the aid and trade facets of government activity. Attention is also drawn to the impact of these initiatives on the developmental objectives of the programme. The principal finding of the study is that while Canada's <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> has until recently been able to maintain a precarious balance between the opposing forces of philanthropy and self-interest, there are now unmistakable signs of a deliberate effort to tilt the programme in a more commercial direction. In this trend, the single case of Canada mirrors a more general pattern towards an increasingly commercial orientation in most donor <b>aid</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is twofold: first, to explore the {{potential}} for landmine programmes to have {{both positive and negative}} effects on peacebuilding and, second, to provide operating questions and practical suggestions for mine action practitioners trying to incorporate peacebuilding into mines action. The essay will begin by examining the concept of peacebuilding and describing the work of practitioners who have attempted to incorporate peacebuilding into humanitarian <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> The writings of these practitioners provide guidelines for <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> that can be transferred to landmine programmes. These authors also caution that <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> can reinforce the structures that support war. I think that this danger can extend to landmine programmes as well. This possibility, and its prevention, will be further explored. The final part of this section will explore of the dynamics of peacebuilding and how it can be incorporated into landmine work...|$|R
