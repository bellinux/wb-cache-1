5000|$|GCHQ Bude was {{featured}} {{extensively in the}} September 11, 2014, BBC2 Horizon television programme: [...] "Inside the Dark Web". This programme estimated that 25% of all internet traffic travels through Cornwall, England. Dr Joss Wright of the University of Oxford Internet Institute explained how mirror images of the signals running down submarine Ethernet cables are used to gather and analyse data. The programme claimed that this procedure involves an optical tap device which is inserted at the submarine <b>cable</b> <b>repeater</b> station. A second copy of the data then travels to GCHQ, while the original carries on its intended journey. GCHQ, it was claimed, then have three days to replay the data. It was stated that everything that comes across the internet can theoretically be accessed, including emails, websites, BitTorrent downloads, films that have been watched etc. Wright added that internal documents show that in 2011, 200 10-gigabit cables coming into Cornwall were being tapped by GCHQ. Dr Wright said that the entire digitised contents of the British Library could be transferred down that set of cables in about 40 seconds. On the same programme, Tim Berners-Lee explained how huge volumes of data are analysed by GCHQ computer programmes to identify trends of communication which are deemed to require further examination.|$|E
50|$|Many such <b>cables</b> use {{underwater}} <b>repeaters</b> or amplifiers {{to boost}} signals being passed along the <b>cable.</b> These <b>repeaters</b> or amplifiers are powered from {{either end of}} the cable using Power Feed Equipment.

40|$|Introduction: It {{has been}} shown by Jung and Tonguz [1] that uplinks in {{personal}} communication system networks can be built using coaxial cable for link lengths 1 / 2 in. Using such <b>cables,</b> no <b>repeater</b> amplifier is necessary to obtain a reasonable dynamic range [1]. From this point of view, the use of optical fibres is necessary for link lengths > 1. 4 km. We show {{that the use of}} optical fibre is actually justified even for much shorter links. Moreover, it is convenient to use repeater amplifiers and higher loss coaxial cable to minimise the costs of the coaxial link. Remote antenna feeding link: If ductings have to be established first, the link costs are of minor importance, or a radio link ma...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1970s, the {{university}} had {{hopes of a}} campus-wide closed-circuit television service to dormitories and other buildings. Although the TV service was not developed, the coaxial cable buried between buildings allowed the radio station to broadcast on an FM wavelength. The signal originated from the studios in St. John's and was carried by <b>cable</b> to <b>repeaters</b> in each dorm. The repeaters boosted the signal, then pushed it through the building via the electrical circuitry. While the FM signal had clearer sound than AM, there were periodic problems when construction on campus caused cuts in the cable. As cable repair was not a top priority of the administrations, WWCU and WCUA staff and supporters held [...] "digging parties" [...] to locate and repair breaks in the cable.|$|R
50|$|This <b>cable</b> {{provided}} intelligent <b>repeaters</b> that counted bit errors {{which were}} reported in response to interrogation from a base station. It contained three fibre pairs which were used to provide two active channels. Each repeater included a base station-controlled cross-over data switch to swap traffic through a choice of two fibre pairs, the switch connections in successive repeaters enabled any desired connection to be made and provide a diversity path when required.|$|R

50|$|Repeaters are {{powered by}} a {{constant}} direct current passed down the conductor {{near the center of}} the <b>cable,</b> so all <b>repeaters</b> in a <b>cable</b> are in series. Power feed equipment is installed at the terminal stations. Typically both ends share the current generation with one end providing a positive voltage and the other a negative voltage. A virtual earth point exists roughly halfway along the cable under normal operation. The amplifiers or repeaters derive their power from the potential difference across them.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, transoceanic cables were coaxial cables that {{transmitted}} frequency-multiplexed voiceband signals. A {{high voltage}} direct current {{on the inner}} conductor powered repeaters (two-way amplifiers placed at intervals along the <b>cable).</b> The first-generation <b>repeaters</b> remain among the most reliable vacuum tube amplifiers ever designed. Later ones were transistorized. Many of these cables are still usable, but have been abandoned because their capacity {{is too small to}} be commercially viable. Some have been used as scientific instruments to measure earthquake waves and other geomagnetic events.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{technology}} of high-performance electrical signaling presenting {{the current state of}} the art and projecting future directions. We have demonstrated equalized electrical signaling between CMOS integrated circuits at data rates of 4 Gb/s. As the factors that determine this signaling rate all scale with improving technology, we expect the data rates of high-performance electrical signaling systems to improve on a Moore's Law curve. The frequency-dependent attenuation of copper wires sets a bandwidth-distance squared (Bd 2) limit on the distance one can signal at a given data rate. Equalizing the channel cancels inter-symbol interference caused by this attenuation and greatly increases signaling distance. In the limit of perfect equalization, distance is ultimately limited by thermal noise in the receiver. At this limit, we calculate that a 4 Gb/s system will be capable of operating over 100 m of 24 -gauge <b>cable</b> without <b>repeaters.</b> 1...|$|R

On 29 September 2015, it was advised that a cable ship had been mobilized to the area, to isolate and resolve the fault, with a tentative fix date of mid to late October 2015, however due to the complexity of repairing cables, this time frame was only an estimated time frame for a fix.|$|R
50|$|Tenders {{to supply}} the cable and other {{equipment}} were undertaken and the main supplier, Felten and Guilleaume (West Germany) was selected in early 1959). The details of the contracts were finalised by mid-1959. The cable for the Canberra-Melbourne link was manufactured by a subcontractor (Olympic Cables Pty Ltd) in Australia. The remaining cable and carrier equipment were manufactured in West Germany. Construction work was undertaken by staff of the PMG.The initial shipment of cable arrived from Germany {{at the end of}} 1959. Cable laying was completed in October 1961 and jointing and testing completed in December 1961.In total, over 960 kilometres of cable were laid and over one million tons of rock and soil excavated to lay the <b>cable.</b> Main <b>repeater</b> stations (which were attended by staff) were constructed every 64 kilometres and minor, unmanned repeater stations every 9 kilometres (103 in total.

The stage is set for a standards-war and in fact, one is currently brewing which should eventually see the evolution of a veritable Automotive Video Bus. Such a bus faces a tall order which includes: low cable cost, low interface cost, low specific weight, multi-GBit/s sustained throughput, multiplex-ability, preservation of synchronisation, high integrity, excellent electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) characteristics, low latency, low jitter, and a minimum 5  m <b>cable</b> span without <b>repeaters</b> [23].|$|R

Communication systems based on "guided" waves, of which "leaky" coaxial cables are one implementation, are attractive candidates for providing a range of communication functions primarily along haulage ways, and possible also within sections up to the working face. (However, there are still strong reservations as to whether a practical coaxial cable sys tem could provide sufficient communications coverage within a section.) In this Part, we present the results of some theoretical calculations {{of the performance of}} leaky coaxial cable communication systems.
