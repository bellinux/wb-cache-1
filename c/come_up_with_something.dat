25|$|Skillet {{formed in}} 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee {{progressive}} rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor {{encouraged them to}} form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut Skillet. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains {{that it was a}} joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.|$|E

[...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today said in 2002, [...] "the alien territory of Achtung Baby and Zooropa cemented U2's relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers".

500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. [...] Hipgnosis had designed {{several of the}} band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion {{when faced with the}} cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. [...] Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as they were employed by the band. [...] For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> [...] "smarter, neater – more classy". [...] The prism design was inspired by a photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell.|$|E
500|$|BioShock 2 was {{announced}} in 2008, with its development being led by 2K Marin.

BioShock 3 was also announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about ten years following the events of the first game.

The Beatles—according to McCartney—needed a new name, so on the flight back to England, Evans and McCartney played with words {{to see if they}} could <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters [...] "S" [...] and [...] "P" [...] stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that it was for salt and pepper, which led to the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band name. They arrived back in London on 19 November 1966. Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper could be completed by Peter Blake, Evans and Aspinall were sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover.|$|E

25|$|A Kiss in the Dreamhouse was {{the first}} album on which the Banshees really {{exploited}} the possibilities of the studio. They allowed themselves to be inspired by sounds. Engineer Mike Hedges, who was interested in vocals, put different effects on Siouxsie's voice and multi-layered it. Hedges also encouraged them to fiddle with effects; if the band <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> off-the-wall, he'd want to top it.|$|R

The band rented a house in Bel Air and began writing in the summer of 1973, but in part because of substance issues and fatigue, they were unable to complete any songs. [...] "Ideas weren't coming out the way they were on Volume 4 and we really got discontent" [...] Iommi said.

[...] Max stated that [...] "Inflikted" [...] {{was supposed to go}} towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, [...] "A lot of people had used it before, so he had to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> else."

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mail {{cited as a}} [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "hilarious" [...] episode, and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "a terrific episode, full of wit and sly digs at our expectations of Homer's abilities. The fact that he invents things that other people find useful (and steal the credit for) is both amusing and a little sad. Poor Homer." [...] Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "though 'Wizard' borders on 'Homer’s wacky scheme' territory, his attempts to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> significant offer amusement. At no point does 'Wizard' threaten to become a particularly strong episode, but it entertains to a reasonable degree. I do like the 'Everything’s Okay Alarm' and the makeup gun, though." ...|$|E

[...] The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as [...] "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roĺl with their own adolescent romanticism", and [...] "the first advance in popular music since the War". They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there were}} some {{criticism}} directed at the list of drugs used in the chorus of [...] "Devil Pray".

[...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin also wrote about the [...] "laundry list of intoxicants" [...] referenced in the song, noting that it [...] "makes 'Devil Pray' sound like a mid-80s PSA." [...] Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media went on to criticize the list for being [...] "a strange, tender, comical thing, [...] but ultimately, it's a boring stadium-throb lite-EDM song about seeking sobriety and/or big-G, God. It's also a Madonna-doing-Madonna cliche , which is too often the downfall of Rebel Heart." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian was negative about [...] "Devil Pray"'s production, claiming that [...] " [...] a pretty transparent attempt by Avicii to <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> along the lines of his hit 'Wake Me Up'." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> better, for this is all I could see myself doing and did." ...|$|E

To ensure that they <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> unused, they settled on using a [...] "nonsensical" [...] word, but one that would still carry an [...] "indirect" [...] {{connection}} to their identity and work.

5000|$|Tchaikovsky was {{uncertain}} initially {{what type of}} composition he would write. Captivated by the playing of the famed Liszt pupil Eugen d'Albert, who had given concerts in Moscow during the 1883/84 season, his thoughts turned to a new piano concerto. Nonetheless, {{he wrote in his}} diary for 13 April 1884, [...] "I stopped playing around and <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> new. Hit upon an idea for a concerto for piano, but it still sounded too poor and unoriginal". Progress, at least in the composer's view, did not improve over time.
