The goal of this work is {{to increase}} the efficiency of conventional solar cells by incorporating quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles in the absorption mechanism. The strategy is to have the QDs absorb UV and fluoresce photons in the visible region that are more readily absorbed by the cells. The outcome is that the cells have more visible photons to absorb and have increased power output. The QDs, having a CdSe core and a ZnS shell, were applied to the solar <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> First, the QDs were synthesized in an octadecene solution, then they were removed from the solution and finally they were dried and deposited into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and the PDMS/QD composite is allowed to cure. The cured sample is applied to a silicon solar panel. The panel with the PDMS/QD application outputs 2. 5 % more power than the one without, under identical illumination by a tungsten halogen lamp, using QDs that fluoresce in the orange region. This work demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating QDs {{to increase the}} efficiency of conventional solar cells. Because the solar cells absorb better in the red region, future effort will be to use QDs that fluoresce in that region to further boost cell output...|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} case {{displays a}} clinical {{study of a}} cancer phenotype with a poor clinical outcome. Prediction of cancer development and effects of treatment {{at the beginning of}} the clinical stage is difficult as the knowledge of cancer process and all necessary parameters of the host body are limited. Cancer is mainly studied on the basis of biochemical-genetic processes and their morphological manifestation. However, the malignant process is assumed to be of essential biophysical nature and develops after mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a direct result of oncogene mutation. Cancers based on the normal and the reverse Warburg effect should be distinguished. The cancer tumors with the reverse Warburg effect display aggressiveness associated with a high rate of recurrence and metastatic implantation. Besides the nature of the two basic types of breast cancer tumors the outcome depends not only on their type, size, and site but also on reactions and interaction with the surrounding tissue and the body aptitude for metastatic activity connected with individual blood or lymphatic vessels for metastatic transport. It is necessary to assess all favourable and adverse factors for cancer development. General reliable method of their specification for all cancers is not available. Nevertheless, the main factor seems to be aggressiveness of cancer <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows</b> from interpretation.

Chem. 262 : 16625 - 16635). The protein is an immunochemically distinct molecule with a subunit size of approximately 30 kD (p 30). p 30 is an abundant protein in perinatal rat brain, but its content decreases rapidly after birth. In {{the present study}} the amino- terminal sequence of p 30 was determined by automated Edman degradations. A single amino-terminal sequence was found, which is not present in previously studied adhesive molecules. This unique sequence has a cluster of five positive charges within the first 11 amino acid residues: Gly-Lys-Gly-Asp-Pro-Lys-Lys-Pro-Arg-Gly-Lys. Antisynthetic peptide antibodies that recognize this sequence were produced in a rabbit, purified with a peptide affinity column, and shown to bind specifically to p 30. The antipeptide antibodies were used, together with anti-p 30 antibodies, to study the localization of p 30 in brain cells and in neuroblastoma <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> <b>follows.</b> (a) Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy indicated that p 30 is a component of neurons in mixed cultures of brain cells.

In addition the protein was detected in ribosomal particles and in intracellular membranes in a proportion of cells. (b) The antibodies immobilized on microtiter wells enhanced adhesion and neurite growth indicating that p 30 is surface exposed in adhering neural cells. (c) Immunoblotting showed that p 30 is extracted from suspended cells by heparin suggesting that a heparin-like structure {{is required for the}} binding of p 30 to the neuronal cell surface.

40|$|Background: Pathogenic chlamydiae are obligate {{intracellular}} pathogens {{and have}} adapted successfully to human cells, causing {{sexually transmitted diseases}} or pneumonia. Chlamydial outer protein N (CopN) is likely a critical effector protein secreted by the type III secretion system in chlamydiae, which manipulates host cells. However, the mechanisms of its action remain to be clarified. In this work, we aimed to identify previously unidentified CopN effector target in host cells. Results: We first performed a pull-down assay with recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion CopN proteins (GST-CpCopN: Chlamydia pneumoniae TW 183, GST-CtCopN: Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW- 3 /CX) as "bait" and soluble lysates obtained from human immortal epithelial HEp- 2 <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> "prey", <b>followed</b> by SDS-PAGE with mass spectroscopy (MS). We found that a host cell protein specifically bound to GST-CpCopN, but not GST-CtCopN.

We also confirmed the role of aldolase A in chlamydia-infected HEp- 2 cells by using two distinct experiments for gene knockdown with an siRNA specific to aldolase A transcripts, and for assessment of glycolytic enzyme gene expression levels. As a result, both the numbers of chlamydial inclusion-forming units and RpoD transcripts were increased in the chlamydia-infected aldolase A knockdown <b>cells,</b> <b>as</b> compared with the wild-type HEp- 2 cells.

In mouse N 2 a cells infected with RABV or cotrans-fected with RABV genes encoding nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P), confocal microscopy demonstrated that upregu-lated cellular CCTwas colocalized with viral proteins N and P, which formed a hollow cricoid inclusion within the region around the nucleus. These inclusions, which correspond to Negri bodies (NBs), did not form inmouse N 2 a cells only expressing the viral protein N or P. Knockdown of CCT by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference led to significant inhibition of RABV replication. These results demonstrate that the complex consisting of viral proteins N and P recruits CCT to NBs and identify the chaperonin CCT as a host factor that facilitates intracellular RABV replication. This work illustrates how viruses can utilize cellular chaperonins and compartmentalization for their own benefit. Rabies virus (RABV), the prototype of the Lyssavirus genus, is aneurotropic virus that almost exclusively invades neurons (1) and causes rabies disease that is fatal in almost 100 % of cases. As the oldest known infectious disease, rabies remains incurable bu...|$|R
40|$|The {{details of}} {{oriented}} visual stimuli are better resolved {{when they are}} horizontal or vertical rather than oblique. This “oblique effect ” has been confirmed in numerous behavioral studies in humans {{and to some extent}} in animals. However, investigations of its neural basis have produced mixed and inconclusive results, presumably due in part to limited sample sizes. We have used a database to analyze a population of 4, 418 cells in the cat’s striate cortex to determine possible differences as a function of orientation. We find that both the numbers of cells and the widths of orientation tuning vary as a function of preferred orientation. Specifically, more cells prefer hor-izontal and vertical orientations compared with oblique angles. The largest population of cells is activated by orientations close to hori-zontal. In addition, orientation tuning widths are most narrow for cells preferring horizontal orientations. These findings are most prominent for simple cells tuned to high spatial frequencies. Complex cells and simple cells tuned to low spatial frequencies do not exhibit these anisotropies. For a subset of simple cells from our population (n 104), we examined the relative contributions of linear and nonlinear mechanisms in shaping orientation tuning curves. We find that linear contributions alone do not account for the narrower tuning widths at horizontal orientations. By modeling simple <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> linear filters <b>followed</b> by static expansive nonlinearities, our analysis indicates that horizontally tuned cells have a greater nonlinear component than those tuned to other orientations. This suggests that intracortical mechanisms {{play a major role in}} shaping the oblique effect...|$|R
40|$|Many {{cells are}} mechanoregulated; their {{activities}} are performed {{at a rate}} partly determined by the biophysical stimulus acting on them. Computer simulations that would capture this {{could be used to}} predict the effect of physical exercise on tissue health. They could also be used to simulate how the tissues surrounding a medical device would respond to the placement of that device. Since cells are the actors within tissues, such simulations require models of how cells themselves are mechanoregulated. In this chapter, we review how mechanoregulation simulations may be built up from models in three ways: <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> simple points, <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> multiple points, <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> structures. In particular, a computer simulation method for tissue differentiation using <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> points is also given, and an approach for extending it to include <b>cells</b> <b>as</b> multiple points is presented. <b>Cells</b> <b>as</b> structures {{in the form of a}} hybrid tensegrity-continuum model is presented, and its potential for use in mechanoregulation simulations is discussed...|$|R
