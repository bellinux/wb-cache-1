5|$|On 2 May 2007, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{issued a}} Safety Recommendation {{document}} that included an interim {{summary of the}} investigation to date, {{as well as some}} immediate safety recommendations that the NTSB believes should be implemented by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to enhance flight safety. The NTSB reported that the Embraer apparently experienced a Traffic <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS) outage, unknown to its flight crew prior to the collision, according to the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR):Preliminary findings in the ongoing investigation indicate that, for reasons yet to be determined, the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> in the Legacy airplane was not functioning {{at the time of the}} accident, thereby disabling the system's ability to detect and be detected by conflicting traffic. In addition, CVR data indicate that the flight crew was unaware that the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> was not functioning until after the accident.|$|E
5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, their failure to recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB {{added that}} {{the design of the}} Embraer's {{avionics}} is such that the non-functioning of the TCAS that apparently occurred is shown by a small static white text message, which may not be noticeable by the flight crew. The NTSB noted:Using only static text messages to indicate a loss of <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> functionality is not a reliable means to capture pilots' attention because these visual warnings can be easily overlooked if their attention is directed elsewhere in the flight environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>System</b> (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's transponder had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) was {{conducted}} to evolve the F-16's capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft's worth. The program upgraded the F-16 in three stages. The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion to upgrade 350 F-16s {{while waiting for the}} F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system)</b> to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limits the scope of upgrades, which often involves the addition of more power-hungry avionics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Due to {{historical}} reasons or system development aspects, many high-level control tasks in vehicles are performed by underlying low-level controllers. This separation of concerns provides reliable systems, but potentially degrades the perfor-mance compared to centralized control. Performance losses are acceptable for most control tasks, but for <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> {{one should not}} compromise on safety. We investigate the performance loss for <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> when an underlying yaw stabilization controller is used, {{which can be found}} in many modern vehicles under various product names, such as electronic stability control (ESC). Since electronic stability control differs from vehicle to vehicle, we use an idealized controller that performs better than or equally well as an actual realization. It is shown that central control concepts bypassing the yaw stabilization perform better than a hypothetical controller embedded with the idealized yaw stabilization. We also provide a measure for the performance loss, which should support the decision for or against the use of yaw stabilization in <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems.</b> I...|$|R

25|$|On August 31, 1986, Aeroméxico Flight 498, a DC-9 {{en route}} from Mexico City, Mexico to Los Angeles, began its descent into LAX when a Piper Cherokee {{collided}} with the DC-9's left horizontal stabilizer over Cerritos, California, causing the DC-9 to crash into a residential neighborhood. All 67 people on the two aircraft were killed, in addition to 15 people on the ground. 5 homes were destroyed and an additional 7 were damaged by the crash and resulting fire. The Piper went down in a nearby schoolyard and caused no further injuries on the ground.

25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided with a generous suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), traffic <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>system</b> (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin entry door was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E

50|$|Research into <b>collision</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>systems</b> {{has been}} ongoing {{since at least}} the 1950s. ICAO and {{aviation}} authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration were spurred into action by the Grand Canyon mid-air collision in 1956.|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} interest in actively mitigating safety in vehicles {{beyond that of}} improving crash worthiness. According to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA), {{there are more than}} 40, 000 deaths on highways each year. This number may be decreasing with increasing active public concern and awareness for the use of safety restraints, but the numbers are still in excess of 40, 000 deaths annually. Focusing on crash-worthiness as a measure of safety in vehicles will eventually reach a point of diminishing return, thus {{there is a need for}} automotive manufacturers to shift their safety focus to crash <b>avoidance</b> safety <b>systems</b> (Runge, 2002). In the public domain, significant progress and advancements have been made under the Intelligent Vehicles Initiative (IVI) set up by U. S. Department of Transportation to prevent motor vehicle crashes by assisting drivers in avoiding hazardous mistakes (U. S DOT, 1998). One IVI focus area is facilitating the rapid deployment of <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> (CAS) in vehicles. <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> are a subset of Advanced Vehicle Control Safety Systems (AVCSS) which come under the umbrella of Intelligent Transportation <b>Systems</b> (ITS). These <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> warn drivers of imminent collisions and can potentially help to save lives. Primary directions of research in CAS are determining implementation strategies and technologies in vehicles and roadway infrastructure, as well as optimizing the driving performance of different populations of drivers when using CAS. In CAS implementation, vehicles will communicate with other vehicles as well as with the roadway infrastructure via sensors and telecommunication networks. The data obtained can then be used in <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems.</b> Vehicle-to-vehicle CAS include warnings that trigger when a vehicle is about to collide with another vehicle. Examples include Frontal Warning, Rear Warning and Blind Spot Detection Warnings. Vehicle-to-infrastructure CAS include warnings that trigger when a vehicle is about to have a collision with the roadway infrastructure. Examples include Intersection Warnings, Lane Departure Warnings, Curve Speed Warnings and Road-condition Warnings. Driving in a dynamic environment has become increasingly complex, such that drivers must visually track objects, monitor a constantly changing system, manage system information, to include the explosion of telematics, and make decisions in this dynamic and potentially high mental workload environment. Introducing <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> into vehicles could add to the complexity of this dynamic environment as different drivers will respond differently to <b>Collision</b> <b>Avoidance</b> <b>Systems</b> and there are many critical human factors issues that require investigation.
