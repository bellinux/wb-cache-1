5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This is achieved by the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation,</b> which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
5|$|The right atrium {{receives}} blood almost continuously {{from the}} body's two major veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. A {{small amount of}} blood from the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> also drains into the right atrium via the coronary sinus, which is immediately above and {{to the middle of}} the opening of the inferior vena cava. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. Most of the internal surface of the right atrium is smooth, the depression of the fossa ovalis is medial, and the anterior surface has prominent ridges of pectinate muscles, which are also present in the right atrial appendage.|$|E
25|$|The <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> system {{provides}} a blood {{supply to the}} heart muscle itself.

After nourishing the heart muscle, blood returns through the coronary veins into the coronary sinus and from this one into the right atrium. Back flow of blood through its opening during atrial systole is prevented by the Thebesian valve. The smallest cardiac veins drain directly into the heart chambers.|$|E

25|$|In humans {{there are}} two subtypes of {{melatonin}} receptors targeted by melatonin agonists, MT1 and MT2. They are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body, together or singly. MT1 receptors are expressed in many regions of {{the central nervous system}} (CNS): suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, substantia nigra, cerebellum, central dopaminergic pathways, ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens. MT1 is also expressed in the retina, ovary, testis, mammary gland, <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> and aorta, gallbladder, liver, kidney, skin and the immune system. MT2 receptors are expressed mainly in the CNS, also in the lung, cardiac, coronary and aortic tissue, myometrium and granulosa cells, immune cells, duodenum and adipocytes.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to metabolism, the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> possesses unique pharmacologic characteristics. Prominent among these is its reactivity to adrenergic stimulation. The majority of vasculature {{in the body}} constricts in response to norepinephrine, a sympathetic neurotransmitter that the body uses to increase blood pressure. In the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation,</b> however, norepinephrine vasoconstriction, due to the predominance of beta-adrenergic receptors in the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation.</b> However, metabolic control factors will increase {{as a result of}} increased oxygen demand in the heart and will more greatly influence vasodilation. Thus sympathetic innervation to the coronary arteries ultimately causes vasodilation.|$|E

40|$|Background It {{is known}} that QRS {{duration}} is related to prognosis in acute myocardial infarction. The relation between QRS duration and <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> is uncertain. In the present study, we aimed to determine the relation between QRS duration and <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> in patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. Methods The present study was composed of 109 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction. All patients had total occlusion in the left anterior descending coronary artery. Electrocardiographic recordings on admission were obtained {{for the assessment of}} QRS duration. The Rentrop classification was used to define <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> on <b>coronary</b> angiography. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: Group 1 with poor <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> (Rentrop 0 – 1) and Group 2 with good <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> (Rentrop 2 – 3). Results Of all patients, 62 patients were included in group 1 and 47 patients in group 2, respectively. In the present study, patients in the group 1 had longer QRS duration than patients in the group 2 (p[*]<[*] 0. 005). Additionally, we found that Rentrop grading had negative correlation with both QRS duration and white blood cell count (r: − 0. 28; p[*]<[*] 0. 005 and r: − 0. 35; p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Conclusion Our study showed that there was an inverse relationship between QRS duration on admission and presence of <b>coronary</b> collateral <b>circulation</b> in patients with acute myocardial infarction...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the heart}} is a very aerobic organ, needing oxygen for the {{efficient}} production of ATP & Creatine Phosphate from fatty acids (and to a smaller extent, glucose & very little lactate), the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> is auto regulated so that the heart receives the right flow of blood & hence sufficient supply of oxygen. If a sufficient flow of oxygen is met and the resistance in the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> rises (perhaps due to vasoconstriction), then the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) increases proportionally, to maintain the same flow. In this way, the same flow through the <b>coronary</b> <b>circulation</b> is maintained over a range of pressures. This part of coronary circulatory regulation is known as auto regulation and it occurs over a plateau, reflecting the constant blood flow at varying CPP & resistance. The slope of a CBF (coronary blood flow) vs. CPP graph gives 1/Resistance.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the effects of 17 β-oestradiol on the mesenteric, renal, iliac and <b>coronary</b> <b>circulations</b> and to determine the mechanisms involved. In pigs anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, changes in blood flow in the superior mesenteric, left renal, left external iliac and left circumflex coronary arteries caused by intravenous infusion of 17 β-oestradiol at constant heart rate and arterial pressure were assessed using electromagnetic flowmeters. In eight pigs, infusion of 2 μg h− 1 of the hormone caused an increase in renal, iliac and coronary blood flow without affecting mesenteric blood flow, left ventricular dP/dtmax (rate of change of left ventricular systolic pressure) and filling pressures of the heart. In four pigs, these vasodilator effects were enhanced by graded increases in the dose of the hormone between 1, 2 and 3 μg h− 1; the highest dose also caused an increase in mesenteric blood flow. In five pigs, blockade of muscarinic cholinoceptors and adrenoceptors with the intravenous administration of atropine, propranolol and phentolamine did not affect the vasodilator responses caused by infusion of 2 μg h− 1 of 17 β-oestradiol. The increases in renal, iliac and coronary blood flow caused by infusion of 2 μg h− 1 of 17 β-oestradiol were prevented, respectively, by the injection of Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) into the renal artery (five pigs), the iliac artery (five pigs) or the coronary artery (five pigs). In five pigs, all responses were prevented by injection of L-NAME into all three arteries. In two pigs, injection of L-NAME into the mesenteric, renal, iliac and coronary arteries abolished the vasodilator responses to the infusion of 3 μg h− 1 of 17 β-oestradiol. The present study shows that intravenous infusion of 2 μg h− 1 of 17 β-oestradiol primarily dilated renal, iliac and <b>coronary</b> <b>circulations</b> and that a higher dose of the hormone also caused vasodilatation in the mesenteric vascular bed.
