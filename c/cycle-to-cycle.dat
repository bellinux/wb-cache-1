In this study, high-speed particle image velocimetry (PIV) data was acquired in an optical research engine with varying spatial resolution and dynamically varying time separations between PIV images for optimal velocity dynamic range throughout the engine cycle. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was then used to quantitatively examine the <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> flow variations and intra-cycle flow evolution in these data sets. One of the causes of in-cylinder flow variations was found to be the oscillatory motion of the intake valve during its opening and closing. The scaling of in-cylinder flow with engine speed was also studied by measuring in-cylinder velocities at three different engine speeds. Further, the use of POD as a tool for differentiating between flow patterns in different data sets was demonstrated by comparing experimental data with two different large-eddy simulation data sets. It was found that the level of <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> variability in intake valve oscillations influences in-cylinder flow patterns during the intake stroke.

The combination of an in-cylinder pressure sensor {{together with a}} direct injection fuel system lends itself well for <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> control of the combustion timing. This paper presents a method of controlling the combustion timing {{by the use of}} a <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> injection-timing algorithm. At each cycle the currently estimated heat-release rate is used to predict the in-cylinder pressure change due to a combustion-timing shift. The prediction is then used to obtain a <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> model that relates combustion timing to gross indicated mean effective pressure, max pressure and max pressure derivative. Then the injection timing that controls the combustion timing is decided by solving an optimization problem involving the model obtained.

Controller-performance test results are presented for different controller and model parameter settings at three different operating points. The results show that the controller was consistent in converging to a combustion timing point that was dependent on the magnitude of the modeled heat transfer rate but not necessarily the same as the experimentally found most efficient point. The convergence rate of the controller could be set by varying a design parameter β, which is the controller resistance to changing the injection timing when moving towards a more efficient operating point.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{application}} of <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> control to manufacturing processes, {{the model of the}} process reduces to a gain matrix and a pure delay. For a general multiple input – multiple output process, this matrix shows the degree of influence each input has on each output. For a system of high order, determining this gain matrix requires excessive numbers of experiments to be performed, and thus a simplified, but non-ideal form for the gain matrix must be developed. In this paper, the model {{takes the form of a}} Gaussian distribution with experimentally determined standard deviation and scaling coefficients. Discrete die sheet metal forming, a multiple input-multiple output process with high dimensionality, is chosen as a test application. Results of the prediction capabilities of the Gaussian model, as well as those of two previously existing models, are presented. It is shown that the Gaussian distribution model does the best job of predicting the output for a given input. The model’s invariance over a set of different formed parts is also presented. However, as shown in the companion paper on <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> control, the errors inherent in this model will cause non-ideal performance of the resulting control system.

Spectral line variability is investigated via cross-correlation functions (CCFs) computed using three sets of spectral lines (weak, solar, strong). A metallic line velocity gradient, δv_r (t), is computed as the difference between weak and strong-line RVs. CCF shape indicators BIS (asymmetry), FWHM, and depth all exhibit clear phase-dependent variability patterns that differ from one pulsation cycle to the next. Weak-line CCFs exhibit these effects more clearly than strong-line CCFs. BIS exhibits the most peculiar modulated variability {{and can be used}} to identify the presence of <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> modulated line profile variations. δv_r (t) clearly exhibits <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> differences that correlate very closely with modulated BIS variability, suggesting perturbations of the atmospheric velocity field as the cause for modulated spectral line variability.

There are several empirical relations between various parameters linking cycle's shape and amplitude, in particular the Waldmeier relations. As solar cycle {{is believed to be}} a result of the solar dynamo action, these relations require explanation in the framework of this theory. Here we aim to present a possible explanation of such kind. We relate the <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> variability of solar activity to fluctuations of solar dynamo drivers and primarily to fluctuations in the parameter responsible for recovery of the poloidal magnetic field from the toroidal one. To be specific, we develop such a model in the framework of the mean-field dynamo based on the differential rotation and α-effect. We demonstrate that the mean-field dynamo based on a realistic rotation curve and nonlinearity associated with the magnetic helicity balance reproduces both qualitatively and quantitatively the Waldmeier relations observed in sunspot data since 1750 (SIDC data). The model also reproduces more or less successfully other relations between the parameters under discussion, in particular, the link between odd and even cycles (Gnevyshev-Ohl rule).

For each work cycle, we calculated the average and standard deviation of the upper arm elevation angle and the activity of the trapezius and deltoid muscles, as well as the angular peak velocity. We summarized these seven variables by calculating averages across cycles and <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> variabilities. Results: At 30 ° arm elevation, pace significantly influenced within-cycle angle variation, <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> variability of the average angle, angular peak velocity, and <b>cycle-to-cycle</b> variability of peak velocity.
