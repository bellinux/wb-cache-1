5|$|After the {{revolution}} broke out, the revolt's leaders chose Sun Yat Sen as provisional president of {{what became the}} Republic of China, overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty, Taft was reluctant to recognize the new government, although American public opinion {{was in favor of}} it. The U.S. House of Representatives in February 1912 passed a resolution supporting a Chinese republic, but Taft and Knox felt recognition should come as a <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> by Western powers. Taft in his final annual message to Congress in December 1912 indicated that he was moving towards recognition once the republic was fully established, but by then he had been defeated for re-election and he did not follow through.|$|E
5|$|To {{disrupt the}} {{preparations}} of this army, the British Royal Navy, which had controlled {{most of the}} Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of Lissa in 1807 and {{used it as a}} base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region. To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly Venice, and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore Bernard Dubourdieu's Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under William Hoste to a <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.|$|E
5|$|During the 1900 season, Fry {{was once}} more no-balled at the {{beginning}} of June, this time by William West. The <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> against throwing reached a peak when Phillips umpired the match between Nottinghamshire and Lancashire in Nottingham on 26 June. Early on the first morning of the three-day match, Mold came on to bowl when Nottinghamshire had scored 34. In Mold's first over, Phillips twice no-balled him for throwing. Lancashire's captain, Archie MacLaren, withdrew Mold from the bowling attack {{at the end of the}} over and he did not bowl again in the match. However, MacLaren later defended Mold in the press. The match reports in both The Times and Wisden commented that Mold had been lucky never to be no-balled before in his career; he was the most high-profile bowler to be called in the Phillips-led crackdown on bowling actions. Mold played another nine times in 1900 without being called for throwing, but he did not play in any of the Lancashire matches umpired by Phillips. Later in the season, Phillips called the Somerset bowler Ted Tyler. By the end of the season, Mold had taken 97 wickets at 14.01.|$|E

40|$|This article {{expands the}} {{existing}} {{body of knowledge}} of manufacturing strategy research as it highlights the influence of context factors on manufacturing strategy content. A sound theoretical foundation is given for the proposition that context factors not only influence competitive priorities but as well the second dimension, the action programs. Whereas various studies showed that companies are in need to compete on multiple competitive priorities simultaneously, research is {{needed in order to}} understand how these requirements can be successfully implemented. We find that while the competition on multiple competitive priorities can lead to trade-offs, <b>concerted</b> <b>actions</b> help to minimize the negative effects and can lead to a strong market position. However, the <b>concerted</b> <b>actions</b> have to be aligned to context factors as this influence the success of the action program. Therefore, context factors not only influence the requirement to compete on multiple competitive priorities but define as well which actions are needed in order to gain a strong market position.

25|$|When {{reduced demand}} and {{increased}} production glutted {{the world market}} in the mid-1980s, oil prices plummeted and the cartel lost its unity. Mexico (a non-member), Nigeria, and Venezuela, whose economies had expanded in the 1970s, faced near-bankruptcy, and even Saudi Arabian economic power was significantly weakened. The divisions within OPEC made <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> more difficult. As of 2015, OPEC had never approached its earlier dominance.|$|E
25|$|This chromatographic process {{relies on}} the {{property}} of biologically active substances to form stable, specific, and reversible complexes. The formation of these complexes involves the participation of common molecular forces such as the Van der Waals interaction, electrostatic interaction, dipole-dipole interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and the hydrogen bond. An efficient, biospecific bond is formed by a simultaneous and <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> of several of these forces in the complementary binding sites.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, Lewis {{was one of}} the signatories to a call {{published}} in the New York Herald for a National Conference on Lynching, intended to take <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> against the widespread practice of lynching and lawlessness in primarily Southern states. Lynching had reached what is now seen as a peak in the South {{around the turn of the}} century, the period when those states imposed white supremacy. In the summer of 1919, after Lewis' speech, the economic and social tensions of the postwar years erupted in numerous white racial attacks against blacks in northern and midwestern cities where blacks had migrated by the thousands and were competing with recent European immigrants; it was called Red Summer.|$|E
25|$|Pacific Coast Women's Press Association (PCWPA; September 27, 1890 - 1941) was a press {{organization}} for women located on the West Coast of the United States. The purpose of this association was primarily {{to bring about a}} more extensive acquaintance among newspaper women, so that by the frequent interchange of ideas and methods, <b>concerted</b> <b>action</b> could be brought about matters of vital public import. Discussions were not permitted of any partisan movements on the subjects of politics, religion, or reform. The members of the association took on causes related to certain public improvements in the way of roads, streets, parks, libraries, village improvement societies, free exhibits of county resources, the suppression of criminal details of sensational cases in newspapers, the suppression of criminal advertising, the development of the kindergartens — things that tended to the building up of the country. To facilitate the work, the association issued printed monographs.|$|E

25|$|Civil {{rights activists}} {{tried to work}} through the {{barriers}} to register African-American voters and enable them to vote. In the summer of 1963, from July through August, activists of the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE) came to Plaquemines Parish to run a voter registration drive for African Americans. About 45 members, both black and white, came to work in the parish and organize local people for voter registration classes, peaceful marches, and drives to register. In a short time, 300 CORE activists and local people were arrested for peaceful protest, but CORE leaders negotiated with the local sheriff and mayor to permit some actions. After training and <b>concerted</b> <b>action,</b> a number of local African Americans did succeed in registering to vote, although many were still prevented, on largely specious grounds for failing to answer questions about the state constitution. The movement also worked to get Seymourville and another small community included within the city boundaries; the city was trying to exclude these majority-black communities from being incorporated in order to prevent black votes from being counted for election of the city commission. Voting rights work took place in other nearby parishes as well; in October an African-American man was the first of his race to register to vote in West Feliciana Parish since the early years following disenfranchisement.|$|E
