40|$|The salient {{features}} of a Stirling-type Pulse Tube Refrigerator (PTR) are its compactness, low vibration, high frequency of operation, and longevity. The flow in the pulse tube is complex because of its oscillatory nature. The flow pattern {{plays an important role}} in the performance of the pulse tube. Various design parameters like dimensions of the pulse tube, the regenerator, and operating parameters like pressure and frequency affect pulse tube performance. The cold end heat exchanger forms the most important component of the PTR, as the cooling effect is distributed from this component. This paper evaluates the experimental performance of a PTR for different configurations of the cold end heat exchanger in terms of cool down curve, lowest temperature reached, and cooling power at 80 K. The performance of the PTR is studied using a stack of coarse <b>copper</b> <b>meshes</b> in the cold heat exchanger. A similar investigation is carried out by replacing the meshes with a tapered finned copper block in order to get better heat transfer at the cold end. The results show a substantial improvement in the performance of the PTR. It is also found that the optimum frequency gets affected by such changes. In another system, the study is extended to investigate the effect of tapering the cold end heat exchanger using coarse <b>copper</b> <b>meshes.</b> The included taper angle is varied, and its effect on the performance of the PTR is studied...|$|R

Because copper brushes have the same hardness as the commutator segments, the rotor cannot be spun backwards against the ends of copper brushes without the copper digging into the segments and causing severe damage.

For diagnostic purposes solid tissues are prepared for TEM in the same way as other biological tissues, they are fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide then dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. The epoxy resin block is trimmed and the target tissue is selected using a light microscope by viewing semithin sections stained with toluidine blue. The block is then retrimmed and the specific area for observation is ultrathin sectioned, preferably using a diamond knife. The ultrathin sections are collected on 3mm <b>copper</b> (<b>mesh)</b> grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to make the contents of the tissue electron dense (and thus visible in the electron microscope).|$|E

5000|$|Ruth Vollmer (1903 - 1982 New York City), was a German artist born in Munich. She {{was born}} in 1903 and named Ruth Landshoff. Her father, Ludwig Landshoff, was a musicologist and {{conductor}} and her mother, Phillipine Landshoff, was an opera singer. Their family was Jewish. At age 19 she began to work {{as an artist and}} took the advice of her father to draw every day. She also had many connections to the teachers and students at the Bauhaus. In 1930 she married a pediatrician named Hermann Vollmer, whom she met in Berlin. Ruth and Hermann move from Germany to New York in 1935. Ruth begins work designing window displays for Bonwit Teller, Tiffany's, Lord & Taylor, and other department stores. Her displays experimented with wire, steel, and <b>copper</b> <b>mesh</b> to create figural forms. In 1943, Vollmer becomes a U.S. citizen. In 1944 she receives a commission from the Museum of Modern Art for its fifteenth anniversary exhibition, [...] "Art in Progress." [...] Vollumer continues to work with wire mesh and shows her work Composition in Space at the Museum of Modern Art's 1948 exhibition [...] "Elements of Stage Design." [...] In 1950, she was commissioned to create a mural for the lobby of 575 Madison, where Vollmer created a large wall relief that used wire rods and wire mesh to play with light, texture, and transparency. Vollumer visits Giacometti for a second time during the summer of 1951. During the 1950s she begins to works with clay as well. Additionally, in 1954 she begins to teach at the Children's Art Center at the Fieldston School in Riverdale and continued to teach until the mid-sixties. In 1960, Vollmer participates in the NYU discussion series [...] "Artists on Art" [...] with her friend Robert Motherwell. 1960 is an important year because she also has her first one-person exhibition at Betty Parson's Section Eleven gallery space. Throughout the 1960s Vollmer works with bronze and as well as showing at Betty Parson's gallery several times. In 1963, she joins the group American Abstract Artists (AAA) and includes her work in their exhibitions from 1963 on. By 1970 Vollmer's art is working with complex geometrical forms and mathematical concepts, particularly spirals and platonic solids. Sol LeWitt wrote a short essay on Vollmer's work for Studio International titled [...] "Ruth Vollmer: Mathematical Forms." [...] Vollmer protests the cancellation of the Hans Haacke at The Solomon R. Guggenheim exhibition by writing a letter to the director, Thomas Messer, in 1971. In 1976, she had a large one-person exhibition at the Neuberger Museum of Art. In 1982, Ruth Vollmer dies after a long battle with Alzheimer's. A majority of her large personal art collection of over one hundred sculptures, paintings, and drawings is donated to MoMA. Her art collection included works by Carl Andre, Mel Bochner, Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Ad Reinhardt, Frank Stella, Agnes Martin, and Chryssa.|$|E
40|$|Spray cooling {{has proven}} to be {{efficient}} in managing thermal load in high power applications. Reliability of electronic products lies on the thermal management and understanding of heat transfer mechanisms of the most commonly used thermal management schemes such as spray cooling. Many experiments have been done to understand the heat transfer mechanisms associated with spray cooling. However, most of them have relied on comprehensive spray cooling experiments where multiple physical variables are at play simultaneously. Furthermore, experiments with single streams of droplets {{have not been able to}} elucidate the effects of the onset of boiling (ONB) during the droplet impingement process. Therefore, efforts have been undertaken to consider the effects of using three droplet streams arranged in a triangulated fashion. The effects of using triangulated multiple droplet impingements on the suppression or enhancement of boiling on heated surfaces has been investigated. Moreover, the effects of using screen laminated on the suppression of ONB during the droplet impingement process has been studied in detail. The main goal of this project is to study the effects of multiple droplet impingement on the flat heater surface in the spray cooling with and without the use of metallic screen laminates. Single and triple droplet impingement experiments have been performed to understand the droplet behavior in spray cooling systems where multiple droplets simultaneously impact a heated surface. The experiments consisted of using a stainless steel screen laminate over a sample surface to observe the suppression or enhancement of pool boiling which tends to occur at the periphery of each droplet impingement zone. An infrared-based imaging technique was used to measure surface temperature during droplet impingement. The heat transfer performance has been evaluated in terms of heat flux, droplet frequency and volume flow rate. The results indicate that droplet stream spacing and the use of <b>copper</b> <b>meshes</b> can enhance surface cooling significantly. Specifically, droplet stream spacing of 1000 ?m with <b>copper</b> <b>meshes</b> with a 6 mm hole and gap of 0. 2 mm lead to enhanced surface cooling during the multiple droplet impingement process. It is expected that the results and conclusions of this study will be useful in understanding the physics of spray cooling which should help design better spray cooling system...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the mechanism of enhanced absorption intensities of vibrational bands of adsorbates on <b>copper</b> <b>meshes</b> with subwavelength holes by measuring and simulating temporal profiles of infrared pulses transmitted through the meshes. As reported previously [Williams et al., J. Phys. Chem. B, 2003, 107, 11871], the absorption intensities of CH stretching bands of alkanethiolate adsorbed on the mesh increase substantially with decreasing hole size. The enhancements of absorption intensities are associated with temporal delays of infrared pulses transmitted through the mesh. Finite difference time domain calculations reproduce the observed pulse delays {{as a function of}} hole size. These facts indicate that the delays of transmitted pulses are not caused by coupling of infrared radiation to surface plasmon polaritons propagating on the front and rear surfaces of the mesh, but they are caused by the reduction in group velocity owing to coupling to waveguide modes of mesh holes. Consequently, the strong enhancements of the absorption intensities are attributed to adsorbates inside the holes rather than to those on the mesh surfaces that have been proposed previously...|$|R
