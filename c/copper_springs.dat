40|$|To miniaturize piezoresistive {{barometric}} pressure sensors {{we have developed}} a package using flip-chip bonding. However, in a standard flip-chip package the different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of chip and substrate and strong mechanical coupling by the solder bumps would lead to stress in the sensor chip which is not acceptable for piezoresistive pressure sensors. To overcome this problem we have developed a new ultra low stress flip-chip packaging technology. In this new packaging technology for pressure sensors first an under bump metallization (UBM) is patterned on the sensor wafer. As the next step solder bumps are deposited.

40|$|Previous studies {{into the}} {{possibility}} of a plasmonic medium of a coiled conductor array in air have shown promise. This work serves to evaluate {{the possibility of}} creating a mechanically-tunable composite filter at low frequencies. <b>Copper</b> <b>springs</b> were created with varying starting pitches using a coil winder. These springs were then embedded into a flexible host polymer. The mechanical and electromagnetic properties of each spring design were predicted and tested. Two horn antennas were used to characterize the overall electromagnetic (EM) properties of the composite. The pitch of each spring was increased mechanically through application of force to the entire polymer-metal composite at equal intervals, with an EM test completed at each step. Using an Agilent 8510 C Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), the frequency spectrum within the microwave range was scanned. Relative amplitude and phase measurements were taken at equal frequency and pitch steps. With no polymer surrounding the springs, plasmon turn-on frequencies were observed to span the microwave bands as the pitch of the springs were increased. Similar results are expected with the springs embedded in a polymeric matrix. These results suggest a method of creating a mechanically-tunable composite filter for use at low frequencies...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} miniaturize piezoresistive {{barometric}} pressure sensors, a new flip-chip packaging {{technology has been}} developed. The thermal expansions of chip and package are different. So in a standard flip-chip package the strong mechanical coupling by the solder bumps would lead to stress in the sensor chip, which is unacceptable for piezoresistive pressure sensors. To solve this problem, in the new packaging technology the chip is flip-chip bonded on compliant springs to decouple chip and package. As {{the first step of}} the packaging process an under bump metallization (UBM) is patterned on the sensor wafer. Then solder bumps are printed. After wafer-dicing the chips are flip-chip bonded on <b>copper</b> <b>springs</b> within a ceramic cavity housing. Due to the compliance of the springs, packaging stress is induced into the sensor chip. As sources of residual stress the UBM and the solder bumps on the sensor chip were identified. Different coefficients of thermal expansion of the sil icon chip, the UBM and the solder lead to plastic straining of the aluminum metallization between UBM and chip. As a consequence the measurement accuracy is limited by a temperature hysteresis. The influence of the chip geometry, e. g., the thickness of the chip or the depth of the cavity, on the hysteresis was investigated by simulation and measurements. As a result of this investigation a sensor chip was designed with very low residual stress and a temperature hysteresis which is only slightly larger than the noise of the sensor...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{dielectric}} elastomer actuators (DEAs) {{have been}} widely used in soft robots and artificial bio-medical applications. Most DEAs are composed of a thin dielectric elastomer layer sandwiched between two compliant electrodes. DEAs vary in their design to provide bending, torsional, and stretch/contraction motions under the application of high external voltages. Most compliant electrodes are made of carbon powders or thin metallic films. In situations involving large deformations or improper fabrication, the electrodes are susceptible to breakage and increased resistivity. The worst cases result in a loss of conductivity and functional failure. In this study, we developed a method by which to exploit stretchable metallic springs as compliant electrodes for cylindrical DEAs. This design was inspired by the extensibility of mechanical springs. The main advantage of this approach {{is the fact that the}} metallic spring-like compliant electrodes remain conductive and do not increase the stiffness as the tube-like DEAs elongate in the axial direction. This can be attributed to a reduction in thickness in the radial direction. The proposed cylindrical structure is composed of highly-stretchable VHB 4905 film folded within a hollow tube and then sandwiched between <b>copper</b> <b>springs</b> (inside and outside) to allow for stretching and contraction in the axial direction under the application of high DC voltages. We fabricated a prototype and evaluated the mechanical and electromechanical properties of the device experimentally using a high-voltage source of 9. 9 kV. This device demonstrated a non-linear increase in axial stretching with an increase in applied voltage, reaching a maximum extension of 0. 63 mm (axial strain of 2. 35 %) at applied voltage of 9. 9 kV. Further miniaturization and the incorporation of compressive springs are expected to allow the implementation of the proposed method in soft micro-robots and bio-mimetic applications...|$|E

40|$|In {{the range}} of milliwatt to a few watts cooling capacity, Stirling cycle and pulse tube coolers are most {{suitable}} for producing cryogenic temperatures owing to their eco-friendliness, high efficiency, cooling capacity to mass ratio etc. The compressor of a Stirling cooler {{is powered by a}} linear motor. The power piston of the cooler is held in position and moves to and fro with the support of so called flexure springs or flexure bearings. Flexures avoid direct contact between moving parts of the compressor of the cooler. Thus, if designed adequately to withstand fatigue, flexure bearings can easily outlast rolling element bearings and slider bearings. In this work, a computational analysis is used to study the performance of flexure spring by varying the geometrical parameters. Three of the most common spring materials namely, SS 304, beryllium <b>copper</b> and <b>spring</b> steel are considered for analysis. The analysis was made by varying the parameters like spiral sweep angle, slot width, number of spirals and disc thickness. The influence of each of these parameters on the fatigue life of the spring has been investigated.

40|$|International audienceCopper {{sulphate}} {{treatment is}} widely used as a global and empirical method to remove or control phytoplankton blooms without precise description of the impact on phytoplanktonic populations. The effects of two copper sulphate treatments on natural phytoplanktonic communities sampled {{in the spring and}} summer seasons, were assessed by indoor mesocosm experiments. The initial copper-complexing capacity of each water sample was evaluated before each treatment. The copper concentrations applied were 80 g l− 1 and 160 g l− 1 of copper, below and above the water complexation capacity, respectively. The phytoplanktonic biomass recovered within a few days after treatment. The highest copper concentration, which generated a highly toxic environment, caused a global decrease in phytoplankton diversity, and led to the development and dominance of nanophytoplanktonic Chlorophyceae. In mesocosms treated with 80 µg l− 1 of copper, the effect on phytoplanktonic community size-class structure and compositionwas dependent on seasonal variation. This could be related to differences in community composition, and thus to species sensitivity to copper and to differences in <b>copper</b> bioavailability between <b>spring</b> and summer.

Currently, copper sprays are used to manage the disease, however, the effectiveness of copper sprays in protecting pruning cuts is unknown. Leaving a 15 -cm-long pruning stub to manage the lethal canker phase of the disease has shown promise. The occurrence of copper-resistant bacteria and negative impacts of copper on soils underscore the need for research. We studied the effectiveness of <b>spring</b> <b>copper</b> sprays and the pruning stub in preventing canker infection. Neither copper nor pruning stubs prevented infection of inoculated and uninoculated pruning cuts.

50|$|This is the 'classic' Mamod {{model and}} has been in {{production}} with minor updates and modifications for nearly 50 years. It is a model of a typical traction engine with a full-length canopy. The engine itself is an oscillating-cylinder unit, the same as the SR1/a which is based on the old MM2 unit. The boiler is longer than that on the SR1 although it is the same volume internally. The front part is an empty void into which, in the earlier versions, the exhaust steam was fed through the choke (it controlled the exiting steam not the inlet steam). The TE1a differs from the TE1 in having a reversing lever to control the speed and direction of the model, initially used on the MEC1 of 1965 and subsequently applied to the TE in 1967, whereas the TE1 was unidirectional only with an exhaust 'choke' to control the speed. The TE1 was claimed to cover a third of a mile in ten minutes on a single filling. Power is delivered to the back axle by means of a drive band running from a small pulley on the flywheel to the rim of one of the back wheels. This can be removed to allow the engine to run stationary or to drive a lineshaft and tools. The front axle of the model is mounted on a central pivot with a simple <b>copper</b> stub <b>spring</b> which provides a crude form of suspension. It is also steerable, by means of a shaft running from the axle up inside the chimney (later models post 67). Early models did not use the later control rod for steering but used a rod mounted directly into a hole in the early model square axle box. Both designs could be screwed down to lock the wheels in a fixed position. A control rod can be attached to the top of this shaft with a wooden handle on top to allow the operator to steer the model as it moves. The TE1/A has a green boiler (this green has varied over the years from apple green to a dark brunswick green, similar to GWR locomotives), red spoked wheels and flywheel, a white/cream coloured canopy and a black firebox/smokebox/chimney. It is also available in a distinctive alternative paint scheme, with a polished brass boiler and maroon wheels. Other limited edition models have been produced in the last decade using blue or black paint work as well of variations of the colours mentioned already.|$|R

Approach: Revisit every spring that was recorded previously to ascertain the current status, water quality and zooplankton communities. Results: fourteen springs out of forty six were still flowing. Several springs in the Eastern Province were structurally changed into manmade pools. Also, one new spring was located and documented in the northwestern region. Zinc and <b>copper</b> in several <b>springs</b> were the common dissolved heavy metals and have had exceeded {{the safe drinking water}} standards according to World Health Organization. Fourteen zooplankton taxa was found, seven belonged to phylum Rotifera (four Lecane spp. and three brachionids). Six belonged to subclasses Phyllopoda and Copepoda. The phyllopod, Pleuroxus sp., belongs to suborder Cladocera. The remaining five were copepods: one in the order Cyclopoida (Halicyclops sp.) and four in the order Harpacticoida (Bryocamptus sp., Schizopera sp., Euterpina sp. and Metis sp.). The remaining taxon was an unidentified species belonging to class Ostracoda. Zooplankton species were present in nine of the fifteen springs; the exceptions were Umm Al-Eyal, Abu-Dhuba and the four geothermal springs.

Ten field stations along the whole freshwater–seawater mixing zone were sampled each month. Different biogeochemical parameters (SPM, chl-a, pH and DOC) were also measured. The levels in total dissolved and total particulate copper ranged from 1. 8 to 9. 5 nM and from 5 to 98 μg g− 1, respectively; such amounts are indicative of a pollution-free system. Extractable C 18 copper (non-polar hydrophobic organic copper species), in winter and spring, accounted for 30 – 40 % of the total dissolved copper. In summer, this contribution rapidly rose to 60 % in the salinity range 20 – 30; {{over the same period}} of time, total particulate copper decreased. The change in dissolved copper speciation and the lowering of particulate copper concentrations were attributed to the release of strong organic ligands by phytoplankton. Our field data evidenced a highly variable behaviour for the various copper species over the seasonal cycle, and then led us to identify the following mechanisms: (i) metal desorption from organic river-flown particles (winter and spring), (ii) metal desorption from resuspended sediment in the upstream section (summer), (iii) competition between particles, non-extractable C 18 organic ligands and phytoplankton-released extractable C 18 organic ligands to complex copper in the downstream section (summer), and (iv) removal of non-extractable C 18 organic copper by adsorption (autumn).

In the large towns and cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole.

I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax, the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage's. An annual rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars (these are the country rates) entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fire-place, back plastering, Venetian blinds, <b>copper</b> pump, <b>spring</b> lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things. But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of man--and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their advantages--it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborer's life, even if he is not encumbered with a family--estimating the pecuniary value of every man's labor at one dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;--so that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms? ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{the demand}} of {{renewable}} energy is dramatically increased. From the waste of vibration that produced from mechanical system or human being movement, Electromagnetic Energy Harvester (EEH) can generate electricity. EEH is proposed in this thesis which generates electricity from mechanical energy when embedded in a vibration medium. The objectives of the thesis are to analyze the generated voltage and to investigate {{the performance of the}} vibration electromagnetic energy harvester for different number of turn coil. A one dimension model was built based on the principle of a spring mass system to convert energy of vibration into electrical energy. It has been designed and fabricated, in which it consists of a permanent magnet Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB), a <b>copper</b> coil, a <b>spring</b> and a plastic bottle to turn coil. The minigenerator is made from a coil of wire (about 400 - 1200 turns) wound around the outside of a plastic 25 mm diameter of bottle. The two coil ends are connected to PicosCope software. A magnet is then placed in the bottle with spring where the spring was assembled with the polystyrene base. An EEH was tested by excite the shaker based on the setup of shaker. Because of the resonant frequency, minigenerator generated voltage and directly stores the voltage in the circuit to generate electricity. Analysis predicts that the generated voltage is proportional to the number of turn. As expected, results show that the output voltage increase with increasing number of turns with 74. 96033 mV at 100 Hz, 107. 6059 mV at 100 Hz and 120. 4737 mV at 100 Hz being generated from the 400, 800 and 1200 turn coils respectively. Moreover, to maximize voltage generation, the magnet size and number of turn coil should be as large as possible. Application of EEH is for fabricating Microelectromechanical system (MEMS). MEMS is the integration of mechanical elements, sensor and electronics on a common substrate through the utilization of microfabrication technology (microtechnology) ...|$|R
40|$|Metals {{transport}} in the Sacramento River, northern California, from July 1996 to June 1997 {{was evaluated}} {{in terms of}} metal loads from sam-ples of water and suspended colloids that were collected on up to six occasions at 13 sites in the Sacramento River Basin. Four of the sampling periods (July, September, and November 1996; and May–June 1997) took place during relatively low-flow conditions and two sampling periods (December 1996 and January 1997) took place during high-flow and flooding conditions, respec-tively. This study focused primarily on loads of cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc, with secondary emphasis on loads of aluminum, iron, and mercury. Trace metals in acid mine drainage from abandoned and inactive base-metal mines, in the East and West Shasta mining districts, enter the Sacramento River system in predominantly dis-solved form into both Shasta Lake and Keswick Reservoir. The proportion of trace metals that was dissolved (as opposed to colloidal) in samples collected at Shasta and Keswick dams decreased in the order zinc ≈ cadmium 3 ̆e copper 3 ̆e lead. At four sampling sites on the Sacramento River— 71, 256, 360, and 412 kilometers downstream of Keswick Dam—trace-metal loads were predomi-nantly colloidal during both high- and low-flow conditions. The proportion of total cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc loads transported to San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta estuary (referred to as the Bay–Delta) {{that is associated with}} mineralized areas was estimated by dividing loads at Keswick Dam by loads 412 kilometers downstream at Freeport and the Yolo Bypass. During moderately high flows in December 1996, mineralization-related total (dissolved + colloidal) trace-metal loads to the Bay–Delta (as a percentage of total loads meas-ured downstream) were cadmium, 87 percent; copper, 35 percent; lead, 10 percent; and zinc, 51 percent. During flood conditions in January 1997 loads were cadmium, 22 percent; copper, 11 percent; lead, 2 percent; and zinc, 15 percent. During irrigation drainage season from rice fields (May–June 1997) loads were cadmium, 53 percent; copper, 42 percent; lead, 20 percent; and zinc, 75 percent. These estimates must be qualified by the following factors: (1) metal loads at Colusa in December 1996 and at Verona in May–June 1997 generally exceeded those determined at Freeport during those sampling periods. Therefore, the above percentages represent maximum estimates of the apparent total proportion of metals from mineralized areas upstream of Keswick Dam; and (2) for logistics reasons, the Sacramento River was sampled at Tower Bridge instead of at Freeport during January 1997. Available data suggest that trace metal loads from agricultural drainage may be significant during certain flow conditions in areas where metals such as copper and zinc are added as agri-cultural amendments. Copper loads for sampling periods in July and September 1996 and in May– June 1997 show increases of dissolved and colloidal copper and in colloidal zinc between Colusa and Verona, the reach of the Sacramento River along which the Colusa Basin Drain, the Sacramento Slough, and other agricultural return flows are tributaries. Monthly sampling of these two agricultural drains by the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment Program shows seasonal variations in metal concentrations, reaching maximum concentrations of 4 to 6 micrograms per liter in “dissolved” (0. 45 -micrometer filtrate) copper concentrations in May 1996, December 1996, and June 1997. The total (dissolved plus colloidal) load of copper from the Colusa Basin Drain in June 1997 was 18 kilograms per day, whereas the <b>copper</b> load in <b>Spring</b> Creek, which drains the inactive mines on Iron Mountain, was 20 kilograms per day during the same sampling period. For comparison, during the January 1997 flood, the <b>copper</b> load in <b>Spring</b> Creek was about 1, 100 kilograms per day and the copper load in the Yolo Bypass was about 7, 300 kilograms per day. The data clearly indicate that most copper and zinc loads during the January 1997 flood entered the Sacramento River up-stream of Colusa, and upstream of the influence of the most intense agricultural drainage return flows in the Sacramento River watershed. This study has demonstrated that some trace metals of environmental significance (cadmium, copper, and zinc) in the Sacramento River are transported largely in dissolved form at upstream sites (below Shasta Dam, below Keswick Dam, and at Bend Bridge) proximal to the mineralized areas of the West Shasta and East Shasta mining districts. In contrast, these trace metals are transported largely in colloidal form at downstream sites (Colusa, Verona, Freeport, and Yolo Bypass). Aluminum, iron, and lead were observed to be transported predominantly in the colloidal phase at all mainstem Sacramento River sampling sites during all sampling periods in this study. Despite continuous water treatment, which has removed 85 to 90 percent of the cadmium, copper, and zinc from the mine drainage at Iron Mountain, Spring Creek remains a significant source of these metals to the Sacramento River system...|$|R
40|$|Soft wax scale (SWS) Ceroplastes {{destructor}} (Newstead) and Chinese wax scale (CWS) C. sinensis Del Guercio (Hemiptera: Coccidae) are indirect pests {{of citrus}} (Citrus spp.) in New Zealand. Honeydew they produce supports sooty mould fungi that disfigure fruit and reduce photosynthesis and fruit yield. Presently, control relies on calendar applications of insecticides. The main {{aim of this}} study was to provide the ecological basis for the integrated management of SWS and CWS. Specific objectives were to compare their population ecologies, determine major mortality factors and levels of natural control, quantify the impact of ladybirds on scale populations, and evaluate pesticides for compatibility with ladybirds. Among 57 surveyed orchards, SWS was more abundant than CWS in Kerikeri but was not found around Whangarei. Applications of organophosphates had not reduced the proportion of orchards with medium or high densities of SWS. Monthly destructive sampling of scale populations between November 1990 and February 1994 was supplemented by in situ counts of scale cohorts. Both species were univoltine, but SWS eggs hatched two months earlier than those of CWS, and development between successive instars remained two to three months ahead. The start of SWS crawler emergence varied by seven weeks between 1988 - 1993. A linear relationship between scale size and fecundity was found for both species. The variation in mean scale size amongst orchards corresponded to large differences in egg production. Survivorship curves and life tables were compared between populations with high and low levels of ladybird predation. Over 90 % of crawlers failed to settle. At four orchards with high numbers of ladybirds, 99 % of settled first and second instar scales died. The key mortality factor occurred at this stage where ladybirds were abundant. In contrast, where ladybirds were scarce, mortality of first and second instar scales was approximately 82 % and some scales survived to breed. Mortality of third instar and adult scales was approximately 80 % and 50 % respectively. Parasitised scales were incubated and parasitoids identified from emerged adults. Diseased scales were cultured to identify fungal entomopathogens. One primary and one secondary parasitoid (Euxanthellus philippiae Silvestri and Coccidoctonus dub ius (Girault) respectively) and two fungal pathogens (Verticillium lecanii (Zimmermann) Viegas and Fusarium spp.) attacked one or both of these stages of SWS and CWS. Parasitoids and pathogens each caused less than 30 % mortality. Density-dependent mortality was not shown by any of the natural enemies. The effect of ladybirds on scale populations was assessed by sampling and experiments where branches and trees were covered to exclude or include ladybirds. Ladybirds predated first and second instar scales and could reduce local scale populations to extinction. Both larval and adult steel blue ladybirds (SBL) Halmus chalybeus (Boisduval), Rhyzobius forestieri (Mulsant), and adult Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Rodolia cardinalis (Mulsant) fed on SWS in laboratory experiments. Adult SBL and R. forestieri consumed approximately 15 scales per day in the field. SBL comprised 98 % of ladybirds in visual and manual searches. Pesticides were screened for toxicity to SBL by a slide dip method, and for disruption to predation by the reduction in feeding on treated leaves. Fungicides and insecticides inhibited feeding by SBL and reduced their numbers. Copper-based fungicides reduced predation by about 80 % compared with approximately 30 % by non-copper fungicides. Buprofezin was non-toxic and non-disruptive to SBL. Mineral oils were moderately toxic but caused some disruption to predation. Organophosphates, synthetic pyrethroids and an insecticidal soap were highly toxic to SBL at recommended label rates. Three fungicides were evaluated in an orchard. Both copper and non-copper fungicides reduced numbers of ladybirds. Nine-spray programmes reduced numbers more than 5 -spray programmes. SWS were more abundant than CWS probably in part because their phenology made them less vulnerable to adverse environmental conditions and ladybirds. Currently, SBL are the key to biological control of SWS and CWS, but with present spray programmes particularly those involving organophosphates, ladybirds cannot be relied on to be sufficiently abundant at the right time of year to achieve control. Orchardists should avoid or reduce applications of <b>copper</b> fungicides during <b>spring</b> and summer to minimise disruption to predation of SWS by ladybirds. The introduction of parasitoids such as those which control SWS in South Mrica and Australia would complement the existing biocontrol from ladybirds and should be investigated...|$|R
