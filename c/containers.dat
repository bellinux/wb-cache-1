5|$|The Jif plastic <b>containers</b> were {{originally}} made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded <b>containers</b> used for food applications. The plastic <b>containers</b> served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E

A soil sample filter <b>container</b> is suspended within the <b>container</b> above the bottom portion thereof. A condensation element is mounted in the closed <b>container</b> and positioned above the filter <b>container</b> to cause gas evaporating from the liquid in the <b>container</b> to liquefy as condensate on the condensation element, whereupon the condensate drips into the filter <b>container</b> and leaches through a soil sample therein, and then collects as a liquid in the bottom portion of the closed <b>container.</b> This permits a hydrocarbon residue to {{be left in the}} bottom portion of the <b>container</b> after the outlet valve has been opened to permit the liquid to evaporate...|$|R

In 2001, China {{has become the}} member of the World Trade Organisation, which will boost up the volume of {{international}} trade and demand for <b>container</b> services in China. Hong Kong <b>container</b> port is a transit hub in Southeast Asia and therefore its <b>container</b> throughput is expected to be increased in a large extent. However, Shenzhen <b>container</b> port, which is the nearest <b>container</b> port to Hong Kong, has a dramatic growth in the same period that its <b>container</b> throughput has been increased from 5 million TEUs in 2001 to over 10 million TEUs in 2003. There is a concern that <b>container</b> business has shifted from Hong Kong <b>container</b> port to Shenzhen <b>container</b> port. Therefore, a survey is conducted in <b>container</b> industry in Hong Kong to investigate whether shippers have shifted to using Shenzhen <b>container</b> port owing to its competitive advantage, such as lower terminal charge and its proximity to the Mainland China. Simultaneously, this survey has investigated whether shipper keeps on using Hong Kong <b>container</b> port owing to its competitive advantage, such as higher handling efficiency and better information technology support. Subsequently, it is found that some shippers have shifted to using Shenzhen <b>container</b> port whereas some shippers keep on using Hong Kong <b>container</b> port as two <b>container</b> ports have different competitive advantages to serve customers with different requirement. A recommendation is made to suggest that Shenzhen and Hong Kong <b>container</b> ports could cooperate together to form an aggregated logistics port to provide professional <b>container</b> and logistics services with a competitive price. They are complementary to each another and increase the competitiveness of two <b>container</b> ports in Southeast Asia...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured <b>containers</b> {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the plastic <b>containers,</b> using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the lemon juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon <b>containers</b> under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E
