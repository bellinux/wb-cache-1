The contact angles test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to study the microscopic physical properties of samples after the aging tests. SEM observed that the surface flatness of samples declined, holes and particles increased on the sample surface, a large number of fillers exposed. The results of FTIR showed that Si-C bonds in the side chain in Si-O backbones were broken by ultraviolet radiation and methyl groups were oxidized, a small amount of fire retardant (Al 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O) were decomposed, hydrophilic groups increased, all which have happened on the HTV silicone rubber after both the aging tests under the same ultraviolet radiation. The differences between the aging properties of two kinds of tests are that the aging extent of samples after outdoor electric aging was severer than that in ultraviolet accelerated aging, and the surface hydrophobicity of it after outdoor electric aging increased compared to ultraviolet accelerated aging.

40|$|Investigations of bulk {{dielectric}} properties of specimens extracted from in-service aged and aged UHVDC <b>composite</b> <b>insulator</b> sheds {{are reported in}} this paper. The program of the study included measurements of DC conductivity and complex permittivity at frequency range 10 - 4 – 103 Hz at various temperatures in dry and wet (water immersion) conditions. The obtained results are analyzed by considering a combination of relations describing various dielectric relaxation modes in dielectrics, included three Cole-Cole types of responses and a hopping process. The hopping has the strongest impact on the responses in the whole frequency range. Two of the Cole- Cole responses appearing in the low frequency range are attributed to Maxwell- Wagner-Sillars relaxations at macroscopic and mesoscopic levels; first one representing interfacial polarization at the border between specimen and air gap in the electrode arrangement, while the second one is attributed to the charge relaxation at filler boundaries and internal cavities in the polymeric materials.
