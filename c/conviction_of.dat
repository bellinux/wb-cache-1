40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. It was first {{available}} from Oxford University Press via [URL] intergenerational transmission of criminal behaviour is well-recognized, but less is known about the mechanisms that may explain it. This study presents new analyses from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, which examine the intergenerational transmission <b>of</b> criminal <b>convictions.</b> It then investigates mediation via psychosocial risk factors. The <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> fathers and mothers were significantly related to the <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> their male offspring, and this was mediated via the fathers’ drug use. However, the <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> fathers were only indirectly related to the <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> female offspring via the father’s cohabitation problems. The <b>convictions</b> <b>of</b> mothers were also indirectly related to those of the female offspring through harsh parental discipline. Accurate identification of the role that psychosocial risk factors play in intergenerational pathways for males and females can inform much more effective gender-specific prevention.

5|$|In their decision, the Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{application}} of curfews against citizens is constitutional. As a companion case to Hirabayashi v. United States, both decided on June 21, 1943, the court affirmed the <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> U.S.-born Minoru Yasui.

The Yasui and Hirabayashi decisions, along with the later Ex parte Endo and Korematsu v. United States decisions, determined the legality of the curfews and relocations during the war. In the 1980s, new information was used to vacate the <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> Yasui.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{is one of}} {{only two}} states (along with Wisconsin) that {{classify}} DUI as a traffic violation, and not a criminal offense, except in cases of serious injury or death. Because it is not a criminal offense, those charged in New Jersey with DUI and related offenses are not fingerprinted, do {{not have the right to}} a jury trial, DUI arrests and convictions are not submitted to the FBI's NCIC criminal database, and DUI arrests and convictions cannot be expunged. Statutory criminal defenses (e.g. duress, entrapment) are not available for DUI, and in State v. Hammond, the state Supreme Court upheld the <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> a person who drove after unknowingly having his drink spiked with alcohol. Common-law criminal defenses are available in DUI cases, and a state appellate court reversed the <b>conviction</b> <b>of</b> a person who drove while intoxicated in order to escape assailants, citing the doctrine of necessity.|$|E
