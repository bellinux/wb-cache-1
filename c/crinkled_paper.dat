6000|$|It was he {{who gave}} me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most of my ideas. [...] "Here's some {{corrugated}} iron," [...] he would say, [...] "suitable for roofs and fencing," [...] and hand me a lump of that stiff <b>crinkled</b> <b>paper</b> that is used for packing medicine bottles. Or, [...] "Dick, {{do you see the}} tiger loose near the Imperial Road?--won't do for your cattle ranch." [...] And I would find a bright new lead tiger like a special creation at large in the world, and demanding a hunting expedition and much elaborate effort to get him safely housed in the city menagerie beside the captured dragon crocodile, tamed now, and his key lost and the heart and spring gone out of him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook my}} hat, and shook out into his {{extended}} hand {{two or three}} eggs, a large marble, a watch, about half-a-dozen of the inevitable glass balls, and then crumpled, <b>crinkled</b> <b>paper,</b> {{more and more and}} more, talking all the time {{of the way in which}} people neglect to brush their hats INSIDE as well as out, politely, of course, but with a certain personal application. [...] "All sorts of things accumulate, sir.... Not YOU, of course, in particular.... Nearly every customer.... Astonishing what they carry about with them...." [...] The crumpled paper rose and billowed on the counter more and more and more, until he was nearly hidden from us, until he was altogether hidden, and still his voice went on and on. [...] "We none of us know what the fair semblance of a human being may conceal, sir. Are we all then no better than brushed exteriors, whited sepulchres--" ...|$|E

50|$|Gammel sorted {{and edited}} the <b>crinkled</b> <b>papers,</b> then {{published}} them beginning in 1898 {{as the first}} ten volumes of Gammelâ€™s Laws of Texas, 1822-1897. This work won acclaim and was supplemented by additional volumes after each legislature to bring the set up to date until 1937.|$|R
50|$|Contemporary {{compositions}} often call on {{players to}} use unusual instruments or effects. For example, several pieces {{call on the}} use of a siren while others will ask players to play recorders, whirly tubes, or to sing, hum, snap, clap or even <b>crinkle</b> sheets of <b>paper.</b> The wind band's diverse instrumentation and large number of players makes it a very flexible ensemble, capable of producing a variety of sonic effects.|$|R
50|$|Roger et Gallet are a firm of French perfumiers {{which was}} founded by {{merchant}} Charles Armand Roger and banker Charles Martial Gallet in 1862. They started by buying a Parisian eau-de-Cologne business which had been founded in 1806 {{by a member of}} the Farina family and then won a legal dispute over the right to use the family name. They specialised in toilet soap which was produced in a large factory near Paris. Later in the 19th century, they were successful with the newly synthesised fragrance of violet, for which they had the French rights, producing perfumes such as Vera Violetta.The company made a name for itself with its luxurious bath soaps, which in 1879 first appeared in their signature round shape, with the <b>crinkled</b> silk <b>paper</b> and seal which are still in use today.|$|R
5000|$|Subtitled [...] "...in the 10th Year of the Trojan War", {{this piece}} retells {{the story of}} the {{incredible}} victory of the Greeks against the Trojans, using the famous [...] "Trojan Horse". The movement opens with call-and-response horn duet and motif that is prominent in both this and the fourth movement. This quickly broadens into a majestic fanfare, another recurring theme in the piece, which in reality serves as a sort of theme for Odysseus. The final sustained note of the fanfare decrescendoes into yet another motif: a flute/horn duet backed by a harp (usually on synthesizer), playing their own call-and-response/echo theme. The full band returns with the fanfare before entering an aggressive section: the woodwinds play rapid alternating triplet patterns while the brass re-enter with an entirely new, even more menacing theme. This new theme reaches its climax and quickly repeats its first part before a rapid woodwind descent which sets the tone for {{the second part of the}} movement, [...] "The Trojan Horse". Like in many of his pieces, Smith has used unusual percussion instruments and effects to achieve a certain mode and image. In this piece, he has instructed the cymbal players to grind the edge of one cymbal into the inner dome of the other, producing the sound of the squeaky wheel. While the Greeks wheel the horse into the city, the flute/duet melody returns briefly, highlighted by an ominous clarinet choir. The music eventually fades away, and a second effect initiates: The [...] "Fire" [...] effect involves members of the band <b>crinkling</b> <b>paper</b> gently while brake drums provoke a sword fight. The [...] "fire" [...] quickly spreads across the band, eventually coming to the crescendo which reintroduces the [...] "Aggressive" [...] theme, albeit with more triumphant feel. This slightly-modified theme brings the band to its final, victorious climax. If the band is transitioning to movement II, [...] "The Winds of Poseidon", an optional fine is supplied, in which the flute/horn duet is repeated one more time with a different ending.|$|R
5000|$|In a later story, [...] "Made in Goatswood", {{the village}} {{has more to}} offer to outsiders: a curiosity shop with a toad-like {{proprietor}} whose [...] "hands were brown and <b>crinkled</b> as the <b>paper</b> in which he wrapped the parcels," [...] selling disturbing lawn ornaments; a fruit stand in a [...] "canvas stall like a shrine" [...] where fruit resembling peaches are offered by a girl whose [...] "eyelids lowered wickedly." [...] There's even a red light district, Fitzroy Street, {{on the edge of}} town.|$|R
5000|$|Jack Pierce was unceremoniously {{fired from}} Universal in 1946, after {{twenty years of}} service. One theory {{for this is that}} Pierce {{resisted}} using the new technique of foam latex for make-ups, which was developed in the late 1930s. That presumably would expedite creating monsters faster, thus saving time and money. However, Pierce was no stranger to latex rubber; he had used a latex headpiece on the Frankenstein Monster since 1935, the Wolf Man's brow and nose were always a one-piece rubber appliance, and as noted, the mummy [...] "make-ups" [...] were actually rubber masks. Pierce would farm the creation of these appliances out to craftsman Ellis Berman. Universal made 40 to 60 pictures a year, out of which only a half dozen might include some elaborate character make-up or monster face, and then usually sparingly. He was resistant to using foam latex for old age make-ups, preferring the time-honored procedure of painting a face with spirit gum, applying a layer of tissue <b>paper,</b> then <b>crinkling</b> the <b>paper</b> and repeating the process. In all, most of Pierce's work was supervising his make-up unit, overseeing glamour make-ups on the leading ladies, and standard make-ups for leading men and character players.|$|R
40|$|I am {{grateful}} to the leadership of Sally Holewa, State Court Administrator and Rodney Olson, Unit Two Court Administrator for their support of my participation in the Court Executive Development Program at the National Center for State Courts {{as well as their}} encouragement in my completion of this project. The research itself {{would not have been possible}} were it not for the help of Ronda Amann, Bryan Elstad and Sheila Muus, who all assisted at various stages in the gathering of data in the time to disposition report as well as the juvenile court bench, bar and agency stakeholders of the East Central and Southeast Judicial Districts who willingly participated in my survey. I am thankful for the support of juvenile court staff in Fargo and Valley City, North Dakota who tolerated my constant ramblings about the topic and offices full of case delay books, spreadsheets and <b>crinkled</b> sheets of <b>paper</b> full of great ideas whose shelf life expired by the very next working day. These people are a pleasure to work with every day. I also appreciate Dr. Gene Flango of the National Center for State Court...|$|R
