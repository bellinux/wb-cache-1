50|$|Market cannibalization, market cannibalism, or {{corporate}} cannibalism is {{the practice of}} slashing {{the price of a}} product or introducing a new product into a market of established product categories. If a company is practising market cannibalization, it is seen to be eating its own market and in so doing, hoping to get a bigger share of it. Concretely, it refers to the principle of a newly introduced product B eating up the market shares of an already established product A, both usually coming from the same company. In this case, both products belong to the same <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> This occurrence can have either a positive or negative impact on the company’s bottom line, can be accidental or deliberate, in which case it is commonly called cannibalisation strategy.|$|E

These models have a good performance in explaining simultaneity relationships among phenomena because they are multivariate models. The justification for use this instrumentals comes from the own concentration of {{the international}} market, where, in agreement with previous works, it is taken individually into account the market slice corresponding to each producing country. Was considered each model evaluating the parameters of transmission of prices among the price of commodity of american soybean for each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> domestic market: the domestic soybean and yours derived acted by the soybean oil and the soybean bran. The estimates like indicate a positive correlation among the prices in different magnitude to each individual market. Tests of unitary root were accomplished, of causality of GRANGER and cointegration tests in order to verify {{if there is a}} long run relationship among the variables. The response impulse function and the decomposition of residues variance were also estimated, for the verification of price of commodity of american soybean influence degree for each <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>of</b> the domestic market. ...|$|R
