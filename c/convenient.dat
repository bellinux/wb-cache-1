5|$|Jeep Safari is {{the most}} <b>convenient</b> way to travel within the {{national}} park; jeeps can be rented for park trips from Ramnagar.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium's {{compounds}} have various {{chemical and}} electronic applications. Rubidium metal is easily vaporized {{and has a}} <b>convenient</b> spectral absorption range, making it a frequent target for laser manipulation of atoms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{men still}} use bathhouses as a <b>convenient,</b> {{safe place to}} meet other men for sex. In areas where {{homosexuality}} is more accepted, safety {{may no longer be}} a primary attraction.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of boron compounds {{does not involve}} the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the <b>convenient</b> availability of borates.|$|E
5|$|Tiloya-paṇṇatti of Yativṛṣabha {{discusses}} {{almost all}} of the events connected with the life of Mahavira in a form <b>convenient</b> to memorisation.|$|E
5|$|According to James, Anne {{wrote to}} him in 1696 {{requesting}} his permission to succeed William, and thereafter promising to restore the Crown to James's line at a <b>convenient</b> opportunity; he declined to give his consent. She was probably trying to ensure her own succession by attempting to prevent a direct claim by James.|$|E
5|$|After Francia's death he was {{succeeded by}} Carlos Antonio López, (called ‘López I’ by some authors, a <b>convenient</b> if {{inaccurate}} designation), {{the father of}} Francisco Solano López (‘López II’). López I did open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasion and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Anne saw an {{opportunity}} in Henry's infatuation and the <b>convenient</b> moral quandary. She determined that she would yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen. She began to take her place at his side in policy and in state, but not yet in his bed.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (<b>convenient</b> for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{earliest}} (excavated) windmill is in Great Linford. The large oak beams {{forming the}} base supports still survived in the mill mound and were shown by radio carbon dating to {{originate in the}} first half of the 13th century. (The present stone tower mill at Bradwell was built in 1815, on a site <b>convenient</b> to the new Grand Junction Canal).|$|E
5|$|But the dealing by {{the general}} {{government}} with the Indian tribes through treaties was resorted to as a <b>convenient</b> mode of regulating Indian affairs, and not because, as with other nations, {{it was the only}} mode, independently of the arbitrament of war, of dealing with them.|$|E
5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are <b>convenient</b> for specifying {{positions of}} Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky. Because Earth's orbit, and hence the ecliptic, moves very little, it is a relatively fixed reference with respect to the stars.|$|E
5|$|Free-body {{diagrams}} {{can be used}} as a <b>convenient</b> way to {{keep track}} of forces acting on a system. Ideally, these diagrams are drawn with the angles and relative magnitudes of the force vectors preserved so that graphical vector addition can be done to determine the net force.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the company}} {{became one of}} the first {{companies}} to offer a frozen energy drink: Banzai Energy Ice, which it created with using the then popular energy drink Banzai. Though the 4-ounce product received good reviews for its citrus flavor and <b>convenient</b> squeeze-up container for on-the-go consumer, the product was a financial failure and was dropped.|$|E
5|$|In other areas, such as formal analysis, {{it is more}} <b>convenient</b> to work {{directly}} with the power series themselves. Thus one may define a solution of a differential equation as a power series which, one hopes to prove, is the Taylor series of the desired solution.|$|E
5|$|Motorists {{found the}} new road to be a <b>convenient</b> way of {{travelling}} across Toronto; this convenience helped influence the suburban {{shift in the}} city and continues to be a driving force of urban sprawl today.|$|E
5|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, lead(II) nitrate provides {{one of two}} <b>convenient</b> and reliable sources of dinitrogen tetroxide. By carefully drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, nitrogen dioxide is produced, which dimerizes into the desired compound.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{constant}} difficulties of London orchestras {{was the lack of}} good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a <b>convenient</b> and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Research {{directions}} on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, <b>convenient,</b> or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; {{and the search}} for effective symptomatic treatments.|$|E
5|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{developed}} that map the IPA symbols to ASCII characters. Notable systems include Kirshenbaum, ARPABET, SAMPA, and X-SAMPA. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing <b>convenient</b> keying of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.|$|E
5|$|Speakers' Corner was {{launched}} on 1 September 2000 at Hong Lim Park, a historical venue for political speeches and rallies. The park's {{proximity to the}} Kreta Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post (NPP) also made it <b>convenient</b> for people to register {{to speak at the}} venue. In the first nine months, more than a thousand speeches were made.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's regular phases {{make it a}} very <b>convenient</b> timepiece, and {{the periods}} of its waxing and waning {{form the basis of}} many of the oldest calendars. Tally sticks, notched bones dating as far back as 20–30,000 years ago, are {{believed}} by some to mark the phases of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The {{cohabitation}} {{lifestyle is}} becoming more popular in today's generation. It is more <b>convenient</b> for couples not to get married {{because it can be}} cheaper and simpler. As divorce rates rise in society, the desire to get married is less attractive for couples uncertain of their long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} version {{incorporates a}} 5-door hard top cab {{allowing for the}} quick and <b>convenient</b> entrance and exit of the driver and all passengers or troops. A large rear compartment enables the storage of both cargo and communications equipment.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} to Golders Green {{would take the}} railway out of the urban and suburban areas and into open farmland. While this provided a <b>convenient</b> site for the CCE's depot {{it is believed that}} underlying the decision was Yerkes' plan to profit from the sale of development land previously purchased in the area that would rise in value when the railway opened.|$|E
5|$|The lack of good {{rehearsal}} {{facilities to}} which Bernstein had objected was {{addressed in the}} 1970s when, jointly with the LPO, the LSO acquired and restored a disused church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a <b>convenient</b> and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The land forces {{attempted}} to physically cut the Japanese supply lines. The 9th Division captured Pabu, thereby cutting the most <b>convenient</b> inland track, while the landing on Long Island occupied an important barge staging area.|$|E
5|$|The long blocks {{along the}} avenues make the walk {{as long as}} 20 minutes to the westernmost parts of the area. In addition, there is no <b>convenient</b> link from Grand Central Station or {{elsewhere}} {{on the east side}} of Manhattan, making the Far West Side a difficult commute for workers from parts of Manhattan, Queens, Westchester and Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The nearest {{railway station}} is at Castle Cary {{but there is}} no direct bus route linking it to Glastonbury. There are <b>convenient</b> bus {{connections}} between Glastonbury and the railway stations at Bristol Temple Meads (over an hour travelling time) and at Taunton.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{isotopes}} {{of potassium}} can be laser cooled {{and used to}} probe fundamental and technological problems in quantum physics. The two bosonic isotopes possess <b>convenient</b> Feshbach resonances to enable studies requiring tunable interactions, while 40K {{is one of only}} two stable fermions amongst the alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|The station {{structures}} {{include the}} station itself, parking tower, transformer power station, duty command center, and the affiliated facilities. The {{structure of the}} station is designed {{to address the needs}} for <b>convenient</b> maintenance, high loading, and large span.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{accession}} of Titus as emperor in 79, {{she returned}} to Rome, but was quickly dismissed amidst a number of popular measures of Titus to restore his reputation with the populace. It is possible {{that he intended to}} send for her at a more <b>convenient</b> time. However, after reigning barely two years as emperor, he suddenly died on 13 September 81.|$|E
5|$|Yarbrough's 1937 {{tables were}} based on a Haldanean 3 {{compartment}} model with compartment half-times of 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Ascent rate was chosen to be 25ft per minute, which was a <b>convenient</b> rate to pull up a diver in standard dress.|$|E
5|$|A {{more modern}} and <b>convenient</b> {{competing}} bridge opened nearby at Chelsea Bridge in 1858, and usage of Battersea Bridge fell sharply. There were serious public {{concerns about the}} safety of the bridge by this time, after an 1844 incident in which a woman was murdered on the bridge in view of one of the toll collectors, who did not intervene because both parties had paid their fares.|$|E
5|$|Between 1772 and 1779, Espejo {{provoked}} the colonial authorities, who regarded him as responsible for several satirical and mocking posters. These posters {{were attached to}} the doors of churches and other buildings, and their anonymous author tended to attack the colonial authorities, the clergy or any other subject he deemed <b>convenient.</b> Although no surviving posters have been found, evidence from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|He {{stays in}} Sarawak, and finds the Simunjon coal-works <b>convenient,</b> as {{the workers are}} happy to be paid a little for insects they find, {{including}} locusts, stick insects and about 24 new species of beetles each day. In all he collects 2000 species of beetle in Borneo, nearly all at the coal mine site; he also found a flying frog and orang-utans in the same place.|$|E
