50|$|<b>Bond</b> <b>trusts</b> issue a {{set number}} of units, {{and when they}} are all sold to investors, the trust's primary {{offering}} period is closed. <b>Bond</b> <b>trusts</b> pay monthly income, often in relatively consistent amounts, until the first <b>bond</b> in the <b>trust</b> is called or matures. When this occurs, the funds from the redemption are distributed to the clients via a pro-rata return of principal. The trust then continues paying the new monthly income amount until the next bond is redeemed. This continues until all the bonds have been liquidated out of the <b>trust.</b> <b>Bond</b> <b>trusts</b> are generally appropriate for clients seeking current income and stability of principal.|$|R

The main features of our framework are non transitivity of the <b>trust</b> <b>bond</b> and non transfer-ability of the history. The elements of history are also cryptographically proved as a criterion to enforce the trust notion. This gives a general framework that permits the implementation of various trust models. I...|$|R

The construction of the Congress Street Super Highway (known today as the Eisenhower Expressway, I-290) required the demolition of the Garfield Park branch and the Main Line but also called for a replacement rapid transit line in the median of the expressway. In 1958, Garfield Service was replaced by the new Congress Line.
