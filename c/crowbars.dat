5|$|The {{enlisted men}} were leery {{of working with}} deadly {{explosives}} but were told by officers that the larger munitions were not active and could not explodethat they would be armed with their fuzes upon arrival at the combat theater. Handling of larger munitions, such as bombs and shells, involved using levers and <b>crowbars</b> from boxcars, {{in which they were}} packed tightly with dunnagelifting the heavy, grease-coated cylinders, rolling them along the wooden pier, packing them into nets, lifting them by winch and boom, lowering the bundle into the hold, then dropping individual munitions by hand a short distance into place. This series of actions was rough enough that damaged naval shells sometimes leaked identification dye from their ballistic caps.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, <b>crowbars</b> and a variety of bladed items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} between <b>Crowbar</b> and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed <b>Crowbar</b> backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent <b>Crowbar</b> through {{a table with}} a hip toss. <b>Crowbar</b> {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a door into Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the door into <b>Crowbar's</b> head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed <b>Crowbar,</b> and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. <b>Crowbar</b> fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned <b>Crowbar</b> after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{plans to build}} a nuclear fuel {{reprocessing}} plant in the Bavarian town of Wackersdorf lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, <b>crowbars</b> and Molotov cocktails at the site of a nuclear reprocessing plant in Wackersdorf. The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{strike by}} the Naval ratings soon took serious proportions.

British personnel of the Defence forces were singled out for attacks by the strikers who were armed with hammers, <b>crowbars</b> and hockey sticks. The White Ensign was lowered from the ships.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of both games, the player can use {{a wide variety of}} weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, <b>crowbars</b> and a variety of bladed items. Later, firearms become available in each game. If the player is running low on health, painkillers are available throughout each stage. In the first game, the player also had a stamina meter which depletes as he sprints, but automatically replenishes when he stands still.|$|E
30|$|Another crucial {{factor of}} the <b>crowbar</b> is the {{resistance}} value [9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Sufficient <b>crowbar</b> resistance can effectively damp the inrush current, whereas excessive {{increase of the}} resistance may incur current spikes and cause over-voltage on the DC-link when the <b>crowbar</b> switches. In [9], the relationship between <b>crowbar</b> resistance and rotor voltage is described, and the upper limit of the resistance is obtained. In [12], the short current is theoretically analyzed and the upper limit of the <b>crowbar</b> resistance is obtained according to the permitted DC-link voltage. Reference [13] reveals the effects of <b>crowbar</b> resistance under different voltage dips. In [14], the real-time adjustable <b>crowbar</b> resistance following the change of the system state is designed. Reference [15] introduces optimization indexes for <b>crowbar</b> resistance under different controllers during grid faults. And a nonlinear <b>crowbar</b> resistance calculation method based on frequency domain analysis is introduced in [16]. By comparing the effects of different resistance values, [17] suggests a <b>crowbar</b> resistance of 0.3 p.u., {{and the study of}} [18] selects 0.5 p.u..|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{studying}} {{the impacts of}} wind turbines integrated into grid, {{the relation between the}} protection of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) during low voltage fault and the dynamic characteristic of grid is established from the points of generator operation constrains and district grid voltage stability. Then the resistance value and switching strategy of <b>crowbar</b> are discussed. Based on analyzing the electric characteristic of the voltage or current during the short-circuit fault in wind turbines with <b>crowbar</b> switching, the equation to estimate peak current of stator and rotor of DFIG with <b>crowbar</b> switching and the value range of <b>crowbar</b> resistance are derived. The numeric test analyzes the impacts of <b>crowbar</b> switching on district grid voltage stability with different fault types, <b>crowbar</b> switching time and <b>crowbar</b> resistance values. Also the interaction impact of <b>crowbar</b> switching on multi-wind farms is analyzed. The results show that reasonable <b>crowbar</b> resistance value and switching strategy can improve low voltage ride through (LVRT) ability of wind turbines and reduce bad impacts on district grid voltage stability with large-scale <b>crowbar</b> switching of wind farms...|$|R

25|$|Rioting {{construction}} workers also attacked buildings near city hall; most were of Irish Catholic extraction and some ripped the Red Cross and Episcopal Church flags {{down from a}} flagpole at nearby Trinity Church. One group invaded two nearby Pace University buildings, smashing lobby windows with clubs and <b>crowbars</b> and beating up students. More than 70 people were injured, including four policemen. Most of the injured required hospital treatment. Six people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} press conference, police {{displayed}} {{an array of}} what they described as weaponry. This included <b>crowbars,</b> hammers and nails which they themselves had taken from a builder's store next to the school; aluminium rucksack frames, which they presented as offensive weapons; 17 cameras; 13 pairs of swimming goggles; 10 pen-knives; {{and a bottle of}} sun-tan lotion.

25|$|Eight hundred troops—fifteen militia {{groups and}} eight army reserve units—were summoned to Toronto {{to assist with}} the cleanup. Local members of the navy {{assisted}} by providing boats and 100 men. The army donated 900 blankets, 350 mattresses, 175 double decker beds, and 150 stretchers in the relief effort. Tools such as bulldozers, <b>crowbars,</b> flamethrowers, pike poles were used to search for bodies. The length of time for which the militia, composed of civilians could help was limited, as their employers could not afford keep paying them during their absence. Most stayed for two weeks, but some remained, while others continued to volunteer during their time off.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar's first tunnels were {{constructed}} by {{hand in a}} slow, backbreaking but remarkably long-lasting method of excavation. The first task was to fragment the limestone rock. This was done by {{using a variety of}} methods, including gunpowder blasting, fire setting (building a fire against the face of the rock to heat it, then quenching it with cold water to cause it to shatter), quicklime (used to fill boreholes which were then slaked with water, causing it to expand and so shattering the surrounding rock) and hammering in wooden wedges which were expanded by soaking them with water, again causing the rock to shatter. The fragments were then removed with <b>crowbars</b> and sledgehammers.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the shots}} were fired, the {{violence}} began immediately. Mobs of thugs, {{including members of}} the Black Hundreds, began looting Jewish owned stores and apartments on Nova-Linsk Street. Policemen and soldiers who had earlier followed the Orthodox procession either allowed the violence to happen or participated in it themselves. The {{first day of the}} pogrom was chaotic. While units of the Czarist army, brought to Białystok by Russian authorities, exchanged fire with Jewish paramilitary groups, thugs armed with knives and <b>crowbars</b> dispersed throughout the main areas of the city to continue the pogrom. Some Jewish sections of the city were protected by self-defense units, usually organized by the labor parties, which moved against the thugs and looters. They were in turn fired upon by Czarist dragoons. Thanks to the Jewish self-defense units several working class sections of the city were spared the violence and thousands of lives were saved.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the behaviour of the rotor current of a DFIG during a fault on the network. It is seen {{that a large}} disturbance of the stator voltage will cause high transient rotor currents which trigger the <b>crowbar</b> protection for the rotor side converter (RSC). Once the <b>crowbar</b> is applied it cannot be removed until its current reaches zero. During the period the <b>crowbar</b> is applied, the machine behaves as a conventional FSIG, losing control of the active and reactive power. Therefore the time taken for the <b>crowbar</b> current to reach zero is crucial as it determines when the RSC can regain power control and how soon the AC voltage can recover. It is seen that the <b>crowbar</b> current can {{take a long time}} to decrease to zero and that this has a significant impact on the voltage recovery after fault. The larger the <b>crowbar</b> resistor and the further the generator is from synchronous speed, the shorter the <b>crowbar</b> current transient is. Power and energy dissipation through the <b>crowbar</b> resistor are also considered, and it is observed that the power varies in accordance with the maximum power transfer theorem. The detailed impact of the timings of <b>crowbar</b> removal and RSC reactivation on system voltage recovery is also investigated. It is seen that reactive power control during fault clearance can assist AC voltage recovery...|$|R

During the first engagement, the Helgoland was becalmed, without engines and extremely vulnerable. Surrounded by three submarines and with limited manoeuvrability it was forced to reveal its identity early in the engagement. On this occasion a screen concealing one of the guns jammed; Sanders and Blair exposed themselves to potential gun fire from the U-boat being attacked in order to cut away the screen with axes and <b>crowbars.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{sea mink}} was pursued by fur traders {{due to its}} large size; this made it more {{desirable}} than other mink species further inland. The unregulated trade eventually led to its extinction, which {{is thought to have}} occurred between 1860 and 1920. The sea mink was seldom sighted after 1860. The last two recorded kills of a sea mink were made in Maine in 1880 near Jonesport, Maine, and Campobello Island in New Brunswick in 1894, although the 1894 kill is speculated to be of large American minks. Fur traders made traps to catch sea minks and also pursued them with dogs, although they were rarely trapped. If a sea mink escaped into a small hole on the rocky ledges, it was dug out by hunters using shovels and <b>crowbars.</b> If it was out of reach of the hunters, it was shot and then retrieved using an iron rod with a screw on the far end. If it was hiding, it was smoked out and suffocated. The minks' nocturnal behavior may have been caused from pressure by fur traders who hunted them in daylight.|$|E
