50|$|Altogether, {{however, the}} only thing that seems clear is that the musk ducks {{probably}} {{are not part of the}} stiff-tailed ducks in the strict sense, but rather represent a not-too-distantly related lineage that is highly convergent as regards their hind limb anatomy. These two are probably part of a very ancient radiation of Gondwanan (often Australian) waterfowl, including such forms as the Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis), the <b>coscoroba</b> swan (<b>Coscoroba),</b> the freckled duck (Stictonetta) which once was placed in the Oxyurinae, or the pygmy geese (Nettapus), but the exact relationships between these lineages remains unresolved. For example, the African white-backed duck (Thalassornis) also shows some similarities to Oxyura, but again, this may be yet another case of convergent evolution.|$|R
50|$|The {{coscoroba}} swan (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> from South America, the only species of its genus, is apparently {{not a true}} swan. Its phylogenetic position is not fully resolved; it is in some aspects more similar to geese and shelducks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{coscoroba}} swan (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> is {{a species of}} waterfowl endemic to southern South America. It is {{the smallest of the}} birds called [...] "swans", but still a large species of waterfowl. It belongs to the subfamily Anserinae in the family of ducks, swans, and geese, Anatidae. It is placed in the monotypic genus Coscoroba. The {{coscoroba swan}} is traditionally considered as an early branch from the common ancestor leading to true geese and swans, and recently genetic studies have associated a phylogenetic relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (Cereopsis novaehollandiae) as sister groups.|$|E
40|$|The Coscoroba Swan (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> is {{an unusual}} member of the Anatidae found in South America, from the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego through Chile and Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay {{as far north as}} Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. The species is not {{threatened}} globally, but some local populations have declined and the status of others is unknown. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the plasma chemistry of a wild population of Coscoroba Swans in southern Brazil during their molting period. We captured 12 chicks, 14 juveniles, and 31 mature birds. The following blood parameters were measured: glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, creatin-kinase, aspartate amino transferase, alanine-aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and pancreatic amylase. Significant differences between males and females were not observed for any of the parameters, and only the levels of alkaline phosphatase differed significantly among age groups. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.

40|$|Context. Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) can be used to assess skeletal development as well as health status in wild animals. Aims. However, the information about age-related dynamics of ALP in birds, especially in precocial species, is very scarce. Therefore, before ALP measurements can be effectively interpreted, it is necessary to determine its normal variation for each species, age group and sex. Methods. Here, we report total-ALP levels of free-living coscoroba swans (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> from the most important breeding and moulting population in Brazil. Data were gathered during the moulting period and categorised according to sex and the following three different age classes: chick (n= 11), young (n= 14) and mature (n= 29). Key results. ALP levels were related to the longitudinal measure of the bones, gradually diminishing with age and showing significant differences among birds of different age classes. In all age groups, no effect of sex on T-ALP concentration was detected. Conclusions. We conclude that measuring ALP facilitates the discrimination among different-aged individuals with similar plumage characteristics and body size. © CSIRO 2010. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of morphological sexing and {{the occurrence of}} sexual dimorphism were analyzed in mature and immature Coscoroba Swans (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba,</b> Anatidae) near the Estação Ecológica do Taim, southern Brazil. On the basis of weight and 10 linear measurements of external morphology, multivariate analysis of vari- ance showed that males were consistently larger than females (sex confirmed via genetic markers) and mature birds were consistently larger than immatures. Overall, 38 % of immatures and 14 % of mature birds were sexed incorrectly by cloacal examination when compared to genetic data. Therefore, we performed a discriminant function analysis of different age classes based on morphometric measurements. Mature birds were sexed with 96 % accuracy using head and tarsus lengths as predictor variables, whereas immatures were sexed with 90 % accuracy based on head and forearm lengths. Method validation conducted with data for additional mature sampled in a different year showed {{that the use of}} head length alone was as accurate for sexing (92 % correct classification) than discriminant functions based on two characteristics (91 %).

40|$|The Coscoroba Swan, <b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba</b> (Molina, 1782), is {{a poorly}} known {{aberrant}} Anserine endemic to South America. We captured adult birds (189 male, 157 female) from the largest population in Brazil at the Taim Ecological Reserve, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Different patterns between sexes can reflect differences in selection, and positive allometry {{may indicate that}} a character is sexually selected. We used body weight and 10 morphological measurements to examine allometric differences {{between males and females}} of C. coscoroba. Males were consistently larger than females. Analysis of scaling relationships against body mass showed that nostril, tail, wing and bill height were positively allometric (i. e., heavier birds had relatively larger character lengths), but there were no sexual differences in allometric slopes. However, for a given mass, mature females had longer tails, longer wings (up to metacarpophalangeal articulation) and shorter heads than males. In the light of current debate in the literature, we discuss whether such positively allometric traits and sexual differences in scaling may be indicative of sexual selection. Although Coscoroba Swan is a monogamous species, increasing the size of some attributes may confer some advantage for mate selection or male-male competition and, contrary to other studies, we suggest that positively allometric slopes alone should not be considered as evidence for sexual selection of the considered traits.

40|$|Microsatellites for {{coscoroba}} swan (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> were developed using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) without prior enrichment. A shotgun/paired-end library was prepared according to standard protocol of Illumina Nextera DNA Library Kit with dual indexing. The PAL_FINDER_v 0. 02. 03 Perl script {{was used to}} extract readings containing microsatellites with di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotides from five million readings obtained in sequencing. Readings were grouped and used in Primer 3 version 2. 0. 0 to design primers when GC content greater than 30 %, melting temperatures within 58 - 65 oC, with 2 oC maximum difference between primers, the last 2 nucleotides in 3 ’ extremity are G or C, and maximum poli-N of 4 nucleotides. When all criteria were met, {{a single pair of}} primers was selected according to the highest score in Primer 3 and with greater amplification region of the repeated sequence. We identified 3046 potentially amplifiable loci (microsatellites) of which 52 were hexanucleotides, 447 pentanucleotides, 760 tetranucleotides, 1168 trinucleotides and 618 dinucleotides. The most common microsatellite motifs in each size were: TC (51. 6 %) for dinucleotides; ATT (23. 9 %) for trinucleotides; AAAT (31. 4 %) for tetranucleotide; ATAGG (60. 6 %) for pentanucleotides; and AAAAAG (21. 2 %) for hexanucleotides. A group of ten loci (including di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides) has been sequenced, using Sanger’s method, to obtain complete sequences for fragments over 200 bp and are currently being used to study the genetic diversity of {{coscoroba swan}} populations. Microsatellites acquired with NGS are an efficient tool for obtaining highly polymorphic markers for non-model species...|$|E
40|$|The Coscoroba Swan (<b>Coscoroba</b> <b>coscoroba)</b> is {{an unusual}} member of the Anatidae. It has a patchy {{distribution}} and is a partial migrant found from the Falkaland islands and Tierra del Fuego through Chile and Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay {{as far north as}} Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. This study describes the movements of Coscoroba swans banded outside the boundary of and in side the >Estaçao Ecológica do Taim> Reserve (c. 32 ° 33 'S, 52 ° 32 'W) in the southern coastal plain of the State of Rio Grande do SuI, Brazil and the phenology in this area. The analysis of banding and recapture or recovery data was conducted between 2005 and 2008, and data from birds marked between 1979 and 2006 were also obtained from >Centra Nacional de Pesquisas e Conservação de Aves Silvestres> (CEMAVE). Distance between sites, the location of marking and recapture or recovery sites, and sex and age were analyzed. A total of 1070 birds were banded and ringed during the flightless wing moult and 32 recaptures or recoveries were registered during the study period (27 inside the banding area and five outside), the resighting of a Coscoroba in Chubut, Argentina (43 ° 21 'S, 65 ° 03 'W) being most noteworthy. A route between Argentina and Brazil to the central depression of Rio Grande do Sul state (to and from the Taim area) was confirmed as well as fidelity to Taim as a molting site and important breeding area. Recaptures at Taim showed a prevalence of male adults that may indicate a greater male fidelity to the natal area and juvenile dispersal to other areas until sexual maturity is reached. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.
