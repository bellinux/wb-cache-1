In this study, {{the effect}} of {{alternative}} additives on the properties spred diameter, setting time, bending strength and water absorption of sanitaryware plaster moulds was investigated. The plaster was partially replaced by the alternative additives such as perlite, diatomite and glass beads. Microstructural features of the resultant compositions were determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, represantative moulds were produced and their performance was investigated under industrial conditions. It was observed that perlite and diatomite addition deteriorated the strength of plaster moulds {{and there was no}} noticeable effect of these additives on casting performance of the plaster moulds. Morever, the presence of glass beads in plaster decreased weight of the moulds without deterioration of moulds service life. Slip casting is a common method for producing sanitaryware, and plaster moulds have been used for shaping sanitaryware products [1, 2].

Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP), {{calcium sulphate dihydrate}} (CSD) and <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>hemihydrate</b> (CSH) were found to increase the setting time from 30 s to about 10 min. Moreover, the use of CSH resulted in a marked increase of the final diametral strength of the cement, which could be raised from 1 MPa to about 3 MPa. The best results were obtained when CSH and CPP were added together to the cement, while the addition of CSD and CPP alone only retarded the setting, without improving the final strength. A particular cement composition (64 wt% beta-TCP, 16 wt% MCPM, 15 wt% CSH and 5 wt% CPP), selected for its optimum final strength, was aged in vitro for 8 d at 37 degrees C in saline solution (0. 9 wt% NaCl in water). After a moderate decrease, the diametral strength of the specimen was found to level off at about 60 % of its initial value (3. 2 MPa), for ageing times beyond 1 d.

While the roughness of the investigated stainless steel samples was kept constant, the surface properties were varied by direct ion implantation of fluorine, oxygen, hydrogen and neon. The completed fouling tests show that the induction periods of the fluorine and oxygen implanted surfaces were consistently longer than those for the untreated ones, with fluorine implantation producing the longest induction times. On the other hand, the hydrogen and especially the neon ion implanted samples showed significantly shorter induction times than the untreated surfaces. Unfortunately this trend could not be correlated with calculated surface energies measured by the sessile drop contact angle method. The heterogeneous nucleation was determined by plotting ln (induction period) vs. ln- 2 (supersaturation ratio), where the supersaturation ratio was varied from 1. 65 to 2. A linear relationship between the slope of the heterogeneous nucleation curves and the electro-negativity of the implanted ions was dis-covered. Furthermore, a clear change-over from mass transfer controlled to reaction controlled fouling can be identified during variation of the flow velocity between 0. 125 and 0. 200 m/s- i. e. Reynolds numbers between 5400 and 11442.

Natural fibres are already used in various types of materials, like plastics, concrete and lime-based products. They demonstrate different attributes like the combination of good mechanical, thermal and acoustic properties that allow these types of materials to be used for different applications. The main drawback associated with plaster is its brittleness, especially under tensile stress. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate different methods that could potentially enhance the mechanical properties of plaster. Adding fibres to gypsum to obtain a composite material is one way to improve the behaviour of the product, especially after the failure of the matrix. The aim of this work was to the study the effects of adding natural fibres, namely hemp and flax fibres, on the setting time of plaster and the mechanical properties of the composite matrix. It was shown that hemp delayed the setting of plaster, unlike flax. The initial and final setting times almost doubled when hemp was added in a plaster matrix, whereas flax fibres did not drastically change them.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Gypsum (calcium sulphate dihydrate) is of great industrial importance with over 95, 000 ktonnes {{being used in the}} world per annum. The greatest use of gypsum is in the production of plaster (<b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>hemihydrate)</b> for use as an interior finisher. Plaster is produced by the calcination (thermal decomposition) of gypsum. The most popular design is a continuous calciner where gypsum is fed continuously and is directly heated by hot air. There are a number of different phenomena occurring within a calciner, including heat transfer, mass transfer, particle and gas mixing, elutriation and the dehydration reaction itself. All these processes interact with each other. Although a lot of research has been carried out in these areas already, the literature has been found to contain significant discrepancies. This study contains experimental work which has been carried out in order to better understand the physical processes occurring within a gypsum calciner. The rate of dehydration of gypsum (35 - 67 μm in diameter) has been studied in a fluidised bed reactor. Experiments were carried out at bed temperatures of 100 to 170 °C. The fluidising gas was air with water vapour pressures of 0. 001 to 0. 30 atm. The dehydrations were under differential conditions. The results show that the dehydration under these conditions can be successfully modelled using the two dimensional Avrami-Er'ovev expression. A study of the fluidisation and elutriation properties of gypsum in batch vessels (cylindrical and conical) has been carried out. The mechanics of elutriation has been investigated and modelled for various freeboards, superficial gas velocities and air humidities. Tracer tests have also been carried out on a laboratory scale continuous conical kettle. Sodium carbonate was used as the inert tracer material. Runs were carried out at different air and gas flowrates and different bed temperatures. Residence time distributions were elucidated. Finally, the above experimental data and component models have been investigated for their applicability to producing a model of the laboratory scale gypsum calciner...|$|E
40|$|The {{reversible}} {{absorption of}} CO 2 by CaO at high temperature is a promising method for capturing and removing CO 2 from a hot gas stream. The main challenge facing {{the use of}} this method is the deterioration of CO 2 absorption capacity when the method is applied over a large number of CO 2 absorption/desorption cycles. Although various techniques have been proposed for improving the cyclic stability and performance of calcium based sorbents, a cost effective method is still needed for industrial applications. Therefore, two promising methods for improving the cyclic stability were selected for further investigation. One method is to optimize the preparation conditions applied to various particle sizes of CaO precursors while the second method involves incorporating an inert material, MgO, in the sorbent. While applying the first method, it was discovered that the absorption capacity and stability of a sorbent derived from limestone is dependent on many factors including the initial calcination atmosphere, temperature and time as well as particle size. It was found that both the absorption capacity and stability were greater for a sorbent derived from 11 ym limestone particles than for one derived from a much coarser material. It was also found that by calcining the 11 ym limestone at 1000 oC for 1 hr in 50 vol% CO 2, the resulting sorbent had an initial absorption capacity of 7 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent which only declined to 6. 3 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/regeneration. A sorbent prepared by calcining calcium acetate at 1000 oC for 1 hr in an atmosphere containing from 50 to 100 % CO 2 exhibited the highest absorption capacity among the materials tested. It was also reasonably stable over 40 cycles tested. One of the most promising sorbents was prepared from plaster of Paris (<b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>hemihydrate)</b> by treating the material with a cyclic oxidation/reduction process at 1070 oC. This sorbent exhibited an increasing trend in absorption capacity throughout a 200 cycle test of CO 2 absorption and desorption. For the second method for improving the cyclic stability of the sorbent, small amounts of MgO were incorporated in a sorbent as an inert diluent and structural stabilizer. It appeared that addition of MgO improved the performance of the sorbent in some cases depending on both the source of MgO and calcination conditions. However, this method did not seem to offer an advantage over the use of dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) alone, especially when the particle size of the dolomite was reduced by grinding so that it was more nearly comparable to that of the 11 ym limestone. A sorbent prepared by calcining the ground dolomite at 1000 oC for 1 hr in N 2 had an absorption capacity in excess of 8 mmol CO 2 /g sorbent over 80 cycles of CO 2 absorption/desorption...|$|E
40|$|Vertebral {{compression}} fractures (VCFs) are deformities of the {{vertebral body}} that {{usually do not}} require an open surgical approach and are often due to osteoporosis or low energy trauma. They may be healed by themselves with a conservative management: brace support and bed rest, combined with the administration of analgesics and bisphosphonates. When the non-surgical approach is not effective, VCFs usually lead to untreatable pain, spine deformity and disability with a proven increase of mortality, especially in patients with poor conditions. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are known as alternative minimal invasive approaches to VCFs. They are two percutaneous spine interventions which are performed {{with the goal of}} back pain relief and, when possible, restoring of the vertebral height. Vertebroplasty involves the injection of a bone cement through the trabeculae of the fractured vertebral body. In this procedure, cement injection is performed under continuous radiological control through a needle inserted in the vertebra by a transpedicular percutaneous approach. In kyphoplasty, a balloon tamp is inserted through a vertebroplasty needle in the fractured vertebral body and then is inflated/deflated and the created cavity is filled with the bone cement injected through a needle. In randomized trials it was found that VP and KP are equally safe and significantly superior to conservative treatment. Injectable bone cements {{play a critical role in}} the effectiveness of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Regarding the bone replacement, several investigations have been focused on the materials exhibiting good bioactivity, biodegradability and biocompatibility. Injectable bone cements can be divided into various categories. The first group is polymer based cements which show unique properties due to their flexibility of composition. However, their poor mechanical strength limits their applications. Metals are considered as the second group that has high wear resistance, strength and ductility. However, their high rate of corrosion and low biocompatibility make them undesirable for living tissue. In addition, allergic reactions can occur due to the high diffusion of metal ions. Another group of materials are ceramics which possess generally good biocompatibility. Although these materials have resistance to corrosion and compression, they are brittle with low fracture strength. Calcium phosphate and calcium sulphate cements could be applicable as biomaterials for vertebral stabilization and augmentation. Nevertheless, their clinical applications have been limited due to some shortcomings. Currently, the number of commercial calcium sulphate-based cements is limited. Therefore, in recent years, several approaches have been proposed to develop the synthetic calcium-based bone cements. The aim of the present research was the synthesis of a mesoporous bioactive glass (MBG) by spray-drying a mild acidic aqueous synthesis solution. These particles are able to chemically bond to the bone and can be also utilized for targeted drug delivery. In order to synthesis the MBG particles, the classical methods are time-consuming due to the additional steps to obtain the final powders. Moreover, these methods are usually performed with ethanol-based solution which is flammable and expensive. Spray-drying can be considered as a single step production technique to transform a fluid feed to a dried solid powder. In fact, the spray-drying approach can be used as an effective alternative to the standard routes with faster kinetics which allows to produce the particles with controlled size and morphology. It is reported that the spray-dried mesoporous bioactive glasses or functionalized silica have been already produced by spraying synthesis solutions based on flammable solvents (mostly ethanol) under an inert atmosphere. In general, the effective procedures involve both safety and economic constraints for a future manufacturing scale-up. In this study, MBG particles were produced by the combination of sol-gel synthesis in an aqueous medium and spray-drying technique, which can be a further improvement in terms of safety, cost and environment. The second aim of this study was to develop an innovative injectable and bioresorbable composite cements based on alpha <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> <b>hemihydrate</b> as a resorbable matrix, enriched with mesoporous glass particles (to impart bioactivity) and a glass-ceramic radiopaque phase. The present work was in the frame of the European Union Seventh Framework Program (FP 7 / 2007 - 2013) under grant agreement no. [280575]-Restoration. During this study, the developed injectable cements were characterized in terms of physical and mechanical properties such as setting time, injectability and compressive strength. Moreover, in vitro bioactivity and degradability of prepared composite cements were assessed in simulated body fluid (SBF). Biological tests using rat bone marrow stromal cells were also carried out in vitro. In addition, further investigations were carried out in vivo by using large animal model (sheep) ...|$|E
40|$|Following {{a request}} from the Commission, the Scientific Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS) {{has been asked to}} {{evaluate}} the safety and bioavailability of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> for use as a source of calcium in food supplements. The present opinion deals only with the safety and bioavailability of a particular source of <b>calcium,</b> <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate,</b> {{to be used as a}} nutritional substance in food supplements. The safety of calcium itself, in terms of the amounts that may be consumed, is outside the remit of this Panel. The Panel noted that the safety of <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> when used as a food additive has been evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the FAO/WHO Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) who allocated an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) not specified for the respective <b>calcium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> ions. The SCF also allocated a tolerable upper intake level of 2500 mg calcium/day. <b>Calcium</b> <b>sulphate</b> as a source of calcium in food for particular nutritional uses and in foods intended for the general population was evaluated by the Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food (AFC). This present opinion is predominately based on these previous opinions...|$|R

[...] "A geochemical process called anhydrite swelling has been confirmed as the cause of these uplifts. This is a transformation of the mineral anhydrite (anhydrous <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate)</b> into gypsum (hydrous <b>calcium</b> <b>sulphate).</b> A pre-condition for this transformation is that the anhydrite is in contact with water, which is then stored in its crystalline structure".|$|R
