50|$|The Red Line, also {{referred}} to as the veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> (VCF) is a pest-exclusion fence separating northern Namibia from the central and southern country parts. It encases several northern regions: Oshana Region, Kavango East Region, Omusati Region, Zambezi Region, Omaheke Region, Kunene Region, and parts of Khomas Region and Oshikoto Region. South of the fence today there commercial farms where the farmers, many of which are white, own the land. Most of these farms are fenced in and are accessible by constructed farm roads. North of the line, on the other hand, all farm land is communal and operated mostly by black farmers. Livestock is not constrained by fences and often ventures onto roads. The red line is a highly guarded line which has roadblocks to check every vehicle which passes.|$|E

30|$|To {{address this}} {{knowledge}} gap, I investigated {{the impact of}} veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> upon livelihoods and natural resource access for pastoralists of Chukumuchu, a small settlement located in a heavily fenced area of Ngamiland district, northwest Botswana. The following section briefly describes the study area and situates it within Botswana's expanding network of veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences.</b> Next, the paper provides a short review of the methods used in the research before comparing existing patterns of pastoral management, settlement and mobility with those recorded in the literature, primarily by anthropologists working in the 1970 s and 1980 s. This shows that mobility has declined and the remaining sections describe and analyse how pastoral society and natural resource management has become progressively more sedentary {{for a variety of}} reasons. The influence of the region's veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> upon pastoral mobility and resource use is then extracted from this narrative of sedentarisation.|$|R
30|$|Veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> {{represent}} the lynchpin {{of the southern}} African disease control system and in Botswana they enable livestock movement control upon otherwise open-access communal rangeland. The continued expansion of veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> into northern regions has facilitated secured access to lucrative export markets for commercial livestock farmers throughout {{the south of the}} country. These fences and the area-based disease freedom policies that surround their use represent a striking barrier to pastoral mobility, yet so far few studies have investigated the impact of these structures upon the subsistence pastoral economy.|$|R
30|$|As {{with the}} rest of the country, {{veterinary}} <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> remain the property of the State and are legally protected from damage/vandalism due to anthropogenic activities (accidental or not) and penalties exist under the Diseases of Animals Act.|$|R
30|$|The most {{outstanding}} constraints in FMD control and possible eradication were livestock theft (62.2  %), veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> damage (36.8  %), lack of protection zones (27.3  %), wild animals (24.2  %) and general apathy among the surveyed communities (19.1  %).|$|E
30|$|The use of cordon fences that {{separate}} livestock from areas inhabited by susceptible wild animals and livestock {{to control the}} transmission of infectious diseases is a common strategy in Botswana and southern Africa in general, recognized by the OIE for establishing disease-free zones in beef-exporting countries (Thomson 1999). The adoption of this strategy is also {{based on the premise}} that airborne virus transmission remains remote in sub-Saharan Africa (Thomson 1994; Mokopasetso 2005). Thus, near the villages of Matsiloje and Matopi, a double-line <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> with a defoliated 10  m in between (varies with terrain) runs just along the ephemeral Ramokgwebana river which separates Botswana and Zimbabwe. The <b>cordon</b> <b>fence,</b> first erected in the late 1970 s, runs for approximately 235  km from Dikgatlhong northwards up to Vakaranga, with staffed pickets at every 2.5 to 3  km along the fence. The international border line itself is unfenced, and previous attempts to erect an electrified fence by Botswana were considered controversial and were subsequently shelved.|$|E
30|$|Most {{reported}} acts {{of damage}} were {{along the eastern}} side of the zone along the border with Zimbabwe. Damage observed along the fence was caused in part by illegal movements of people across the border at ungazetted points. In addition to general damage by illegal immigrants, the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> was also cut by criminals who moved/smuggled goods, particularly livestock, across the two countries. Also accompanying these criminal activities is the likelihood of transmitting FMD through cloven-hoofed animal-derived products such as fresh milk and meat as well as other disease-carrying fomites which could have been detected, confiscated and disposed or dipped/decontaminated had official check points been used as dictated by movement protocols. At times, particularly during the dry season, livestock may be drawn towards the standing grass biomass in between the double fence lines or the water sources (hand-dug wells on the dry sandy Ramokgwebana river bed) on the other side of the fence. This, however understated, means an increase in livestock density lurking in very close proximity to the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> in order to seize any opportunity to access feed and water.|$|E
30|$|In 2015, the use {{of ground}} chilli pepper, a {{non-lethal}} technique, on <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> to deter elephants was piloted around Matopi village by the Department of Veterinary Services, though no systematic evaluation {{has been carried out}} on its effectiveness.|$|R
3000|$|Beyond {{reducing}} {{stock losses}} through straying, some pastoralists report that enclosure by the <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> has improved livestock {{security in the}} region. MS a male Hambukushu herder {{in a similar situation}} to KB explained why he welcomes enclosure: [...]...|$|R
30|$|In {{southern}} Africa, sustained {{public sector}} investment in these disease control policies has facilitated {{the attainment of}} 'disease freedom' from certain areas, primarily {{through the construction of}} a network of large-scale veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> (Scoones et al. 2010). These facilitate the control of livestock movements upon extensive rangelands and allow the area-based disease freedom required to access lucrative beef export markets (Sutmoller 2002). By restricting mobility and dividing communal rangelands, veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> could have potentially detrimental impacts upon pastoralists and their flexible systems of resource access, yet apart from several brief time-bound assessments the exact societal costs of this approach remain poorly understood (see, e.g. Hobbs 1981,Hitchcock 1995, 2002,Scott Wilson Resource Consultants 2000).|$|R
30|$|An {{interesting}} point to note {{is the current}} height of the double <b>cordon</b> <b>fence.</b> The inner fence {{on the western side}} (Botswana) is stock proof at 1.4  m high, while the one on the eastern side (Zimbabwe) is stock and game proof at 2.4  m. However, in areas like Matopi, both fences are at a height of 1.4  m (presumably for ease of maintenance following relentless pressure by elephants). In an earlier study by Hargreaves et al. (2004) in Zimbabwe on the outbreak of FMD in cattle adjacent to a conservancy, epidemiological investigations showed that it was most likely that antelope (impala or kudu) infected through contact with the buffalo herd within the conservancy had jumped over the fence and transmitted the virus to nearby cattle herds. Following this incident, the height of fencing surrounding conservancies in Zimbabwe was increased to a minimum of 2.3  m (Hargreaves et al. 2004), which may prompt reconsideration on the sufficiency of the current <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> height. In fact, a small number of respondents in the current study did mention the non-kudu-proof fence as a possible constraint in combating the disease.|$|E
30|$|Some of the {{constraints}} identified by livestock owners like livestock theft, <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> damage, stray livestock and apathy can be countered {{to some extent}} with aggressive awareness campaigns, stakeholder and community involvement (e.g. engaging Farmer Associations). Strong emphasis must always be placed first and foremost on how successful FMD control and eradication benefits livestock owners, both large and small-scale, rather than the government. This will inculcate trust, a sense of ownership, vigilance and compliance which are all pivotal in disease control.|$|E
30|$|The way SM's family adapted their herd {{management}} system illustrates both the gradual process of sedentarisation {{that has occurred}} in the region and the role played by veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> enclosure. It also shows that mobility and flexibility remain important strategies through which pastoralists manage enclosure and sedentarisation. Whereas, in the past the family managed their livestock between the grasslands of the Xaudum valley and Marunga, they now maintain mobility between Marunga and Ndivitama. Dual well ownership and herd splitting represent important strategies by which pastoralists manage the risks and vulnerability of enclosure.|$|E
30|$|The {{perception}} of apathy demonstrated by owners and herders alike could also {{arise from the}} subsistence nature of extensive livestock farming in Botswana, which may not necessarily require intensive herd management. It is a low-input, low-output system. A similar observation has been made by McGahey (2011) in Botswana’s Ngamiland, where there was positive attitude among some livestock owners and herders towards veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> particularly in curbing stock theft and preventing cattle from straying as far as Namibia. People are aware that their livestock cannot go beyond the <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> (barring permeability due to wildlife and anthropogenic damage), and so, they let their stock graze freely within the area without close herding or no herding at all. This is even more so during dry seasons when water sources become key focal points where livestock congregate, thereby reducing herding labour demand as well as time to round up the animals. Even in instances where animals do go astray, herders and owners will search for them {{within the confines of}} the <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> first, before raising an alarm. And since the last FMD outbreaks in the study area were recorded in 2002 and 2003, it is natural for people in general to let their guard down once a perceived threat has passed.|$|R
3000|$|Another {{major risk}} facing {{people in the}} region is fire. Enclosure by {{veterinary}} <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> in the region has increased the vulnerability of pastoralists to grazing shortages following periodic fire events. WK a 32 -year-old Herero man from Kawaronga cattlepost explained why he resented the CBPP fences: [...]...|$|R
30|$|For the {{purposes}} of disease control, particularly foot-and-mouth disease which remains endemic in wild buffalo, Botswana is dissected by a network of veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> which divide the land into four: an export zone, buffer zone, vaccination/surveillance zone and a wildlife/foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) zone. Within these zones over 80 % of livestock reared for the commercial sector are grazed on communal land (Darkoh and Mbaiwa 2002). The remaining cattle are reared on fenced tribal lands (tribal grazing lands policy, TGLP) or freehold farms, with the privatised land of the latter covering a meagre 6 % of the country's total land area (Ndzinge et al. 1984). Elsewhere in southern Africa (Namibia, South Africa and formally Zimbabwe) a dualistic system exists whereby disease control, market infrastructure and support is focussed on the privatised ranching sector enclosed and protected from diseases endemic in communal areas by veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> (Scoones and Wolmer 2006).|$|R
30|$|The modus operandi, {{which is}} also aided by the vastness of Zone 6, {{involves}} stealing of livestock (particularly cattle, small stock and, to the bemusement of Batswana, donkeys) from either country along the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> by criminal syndicates or individuals, driving them further away from their usual grazing and watering points (cattle posts) and exchanging them with another stolen batch of livestock from the neighbouring country. Or instead of exchanging live animals, one could be sold stolen livestock, knowingly or not. In some instances, stolen livestock from Botswana could be herded illegally into Zimbabwe where they are further moved from the area of entry and later driven back into Botswana at a different locality where they are then reared or sold. Some local butcheries and unscrupulous individuals may provide the market for such stolen livestock, contrary to the legal process of inspection of animals before slaughter (Livestock and Meat Industries Act of 1962). This is further exacerbated by failure to brand and ear mark livestock as expected of livestock owners (Branding of Cattle Act). Because of the criminality of these movements, the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> is almost always cut to facilitate cross-border movement or fence sections damaged by elephants used as crossing points. And {{if there are any}} FMD-infected livestock or fomites involved, so will the subsequent spread of the disease.|$|E
30|$|When {{pressed to}} provide a {{negative}} implication of enclosure most pastoralists could offer one of the above problems. These negative impacts {{are similar to those}} documented by Hitchcock (1995, 2002), who noted that movement restrictions across the central Ngwato <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> during a FMD outbreak prevented the seasonal movement of cattle to village arable lands causing a shortage of milk and draught power. Hitchcock (1995) also described how officials prevented people taking meat and crafts to markets found to the east of the fence by restricting the movement of some goods of animal origin (ibid, p. 184).|$|E
3000|$|KB's {{response}} to enclosure highlights {{some of the}} contemporary risks and vulnerabilities facing sedentary pastoralists in the region.

Before enclosure by the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence,</b> he could draw upon social ties to access water sources elsewhere in the region.

30|$|One {{might assume}} that a colonial-era policy {{instrument}} that focuses on containment and movement restriction would impact negatively upon a subsistence pastoral society whose primary focus {{may well be the}} maintenance of opportunistic and flexible rangeland access (Scoones 1995). Using a detailed examination of the precise societal costs associated with two <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> in northern Botswana, this paper illustrates that the situation is less than straightforward. In fact, the majority of herders welcome enclosure, especially those faced with labour shortages after the general movement towards non-agricultural forms of employment. For these groups, veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> reduce the risk of stock theft and provide a useful limit to the movement of lost livestock, especially during the wet season. Furthermore, the increased presence of veterinary personnel either at sporadic gate camps or on regular maintenance patrols represent additional resources that pastoralists can draw upon to locate lost livestock. In Namibia, pastoralists have intentionally created fenced community enclosures, primarily to reduce herding requirements and improve herd security (Werner 2000, Stahl 2000, Twyman et al. 2001). It would appear that faced with declining agricultural labour availability, herders throughout the region are beginning to favour fencing and enclosure over more opportunistic and flexible resource access arrangements.|$|R
30|$|According to Perkins et al. (2002) {{there are}} two {{possible}} reasons why fires in the Kalahari have become more severe and widespread. First, the almost unprecedented decline in large wild herbivore numbers has increased the volume of dead biomass. Almost every person interviewed from the area stated {{that there has been}} a decline in wild herbivores, particularly since the CBPP fences were constructed. This is unsurprising given that veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> represent impermeable barriers for most species and are associated with large-scale declines in water-dependent species in the Kalahari (Thouless 1998,Wheelwright et al. 1996).|$|R
30|$|Elephants (Loxodonta africana) {{were also}} a major {{contributing}} factor to the observed fence damage (further expounded below under section on wild animals). Jori et al. (2011) also identified elephants and anthropogenic activities as {{the two most important}} causes of damage to the veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> separating wildlife and livestock along the boundary of the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Even in settings where cordon fences are electrified like in South Africa, stealing of batteries and solar panels may render the fence ineffective (Jori et al. 2009). All these frequent damages to the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> in the study area not only put a strain on the dwindling resources mobilized for fence maintenance but also expose agro-pastoral communities to concurrent multiple stressors such as livestock going astray into Zimbabwe and increased human-wildlife conflicts. In contrast, veterinary cordon fences in other areas of Botswana like Chobe and Ngamiland are further compromised by annual veld fires as well as flooding. While proving effective, game-proof fencing comes at a financial cost (construction, maintenance and patrol) which may prove prohibitive in some countries (Sutmoller 2002; Sinkala et al. 2014) and continue to meet mounting resistance from conservationists due to its detrimental ecological effects (Mbaiwa and Mbaiwa 2006; Gadd 2012). Research on the impact of veterinary cordon fencing in northern Botswana also demonstrated restricted patterns of resource access and pastoral mobility resulting in negative implications for social and environmental sustainability (McGahey 2008; 2011).|$|E
30|$|Since the study, Zone 6 {{has been}} demarcated into Zones 6 a and 6 b by {{approximately}} 180  km of 2.4 -m-high fence. The surveyed villages of Borolong and Mathangwane are under Zone 6 a, while Matopi and Matsiloje now fall under Zone 6 b (protection zone) along the Botswana/Zimbabwe border. Zone 6 b forms {{part of a}} series of contiguous protection zones stretching across the country from east to west, essentially protecting FMD-free without-vaccination zones in the south from any FMDV incursions from FMD-infected zones in the north - with a strong resemblance to Namibia’s (in)famous Veterinary <b>Cordon</b> <b>Fence</b> (VCF) or the ‘Red Line’.|$|E
30|$|Pastoral {{systems are}} dynamic, necessitating a multitemporal {{approach}} to the analysis and understanding of change (Desta and Coppock 2004). Whilst some characteristics, strategies or cultures may remain relatively consistent, most communities are constantly adapting and changing {{to a variety of}} internal or external pressures. History, particularly historical struggles over access to, control of and exclusion from resources are vital in the quest to understand current resource use and management issues (Moore 1993). To investigate the impact of veterinary cordon fences, this study sought to understand how mobility was used in the past, how it is used now, along with the timing and cause of its demise. Only within this narrative of social change can the direct impact of veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> enclosure on pastoral livelihoods be illuminated.|$|E
30|$|In February 1995 Botswana's first CBPP {{outbreak}} {{for nearly}} 60 years {{occurred in the}} Xaudum valley {{to the north of}} Chukumuchu. The outbreak started after infected livestock entered Botswana from Namibia, probably {{as a result of the}} post-independence relaxation of military border patrols and the ongoing process of Herero repatriation. State veterinarians moved quickly to contain the disease, using emergency powers to construct three new veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences.</b> These failed to hold the outbreak and in April 1996 the Department of Animal Health and Production decided to 'stamp out' the infection by ordering the cull of Ngamiland's 320, 000 heads of cattle.|$|R
30|$|In {{extending}} marketing {{opportunities to}} marginalised pastoral areas, disease management in Botswana is often {{regarded as a}} model that could help to catalyse Africa's currently underdeveloped potential for livestock production. Such assertions surround current efforts to re-establish a fenced export zone in eastern Africa, for example (Kock 2010). Focusing {{on the case of}} veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fencing</b> in northern Botswana, this paper illustrates the exact societal costs and benefits associated with the policy instrument. Whilst on balance fences may have reduced herding demands and improved livestock security, negative implications for resource access and pastoral risk management raise concern.|$|R
30|$|In Namibia, {{large tracts}} of {{communal}} rangeland have been compartmentalised and fenced illegally by individuals and small groups of farmers (cf. Werner 2000,Stahl 2000,Stahl 2000) found that reduced stock theft was one of main benefits of illegal fencing and indeed the main determinant driving the impetus to fence. Before the CBPP fences and additional electrified international border fence were constructed in 1995 / 1996, {{there was a period}} after Namibian independence in 1990 when military border security was relaxed and cattle thefts increased in the Xaudum area, probably precipitating the CBPP outbreak itself. It seems for many the <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> provide a welcome barrier preventing cattle from straying into remote border regions where the risk of theft remains high.|$|R
30|$|Tracking {{changes in}} herd management, in {{particular}} declining livestock mobility, {{over the period}} leading {{up to and including}} veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> enclosure proved vital to contextualise perceived impacts emerging from the pastoral community. These enquiries revealed that three overall seasonal herd mobility strategies were employed in the past: sedentary herd-release management, wet seasonal mobility in which herders moved to a single water source to avoid conflicts on arable lands, and wet season mobility to multiple water sources to track resource availability. Several authors have stressed the importance of socio-economic factors over ecological considerations in determining herding decisions within contemporary pastoral communities (cf. Baker and Hoffman 2006, Turner 1999). Socio-economic changes associated with a gradual shift towards wage-dependency and regional economic development reduced labour availability at the cattleposts, which in turn has led to a reduction in seasonal herd mobility. This empirical evidence demonstrates exactly how household herd management in pastoral societies can become increasingly dominated by non-environmental considerations with increased income diversification.|$|E
30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{presence}} of FMD-susceptible wild ungulates on the same grazing lands used by livestock as well as damage of cordon fences by elephants, the situation is even more complex. Nature-based tourism, for which southern Africa has a comparative advantage, is an important revenue earner for Botswana, only second to minerals which are finite resources under an extractive industry. So both livestock and tourism sectors are integral in efforts to safeguard and develop rural livelihoods and therefore should sustainably complement each other. A possible approach is the adoption of Botswana’s renowned Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) model by communities in the study area to achieve the twin objectives of nature conservation and economic empowerment of locals - with possible realignment (not total removal) of the <b>cordon</b> <b>fence</b> blocking elephant movement corridors and home ranges particularly access routes to Dikgatlhong dam. Land is already limited in this area, and stakeholders will have to be flexible, innovative and accommodative of integrated land use proposals. As an example, a percentage of revenue generated from ecotourism activities under such a model could be channelled back into fence fortification, patrol and maintenance. This then calls on different stakeholders within the livestock and conservation fields, who are often the biggest impediment to meaningful win-win dialogue, to find a middle ground that drives towards compatibility as advocated for by Niamir-Fuller et al. (2012) in East Africa.|$|E
30|$|Southern African rangelands support both {{livestock}} and a rich diversity of wildlife, {{with the latter}} also central to national economies and conservation efforts. One wild animal often mentioned in the same line with FMD outbreaks in livestock {{in the region is}} the African buffalo, though restricted to wildlife areas in Botswana. This is because African buffalo (one of the ‘big five’ and a tourist attraction) are a known natural reservoir for SAT-type FMDV in southern Africa (Condy and Hedger 1974; Mapitse 1998), which makes control of FMDV not only challenging but its eradication untenable in the near future. The role of other wild cloven-hoofed animals apart from the African buffalo in virus maintenance and transmission of FMD has been extensively researched in southern Africa (e.g. Anderson et al. 1993; Letshwenyo et al. 2006; Vosloo et al. 2009; Weaver et al. 2013). Thus, the presence of wild ungulates in the study area such as the greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) and impala (A. melampus), which are known intermediary transmitters of FMDV, makes outbreaks likely. This is even more so due to an increased elephant population (an Appendix I CITES species and one of the ‘big five’, approximately 200, 000 in Botswana) which damages the non-electrified <b>cordon</b> <b>fence,</b> thus enabling smaller ungulates including possibly infected livestock to cross undeterred.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{revival of}} debates {{concerning}} livestock development in Africa follows the more widespread acceptance of paradigm shifts within rangeland science, and maintaining pastoral mobility is now recognised as fundamental {{for the future}} survival of pastoralism and sustainability of dryland environments. However, in southern Africa communal pastoral drylands continue to be enclosed and dissected by large-scale barrier fences designed to control livestock diseases, thus protecting lucrative livestock export agreements. This interdisciplinary research examines {{the extent to which}} these veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> have changed people’s access to, and effective management of, natural resources in northern Botswana and how fence-restricted resource use by livestock, wildlife and people has changed the natural environment. Critical political ecology informed the approach, given its emphasis on socio-political and historical influences on resource access, mobility and user relationships. This enabled the biophysical effects of social changes to be investigated fully, thereby moving beyond a tradition of discipline-based studies often resulting in severely repressive rangeland policies. The research demonstrates how enclosure by veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> restricts patterns of resource access and mobility within pastoral drylands, with serious implications for both social and environmental sustainability. Enclosure increases the vulnerability of people to risks and natural hazards, while resource access constraints and pastoral adaptations to enclosure have favoured the increasing commercialisation of livestock production, thus obstructing pathways into pastoralism. While widespread environmental change in livestock areas cannot be attributed thus far to enclosure, the curtailment of wild migratory herbivores at the wildlife–livestock interface has caused some large-scale structural vegetation changes and there are indications that fence induced sedentarisation could be accentuating existing degradation trends. Given these changes, future rangeland policies in Africa should be aware of the social and environmental impacts associated with export-led disease management infrastructure and consider alternative, less intrusive, approaches to livestock development and disease control in extensive pastoral drylands. </p...|$|R
30|$|Thus, the CBPP fences {{have benefited}} herders with limited human capital {{and this is}} {{reflected}} in the 21 % of herders from the cattleposts and 83 % of herders from the village who recognise the positive outcomes of enclosure.f Veterinary <b>cordon</b> <b>fences</b> and their associated maintenance roads, sporadic gate camps, along with regular maintenance patrols and permanent gate keepers also represent infrastructure and personnel that can be utilised by pastoralists. When cattle fail to return home after release in the wet season, pastoralists begin looking for livestock often relying on the knowledge of other herders who may have seen their cattle in the rangeland. Cattle often stray as far as the veterinary fences where they can be easily seen or tracked. Pastoralists use fence roads to search for livestock, often stopping to ask DAHP gatekeepers if their cattle have been seen along the fence. DAHP officials may also visit cattleposts to inform herders about the location of lost herds.|$|R
30|$|Whilst many {{recently}} settled Hambukushu and Bayei herders may welcome enclosure, a {{small group}} of Herero herd patriarchs remain openly negative towards the <b>cordon</b> <b>fences.</b> This group cites reduced livestock mobility as their primary concern. The views of KB a 60 -year-old Herero herd patriarch who manages the household herd at the Boudum cattlepost are representative of those expressed by this group. KB and his family were one of the first herders to pioneer livestock production in the region and he remembers moving to the Xaudum valley to dig a new well with his father in the late 1950 s after losing cattle to trypanosomiasis and predators at Nxamasere. In 1984, the family decided to move their permanent onganda to their wet season waterhole, Boudum, as grazing had been depleted at Xaudum due to the ongoing drought. The family kept their cattle permanently at Boudum until 1995 when poor rains and lack of grazing forced KB to move the herd to his brother's well at Xaudum where they remained until the cull.|$|R
