Moreover, this knowledge will help define potential new therapeutic strategies through novel molecular targets, drive stem cell development into the desired differentiation path and ameliorate our comprehension of tissue engineering.

40|$|AbstractBoth {{acquired}} and <b>congenital</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> may {{be associated}} with increased susceptibility to invasive fungal infections (IFIs), {{depending on the type of}} immune deficit. IFIs frequently occur in patients with phagocytic and cellular immune defects, but are rarely observed in those with humoral or complement deficits. Among congenital immune disorders, chronic granulomatous disease and hyper-IgE syndrome are most frequently associated with IFIs; variable susceptibility to fungal pathogens is also seen in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome, Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, common variable immunodeficiency, defects in the interferon-γ–interleukin- 12 axis, and myeloperoxidase deficiency. Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptococcus, Histoplasma and other fungal genera are variably implicated in causing invasive infections in these patients. Prompt diagnosis of IFIs in this patient population requires a high degree of suspicion, together with a knowledge of their clinical presentation and the limitations of diagnostic modalities. Apart from administration of appropriate antifungal agents, successful management often requires the addition of surgical intervention. Adjunctive immunotherapy may be considered, although this has not been systematically studied. Prophylactic interferon-γ and itraconazole administration have been shown to reduce the risk of IFIs in patients with chronic granulomatous disease; however, the possibility of infections with azole-resistant organisms following long-term itraconazole prophylaxis should not be overlooked...|$|R

40|$|Immunophenotyping {{of blood}} {{lymphocyte}} subpopulations in neonates and young infants is {{hampered by the}} limited amount of blood that can be collected. Contamination of the flow cytometric "lympho-gate" by normoblasts and analysed erythrocytes, and therefore the underestimation of the relative frequencies of lymphocyte subpopulations, interferes with the precise calculation of absolute counts.   A microassay was developed by adapting the lysed whole blood technique. Triple immunostaining in a single antibody staining step was used to reduce washing steps and cell loss. Introduction of a triple staining for CD 71 (expressed by erythroid precursors), glycophorin A (GpA, expressed by all erythroid cells), and CD 45 (expressed by all leucocytes) permitted the relative frequencies of normoblasts (CD 71 +/GpA+/CD 45 - population) and unlysed erythrocytes (CD 71 -/GpA+/CD 45 - population) to be identified and measured within the "lympho-gate" of neonatal cord blood samples. Particularly high frequencies were found (median: 31 %) in cord blood samples from preterm neonates. These erythroid cells disappear rapidly by 1 week of age The relative frequencies of erythroid cells {{can be used to}} calculate correct lymphocyte subpopulation values.

For patients with WAS, SCIDX 1 or XLA, the demonstration of non random X-Chromosome inactivation in their mothers {{can be used to}} confirm clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, analysis of X-Chromosome inactivation in at risk females allows preconceptional carrier detection, thus representing an important aid in genetic counseling. For each disease we established a PCR-based, non radioactive assay at the human androgen receptor (HUMARA) locus, that allows analysis of X-Chromosome inactivation in the affected cell types and in tissue specific controls to exclude the issue of skewed X-chromosomal inactivation. In our study, 50 females with a known family history of XLA [19], WAS [18], and SCIDX 1 [13],were examined.

40|$|Summary: Globally, {{the number}} of {{immunosuppressed}} people increases each year, with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic continuing to spread unabated {{in many parts of}} the world. Immunosuppression may also occur in malnourished persons, patients undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy, and those receiving immunosuppressive therapy. Components of the immune system can be functionally or genetically abnormal as a result of acquired (e. g., caused by HIV infection, lymphoma, or high-dose steroids or other immunosuppressive medications) or congenital illnesses, with more than 120 <b>congenital</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> described to date that either affect humoral immunity or compromise T-cell function. All individuals affected by immunosuppression are at risk of infection by opportunistic parasites (such as the microsporidia) as well as those more commonly associated with gastrointestinal disease (such as Giardia). The outcome of infection by enteric protozoan parasites is dependent on absolute CD 4 + cell counts, with lower counts being associated with more severe disease, more atypical disease, and a greater risk of disseminated disease.

Few stem cell sources have been approved for transplantation, among them are the hematopoietic progenitor cells which are progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineage in the hematopoietic system, that continually provides mature blood cells during the lifespan of the individual. These well-characterized stem cells are clinically relevant in the treatment of diseases such as breast cancer, leukemias, and <b>congenital</b> <b>immunodeficiencies.</b> Peripheral blood stem transplantation is a standard procedure after its first successful transplantation more than 35 years ago. The minimum intended dose of stem cells given to the patient is 2. 5 × 106 – 5 × 106 cells. In this study, we are establishing a correlation between the number of stem cells enumerated and the weight of the patient as a determinant for suitable transplantation. We have established a conversion factor to deliver the required dose of approximately 3 × 106 stem cells/kg body weight. This will ensure a uniform collection strategy that is sufficient for transplantation irrespective of the weight of the patient. This approach, if incorporated, will lead to a significantly lesser rate of bone marrow transplantation failures as sufficient number of stem cells will ensure engraftment of stem cells...|$|R

40|$|Primary <b>immunodeficiencies</b> (PID) are <b>congenital</b> {{disorders}} of immune competence, {{which are}} mainly {{characterized by a}} pathological susceptibility to infection. This is often accompanied by severe recurrent infections with drug-resistant, long progressions. In addition, there are associated immune regulation disorders, which may manifest themselves in granuloma formation, autoimmunity, recurrent fever, eczema, lymphoproliferation and chronic intestinal inflammation. More than 240 disease entities have been defined so far as PID, and just as extensive is the spectrum of clinical severity. While the most common <b>congenital</b> <b>immunodeficiencies,</b> such as selective IgA deficiency or C 2 complement deficiency, have a mild phenotype which often remains undetected, severe PID are characterized by significant mortality {{in the first years}} of life, as well as a serious morbidity with irreversible organ damage. This applies in particular to PID that are defined by the absence or functional anergy of T-lymphocytes (severe combined immunodeficiency; SCID) or B-lymphocytes (e. g. X-linked agammaglobulinemia; XLA). Patients with such severe <b>congenital</b> <b>immunodeficiencies</b> appear to be in perfect health at birth, yet show initial manifestations of SCID between the 14 th day and the 4 th month following birth; in patients with XLA usually between the 8 th and 16 th month after birth. Albeit increasingly becoming appreciated as a relevant health problem, there is a lack of diagnostic procedures and screening profiles that would allow earliest possible diagnosis of patients with severe PID on a population scale. As a superior prognosis could be given upon prompt diagnosis and immediate adequate treatment, one strategy to improve the outcome of severe PID shall be to test newborns for the presence of T and B cells. With the aim to develop a simple and reliable test for newborn screening using the established dried blood sampling system (Guthrie cards), a multiplex real-time quantitative qPCR assay for the quantitation of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) and kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) as surrogate markers of T and B cell development was designed and evaluated (publication I). This assay was further extended to allow detection of newborns with an inversion of the UNC 13 D gene, causing a severe PID characterized as familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (publication III). Furthermore, the feasibility to identify several other severe PID, characterized by a functional defect of T- and B-cell interation (combined immunodeficiency diseases), was assessed using IgA-protein detection in neonatal Guthrie cards. However, this assay provided evidence of a maternal transfer mechanism for IgA, thereby preventing the use of this assay as a screening tool for severe PID (publication II). Finally, the TREC-KREC newborn screening assay was further improved in terms of assay performance and evaluated in retrospective cohorts of patients with the DiGeorge syndrome, or Down syndrome (publications IV and V). In addition, novel second-tier assays for comfirmation of the 22 q 11 microdeletion or the chromosome 21 triplication have been designed and succesfully tested with neonatal samples. In summary, new assays and concepts for newborn screening of severe primary immunodeficeincies were designed and benchmarked in retrospective and prospective neonatal dried blood spot samples, thereby underlining the potential of this preventive health care strategy...|$|R
