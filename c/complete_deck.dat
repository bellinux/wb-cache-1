50|$|A common {{alternate}} form of {{the game}} (as described in Hoyle's Rules of Games) uses a <b>complete</b> <b>deck</b> of standard playing cards but assigns the point cards differently (aces = 15, kings = 10, tens = 10, fives = 5), and is essentially similar to the 1-High Partnership described below.|$|E

50|$|She was {{the first}} ship of the line with three <b>complete</b> gun <b>decks,</b> {{although}} when first <b>completed</b> the upper <b>deck</b> carried no guns in the waist, and was stepped down aft {{because of the large}} amount of sheer (the manner in which the decks rose towards the stern and bow). In 1621 a refit saw the removal of this step-down, with all three gun decks now being continuous.|$|R

Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons.|$|R

40|$|The {{output from}} a Coulter model S is {{captured}} by {{a specially designed}} silent interface which visualizes the results, automatically prints the data on a continuous paper roll and transmits the information to a card punch located in a data processing room.

The <b>completed</b> <b>deck</b> of cards is used in an off-line batch mode on a dedicated laboratory computer to format report documents, produce ward listings, and quality control information. A punch card off-line method is also described for blood group and related data...|$|R

50|$|The {{main deck}} of a ship is the {{uppermost}} <b>complete</b> <b>deck</b> extending from bow to stern. A steel ship's hull may be considered a structural beam with the main deck forming the upper flange of a box girder and the keel forming the lower strength member. The main deck may act as a tension member when the ship {{is supported by a}} single wave amidships, or as a compression member when the ship is supported between waves forward and aft.|$|E
50|$|Evaluating {{a hand on}} {{this basis}} takes due account {{of the fact that}} there are 10 HCP in each suit and {{therefore}} 40 in the <b>complete</b> <b>deck</b> of cards. An average hand contains one quarter of the total, i.e. 10 HCP. The method has the dual benefits of simplicity and practicality, especially in notrump contracts. Most bidding systems are based upon the premise that a better than average hand is required to open the bidding; 12 HCP is generally considered the minimum for most opening bids.|$|E
