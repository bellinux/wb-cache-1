The final floor vote was: 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats voted to confirm while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject the nomination.|$|E

[...] Charles Holden described Pick's management of meetings: [...] "Here his decisions were those of a benevolent dictator, and the members left the meeting with a clear sense of a task to be performed, difficult, perhaps, and sometimes impossible, as might subsequently prove to be, but usually well worth exploring if only in producing <b>convincing</b> <b>proof</b> of obstacles. Out of these exploratory methods there often emerged new and most interesting solutions, which Pick was quick to appreciate, and to adopt in substitution for his own proposals." ...|$|E
500|$|The killings at Kragujevac and Kraljevo {{exacerbated}} {{tensions between}} the Partisans and Chetniks. They also convinced Mihailović that active resistance was futile {{for as long as}} the Germans held an unassailable military advantage in the Balkans, and that killing German troops would only result in the unnecessary deaths of tens of thousands of Serbs. He therefore decided to scale back Chetnik guerrilla attacks and wait for an Allied landing in the Balkans. The killings occurred only a few days before Captain Bill Hudson, a Special Operations Executive officer, met with Mihailović at his Ravna Gora headquarters. Hudson witnessed the aftermath of the massacre and noted the psychological toll it exacted. [...] "Morning and night was the most desolating atmosphere," [...] he recounted, [...] "because the women were out in the fields, and every sunrise and sunset you would hear the wails. This had a very strong effect on Mihailović." [...] "The tragedy gave to Nedić <b>convincing</b> <b>proof</b> that the Serbs would be biologically exterminated if they were not submissive," [...] Djilas wrote, [...] "and to the Chetniks proof that the Partisans were prematurely provoking the Germans".|$|E

500|$|The first {{important}} work on element 103 {{was carried out}} at Berkeley by the nuclear-physics team of Albert Ghiorso, Torbjørn Sikkeland, Almon Larsh, Robert M. Latimer, and their co-workers on February 14, 1961. The first atoms of lawrencium were reportedly produced by bombarding a three-milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron-10 and boron-11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator (HILAC). The Berkeley team reported that the isotope 257103 was detected in this manner, and that it decayed by emitting an 8.6MeV alpha particle with a half-life of (8±2)s. This identification was later corrected to be 258103, as later work proved that 257Lr {{did not have the}} properties detected, but 258Lr did. This was considered at the time to be <b>convincing</b> <b>proof</b> of the synthesis of element 103: while the mass assignment was less certain and proved to be mistaken, it did not affect the arguments in favor of element 103 having been synthesized. Scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) raised several criticisms: all but one were answered adequately. The exception was that 252Cf was the most common isotope in the target, and in the reactions with 10B, 258Lr could only have been produced by emitting four neutrons, and emitting three neutrons was expected to be much less likely than emitting four or five. This would lead to a narrow yield curve, not the broad one reported by the Berkeley team. A possible explanation was that there was a low number of events attributed to element 103. This was an important intermediate step to the unquestioned discovery of element 103, although the evidence was not completely convincing. The Berkeley team proposed the name [...] "lawrencium" [...] with symbol [...] "Lw", after Ernest Orlando Lawrence, inventor of the cyclotron. The IUPAC Commission on Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry accepted the name, but changed the symbol to [...] "Lr". This acceptance of the discovery was later characterized as being hasty by the Dubna team.|$|E

2500|$|Edwin Percy Whipple from North American Review {{considered}} The Tenant [...] "less unpleasant" [...] than Wuthering Heights. However, both novels, in his opinion, {{were constructed}} with an [...] "excessive clumsiness" [...] and [...] "the brutal element of human nature" [...] was equally [...] "given prominence" [...] in them. He continues: [...] " [...] seems a <b>convincing</b> <b>proof,</b> {{that there is}} nothing kindly in author's powerful mind, and that, if he continues to write novels, he will introduce into the land of romance a larger number of hateful men and women than any other author of the day. In Gilbert he sees [...] "nothing good, except rude honesty", and while acknowledging Helen's [...] "strong-mindedness", he finds no [...] "lovable or feminine virtues". Despite this, Whipple praised novels characterization: [...] "All the characters are drawn with great power and precision of outline, and the scenes are vivid as the life itself." [...] Helen's marriage to Arthur he sees as [...] "a reversal of the process carries on in Jane Eyre", but Arthur Huntingdon, in his opinion, is [...] "no Rochester". [...] "He is never virtuously inclined, except in those periods of illness and feebleness which his debaucheries have occasioned". Whipple concludes: [...] "The reader of Acton Bell gains no enlarged view of mankind, giving a healthy action to his sympathies, but is confined to a narrow space of life, and held down, as it were, by main force, to witness the wolfish side of his nature literally and logically set forth. But the criminal courts are not the places in which to take a comprehensive view of humanity and the novelist who confines his observation to them is not likely to produce any lasting impression except of horror and disgust".|$|E

He {{should never have been}} out in the first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez not to talk about the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single <b>convincing</b> <b>proof</b> that [...] had done any of the things they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
