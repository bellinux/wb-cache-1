40|$|Synopsis: The {{influence}} of some pozzolanic additions – such as silica fume, fly ash and ultra-fine amorphous colloidal silica (UFACS) – {{on the performance}} of superplasticized concrete was studied. Superplasticized mixtures in form of flowing (slump of 230 mm) or self-compacting <b>concretes</b> (<b>slump</b> flow of 735 mm) were manufactured all with a water-cement ratio as low as 0. 44, in order to produce high-performance concretes (HPC). They were cured at room temperature (20 °C) or steam-cured at 65 °C in order to simulate the manufacturing of pre-cast members. Concretes with ternary combinations of silica fume (15 - 20 kg/m 3), fly ash (30 - 40 kg/m 3) and UFACS (5 - 8 kg/m 3) perform better – in terms of strength and durability – than those with fly ash alone (60 kg/m 3) and approximately as those with silica fume alone (60 kg/m 3). Due to the reduced availability of silica fume on the market, these ternary combinations can reduce by 60 - 70 % the needed amount of silica fume for each pre-cast HPC element at a given performance level. Moreover, at later ages the strength reduction in steam-cured concretes with respect to the corresponding concretes cured at room temperature, is negligible or much lower in mixtures with the ternary combinations of pozzolanic additions...|$|R

40|$|Concrete workability, {{quantified}} by <b>concrete</b> <b>slump,</b> is {{an important}} property of a concrete mixture. <b>Concrete</b> <b>slump</b> is generally known to affect the consistency, flowability, pumpability, compactibility, and harshness of a concrete mix.

40|$|To date, {{the most}} {{commonly}} method for measuring fresh concrete’s workability on site in Indonesian is {{by means of the}} Abrams harder cone. Workability is measured as a numerical value called the slump number. This method is the oldest and most widely used test on site. On the contrary, two alternatives devices to measure workability of fresh concrete on the field exist. These are K – Slump Tester and the Kelly Ball. The K-Slump Tester rapidly and directly indicates workability of fresh concrete. The device has a pointed end for easy insertion into fresh concrete and a disc that controls the depth of penetration. When inserted, wet concrete enters the shaft through side openings and raises a floating plunger to give an estimate of <b>concrete</b> <b>slump.</b> Kelly Ball is also used to determining the consistency of fresh concrete on site.
