25|$|Optimal {{foraging}} theory (OFT) {{states that}} organisms forage {{in such a}} way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time. In other words, animals behave {{in such a way}} as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy that would seem suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an adaptation that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family. If a hunter-gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with <b>caloric</b> <b>value,</b> it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long as men and women share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical <b>caloric</b> <b>value</b> {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition.

The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12–$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3).

Analysis of various populations of Xanthium (cocklebur) indicated differences in chlorophyll levels and leaf chloroplasts ultrastructure between populations. The study also revealed some insight into intrapopulational variation in dark requirements for flowering of selected populations. In addition, <b>caloric</b> <b>values</b> of dried leaf material of cocklebur were analyzed for interpopulational differences.

40|$|The {{variation}} in {{energy in the}} muscles of the most representative fish species from three Neotropical Reservoirs was investigated to determine the effect of the reproductive process on the amount of energy allocated and a possible relationship between the general welfare of the species and their caloric content. Significant differences were detected between the sexes and among the stages of gonad maturity. In general, the {{variation in}} energy in the muscles indicate to be a function of the reproductive cycle. In most examined species, females presented the highest <b>caloric</b> <b>values,</b> reflecting physiological differences in their use of energy, relative to the reproductive process. However, there was no significant correlation between <b>caloric</b> <b>values</b> and the condition factor of any species. Significant differences in the caloric content and condition factor were identified in each species belonging different trophic groups, indicating an effect of food quality on the amount of energy stored in the muscles.

In addition, an effect of reproduction and feeding habit on energy allocation was observed in both sexes...|$|R
