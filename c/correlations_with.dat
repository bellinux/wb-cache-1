40|$|AIM: To {{research}} the correlation factor of the anterior segment values of eyes with different axial lengths. METHODS: In this study, 697 cases 697 eyes were included. According to axial length we divided {{all the cases}} into short axial length group, normal axial length group, mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group. The relevant indicators of the anterior segment values of patients in the five groups was comparatively analyzed. RESULTS: In the short axial length group, the anterior chamber volume(ACV) showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age; anterior chamber depth(ACD) showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age. In the normal axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> axial length(AXL); the anterior chamber angle(ACA) showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL, and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL. In the mild long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL, and a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACA showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL, and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> corneal curvature; the ACD showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age and a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL. In the moderate long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age; the ACA showed a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL; the ACD showed a significantly positive <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> AXL. In the severe long axial length group, the ACV showed a significantly negative <b>correlation</b> <b>with</b> age. There {{were no significant differences}} on ACV, ACA and ACD among mild long axial length group, moderate long axial length group and severe long axial length group(P > 0. 05), while the difference between other groups was significant(P CONCLUSION: There has a correlation between the anterior chamber values(ACV, ACA, ACD) age and AXL for eyes which AXL were 22 - 27 mm, while the correlation would disappear as the AXL became shorter or longer.

25|$|One {{approach}} to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys {{information contained in}} the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest.

25|$|A {{colloidal}} crystal is {{a highly}} ordered array of particles that forms over a long range (from a few millimeters to one centimeter in length); colloidal crystals have appearance and properties roughly analogous to their atomic or molecular counterparts. It {{has been known for}} many years that, due to repulsive Coulombic interactions, electrically charged macromolecules in an aqueous environment can exhibit long-range crystal-like <b>correlations,</b> <b>with</b> interparticle separation distances often being considerably greater than the individual particle diameter. Periodic arrays of spherical particles give rise to interstitial voids (the spaces between the particles), which act as a natural diffraction grating for visible light waves, when the interstitial spacing is of the same order of magnitude as the incident lightwave. In these cases in nature, brilliant iridescence (or play of colours) is attributed to the diffraction and constructive interference of visible lightwaves according to Bragg’s law, in a matter analogous to the scattering of X-rays in crystalline solid. The effects occur at visible wavelengths because the separation parameter d is much larger than for true crystals.|$|E
