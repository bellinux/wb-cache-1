On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. The planes dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling,</b> unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|With Ortona and Villa Grande captured, {{it looked}} as if it would require the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more {{concentrated}} blow at Orsogna to complete the breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. Drifting snow, sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. Montgomery—realising the Eighth Army no longer had the strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome—recommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted. Alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.|$|E

50|$|The North Vietnamese advance {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the seasonal monsoon, whose 500 ft <b>cloud</b> <b>ceilings</b> negated many U.S. airstrikes. PAVN advance elements were soon followed by anti-aircraft units armed with new ZSU-57-2 tracked weapon platforms and man-portable, shoulder-fired Grail missiles, which made low-level bombing attacks hazardous.|$|R

25|$|Up-slope fog or {{hill fog}} forms when winds blow air up a slope (called {{orographic}} lift), adiabatically cooling {{it as it}} rises, and causing the moisture in it to condense. This often causes freezing fog on mountaintops, where the <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> would not otherwise be low enough.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the accident, there was light rain and mist. The {{visibility}} was 4 kilometres with a <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> of 61 metres. The air temperature was 0°C with east-northeast winds at 37 kilometres per hour, gusting to 56 kilometres per hour. The aircraft had been cleared to land on Îles-de-la-Madeleine's Runway 07 prior to the crash.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2005, the {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at the}} Kennedy Space Center on board a C-17 Globemaster III for launch preparations. The launch of New Horizons was originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006 to allow for borescope inspections of the Atlas V's kerosene tank. Further delays related to low <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> conditions downrange, and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days. Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced {{the spacecraft}} to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by 2–4 years. The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39, at 19:00UTC on January 19, 2006.|$|E

Grünberg initially argued that weather conditions prohibited a safe takeoff but Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring intervened and ordered the jets to engage the enemy.|$|E
500|$|As the {{aircraft}} began taxiing to the departure runway, the rain intensified and visibility {{at the airport}} fell below the three mile minimum required for VFR flight. Cheyenne's control tower advised the Cessna about the reduced visibility and that the [...] "field is IFR". [...] In general, when an airport is officially IFR (normally because of reduced visibility or low <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling),</b> only IFR or special VFR operations are allowed. Reid then requested and received from the control tower a special VFR clearance {{to allow him to}} exit the airport's control zone visually, despite the reduced visibility.|$|E
500|$|Both {{flights of}} 56 Squadron {{took off from}} {{their side of the}} trench lines at 17:00 hours. They climbed into a sky {{overhung}} with a 300meter (1,000feet) thick <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> at 2,700meters (9,000feet) altitude, and crossed the lines over Bixschoote at 2,400meters (8,000feet). McCudden later noted there were lower scattered layered skeins of clouds, but horizontal visibility was fair. On the other hand, he saw ground visibility was veiled by haze. He also noted friendly aircraft swarming to the north as his flight approached the Battle of Passchendaele. Indeed, there were elements of at least eight Royal Flying Corps squadrons waging its offensive campaign over the battlefield. There was also considerable enemy air activity in the east, where German jastas waited for [...] "the customers to come into the shop". The overcast compressed air activity into lower levels instead of allowing its usual altitude range to about 6,000meters (20,000feet).|$|E
25|$|The initial launch day weather {{forecast}} {{called for a}} 90% chance of favorable launch conditions. As the launch preparations continued, due to lower <b>cloud</b> cover <b>ceilings</b> it was changed to 70% and at liftoff to 80%.|$|R

500|$|The chosen {{landing site}} {{was a small}} beach on the south shore of Hyane Harbour near the Momote {{airstrip}}. The airstrip could be seized quickly; but the surrounding area was mangrove swamp, and the harbour entrance was only about [...] wide. [...] "Since the whole operation was a gamble anyway," [...] Samuel Eliot Morison noted, [...] "one {{might as well be}} consistent." [...] The gamble paid off. The Japanese had not anticipated a landing at this point and the bulk of their forces were concentrated to defend the beaches of Seeadler Harbour, {{on the other side of}} the island. The weather on 29 February 1944 was overcast with a low <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> that prevented most of the planned air strike. Only three B-24s and nine B-25s found the target. The naval bombardment was therefore extended for another 15minutes. Each APD lowered four LCPRs (Landing Craft, Personnel, Ramped). Each LCPR carried its maximum load of 37men, who boarded by climbing over the APDs' sides and down cargo nets. The unarmoured LCPRs were still used because davits had not been strengthened to carry the heavier, armoured LCVP (Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel).|$|E
500|$|Senna {{achieved}} {{his first}} victory in Formula One at the 1985 Portuguese Grand Prix on 21 April. John Blunsden of The Times described the win as [...] "one {{of the most}} telling examples of supreme driving ability", while fellow driver Patrick Tambay described the race as a nightmare, as it was [...] "very, very flooded everywhere, the <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> very low and the light very poor". He won two races {{in each of his}} three years with Lotus before moving to McLaren for the 1988 season. He secured his first Formula One world championship that year and enjoyed his most successful season in terms of race wins. His eight victories that year set a new record for the most wins in a season, breaking the previous record of seven by Jim Clark. In the subsequent three seasons with McLaren, he won six or more races each season, securing two more Formula One world championship titles in 1990 and 1991. Senna managed only three victories in 1992. His final win in Formula One came at the final race of the 1993 season at the Australian Grand Prix. In all, Senna won 41 Grands Prix at seventeen different circuits.|$|E
500|$|Pines of Rome was {{the first}} piece Disney {{suggested}} for the film, {{as well as the}} first to be animated; designs appeared in the studio's dailies as early as October 1993. Butoy served as director with James Fujii handling the story. The opening to the piece gave Disney the idea of [...] "something flying". Butoy sketched the sequence on yellow Post-it notes. The story originally involved the whales flying around {{from the perspective of a}} group of penguins, but the idea was scrapped to make the baby whale a central character. The whales were also set to return to Earth but Butoy said it [...] "never felt quite right", leading to the decision to have them break through a <b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling</b> and enter a different world by the supernova. Butoy created a [...] "musical intensity chart" [...] for the animators to follow which [...] "tracked the ups and downs of the music... as the music brightens so does the color", and vice versa. He explained that because CGI was in its infancy during development, the first third of the segment was hand drawn using pencil to get a feel of how the whales would move. When the drawings were scanned into the CAPS system, Butoy found the whales were either moving too fast or had less weight to them. The drawings were altered to make the whales slow down and [...] "more believable". The eyes of the whales were drawn by hand, as the desired looks and glances were not fully achievable using CGI. Butoy recalled the challenge of having the water appear and move as naturally as possible; the team decided to write computer code from scratch as traditional animation would have been too time consuming and would have produced undesired results. The code handling the pod of whales was written so the whales would move away if they were to collide and not bump into, overlap, or go through each other. The same technique was used for the stampede scene in The Lion King (1994), which was produced at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Twenty-one NWS Center Weather Service Units (CWSU) are {{collocated}} {{with the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). Their main {{responsibility is to}} provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the National Airspace System. Beside scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the ARTCC and other FAA facilities, CWSU meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products. The Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an aviation weather warning for thunderstorms, icing, turbulence, and low <b>cloud</b> <b>ceilings</b> and visibilities. The Meteorological Impact Statement (MIS) is a two- to 12-hour forecast that outlines weather conditions expected to impact ARTCC operations.|$|R
5000|$|The West Kootenay Regional Airport, (Castlegar Airport) [...] {{is a small}} {{regional}} airport located [...] south southeast of Castlegar, British Columbia, Canada. It is {{owned and operated by}} the City of Castlegar, and has a 15317 sq ft passenger terminal. Due to the mountainous terrain impinging on both runway approaches, there is no possibility of a straight-in approach. The airport is therefore certified for day operations only, and the glideslope on approach is set to a steep 5.0° rather than the standard 3.0°. The instrument approaches to Castlegar are considered among the most challenging of any in use at a commercial airport in North America. As of 2011, the Dash-8s serving the airport required minimums of 3400 foot <b>cloud</b> <b>ceilings</b> and three miles visibility (Air Canada Jazz adds 100 feet and one mile to these minimums).|$|R

40|$|Accurate weather {{forecasts}} {{are vital}} to air combat operations. Quantitative assessments of forecasts and their operational impacts are essential to improving weather support for war fighters. We adapted an existing U. S. Navy, web-based, near-real time system for collecting and analyzing data on the performance and operational impacts of military forecasts. We used the adapted system to collect and analyze data on Air Force Weather (AFW) forecasts, and the planning and execution of flying operations, at six Air Combat Command and Pacific Air Forces bases. We analyzed the data to develop quantitative metrics of forecast performance and operational impacts. Our results indicate that planning weather forecasts (PWFs) have a higher potential for making positive contributions to air operations than do mission execution forecasts (MEFs). This is notable because AFW units spend significantly less time developing PWFs than MEFs. Surface visibility, <b>cloud</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and <b>cloud</b> layers caused most negative mission impacts, indicating these phenomena should be a focus of future research and training. We found high levels of mission success even when forecasts were inaccurate, perhaps due to aircrew and mission flexibility. Our analyses revealed a need for improved education of flying units on the nature and availability of AFW products...|$|R

2500|$|Sets {{of surface}} {{measurements}} are important data to meteorologists. They give {{a snapshot of}} a variety of weather conditions at one single location and are usually at a weather station, a ship or a weather buoy. The measurements taken at a weather station can include any number of atmospheric observables. Usually, temperature, pressure, wind measurements, and humidity are the variables that are measured by a thermometer, barometer, anemometer, and hygrometer, respectively. Professional stations may also include air quality sensors (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, dust, and smoke), ceilometer (<b>cloud</b> <b>ceiling),</b> falling precipitation sensor, [...] flood sensor, lightning sensor, microphone (explosions, sonic booms, thunder), pyranometer/pyrheliometer/spectroradiometer (IR/Vis/UV photodiodes), rain gauge/snow gauge, scintillation counter (background radiation, fallout, radon), seismometer (earthquakes and tremors), transmissometer (visibility), and a GPS clock for data logging. Upper air data are of crucial importance for weather forecasting. The most widely used technique is launches of radiosondes. Supplementing the radiosondes a network of aircraft collection is organized by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E

40|$|U. S. weather {{stations}} operated by NOAA’s National Weather Service (NWS) have undergone {{significant changes in}} reporting and measuring <b>cloud</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Stations operated by the Department of Defense have maintained more consistent reporting practices. By comparing cloud-ceiling data from 223 NWS first-order stations with those from 117 military stations, and by further comparison with changes in physically related parameters, inhomogeneous records, including all NWS records based only on automated observing systems and the military records prior to the early 1960 s, were identified and discarded. Data from the two networks were then used to determine changes in daytime ceiling height (the above-ground height of the lowest sky-cover layer {{that is more than}} half opaque) and ceiling occurrence frequency (percentage of total observations that have ceilings) over the contiguous United States since the 1950 s. Cloud-ceiling height in the surface– 3. 6 -km layer generally increased during 1951 – 2003, with more sig-nificant changes in the period after the early 1970 s and in the surface– 2 -km layer. These increases were mostly over the western United States and in the coastal regions. No significant change was found in surface– 3. 6 -km ceiling occurrence during 1951 – 2003, but during the period since the early 1970 s, there is a tendency for a decrease in frequency of ceilings with height below 3. 6 km. Cloud-ceiling heights above 3. 6 km have shown no significant changes in the past 30 yr, but there has been an increase in frequency, consistent with the increase in ceiling height below 3. 6 km. For the surface– 3. 6 -km layer, physically con-sistent changes were identified as related to changes in ceiling height and frequency of occurrence. This included reductions in precipitation frequency related to low ceiling frequency, and surface warming and decreasing relative humidity accompanying increasing ceiling heights during the past 30 yr. 1...|$|R
