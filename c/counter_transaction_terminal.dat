40|$|Abstract: Cryptoprocessors feature an on-chip {{block cipher}} {{hardware}} between the cache {{and the bus}} interface. Code and data are decrypted on-the-fly while being fetched from RAM and are encrypted while being written into RAM. Even someone with full physical access to the printed circuit board cannot observe the executed cleartext software and its data structures. Cryptoprocessors {{have been used for}} many years as microcontrollers in security sensitive applications like financial <b>transaction</b> <b>terminals.</b> This paper explores the hardware, firmware, operating system, and key management mechanisms necessary in order to apply the cryptoprocessor concept in multitasking operating system workstations...|$|R
50|$|This {{notational}} {{scheme is}} not strictly accurate, because the <b>transaction</b> <b>counter</b> is 21 bits, {{which is not}} an even multiple of 4 (the number of bits in a hex digit). Consequently, the <b>transaction</b> <b>counter</b> actually consumes one bit of the field that is the TRSM ID (in this example {{that means that the}} TRSM ID field can accommodate 2(5*4-1) devices, instead of 2(5*4), or about half a million).|$|R

Operating a card terminal requires a provider contract with the network operator. The data collected by the terminal is processed by the provider. For the time the terminal is in use the user (for example, the retailer) can contact the service provider. He can call a hotline and is guaranteed on-site technical support by a technician. He has a contact person who helps with questions about the account, transaction control, managing the contract, etc.|$|R

This problem is crucial on embedded systems like financial <b>transaction</b> <b>terminals,</b> pay-TV access-control decoders, where adversaries may easily gain full physical accesses to the systems and critical algorithms {{must be protected}} from being cracked. However, as this paper points out that protecting software with either encryption or obfuscation cannot completely preclude the control flow information from being leaked. Encryption has been widely studied and employed as a traditional approach for software protection, however, the control flow information is not 100 % hidden with solely encrypting the code. On the other hand, pure software-based obfuscation has been proved inefficient to protect software due to its lack of theoretical foundation and considerable performance overhead introduced by complicate...|$|R

50|$|In {{practical}} applications, {{one would}} have several BDKs on record, possibly for different customers, or to contain the scope of key compromise. When processing transactions, {{it is important for}} the receiver to know which BDK was used to initialize the originating device. To achieve this, the 80-bit KSN is structured into three parts: as Key Set ID, a TRSM ID, and the <b>transaction</b> <b>counter.</b> The algorithm specifies that the <b>transaction</b> <b>counter</b> is 21-bits, but treats the remaining 59 bits opaquely (the algorithm only specifies that unused bits be 0-padded to a nibble boundary, and then 'f' padded to the 80-bit boundary). Because of this, the entity managing the creation of the DUKPT devices (typically a merchant acquirer) is free to subdivide the 59 bits according to their preference.|$|R

[...] The company's most popular current products include the Omni 3700 Family, featuring the Omni 3750 and Omni 3740. In 2004, Verifone introduced its newest line of products, Vx Solutions (also called VerixV). These include the Vx510, Vx520 and Vx570, which are countertop terminals offering dial-up or Ethernet access, and the Vx610 and Vx670 which are portable, include batteries, and an integrated wireless communications module. The Vx610 is offered in GPRS, CDMA, and WiFi wireless configurations, and is considered a 'countertop mobile' product. The Vx670 is a true portable or 'handover' version available with GPRS, WiFi, and as of November 2007, Bluetooth-integrated communications modules.The Vx670, in particular, is a deterrent against the theft of credit information because the customer {{is not required to}} relinquish possession of his or her credit card; instead transacting directly with the Vx670 in a 'pay at table' sense. The Vx510 is repackaged as Omni 3730, capitalizing the huge sales of the Omni 3700 series. A derivative of Omni3730 is the Omni 3750LE, which has reduced features, but lower price.

40|$|In the photo, {{employees}} of the UAB Bank, Knoxville, Tennessee, are using Teller <b>Transaction</b> <b>Terminals</b> manufactured by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama, an electronics firm which has worked {{on a number of}} space projects under contract with NASA. The terminals are part of an advanced, computerized financial transaction system that offers high efficiency in bank operations. The key to the system's efficiency is a "multiplexing" technique developed for NASA's Space Shuttle. Multiplexing is simultaneous transmission of large amounts of data over a single transmission link at very high rates of speed. In the banking application, a small multiplex "data bus" interconnects all the terminals and a central computer which stores information on clients' accounts. The data bus replaces the maze-of wiring that would be needed to connect each terminal separately and it affords greater speed in recording transactions. The SCI system offers banks real-time data management through constant updating of the central computer. For example, a check is immediately cancelled at the teller's terminal and the computer is simultaneously advised of the transaction; under other methods, the check would be cancelled and the transaction recorded at the close of business. Teller checkout {{at the end of the}} day, conventionally a time-consuming matter of processing paper, can be accomplished in minutes by calling up a summary of the day's transactions. SCI manufactures other types of terminals for use in the system, such as an administrative terminal that provides an immediate printout of a client's account, and another for printing and recording savings account deposits and withdrawals. SCI systems have been installed in several banks in Tennessee, Arizona, and Oregon and additional installations are scheduled this year...|$|R

5000|$|A {{transaction}} processing capability {{was developed in}} the late 1960s as a joint project with United Airlines and later refined in another joint project with Air Canada. This capability was fully integrated into the operating system in 1972 and became the basis of much of the future growth of the 1100 Series. Early users controlled communication lines directly from within their real time programs. Part of the development of {{transaction processing}} included a communication message system that managed the communication lines and presented messages to Exec 8 to be scheduled as transactions. This moved all the low level communication physical line management and protocols out of the applications and into the CMS 1100 application. [...] CMS 1100 itself ran as a real time multi-threaded program with the privilege of acquiring control of communication lines and submitting transaction messages for scheduling. This led to the notions in Exec 8 that applications of any nature needed to be carefully controlled to ensure that they could not cause integrity issues. Security was certainly a concern, but in the early days system reliability and integrity were much larger issues. The system was still primarily batch and transaction processing and there was little chance that anyone could install unauthorized code on the system. CMS 1100 later added the capability to be the interface for demand terminals as well as <b>transaction</b> <b>terminals</b> so that terminals could be used for both and the early terminal drivers could be removed from the Exec. CMS 1100 was later replaced by a combination of CPComm (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform) and SILAS (System Interface for Legacy Application Systems).For the Intel-based Dorado server models, the lower level communications were moved to firmware, with the upper levels handled by SILAS and CPCommOS (ClearPath Enterprise Servers Communications Platform for Open Systems).|$|R
