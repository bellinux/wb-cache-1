25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caball√©:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been <b>closed.</b> <b>Behind</b> it was {{sleeping}} not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, {{to do things that}} were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.|$|E
25|$|Devil May Cry 2 {{begins with}} Dante meeting an associate, Lucia, in a museum. She invites him to Dumary Island, where he meets her mother, Matier. She asks {{for his help}} in {{fighting}} Arius, a businessman who wields demonic power and is planning to use a collection of magic artifacts, the Arcana, to call forth a devil lord known as Argosax. Dante flips a coin, {{and based on the}} result, he decides to help. Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that she was his creation. Shortly afterward, Lucia gives Dante the last of the Arcana before leaving to face Arius alone. Dante then encounters Matier who asks Dante to take the Arcana to save Lucia from Arius. Lucia attacks Arius, though he captures her. Dante arrives and trades the Arcana for Lucia, then attacks Arius, who escapes. A large stream of energy strikes the Ouroboros tower and a portal to the demon world is opened. Dante and Lucia argue over who will enter, but Dante flips his coin to determine that he will be the one to go. After Dante departs, Arius returns to the human world, though Lucia goes on to defeat him. Within the portal, Dante fights and defeats the partially summoned Argosax. Finding the portal <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> him, Dante instead drives further into the demon realm on a motorcycle. In the aftermath of the battle, Matier insists to Lucia that Sparda returned from a similar trip. Sometime later in Dante's shop, Lucia muses about Dante and examines the coin he gave her, discovering it is two-headed. Outside the sound of a motorcycle echoes, and Lucia leaves to investigate. The player is not shown {{whether or not it is}} Dante.|$|E
500|$|Boris hasn't reappeared by {{the time}} Tommy's best friend, Chuckie Finster, and his dad, Chas, arrive to join the celebration; when the Seder begins the {{children}} set off to search for toys, eventually finding Boris in the attic. Boris explains that he felt bad about yelling at Minka, and had gone to look for her mother's wine glasses, but had become locked inside when the door <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> him (it can't open from the inside). Angelica tests the door, and inadvertently locks them all in again.|$|E

2500|$|In {{fulfilment}} of {{the promise}} of peaceful life, symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head (Leviticus Rabbah x., Midrash Teh. cxxxiii. 1), Aaron's death, {{as described in the}} Haggadah, was of a wonderful tranquility. Accompanied by Moses, his brother, and by Eleazar, his son, Aaron went to the summit of Mount Hor, where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view. [...] "Take off thy priestly raiment and place it upon thy son Eleazar!" [...] said Moses; [...] "and then follow me." [...] Aaron did as commanded; and they entered the cave, where was prepared a bed around which angels stood. [...] "Go lie down upon thy bed, my brother," [...] Moses continued; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur. Then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God. The cave <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> Moses as he left; and he went down the hill with Eleazar, with garments rent, and crying: [...] "Alas, Aaron, my brother! thou, the pillar of supplication of Israel!" [...] When the Israelites cried in bewilderment, [...] "Where is Aaron?" [...] angels were seen carrying Aaron's bier through the air. A voice was then heard saying: [...] "The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found on his lips: he walked with me in righteousness, and brought many back from sin" [...] (Malachi 2:6). He died, according to Seder Olam Rabbah ix., R. H. 2, 3a, on the first of Ab." [...] The pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel's camp disappeared at Aaron's death (see Seder 'Olam, ix. and R. H. 2b-3a). The seeming contradiction between Numbers 20:22 et seq. and Deuteronomy 10:6 is solved by the rabbis in the following manner: Aaron's death on Mount Hor was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Arad, in consequence of which the Israelites fled, marching seven stations backward to Mosera, where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron; wherefore it is said: [...] "There [...] died Aaron." ...|$|E
