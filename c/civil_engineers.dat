Homer announced the creation of an advisory panel headed by the American Society of <b>Civil</b> <b>Engineers.</b> The panel had about two months to evaluate options for completing the line through Tysons Corner, with the results presented to the state on July 27, 2006 and published on July 31, 2006.|$|E

The first of these was {{as chairman of the}} Association of Consulting Engineers between 1949 and 1950, an association of which he was made an honorary member in 1984. Paton served on the council of the Institution of <b>Civil</b> <b>Engineers</b> from 1954 to 1959 and again from 1961 to 1966. He was elected vice president of that institution, a position he filled from 1966 to 1970 when he was elected president.

5|$|The Students' Observatory was {{constructed}} in 1886 on the Berkeley campus, with the original funds provided by the California legislature {{in order for the}} observatory to provide practical training to <b>civil</b> <b>engineers.</b> Very quickly, the Students' Observatory became seen as a training ground for students studying astronomy, so that they would be better prepared to go on to use the facilities at Lick Observatory. This contributed to the separation of the departments of civil engineering and astronomy in the mid-1890s, with the Students' Observatory becoming the home of the Berkeley Astronomy Department.|$|E

5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a yardstick by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chairman Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country for defense purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of <b>Civil</b> <b>Engineers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Greene built railroads in {{six states}} and {{designed}} municipal sewage and water systems for Washington, D.C., Detroit, {{and several other}} cities. In New York City, he designed the Croton Aqueduct reservoir in Central Park and the enlarged High Bridge over the Harlem River. He was one of twelve founders in New York City of the American Society of <b>Civil</b> <b>Engineers</b> and Architects. While {{on a trip to}} Maine for railroad surveying, he met Martha Barrett Dana, daughter of Samuel Dana, a prominent Massachusetts politician. They were married in Charlestown, Massachusetts, on February 21, 1837. They had six children together, including four sons (three of them later served in the military), one daughter, and one son who died in infancy.|$|E
5|$|In 1800 the <b>civil</b> <b>engineers</b> William Jessop and John Rennie {{assisted}} local engineers {{with plans}} for improvements, the chief of which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and the diesel engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E
