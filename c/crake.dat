5|$|Crex {{is a small}} genus {{of birds}} in the rail family. It {{contains}} two species, the corn <b>crake,</b> C. crex, which breeds across Europe and Asia and winters in southern Africa, and the African <b>crake,</b> C. egregia, which migrates within Africa. Both are short-billed rails with blackish-brown upperparts, mainly blue-grey underparts, and barring on the flanks. The corn <b>crake</b> is significantly larger than its relative, and has a distinctive chestnut patch on its wings. Unusually for their family, these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows, and the African <b>crake</b> in dry grassland. The African <b>crake</b> is sometimes given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the small}} crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the corn <b>crake</b> is the African <b>crake,</b> C. egregia. This was first described as Ortygometra egregria by Wilhelm Peters in 1854 from a specimen obtained in Mozambique, and has variously been placed in the genus Porzana or its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. The Porzana crakes are the closest relatives of the Crex genus, particularly the ash-throated <b>crake,</b> Porzana albicollis, which has occasionally also been allocated to Crex.|$|E

5|$|Most European {{countries}} have {{taken steps to}} conserve the corn <b>crake</b> and produce national management policies; {{there is also an}} overall European action plan. The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival, principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting. Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed, and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing. Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale. Reduction of illegal hunting, and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed, are also conservation aims. Reintroduction of the corn <b>crake</b> is being attempted in England, and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries. Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas, there are cost implications, estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn <b>crake.</b> The corn <b>crake</b> {{does not appear to be}} seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation, which creates more open habitats.|$|E
5|$|The African <b>crake</b> {{is smaller}} than the corn <b>crake,</b> which also has darker upperparts, a plain grey face and {{different}} underparts barring pattern. In flight, the African species has shorter, blunter wings with a less prominent white leading edge, and deeper wingbeats than its relative. Other sympatric crakes are smaller with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and a shorter bill. The African rail has dark brown upperparts, a long red bill and red legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|The corn <b>crake</b> is a {{difficult}} bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation, but will sometimes emerge into the open. Occasionally, individuals may become very trusting; for five consecutive summers, an individual <b>crake</b> on the Scottish island of Tiree entered a kitchen to feed on scraps, and, in 1999, a wintering Barra bird would come for poultry feed once the chickens had finished. In Africa, it is more secretive than the African <b>crake,</b> and, unlike its relative, it is rarely seen in the open, although it occasionally feeds on tracks or road sides. The corn <b>crake</b> is most active early and late in the day, after heavy rain and during light rain. Its typical flight is weak and fluttering, although less so {{than that of the}} African <b>crake.</b> For longer flights, such as migration, it has a steadier, stronger action with legs drawn up. It walks with a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass with its body held horizontal and laterally flattened. It will swim if essential. When flushed by a dog, it will fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then crouch on landing. If disturbed in the open, this <b>crake</b> will often run in a crouch for a short distance, with its neck stretched forward, then stand upright to watch the intruder. When captured it may feign death, recovering at once if it sees a way out.|$|E

50|$|The Kotuku {{and more}} than 76 other bird species have been {{recorded}} at Ōkārito. These species include migratory waders, gulls, shags and terns on the estuarine mud flats as well as black swans, scaup, crested grebes, and ducks in freshwater areas. Tui, bellbird, kingfishers, pigeon, <b>crakes,</b> fern birds, and bitterns and <b>crakes</b> inhabit the wetland areas.|$|R
5|$|The corn <b>crake</b> is {{sympatric}} {{with the}} African <b>crake</b> on the wintering grounds, {{but can be}} distinguished by its larger size, paler upperparts, tawny upperwing and different underparts pattern. In flight, it has longer, less rounded wings, and shallower wingbeats than its African relative, and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing. In both the breeding and wintering ranges {{it is unlikely to}} be confused with any other rails, since sympatric species are smaller, with white markings on the upperparts, different underparts patterns and shorter bills. A flying corn <b>crake</b> can resemble a gamebird, but its chestnut wing pattern and dangling legs are diagnostic.|$|E
5|$|The corn <b>crake,</b> {{corncrake}} or landrail (Crex crex) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family. It breeds in Europe and Asia as far east as western China, and migrates to Africa for the northern hemisphere's winter. It is a medium-sized <b>crake</b> with buff- or grey-streaked brownish-black upperparts, chestnut markings on the wings, and blue-grey underparts with rust-coloured and white bars on the flanks and undertail. The strong bill is flesh-toned, the iris is pale brown, and the legs and feet are pale grey. Juveniles are similar in plumage to adults, and downy chicks are black, as with all rails. There are no subspecies, although individuals from {{the east of the}} breeding range tend to be slightly paler than their western counterparts. The male's call is a loud krek krek, from which the scientific name is derived. The corn <b>crake</b> is larger than its closest relative, the African <b>crake,</b> which shares its wintering range; that species is also darker-plumaged, and has a plainer face.|$|E
5|$|The rails are a bird family {{comprising}} nearly 150 species. Although {{origins of}} the group are lost in antiquity, {{the largest number of}} species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the corn <b>crake</b> is the African <b>crake,</b> C. egregia, which has sometimes been given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. Both species are short-billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails. Porzana crakes, particularly the ash-throated <b>crake</b> (Porzana albicollis) are near relatives of the Crex genus.|$|E
50|$|The Little Belt is a {{protected}} wetland under the Ramsar Convention and a particularly important spot for breeding and migrating birds.

5|$|Two extinct flightless {{species of}} rail were {{at one time}} placed in the genus Atlantisia with the Inaccessible Island rail. The Ascension <b>crake</b> (Mundia elpenor) and the Saint Helena {{swamphen}} (Aphanocrex podarces) were once considered congeners of A. rogersi. The Ascension <b>crake</b> disappeared some time before 1700 but was briefly mentioned and described by traveller and hobby naturalist Peter Mundy in 1656. The Saint Helena swamphen disappeared before 1600 {{and has never been}} encountered alive by scientists. In 1973 Olson synonymised the genus Aphanocrex with the genus Atlantisia, and described the Ascension <b>crake</b> as being congeneric. Today they are considered to have evolved independently (with A. podarces probably not even being closely related), and in 2003 the genus Mundia was erected and the Saint Helena swamphen moved back to Aphanocrex, leaving the Inaccessible Island rail the only species in the genus Atlantisia. Both the Ascension <b>crake</b> and the Saint Helena swamphen became extinct due to predation by introduced species, mainly cats and rats.|$|E
5|$|A smallish <b>crake,</b> the African <b>crake</b> has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, {{and a white}} line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye stripe. The African <b>crake</b> has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3–11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African <b>crake</b> feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|Although {{survival}} in undisturbed sites is high, at 80–90%, the corn <b>crake</b> suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn <b>crake</b> chick survival is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower {{survival in}} large broods.|$|E

5|$|Both Crex {{species have}} huge {{breeding}} ranges, estimated at 15,700,000km2 (4,500,000mi2) for the African <b>crake</b> and 12,400,000km2 (4,800,000mi2) for the corn <b>crake.</b> The population {{size of the}} African species is unknown, but it is common in most of its range, and its numbers appear to be stable. The European bird has an estimated 1.3–2.0 million breeding pairs in Europe, three-quarters {{of which are in}} European Russia, and a further 515,000–1,240,000 pairs in Asiatic Russia; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5.45 and 9.72 million individuals. Both species are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. The corn <b>crake</b> was formerly classified as near-threatened because of serious declines in Europe, but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased in Russia and Kazakhstan. Although most rails in the Old World are covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA), neither Crex species is listed, being too terrestrial to be classed as wetland species.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, Crex {{species may}} be hunted by the leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, and black sparrowhawk. In South Africa, newly hatched African <b>crake</b> chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African <b>crake</b> in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This <b>crake</b> is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E
50|$|Immature Baillon's <b>crakes</b> {{are similar}} to the adults, but have {{extensively}} barred underparts. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.|$|R
500|$|John Clare, {{the nineteenth-century}} English poet based in Northamptonshire, wrote [...] "The Landrail", a semi-comic piece which is {{primarily}} {{about the difficulty}} of seeing corn <b>crakes</b> – as opposed to hearing them. In the fourth verse he exclaims: [...] "Tis like a fancy everywhere/A sort of living doubt". Clare wrote about corn <b>crakes</b> in his prose works too, and his writings help to clarify the distribution of this rail when it was far more widespread than now.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like other}} <b>crakes,</b> it feeds on small fish, molluscs, worms and insects (beetles, {{grasshoppers}} and caterpillars). Large grasshoppers shaken about and battered before swallowing.|$|R
5|$|The African <b>crake</b> (Crex egregia) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family that breeds in most of sub-Saharan Africa away from the arid south and southwest. It is {{seasonally}} common in most of its range other than the rainforests and areas that have low annual rainfall. This <b>crake</b> is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow it to breed elsewhere. There have been a few records of vagrant birds reaching Atlantic islands. This species nests {{in a wide variety of}} grassland types, and agricultural land with tall crops may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Both Crex crakes {{are mainly}} active during the day, {{especially}} at dawn, dusk, during light rain, or after heavier rain. The African <b>crake</b> is less skulking {{and easier to}} flush from cover than other crakes, and is often seen {{at the edges of}} roads and tracks, but the corn <b>crake</b> is a much more difficult bird to see in its breeding sites, usually being hidden by vegetation and rarely emerging into the open. Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings, flanks and belly like a fan. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking.|$|E
5|$|Most rails are secretive wetland {{birds that}} have made little {{cultural}} impression, but as a formerly common farmland bird with a loud nocturnal call that sometimes led to disturbed sleep for rural dwellers, the corn <b>crake</b> has acquired a variety of folk names and some commemoration in literature.|$|E
