50|$|In golf, bounce or bounce {{angle is}} the angle inscribed by <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of a golfing iron (particularly a wedge), {{the sole of}} the club, and the ground. In plainer terms, bounce angle is an {{indication}} of how much the sole, or bottom-most part, of the club head lifts <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> A high bounce angle (angles of 12-15° are not uncommon) indicates a sole which lifts <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> significantly, whereas a club with little or no bounce allows <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> to contact <b>the</b> ground without interference.|$|R

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{is a highly}} complex process that requires the extension of cell membrane {{in the direction of}} travel. This membrane is continuously remodeled to expand <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> and alter its membrane properties. For a long time it has been known that there is a continual flow of polarized membrane traffic towards <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> during migration and that this trafficking is essential for cell migration. However, there is little information on how the cell coordinates exocytosis at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> It is also unclear whether these internal membranes are incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> or are just delivering the necessary proteins for migration to occur. We have shown that recycling endosome membrane is incorporated into the plasma membrane at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> to expand <b>the</b> membrane {{and at the same time}} delivers receptors to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> to mediate migration. In order for this to happen the surface Q-SNARE complex Stx 4 /SNAP 23 translocates to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> where it binds to the R-SNARE VAMP 3 on the recycling endosome allowing incorporation into the plasma membrane.

40|$|Chemotaxis of amoeboid {{cells is}} driven by actin {{filaments}} in leading pseudopodia and actin–myosin filaments {{in the back and}} {{at the side of the}} cell to suppress pseudopodia. In Dictyostelium, cGMP plays an important role during chemotaxis and is produced predominantly by a soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). The sGC protein is enriched in extending pseudopodia at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> cell during chemotaxis. We show here that the sGC protein and the cGMP product have different functions during chemotaxis, using two mutants that lose either catalytic activity (sGCΔcat) or localization to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> (sGCΔN). Cells expressing sGCΔN exhibit excellent cGMP formation and myosin localization in the back of the cell, but they exhibit poor orientation at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Cells expressing <b>the</b> catalytically dead sGCΔcat mutant show poor myosin localization at the back, but excellent localization of the sGC protein at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> where it enhances the probability that a new pseudopod is made in proximity to previous pseudopodia, resulting in a decrease of the degree of turning.

40|$|The active forward {{movement}} of cells is {{often associated with}} the rearward transport of particles over the surfaces of their lamellae. Unlike the rest of the lamella, we found that <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> (within 0. 5 microns of the cell boundary) is specialized for rearward transport of membrane-bound particles, such as Con A-coated latex microspheres. Using a single-beam optical gradient trap (optical tweezers) to apply restraining forces to particles, we can capture, move and release particles at will. When first bound on the central lamellar surface, Con A-coated particles would diffuse randomly; when such bound particles were brought to <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> lamella with the optical tweezers, they were often transported rearward. As in our previous studies, particle transport occurred with a concurrent decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient, consistent with attachment to the cytoskeleton. For particles at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> lamella, weak attachment to the cytoskeleton and transport occurred with a half- time of 3 s; equivalent particles elsewhere on the lamella showed no detectable attachment when monitored for several minutes. Particles held on the cell surface by the laser trap attached more strongly to the cytoskeleton with time. These particles could escape a trapping force of 0. 7 X 10 (- 6) dyne after 18 +/- 14 (sd) s at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> and after 64 +/- 34 (SD) s elsewhere on the lamella.
