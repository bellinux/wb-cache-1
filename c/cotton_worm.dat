40|$|Abstract Background <b>Cotton</b> <b>worm</b> {{is one of}} {{the main}} insects of soybean in {{southern}} China. Plants may acquire defense mechanisms that confer protection from predation by herbivores. Induced responses can lead to increased resistance against herbivores in many species. This study focuses on searching changed proteins in soybean defense response induced by <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> feeding. Results Ten protein spots that are changed in abundance in response to <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> feeding were identified by Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). A total of 11 unique proteins from these spots were identified by MALDI-TOF MS. The mRNA and protein relative expression levels of most changed proteins were up-regulated. These proteins were mainly involved in physiological processes, including active oxygen removal, defense signal transduction, and metabolism regulation. Conclusion This is the first proteomic analysis of the soybean defense response induced by <b>cotton</b> <b>worm.</b> The differentially expressed proteins could work together to play a major role in the induced defense response. PAL and SAMS were up-regulated at both the protein and mRNA levels. These genes can be strongest candidates for further functional research. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} {{of plant}} defenses by insect feeding is regulated via multiple signaling cascades. One of them, ethylene signaling, increases susceptibility of Arabidopsis to the generalist herbivore Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The hookless 1 mutation, which affects a downstream component of ethylene signaling, conferred resistance to Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> {{as compared with}} wild-type plants. Likewise, ein 2, a mutant in a central component of the ethylene signaling pathway, caused enhanced resistance to Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> that was similar in magnitude to hookless 1. Moreover, pretreatment of plants with ethephon (2 -chloroethanephosphonic acid), a chemical that releases ethylene, elevated plant susceptibility to Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm.</b> By contrast, these mutations in the ethylene-signaling pathway had no detectable effects on diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) feeding. It is surprising {{that this is not}} due to nonactivation of defense signaling, because diamondback moth does induce genes that relate to wound-response pathways. Of these wound-related genes, jasmonic acid regulates a novel β-glucosidase 1 (BGL 1), whereas ethylene controls a putative calcium-binding elongation factor hand protein.

Arabidopsis contains two vsp genes and real-time quantitative PCR allowed us to characterize their differential expression.

These results clearly demonstrate that VSPs are part of the local plant response to herbivore attack. To obtain additional information on vsp regulation, we analysed a fusion of a soybean vspB promoter fragment to the ??-glucuronidase gene in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.

Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Xanthi) and Arabidopsis [Heynh. ] ecotype Wassilewskija) transgenic plants expressing the mustard trypsin PI 2 (MTI- 2) at different levels were obtained. First-instar larvae of the Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis Boisd.) were fed on detached leaves of these plants.

However, larvae fed leaves from plants expressing MTI- 2 at the low expression level did not show increased mortality, but a net gain in weight and a faster development compared with control larvae. The low MTI- 2 expression level also resulted in increased leaf damage. These observations are correlated with the differential expression of digestive proteinases in the larval gut; overexpression of existing proteinases on low-MTI- 2 -expression level plants and induction of new proteinases on high-MTI- 2 -expression level plants.

One of them corresponds to a family of cathepsin D inhibitors (CDIs) described in potato (Solanum tuberosum), involving up to 15 isoforms with a high sequence similarity. In this work, we describe a tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) wound-inducible protein called jasmonic-induced protein 21 (JIP 21). Sequence analysis of its cDNA predicted a putative function as a CDI. The JIP 21 gene, whose protein has been demonstrated to be glycosylated, is constitutively expressed in flowers, stem, and fruit, and is inducible to high levels by wounding and methyl jasmonate in leaves of tomato plants. The genomic sequence of JIP 21 shows that the gene is intronless and reveals the presence of both a methyl jasmonate box (TGACT) and a G-box (CACGT) in the promoter. In contrast to the presumed role of JIP 21 based on sequence analysis, a detailed biochemical characterization of the purified protein uncovers a different function as a strong chymotrypsin inhibitor, which questions the previously predicted inhibitory activity against aspartic proteinases. Moreover, Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) larvae fed on transgenic tomato plants overexpressing JIP 21 present an increase in mortality and a delay in growth when compared with larvae fed on wild-type plants. These larvae belong to the Lepidoptera family whose main digestive enzymes have been described as being Ser proteases. All these results support the notion that tomato JIP 21 should be considered as a chymotrypsin inhibitor belonging to the Ser proteinase inhibitors rather than a CDI.

40|$|Photosynthesis is {{the most}} {{important}} process for nearly all life on earth. Photosynthetic organisms capture and transfer light energy from the sun into chemical energy which in turn provides a resource base for heterotrophic organisms. Natural light regimes are irregular and vary over magnitudes. At a certain light intensity, metabolic processes cannot keep up with the electron flow produced by the primary photoreactions, and thus reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced. ROS are highly reactive and can damage the photosynthesis apparatus and hence plants have evolved several photoprotection mechanisms to avoid the formation of ROS. The aim of this thesis was to examine the ecological effects of variations in photoprotection in plants. In particular I wanted to study the effect on fitness and the interaction with herbivorous insects of plants with different ability in photoprotection. To study this I used wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants and grew them under natural conditions in field experiments in our botanical garden in Umeå, northern Sweden. For the investigation of the plant-insect interaction, a specialist on Brassicaceae (Plutella xylostella – diamondback moth) and a generalist herbivore (Spodoptera littoralis - Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>worm)</b> were used. Plants that are genetically deficient in one of the photoprotection mechanisms showed reduced fitness under natural conditions. I could thus show that feedback de-excitation (FDE) {{is the most}} important photoprotection mechanism, because a lack of FDE showed the highest reduction in fitness. The comparison of field grown wild-type with FDE mutant plants, using molecular biology methods, revealed large changes in gene transcription and metabolic composition. In particular, the jasmonate pathway was upregulated in light stressed plants, especially in plants lacking FDE. Jasmonate in turn is known to be a chemical compound which induces herbivore resistance genes and other stress responses. Specialist and generalist insect herbivores responded differently in feeding (dual-choice and no-choice) and oviposition experiments with field grown plants that differed in FDE. Female diamondback moths were attracted by induced defense compounds whereas the larvae avoided these plants in feeding experiments. Generalist larvae preferred, and showed a higher survival rate, on less light-stressed plants compared to more light-stressed plants. Combining molecular biology with ecological experiments is a challenging task. To summarize my experiences, I have produced a guide for experiments on transgenic plants in common gardens. In future investigations it is important to examine natural variations in photoprotection to elucidate selection pressures on specific genes...|$|E

Secondary metabolites were extracted, and ethyl acetate extracts of A. alternata (MG 786545), C. lunata (MF 113056), and N. sphaerica (MF 113055) were tested for their insecticidal activity by both techniques. C. lunata (MF 113056) showed the most potent pathogenicity causing 60 % mortality after 7 [*]days by dipping bioassay, while A. solani (MG 7865453) and A. alternata (MG 786545) caused 40 and 33.3 % mortality, respectively. All tested endophytes showed no effect against S. littoralis by residual film method. N. sphaerica ethyl acetate extract activated larval feeding on castor leaves causing 25 % mortality by residual film at 2000 [*]mg/l.|$|R
40|$|International audienceInsects show {{behavioural}} plasticity {{based on}} their physiological state. Deprivation from a resource will normally make them more responsive to it or to perform behaviour increasing the probability of encountering such a resource. Modulation of the olfactory system has been shown mainly in the central nervous system, {{but also in the}} periphery. In this study, antennal sensitivity of females of the Egyptian <b>cotton</b> leaf <b>worm</b> Spodoptera littoralis to different plant and sex pheromone odours was measured using electroantennography (EAG). Different mating status, age, and feeding status were used to investigate peripheral changes in olfactory responses. Virgin females were found to be more sensitive to plant odours and sex pheromone compared to mated females. Age also had an impact on antennal sensitivity, 2 and 4 days old females being more sensitive than just-emerged ones. Such an increase in sensitivity could be explained by maturation of olfactory receptor neurons after emergence or by an increase in motivation as the available expected life time remaining decreases. Finally, feeding status did not modify the antennal sensitivity of females. A peripheral modulation could thus be demonstrated in the olfactory system of female Spodoptera littoralis at certain life stages...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganisms are {{attacked}} by different natural enemies present in their habitat. While enemies such as parasitoids and predators will kill their hosts/preys when they successfully attack them, enemies such as micropredators will not entirely consume their prey. However, {{they can still}} have important consequences on the performance and ecology of the prey, such as reduced growth, increased emigration, disease transmission. In this paper, we investigated {{the impact of a}} terrestrial micropredator, the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, on its unusual invertebrate host, the Egyptian <b>cotton</b> leaf <b>worm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis. Larvae developing in presence of mosquitoes showed a slower development and reached a smaller pupal weight when compared to a control without mosquitoes, apparently because of a reduced feeding time for larvae. In addition, larvae tended to leave the plant in presence of mosquitoes. These results suggest that mosquitoes act as micropredators and affects lepidopteran larvae behaviour and development. Ecological impacts such as higher risks of food depletion and longer exposure to natural enemies are likely to be costly consequences. The importance of this phenomenon in nature - the possible function as last resort when vertebrates are unavailable - and the evolutionary aspects are discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFemale <b>cotton</b> leaf <b>worm</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Biosduval) {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on its antennal sensory structures for host location for feeding or oviposition. The external structure, number, and distribution of the antennal sensilla of female S. littoralis were examined with light and scanning electron microscopy. The antenna of adult female is filiform, composed of a scape, a pedicel and a flagellum. The flagellum has 65 – 80 segments densely packed with sensilla distributed on the ventral surface and lateral edges of the flagellum except the dorsal surface which is packed with scales. Eight types of sensilla; trichodea, basiconica, auricillica, coeloconica, uniporous peg, chaetica, styloconica, and squamiformia were detected. Total number of antennal sensilla varied among different antennal portions. Proximal segments showed significantly more short trichoid and basiconic sensilla than distal ones, while distal segments have the longest sensilla chaetica. Last antennal segment carries the higher number of sensilla chaetica than other segments and ends with an apical crown which has 1 – 3 branches, each is endowed with 4 – 6 apical aporous sensilla styloconica. The possible function of the antennal sensilla is discussed {{in relation to their}} morphology...|$|R
30|$|Natural {{protection}} of the Bacillus thuringiensis-based biopesticides from inactivation by the UV component of the cosmic rays constitutes a big challenge to environmentalists, health concerned groups, and industry. Melanin pigment produced {{by a variety of}} microbes has the capabilities of protecting these types of biopesticides. A black melanin produced by a locally isolated strain of the yeast Hortaea werneckii EGYNDA 08 possesses the qualities of a sun protectant agent. This UV bio-protectant increased the killing potency of a locally isolated B. thuringiensis subsp. aegypti (Bt-C 18)-based biopesticide ninefold upon feeding the first instar larvae of the <b>cotton</b> leaf <b>worm,</b> Spodoptera littrolis. This black melanin was extracted, characterized, and exposed to different optimization process for the purpose of enhancing its productivity. The optimization process employed medium engineering techniques to generate a suitable cheap production medium not only at bench-scale level but also at the bioreactor level. These optimization techniques have led to increase the melanin produced by the local isolate of Hortaea werneckii EGYNDA 08 up to 228  mg/l compared to 8  mg/l prior to optimization. This study concluded that black yeast melanin could be used at a wide range as a potential green alternative for the conventional chemically based sunscreens that currently used to protect biopesticides from inactivation by the cosmic rays.|$|R
