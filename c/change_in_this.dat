5|$|Rulers {{sponsored}} Theravada {{and often}} {{took steps to}} stop the spreading of Mahayana beliefs. Rulers such as Aggabodhi I, Kashyapa V (914–923) and Mahinda IV (956–972) promulgated disciplinary rules for the proper conduct of the Sangha. Voharika Tissa and Gothabhaya (249–262) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views. A <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him. As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread, however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.|$|E
5|$|The prison officer's {{role in the}} 20th century did {{not change}} much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer {{training}} became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union {{was based on the}} ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied nuthatch sensu stricto, S. cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian nuthatch, S. (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|E

5|$|The {{early history}} of British {{expansion}} in India was characterised by the co-existence of two approaches towards the existing princely states. The first was a policy of annexation, where the British sought to forcibly absorb the Indian princely states into the provinces which constituted their Empire in India. The second was a policy of indirect rule, where the British assumed suzerainty and paramountcy over princely states, but conceded to them sovereignty and varying degrees of internal self-government. During {{the early part of}} the 19th century, the policy of the British tended towards annexation, but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> approach, by demonstrating both the difficulty of absorbing and subduing annexed states, and the usefulness of princely states as a source of support. In 1858, the policy of annexation was formally renounced, and British relations with the remaining princely states thereafter were based on subsidiary alliances, whereby the British exercised paramountcy over all princely states, with the British crown as ultimate suzerain, but at the same time respected and protected them as allies, taking control of their external relations. The exact relations between the British and each princely state were regulated by individual treaties and varied widely, with some states having complete internal self-government, others being subject to significant control in their internal affairs, and some rulers being in effect little more than the owners of landed estates, with little autonomy.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the rockets}} are {{constructed}} {{exactly the same}} way, and starting {{at the same moment}} in S with the same acceleration, they must have the same velocity all of the time in S. Thus they are traveling the same distances in S, so their mutual distance cannot <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> frame. Otherwise, if the distance were to contract in S, then this would imply different velocities of the rockets in this frame as well, which contradicts the initial assumption of equal construction and acceleration.|$|E

25|$|Knowledge base {{annotation}} is done {{based on}} the information of gene attribute, protein function and its metabolism. In this type of annotation more emphasis is given to genetic variation that disrupts the protein function domain, protein-protein interaction and biological pathway. The non-coding region of genome contain many important regulatory elements including promoter, enhancer and insulator, any kind of <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regulatory region can change the functionality of that protein. The mutation in DNA can change the RNA sequence and then influence the RNA secondary structure, RNA binding protein recognition and miRNA binding activity,.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol {{synthesis}} {{can also}} be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteosome. This enzyme's activity {{can also be}} reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.|$|E
25|$|When {{the name}} Yugoslav Airlines first {{appeared}} on aircraft in 1950, the airline had a simple, mainly white livery. During these years there was a Yugoslav flag on the tail, and on the body the words Jugoslovenski Aerotransport. Shortly afterwards the airline changed its livery and added a logo on the tail section with a red shaped egg on the tail in which JAT was written in white. The rest of the tail was blue, with Yugoslav Airlines written on the fuselage in red. There were variations of this livery during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The biggest <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period was when the first Boeing 737-300 aircraft arrived with a silver body.|$|E

25|$|The master {{constraint}} programme {{has evolved}} into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure – it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly {{have something to say about}} topology <b>change.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and progress has been made in establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.|$|E
25|$|The {{caste system}} {{as it exists}} today {{is thought to be}} the result of {{developments}} during the collapse of the Mughal era and the British colonial regime in India. The collapse of the Mughal era saw the rise of powerful men who associated themselves with kings, priests and ascetics, affirming the regal and martial form of the caste ideal, and it also reshaped many apparently casteless social groups into differentiated caste communities. The British Raj furthered this development, making rigid caste organisation a central mechanism of administration. Between 1860 and 1920, the British segregated Indians by caste, granting administrative jobs and senior appointments only to the upper castes. Social unrest during the 1920s led to a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> policy. From then on, the colonial administration began a policy of positive discrimination by reserving a certain percentage of government jobs for the lower castes.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{demographics}} {{changed dramatically}} in the 1850s and 1860s under waves of immigration and domestic migration. Due to increased immigration since the 1840s and the Great Famine, ethnic Irish made up 9.9 {{percent of the population}} in 1850, but 23.2 percent in 1860, when the total population was 22,623. They had encountered considerable discrimination in the city but by 1860, the Irish constituted most of the police force. They also gained many elected and patronage positions in the Democratic Party city government, and an Irish man was elected as mayor before the Civil War. At that time, representatives were elected to the city council from 30 wards. The elite were worried about corruption in this system and that so many saloonkeepers were active in the wards. German immigrants also made this city a destination following the 1848 revolutions; both the Irish and German immigrants were mostly Catholic, adding another element to demographic <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> formerly Protestant city.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 2010s, Kreuzlingen's {{downtown}} began {{to experience a}} dearth of shoppers as many of them, including buses from elsewhere in Switzerland that pass through the city, started crossing the border to shop in Konstanz instead, due to lower prices for basic items in Germany, a favorable exchange rate between the euro and the franc and a German VAT refund that allows shoppers from non-European Union countries such as Switzerland to get back {{as much as a}} fifth of the price of the goods they buy. Elected officials from the city have asked the national government to negotiate a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> policy with their German counterparts as they feel it is anti-competitive; at the same time some Konstanz residents, feeling displaced in their own hometown by the onslaught of Swiss on weekends, have opened businesses in Kreuzlingen that primarily cater to other Germans.|$|E
