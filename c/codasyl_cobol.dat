A 2013 poll by Micro Focus found that 20% of university academics thought COBOL was outdated or dead and that 55% believed their students thought COBOL was outdated or dead. The same poll also found that only 25% of academics had COBOL programming on their curriculum even though 60% thought they should teach it.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a DBMS-independent database reverse engineering (DBRE) methodology {{based on a}} generic process model and on transformation techniques. DBRE is proposed as a two-phase process consisting in recovering the DBMSdependent data structures (data structure extraction) then in recovering their semantics (data structure conceptualization). The second phase, that is strongly linked with the logical design phase of current database design methodologies, can be performed by application of a selected set of standard schema restructuring techniques, or schema transformations. The paper illustrates the methodology by applying it to various DBRE processes : removing optimization structures, untranslating Relational, <b>COBOL,</b> <b>CODASYL,</b> TOTAL/IMAGE and IMS database as well as file structures, and finally conceptual normalization. A shorter version appears in the final proceedings of the conference (LNCS 823 - SpringerVerlag). KEYWORDS database design, dabase reverse engineering, schem [...] ...|$|R
