500|$|Churchill {{had been}} {{promoted}} to Major General on 3 July (O.S.), but it was Feversham who received the lion's share of the reward. Churchill was not entirely forgotten, and in August {{he was awarded the}} lucrative colonelcy of the Third Troop of Life Guards. Yet according to Historian David Chandler {{it is possible that the}} Sedgemoor campaign, and its subsequent persecutions driven by the bloodthirsty zeal of Judge Jeffreys, set in train a process of disillusion that culminated in his abandonment of his king, and long-time patron and friend, just three years later. His master, however, had already given him cause for anxiety.

500|$|Mike Stagno {{said that}} Youthanasia {{features}} [...] "a more traditional type of metal". He explained {{that even though}} the music on a number of tracks remains quite heavy, it was obvious that the thrash metal is [...] "very scarce" [...] on this record. Stephen Thomas Erlewine agreed that Megadeth have abandoned some of the more experimental, progressive elements in their music. Similarly, Chris Ayers of Exclaim! felt that with Youthanasia, the band [...] "eroded their brilliant thrash to mid-paced chug". According to the band's official website, [...] "Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth, following the footsteps of their previous album." [...] Speaking about the stylistic direction of the album, then-guitarist Marty Friedman stated: [...] "We pretty much stick to our guns. It's not like we're gonna <b>change</b> <b>our</b> next album to try and follow the trend. We don't really change with the times." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the near-loss, Camacho said, [...] "I am {{satisfied}} with our performance. The players worked well {{and he had}} many chances to score." [...] The following Wednesday, Benfica hosted Celtic for matchday three of the Champions League. They continued struggling to convert goal opportunities, hitting the goal post twice in quick succession before finally breaking Celtic's defence with an 87th-minute winning goal by Cardozo. Camacho praised his players for not giving up and staying calm under pressure. On 28 October, Benfica hosted Marítimo for the Primeira Liga. Although Kanú scored first for Marítimo in the eighth minute, Cardozo evened the score ten minutes later. Marítimo {{had an opportunity to}} regain the lead when Quim incurred a penalty and was sent off but his replacement, Hans-Jörg Butt, stopped the penalty kick. In the second half, Adu scored the winning goal for ten-men Benfica in the 87th minute. Camacho said about teams like Marítimo, [...] "We have to <b>change</b> <b>our</b> mentality and never relax, because for teams like Marítimo or Vitória de Setúbal, their 'Champions League' is facing Benfica." [...] On the last day of October, Benfica visited the Estádio do Bonfim for their second game against Vitória de Setúbal, and the remodelled team led at half-time. During the second half Setúbal, pushing hard, scored twice to knock Benfica out of the League Cup. Camacho said, [...] "We were eliminated because they were better. It was a fair loss." ...|$|E

Pierce told one {{interviewer}} of his wife, [...] "She's not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, {{and there was the}} day I had to go to Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – and tell him that he'd better <b>change</b> <b>our</b> bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too." [...] Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side's landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox's death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day's game against the Cleveland Indians, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois on July 31, 2015 at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Alsip.|$|E
