40|$|AbstractHuman gaits are complicated, and {{the gait}} phases cannot be exactly {{distinguished}} by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. Measurement of GCF provides information to detect human gait phases. In gaits of certain patients, the GCF patterns are sometimes vague. A higher level algorithm that monitors {{the degree of}} abnormalities in the gait phases detected by the fuzzy logic is proposed. When it is measured by force sensors in shoes, {{it may be more}} smoothened due to the flesh as well as the cushioning materials in the sole of the shoe. For this purpose, fuzzy logic is suitable. In this project, air bladders are used for measuring GCF. The proposed methods are implemented by using signals from sensor-embedded shoes called smart shoes. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors installed between the <b>cushion</b> <b>pad</b> and the sole. The GCF sensor applies an air pressure sensor connected to an air bladder...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” Measurement {{of ground}} contact forces (GCF) {{provides}} necessary information to detect human gait phases. In this paper, a new analysis method of the GCF signals is discussed for detection of the gait phases. Human gaits are complicated, and the gait phases {{can not be}} exactly distinguished by comparing sensor outputs to a threshold. This paper mainly discusses how to detect the gait phases continuously and smoothly. The proposed analysis method is intended for applications to power assistive devices for patients, as well as diagnostics of pathological gait. Smooth and continuous detection of the gait phases enables a full use of information obtained from GCF sensors. For experimental verification, smart shoes have been developed. Each smart shoe has four GCF sensors embedded between the <b>cushion</b> <b>pad</b> and the sole. The performances are experimentally verified for both normal and abnormal gaits, and a means for quantification of abnormalities in the gait is also introduced in this paper. W I...|$|E
40|$|Effective digital human model (DHM) {{simulation}} of automotive driver packaging ergonomics, safety and comfort depends on accurate modelling of occupant posture, which is {{strongly related to}} the mechanical interaction between human body soft tissue and flexible seat components. This paper presents a finite-element study simulating the deflection of seat cushion foam and supportive seat structures, as well as human buttock and thigh soft tissue when seated. The three-dimensional data used for modelling thigh and buttock geometry were taken on one 95 th percentile male subject, representing the bivariate percentiles of the combined hip breadth (seated) and buttock-to-knee length distributions of a selected Australian and US population. A thigh-buttock surface shell based on this data was generated for the analytic model. A 6 mm neoprene layer was offset from the shell {{to account for the}} compression of body tissue expected through sitting in a seat. The thigh-buttock model is therefore made of two layers, covering thin to moderate thigh and buttock proportions, but not more fleshy sizes. To replicate the effects of skin and fat, the neoprene rubber layer was modelled as a hyperelastic material with viscoelastic behaviour in a Neo-Hookean material model. Finite element (FE) analysis was performed in ANSYS V 13 WB (Canonsburg, USA). It is hypothesized that the presented FE simulation delivers a valid result, compared to a standard SAE physical test and the real phenomenon of human-seat indentation. The analytical model is based on the CAD assembly of a Ford Territory seat. The optimized seat frame, suspension and foam pad CAD data were transformed and meshed into FE models and indented by the two layer, soft surface human FE model. Converging results with the least computational effort were achieved for a bonded connection between cushion and seat base as well as cushion and suspension, no separation between neoprene and indenter shell and a frictional connection between <b>cushion</b> <b>pad</b> and neoprene. The result is compared to a previous {{simulation of}} an indentation with a hard shell human finite-element model of equal geometry, and to the physical indentation result, which is approached with very high fidelity. We conclude that (a) 	SAE composite buttock form indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated in a FE model of merely similar geometry, but using a two-layer hard/soft structure. (b) 	Human-seat indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated with a simplified human buttock-thigh model for a selected anthropomorphism...|$|E

30|$|Only one {{previous}} study has investigated {{the effect of}} altering bra strap orientation and design on both bra strap discomfort and pressure [5]. Vertical and cross-back bra strap orientations were compared with and without {{the addition of a}} small <b>cushioned</b> <b>pad</b> placed under the strap at the apex of the shoulder. Bra strap discomfort was not significantly different in any condition and bra strap pressure was only reduced with the addition of the <b>cushioned</b> <b>pad</b> in the cross-back orientation, which had higher pressures than in the vertical strap orientation, both with and without the <b>cushioned</b> <b>pad.</b> Although the results of this {{previous study}} suggest that bra strap discomfort and pressure cannot be reduced by altering bra strap orientation and design, the study had several limitations. For example, the authors reported that the <b>cushioned</b> <b>pad</b> was not effective in increasing strap width or, in turn, surface area of contact at the shoulder-strap interface as it was found to curl under the strap in the vertical condition [5]. The higher strap pressures in the cross-back orientation may also have been due to tighter straps in this orientation because the bra straps used in the study were commercially available convertible straps, which do not always allow for the greater distance required between the attachment sites of the bra in the cross-back orientation compared to the vertical orientation. It is also conflicting that the cross-back orientation was the most preferred by the 14 participants when it had the same level of discomfort as the vertical orientation and higher strap pressures. The participant number was also low, and the bra sizes, and in turn breast sizes, were at the small end of the spectrum for women with large breast [17 - 20]. It is also recognised that a range of reasons can affect bra strap preference, such as aesthetics and personal preference, which may have resulted in the cross-back orientation being the preferred orientation in the study cohort.|$|R

Various {{studies have been conducted}} to investigate the capability of corrugated paperboard (CPB) to act as cushioning materials for protective packaging.

However, no information is available to show that CPB can be engineered to produce a cushioning element with good shock attenuation in repetitive impacts. This study investigates the deterioration of the shock attenuation characteristics of CPB cushions in consecutive impacts. A series of cushion-test style experiments on multilayer <b>cushion</b> <b>pads</b> made entirely from CPB were conducted.

It is shown that the shock response of critical component is weakened owning to the decrease in the defined system parameter. Furthermore, at low frequency parameter ratio, the enhancement of the damping ratio of the critical component leads to the decrease in the peak of the shock response, which can also be reduced by the increase in damping ratio of <b>cushioning</b> <b>pad</b> at both lower and higher frequency parameter ratios.

40|$|Abstract. The {{theory and}} methods of damage {{boundary}} curve (DBC) based on input excitation accelerations have played important roles in transportation packaging designs for commodities. However, {{in many cases the}} designed <b>cushion</b> <b>pads</b> according to the concept of traditional DBC can transmit a higher acceleration than the maximum critical acceleration and yet still not cause any damage to the products. That means the conservatism exist in the traditional theory and method, which would bring over package and result in the rise of transport cost and more wastes of packaging materials. Thus, constructing new DBC is necessary in cushioning packaging designs of commercial products. In this paper, we developed a new drawing method and procedure for constructing new DBC based on response accelerations and Biot Model which is different from traditional DBC based on excitation ones. The new DBC is beneficial to overcome the conversation brought by the traditional DBC in transport packaging design, and it may have a wider application in transport packaging design for commodities...|$|R
