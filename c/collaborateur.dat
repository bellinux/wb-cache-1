25|$|He {{soon found}} that such work {{did not pay}} enough to keep his retinue, and so he sought {{employment}} from the French foreign office, either as a writer or a diplomat. He first sent Mme de Nehra to Paris {{to make peace with}} the authorities, and then returned himself with hopes of getting a job through an old literary <b>collaborateur</b> of his, Durival, who was at this time director of finance at the department of foreign affairs. One of this official's functions was to subsidize political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau hoped to be so employed. However, he ruined his chances with a series of writings on financial questions.|$|E
60|$|The old gentleman {{had been}} {{to take one of}} the baths for which Rosenbad is famous, and which {{everybody}} takes, and his after-bath toilet was not yet completed when Pen arrived. The elder called out to Arthur in a cheery voice from the inner apartment, in which he and Morgan were engaged, and the valet presently came in, bearing a little packet to Pen's address--Mr. Arthur's letters and papers, Morgan said, which he had brought from Mr. Arthur's chambers in London, and which consisted chiefly of numbers of the Pall Mall Gazette, which our friend Mr. Finucane thought his <b>collaborateur</b> would like to see. The papers were tied together: the letters in an envelope, addressed to Pen, in the last-named gentleman's handwriting.|$|E

5000|$|The use of [...] "collaboration" [...] to mean [...] "traitorous {{cooperation}} with the enemy," [...] dates from 1940, originally {{in reference to the}} Vichy Regime in France, the French civilians who sympathised with Nazi Germany's doctrine, and voluntary troops (LVF) who fought against the Free French and later De Gaulle's French Force. Since then, the words collaboration and <b>collaborateur</b> may have this very pejorative meaning in French (and the abbreviation collabo has only this pejorative and insulting meaning). Nonetheless, collaboration and <b>collaborateur</b> have kept in French their original positive acceptations -with, for example, <b>collaborateur</b> still commonly used in referring to co-workers.|$|E

50|$|But most of {{the former}} Dynamo players, among them the very popular goalkeeper Trusevich, {{did not want to}} play in Rukh, {{probably}} because they took Shvetsov for a <b>collaborateur.</b> Trusevich found a job in the Bakery No. 1 which guaranteed their workers and their families normal supplies of food. More former Dynamo players found jobs in the bakery. The German director Joseph Kordik, an engineer from Moravia, encouraged them to form a football team: FC Start. After World War II Kordik declared to the NKVD that in reality he was Czech, not German.|$|E
5000|$|In France, a {{distinction}} emerged between the <b>collaborateur</b> and the collaborationniste. The latter expression is mainly {{used to describe}} individuals enrolled in pseudo-Nazi parties, often based in Paris, who had an overwhelming belief in fascist ideology or were simply anti-communists. [...] Collaborateurs on the other hand, could engage in collaboration {{for a number of}} more pragmatic reasons, such as preventing infrastructure damage for use by the occupation forces or personal ambition and greed, and were not necessarily believers in fascism per se. Arch-collaborators like Pierre Laval or René Bousquet are thus distinct from collaborationists.|$|E
50|$|The Révolution {{nationale}} particularly attracted {{three groups}} of persons. The Pétainistes gathered those who supported the personal figure of Marshall Pétain, considered at that time a war hero of the Battle of Verdun. The <b>Collaborateurs</b> include those who collaborated with Nazi Germany or advocated collaboration, but who are considered more moderate, or more opportunistic, than the Collaborationistes, advocates of a French fascism.|$|R

50|$|The film Match (2012) by the Russian {{director}} Andrey Malyukov, also {{ignores the}} reports of Ukrainian witnesses and scholars and repeats the Soviet propaganda version. In the film, Russian communists are fighting against the German occupiers. All the <b>collaborateurs</b> speak Ukrainian. Malyukov became popular as a director of a nationalistic-patriotic TV series about Russian troops in the Caucasus and in Afghanistan. Ukrainian authorities blocked {{the release of the}} film for several months because according to them, the film gives a wrong picture of history.|$|R
