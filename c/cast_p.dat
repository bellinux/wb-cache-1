40|$|Objectives: To {{quantify}} the moulding ability of Plaster of Paris and polyester cast materials as {{assessed by the}} novel use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography. Methods: A prospective crossover study was performed in 25 healthy volunteers aged 18 – 65 years. Participants’ non-dominant wrist was immobilized using a synthetic polyester cast followed by a Plaster of Paris cast with three point moulding to simulate reduction of a dorsally angulated distal radius fracture. The novel use of peripheral quantitative computed tomography {{was used to measure}} the closeness of ﬁt of each cast on an axial tomographic slice. Results and conclusions: Plaster of Paris casts were able to achieve a closer mould than polyester when measured between the bone and the <b>cast</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 002), as well as between the skin and the <b>cast</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} {{complications}} and recovery {{of patients with}} Achilles tendon rupture managed by percutaneous repair, open repair, and non-operative means in a tertiary referral centre between 2001 and 2003. METHODS: The operating theatre register and logbooks of the Consultants were used to identify surgically managed patients, while plaster room records were used for conservatively managed patients. We collated demographic and management details. RESULTS: The number of plaster changes (p < 0. 001), median length of time in <b>cast</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001), and number of outpatient visits (p < 0. 05) was greater in conservatively managed patients. We performed no formal statistical analysis given the small numbers. Conservative management was the least expensive and open surgery the most costly modality of management. Percutaneous surgery was approximately {{a third of the}} cost of open surgery when performed under local anaesthetic. CONCLUSION: In our setting, percutaneous repair and conservative management are viable alternatives to open surgery, which carries higher complications rates and was the most costly of the three. Individual patients will have different needs due to their age, occupation, or level of sporting activity...|$|E
40|$|We gated both p-type, and n-type, organic {{nanowire}} (NW) {{films with}} an aqueous {{electric double layer}} (EDL) in thin-film transistor (TFT) architectures. For p-type NWs, we used poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) NWs grown via two different routes. Both can be gated with water, resulting in TFTs with threshold lower than for conventionally <b>cast</b> <b>P</b> 3 HT films under the same gating conditions. However, TFT drain currents are lower for NWs than for conventional P 3 HT films, which agrees with similar observations for ‘dry’ gated TFTs. For n-type NWs, we have grown ‘nanobelts’ of poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) by a solvent/non-solvent mixing route with later displacement of the solvent, and dispersion in a non-solvent. Water-gating such films initially failed to give an observable drain current. However, BBL nanobelts can be gated with the aprotic solvent acetonitrile, giving high n-type drain currents, which are further increased by adding salt. Remarkably, after first gating BBL NW films with acetonitrile, they can then be gated by water, giving very high drain currents. This behaviour is transient on a timescale of minutes. We believe this observation {{is caused by a}} thin protective acetonitrile film remaining on the nanobelt surface...|$|E

There are potential time and resource savings if a prefabricated boot can replace a custom applied cast. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if muscle activity reduction is similar using a fiberglass cast versus a prefabricated (Aircast FoamWalker) boot. Methods: Surface EMG data were recorded from the gastrocnemius, soleus, and peroneals of 12 normal adults while walking barefoot, in a fiberglass cast with a cast shoe (cast), and while wearing an Aircast FoamWalker (boot). Subjects walked at their self-selected speed for 10 trials in each condition, and the order of barefoot, cast, and boot was randomly assigned. The data were rectified, integrated across stance phase and normalized to a percent of each subject’s barefoot mean integrated EMG (iEMG) value. For each muscle, a linear mixed-effects statistical model (subject by trial by condition) was utilized to determine if iEMG activity levels were reduced by immobilization compared to barefoot walking. Results: Activity for all muscles was significantly lower in the boot compared with barefoot (p <. 05). The cast iEMG levels were significantly different from barefoot for the soleus and peroneals (p <. 05). Gastrocnemius activity was significantly decreased in the boot when compared with the <b>cast</b> (<b>p</b> <. 0001). The greater reduction in iEMG levels for the boot indicates that it is superior to a fiberglass cast in reducing gastrocnemius muscle activit...|$|E
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the College of Dental Medicine of Nova Southeastern University {{of the degree of}} Master of Science in Dentistry. Background. Earlier research evaluated the 3 D internal fit of CAD/CAM crowns after direct versus indirect laser scanning. To date, no study has evaluated the marginal integrity of all-ceramic crowns milled with different type of scanning systems via different methods of scanning. The purpose of This study was conducted to assess the marginal integrity of all-ceramic crowns milled with the E 4 D CAD/CAM system (D 4 D, Richardson, Texas) using three different scanning methods of a prepared model (direct scanning and indirect scanning of a cast, and scanning of an impression material). Methods. A metal die model of a prepared mandibular first molar was fabricated according to specifications for tooth preparation for the E 4 D CAD/CAM system. Fifty five all-ceramic crowns were milled using this system: 5 crowns were made from scanning of the metal die; 25 crowns were made from scanning of 5 PVS impressions of the metal die, with each impression scanned 5 times; and 25 crowns were made from scanning stone dies poured from the same previous 5 PVS impressions. Each stone die was scanned 5 times. An internal gap to provide space for cement was kept constant at 25 microns. Marginal integrity of the crowns was assessed using optical microscopy. Results. The overall mean marginal gap and standard deviation for crowns was 78. 1 μm (18. 9) for scanning the metal dies, 148. 9 μm (25. 4) for scanning impressions and 126. 2 μm (28. 2) for scanning the stone casts. ANOVA revealed significant differences in marginal gap between the three different groups. Conclusions. The direct scanning of a metal die produced crowns with significantly smaller marginal gaps than the marginal gap seen from scanning a PVS impression or a stone <b>cast</b> (<b>P</b> 3 ̆c. 05). Additionally, it was found that scanning PVS impressions or stone casts, produced crowns with unacceptable mean marginal gaps (over 120 μm). It was also observed that difficulty of scanning PVS impressions and tracing the finish line lead to overhanging margins and larger marginal gaps for both crowns produced via that method...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how to predict the need for tenotomy at the initiation of the Ponseti treatment. Fifty clubfeet (35 patients) were prospectively rated according to Pirani and Dimeglio scoring systems. Tenotomies were performed in 36 of 50 feet (72 %). Those that underwent tenotomy required significantly more <b>casts</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 005). Of 27 feet with initial Pirani scores 5. 0, 85. 2 % required a tenotomy and 14. 8 % did not; 94. 7 % of the Dimeglio Grade IV feet required tenotomies. Following removal of the last cast, there was no significant difference between those that did and did not have a tenotomy. Children with clubfeet who have an initial score of 5. 0 by the Pirani system or are rated as Grade IV feet by the Dimeg-lio system are very likely to need a tenotomy.

40|$|Introduction: The urinary {{sediment}} is {{an important}} test that can help to diagnose diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract. When examining the urinary sediment, {{a report of the}} detected cells and elements is made. The interpretation of this report is up to the clinician. From the assumption that nephrologists and laboratory review the urinary sediment different, we examined whether there is a difference in the assessment of the urinary sediment between nephrologist and laboratory and whether this has consequences for the accuracy of the diagnosis given using these reports. Methods: In this study 45 urinary sediments were reviewed by both laboratory and nephrologist A. Using these reports a diagnosis was given by two different nephrologists (A and B). These diagnoses were compared with the gold standard, the diagnosis made by the clinician, to assess accuracy of diagnosis. The reporting of the various cells and elements were compared. The agreement between the diagnoses made by both nephrologists was also examined. Results: No significant difference was found in the accuracy of the diagnosis given using the various reports (p = 0. 180 and p = 1. 0). The report shows that there is {{a significant difference in the}} reporting of erythrocytes (p = 0. 009), round epithelium (p = 0. 006), granular <b>casts</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 001), hyaline <b>casts</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 004) and dysmorphic erythrocytes (p = 0. 008). The agreement between the 1 st and 2 nd diagnosis of nephrologist A given its own assessment is strong (κ = 0. 803), the agreement in diagnoses between nephrologist A and B using the different reports is fair (κ = 0. 555 / κ = 0. 503). Conclusion: Although no statistically significant difference can be proved in the accuracy of diagnoses, there is a tendency that the assessment of the urinary sediment by the nephrologist leads to more accuracy than the assessment by the laboratory. The nephrologist is better able to recognize red-cell dysmorphia and different cellcasts. The difference in the reporting of the various cells and elements is of particular importance in making renal diagnostics. ...|$|R

The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the accuracy of three impression materials in both parallel and nonparallel implant positions. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, two partial dentate maxillary acrylic models with four implant analogues in canines and lateral incisors areas were used. One model was simulating the parallel condition and the other nonparallel one, in which implants were tilted 30 ° bucally and 20 ° in either mesial or distal directions. Thirty stone casts were made from each model using polyether (Impregum), additional silicone (Monopren) and vinyl siloxanether (Identium), with open tray technique. The distortion values in three-dimensions (X, Y and Z-axis) were measured by coordinate measuring machine. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), one-way ANOVA and Tukey tests were used for data analysis (α = 0. 05). Results: Under parallel condition, all the materials showed comparable, accurate <b>casts</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 74).

This study aimed to compare the most commonly used vascular injection products in fresh-frozen and formalin-embalmed cadaver specimens. An overview of the properties, advantages and limitations of each substance was given, and a comparison of vascular infusion procedures in both preservation methods was made. A literature search was performed in order to identify the most commonly used vascular injection products. Acrylic paint, latex, gelatin, silicone, Araldite F and Batson's No. 17 were selected for the study. One fresh-frozen and one embalmed cadaver forearm were infused with each injection product according to a uniform protocol. The curing time, skin- and subcutaneous tissue penetration, degree of filling of the arterial tree, extravasations, consistency of the injected vessels during dissection, and the costs of each injection fluid were noted. There was a large variation between the injection fluids in processing- and curing time, colour intensity, flexibility, fragility, elasticity, strength, toxicity and costs. All fluids were suitable for infusion. The penetration of injection fluid into the skin and subcutaneous tissue was significantly better in fresh-frozen specimens (P = 0. 002 and P = 0. 009, respectively), with significantly smaller branches <b>casted</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 004). Vascular infusion of fresh-frozen cadaver specimens results in a significantly better filled coloured arterial tree, enabling more detail to be achieved and smaller branches casted.
