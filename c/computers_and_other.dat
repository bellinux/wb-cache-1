5|$|An initial {{prototype}} design was developed between January and May 1964. When used with MAR, the MSR needed only short range, enough to hand off the Sprint missiles. This {{led to a}} design with limited radiated power. For Small City Defense, this would not offer enough power to acquire the warheads at reasonable range. This led to an upgraded design with five times the transmitter power, which was sent to Raytheon in May 1965. A further upgrade in May 1966 included the battle control <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> features for the SCD system.|$|E

This, in turn, could lead to even greater advances in electronic miniaturization.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005, the new subgenre of geeksta rap (named for gangsta rap) emerged, largely {{independently}} of more traditional nerdcore.

This braggadocio {{led to the}} first nerdcore feud, between MC Plus+ and Monzy.|$|E

25|$|Processors {{that have}} a RISC {{architecture}} typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers), which improves cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation.

25|$|Before the {{invention}} of the integrated circuit in 1959, electronic circuits were constructed from discrete components that could be manipulated by humans. These discrete circuits consumed much space and power and were limited in speed, although they are still common in some applications. By contrast, integrated circuits packed a large number—often millions—of tiny electrical components, mainly transistors, into a small chip around the size of a coin. This allowed for the powerful <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> electronic devices we see today.|$|E

25|$|Technology {{is often}} a {{consequence}} of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, <b>computers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one {{for the purposes of}} research and reference.|$|E
25|$|Phase-locked loops {{are widely}} {{employed}} in radio, telecommunications, <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> electronic applications. They {{can be used}} to demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency (frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in digital logic circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.|$|E

25|$|In Alone Together, Turkle explores where {{technology}} is taking us and how society adapts to answer new questions {{brought on by}} the rise of mobile technologies, robots, <b>computers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> electronic gadgets. In particular, Turkle raises concerns about the way in which genuine, organic social interactions become degraded through constant exposure to illusory meaningful exchanges with artificial intelligence. Underlying Turkle's central argument {{is the fact that the}} technological developments which have most contributed to the rise of inter-connectivity have at the same time bolstered a sense of alienation between people. The alienation involves links between social networks favouring those of proper conversations.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{multimodality}} grew {{in scope}} {{with the release}} of the Internet, personal <b>computers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> digital technologies. The literacy of the emerging generation changed, becoming accustomed to text circulated in pieces, informally, and across multiple mediums of image, color, and sound. The change represented a fundamental shift in how writing was presented: from print-based to screen-based. Literacy evolved so that students arrived in classrooms being knowledgeable in video, graphics, and computer skills, but not alphabetic writing. Educators had to change their teaching practices to include multimodal lessons in order to help students achieve success in writing for the new millennium.|$|E

500|$|Twitterbots {{are capable}} of {{influencing}} public opinion about culture, products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication. The New York Times states, [...] "They have sleep-wake cycles so their fakery is more convincing, making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs." [...] The tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing, all of which depends on {{the intention of the}} person purchasing or creating the bot. The social implications these Twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the ScienceDirect Journal. Looking at the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the journal notes, [...] "people exhibit remarkable social reactions to <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> media, treating {{them as if they were}} real people or real places." [...] The study concluded that Twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere. While the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful Human-Computer Interaction, the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the Twitter realm. Benign Twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular, push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation, spam and/or slander.|$|E
500|$|While {{molten rock}} comes {{closer to the}} surface it would most likely cause more fragmentation, {{triggering}} an explosive eruption that could produce an eruption column with an elevation of [...] and may be sustained for 12hours. A well-documented explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Belt with such force is the eruption of Mount Meager 2,350years ago, which deposed ash as far east as Alberta. This would endanger air traffic {{and would have to}} take another route away from the eruptive zone. Every airport buried under pyroclastic fall would be out of service, including those in Vancouver, Victoria, Kamloops, Prince George and Seattle. The tephra would destroy power transmission lines, satellite dishes, <b>computers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> equipment that operates on electricity. Therefore, telephones, radios and cell phones would be disconnected. Structures not built for holding heavy material would likely demolish {{under the weight of the}} tephra. Ash from the eruption plume would subside above the vent area to create pyroclastic flows and would travel east and west down the nearby Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. These would likely have significant impacts on salmon in the associated rivers and would cause considerable melting of glacial ice to produce debris flows that may extend into Daisy Lake and Squamish to cause significant damage. The eruption column would then travel eastward and extract air travel throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
