50|$|An {{oscillator}} crystal has two electrically conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the <b>controlling</b> <b>circuit</b> places the crystal into an unstable equilibrium, {{and due to}} the positive feedback in the system, any tiny fraction of noise is amplified, ramping up the oscillation. The crystal resonator {{can also be seen}} as a highly frequency-selective filter in this system: it only passes a very narrow subband of frequencies around the resonant one, attenuating everything else. Eventually, only the resonant frequency is active. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal's frequency band becomes stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. The narrow resonance band of the quartz crystal filters out all the unwanted frequencies.|$|E

50|$|An {{image is}} {{projected}} through a lens onto the capacitor array (the photoactive region), causing each capacitor to accumulate an electric charge {{proportional to the}} light intensity at that location. A one-dimensional array, used in line-scan cameras, captures a single slice of the image, whereas a two-dimensional array, used in video and still cameras, captures a two-dimensional picture corresponding to the scene projected onto the focal plane of the sensor. Once the array has {{been exposed to the}} image, a control circuit causes each capacitor to transfer its contents to its neighbor (operating as a shift register). The last capacitor in the array dumps its charge into a charge amplifier, which converts the charge into a voltage. By repeating this process, the <b>controlling</b> <b>circuit</b> converts the entire contents of the array in the semiconductor to a sequence of voltages. In a digital device, these voltages are then sampled, digitized, and usually stored in memory; in an analog device (such as an analog video camera), they are processed into a continuous analog signal (e.g. by feeding the output of the charge amplifier into a low-pass filter), which is then processed and fed out to other circuits for transmission, recording, or other processing.|$|E
