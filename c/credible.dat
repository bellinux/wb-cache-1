5|$|On June 21, Striker {{made his}} first post-WWE appearance, by {{appearing}} on Family Wrestling Entertainment iPPV, FWE Rumble in Queens, New York as a color commentator. On October 21, 2013, Striker was defeated by Justin <b>Credible</b> in NYWC's House of Madness. After the match, Striker nailed <b>Credible,</b> causing him to bleed. Backstage, Striker tried to apologize but <b>Credible</b> cursed {{him out in the}} locker room and stormed off. On July 2013, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) announced Striker as the new announcer of the promotion on MAVTV. On November 2, 2013, Striker made his in ring debut for CWFH, unsuccessfully challenging Scorpio Sky for the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|However, by March 2012, the Wildrose was polling {{the support}} of four-in-ten Albertans, showing {{significant}} improvement and a <b>credible</b> challenger to the PCs.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 2005, a visibly {{pregnant}} Psaltis {{appeared at}} the ECW reunion event , which is unaffiliated with World Wrestling Entertainment, holding the key for the main event steel cage match between Jerry Lynn and Justin <b>Credible.</b> The match was won by Justin <b>Credible</b> after Psaltis, Jason Knight, and Lance Storm interfered on his behalf. In June 2006, she managed Johnny Candido in a match for the National Wrestling Superstars promotion.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} {{from their}} Europa League group. Celtic played Inter Milan {{in the last}} 16 stage of the Europa League, rallying to draw 3–3 at Parkhead from an early 0–2 deficit in a pulsating encounter, then losing 1–0 in Milan {{to go out on}} aggregate despite a highly <b>credible</b> performance.|$|E
5|$|Disaster Management: Identification of true {{victims of}} {{disasters}} is often problematic {{because there are}} infiltrators who {{take advantage of the}} absence of <b>credible</b> identification system to benefit {{at the expense of the}} affected ones. Data on a persons Lebanese Identity Card is used to establish whether they live in an area affected by a disaster to enable them to receive relief items.|$|E
5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a <b>credible</b> currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a <b>credible</b> currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, {{as a native}} of the area in which the Battle of Barry is {{supposed}} to have occurred, Boece may have used local folklore as his source. Boece is no longer regarded as a <b>credible</b> historical source.|$|E
5|$|NMFS then {{reversed}} {{itself and}} declared that there was sufficient, <b>credible</b> information to declare that Aliso Creek had been steelhead habitat and {{was added to the}} Distinct Population Segment List under the jurisdictional domain of NOAA. It is now considered a candidate for re-colonization.|$|E
5|$|Once a given astronomical {{observation}} {{has been determined}} to be a <b>credible</b> extraterrestrial signal, the astronomical community should be informed through the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the IAU. The Secretary-General of the United Nations and various other global scientific unions should also be informed.|$|E
5|$|Ray's {{report also}} {{concluded}} that there was no <b>credible</b> evidence that Bernard Nussbaum testified falsely about not having discussed Livingstone's hiring with the First Lady, and found as well that there was no personal relationship between the First Lady and Livingstone that had formed the basis for his hiring.|$|E
5|$|The accused had {{no right}} of appeal. The right was given to their {{relatives}} or other interested persons {{but they were not}} allowed to nominate psychiatrists {{to take part in the}} evaluation, because all psychiatrists were considered fully independent and equally <b>credible</b> before the law.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate over}} {{who came out}} the best from the Crisis, Britain or Indonesia, {{continues}} on into the present, and though many historians depict a British advantage (admittedly, these historians are British and American) there is a <b>credible</b> case {{for the success of}} both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{decade after}} the fact, during {{the second round of}} child abuse allegations, Jackson's lawyers would file a memo stating that the 1994 {{settlement}} was made without his consent. A later disclosure by the FBI of investigation documents compiled over nearly 20 years led Jackson's attorney to suggest that no evidence of molestation or sexual impropriety from Jackson toward minors existed. According to reports, the Department of Children and Family Services (Los Angeles County) investigated Jackson beginning in 1993 with the Chandler allegation and again in 2003. Reports show the LAPD and DCFS did not find <b>credible</b> evidence of abuse or sexual misconduct.|$|E
5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter. Wagner {{died of a}} heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca' Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend that the attack was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without <b>credible</b> evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several <b>credible</b> hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of variants. Because of this, the reported associated variants {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal variants. Associated regions can contain hundreds of variants spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated variants to a <b>credible</b> set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to archaeological evidence, Zenobia's life {{was recorded in}} different ancient sources but many are flawed or fabricated; the Augustan History, a late-Roman collection of biographies, is the most notable (albeit unreliable) source for the era. The author (or authors) of the Augustan History invented many events and letters attributed to Zenobia {{in the absence of}} contemporary sources. Some Augustan History accounts are corroborated from other sources, and are more <b>credible.</b> Byzantine chronicler Joannes Zonaras is considered an important source for the life of Zenobia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days {{they had been in}} the race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain <b>credible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Klemana Schuetz was {{identified}} as the bomber by Franz Mayhoff, a New York anarchist and fraudster, who claimed in an affidavit that Schuetz had once admitted throwing the Haymarket bomb. August Wagener, Mayhoff's attorney, sent a telegram from New York to defense attorney Captain William Black {{the day before the}} executions claiming knowledge of the bomber's identity. Black tried to delay the execution with this telegram but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as <b>credible</b> by historians.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in a currency {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A <b>credible</b> commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley and all law {{enforcement}} officials who had been deposed {{were excluded from the}} report. Also, the 75 <b>credible</b> abuse cases were overlooked; the report focused on doubts about the torture of the four pardoned death row inmates. Among the final costs were $6.2 million for the investigation and $7 million to hire outside counsel for Burge and his cohort. Many activists were disappointed to learn that the statute of limitations meant that Burge would not be prosecuted for torture. Debates in the op-ed pages continued for days. Egan explained his report to the public with legal theories and federal jurisdiction issues.|$|E
5|$|Modern weapons technologies, {{including}} the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial {{research and the}} deployment of weapon systems can be {{as long as a}} decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a <b>credible</b> external enemy who warrants such expenditure.|$|E
5|$|Powerful vested {{interests}} and corrupt commanders were, as of February 2011, the largest obstacle to reforming the army. Some newly delivered weaponry was sold by officers. The International Crisis Group {{also said that}} AMISOM's efforts at assisting in formalizing the military's structure and providing training to the estimated 8,000 SNA soldiers were problematic. Resistance continued {{to the establishment of}} an effective chain of command, logical military formations and a <b>credible</b> troop roster. Although General Mohamed Gelle Kahiye, the respected former army chief, attempted to instill reforms, he was marginalized and eventually dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect {{continued}} their feud, although Flair legitimately requested {{to be released}} from his WWF contract in order to return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted on the condition that he help build up Perfect as a <b>credible</b> babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated Flair from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated Flair in a loser leaves town match. Flair did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Savoye, {{comparing}} {{the structure of}} Live and Let Die with Casino Royale, believes that the two books have open narratives which allow Fleming to continue with further books in the series. Savoye finds differences {{in the structure of}} the endings, with Live and Let Dies promise of future sexual encounters between Bond and Solitaire to be more <b>credible</b> than Casino Royales ending, in which Bond vows to battle a super-criminal organisation.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and the Mafia. The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. The Mafia was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with <b>credible</b> threats of violence {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E
5|$|Sources often {{considered}} more <b>credible</b> than the Augustan History include the contemporary historians Cassius Dio and Herodian. Cassius Dio lived {{from the second}} half of the 2nd century until sometime after 229. Born into a patrician family, he spent the greater part of his life in public service. He was a senator under emperor Commodus and governor of Smyrna after the death of Septimius Severus. Afterwards he served as suffect consul around 205, and as proconsul in Africa and Pannonia.|$|E
5|$|Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was {{released}} by LaFace on April 26, 1994, and peaked at number 20 on the Billboard 200, eventually being certified platinum in the United States. The record received positive reviews from critics and helped distinguish Southern hip hop as a <b>credible</b> hip hop scene, amid East Coast and West Coast hip hop's market dominance at the time. The album has since been viewed by music journalists as an important release in both hip hop and Atlanta's music scene.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Moon Agreement {{was created}} to {{restrict}} the exploitation of the Moon's resources by any single nation, but as of 2014, it has been signed and ratified by only 16 nations, none of which engages in self-launched human space exploration or has plans to do so. Although several individuals have made claims to the Moon {{in whole or in}} part, none of these are considered <b>credible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The General Court was {{the chief}} {{legislative}} and judicial body of the colony. It was elected by the freemen from among their own number and met regularly in Plymouth, the capital town of the colony. As part of its judicial duties, it would periodically call a Grand Enquest, which was a grand jury of sorts elected from the freemen, who would hear complaints and swear out indictments for <b>credible</b> accusations. The General Court, and later lesser town and county courts, would preside over trials of accused criminals and over civil matters, but the ultimate decisions were made by a jury of freemen.|$|E
5|$|The Mafia only became <b>credible</b> {{again after}} the end of the invasion. The Allied Military Government of Occupied Territories (AMGOT), looking for anti-fascist notables to replace fascist authorities, made Don Calogero Vizzini mayor of Villalba, as well as an Honorary Colonel of the US Army. In the chaos that {{followed}} the invasion of Sicily and the collapse of Fascism, the American army often relied on senior churchmen for advice on whom to trust. Don Calò was one of those recommended. He had a long record of involvement with Catholic social funds and there were several clergymen in his family.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a greater emphasis on gathering <b>credible</b> evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E
5|$|The {{cannibalism}} of {{the frog}} {{has been speculated}} to cause its decline in some areas, because the smaller tadpoles can be toxic. Other postulated causes of the decline include increased ultraviolet radiation due to {{the hole in the}} ozone layer, global warming, and increased drought. The first theory was tested and the results were inconclusive. Global warming is not thought to be a <b>credible</b> cause, as the extremities of the frog's range have not changed, while declines in population have occurred in both dry and wetter areas.|$|E
5|$|Thurstan {{travelled}} to Rome, {{as did the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, {{and both}} presumably opposed David's request. David however gained the support of King Henry, and the Archbishop of York agreed to a year's postponement of the issue and to consecrate Robert of Scone without making an issue of subordination. York's claim over bishops north of the Forth were in practice abandoned {{for the rest of}} David's reign, although York maintained her more <b>credible</b> claims over Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} {{himself at}} the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story <b>credible.</b> They weren't convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed {{him over to the}} FBI. As a member of a Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{reasonable}} doubt that McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not consider him {{a suspect in the}} Cooper case because of significant mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and <b>credible</b> evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas {{on the day of the}} Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.|$|E
