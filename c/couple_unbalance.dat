In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. swing frame) of vertical dynamic balancing machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machine’s swing frame. The static unbalance and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic balancing machine with the new swing frame. The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic balancing machine. The new dynamic balancing machine can measure static unbalance and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic balancing machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic balancing machine with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|E
50|$|Couplings are {{normally}} balanced {{at the factory}} prior to being shipped, but they occasionally go out of balance in operation. Balancing can be difficult and expensive, and is normally done only when operating tolerances are such that the effort and the expense are justified. The amount of <b>coupling</b> <b>unbalance</b> that can be tolerated by any system is dictated by {{the characteristics of the}} specific connected machines and can be determined by detailed analysis or experience.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 93 - 102 Test stand {{vibration}} {{measurements on}} a partially loaded 54, 000 hp, parallel shaft, double helical speed increaser revealed synchronous resonant vibrations near normal operating speed. Further testing confirmed the lateral critical {{speed of the}} pinion was lower than originally designed due to modifications applied while the gear unit was in the test stand, which were aimed at lowering bearing pad operating temperatures under full load field conditions. The lateral critical speed was seen to increase as expected by sequentially removing the coupling spacer, adapter plate, and the hub. However, resulting vibration measurements showed a resonance remained near running speed. Impact testing pointed to a structural, resonant axial motion of the gear case near rated operating speed. Finite element analyses of the gear unit confirmed the existence of two structural resonances with endwall breathing mode shapes near pinion speed. Excitation {{of one of these}} modes was provided by <b>coupling</b> <b>unbalance</b> on the rotating pinion shaft that demonstrated cross-coupling of radial forces due to unbalance and axial structural motions. The near coincidence of the structural resonance and the lateral critical speed on the test stand provided vibration amplification above that normally expected due to either resonant condition alone. Amplification factors were moderate and significant overlap occurred between the flanks of the two resonances. A two-step solution was implemented to increase the resonant frequencies of both the shaft in its oil film bearings and the gear case end walls. First, a bearing clearance and preload modification were applied along with additional hot oil removal techniques. Second, a tie bar brace was added above and parallel to the pinion between the end walls of the upper section of the gear case to increase structural stiffness in an axial direction. Additional rotordynamic and finite element analyses predicted significantly improved response to unbalance. The bearing and structural modifications were installed and tested sequentially. These tests, under similar conditions as previously imposed on the unit for qualification and acceptance, were successful in proving the solution. This paper documents measured vibrations at various stages in the investigation, results of rotordynamic and finite element analyses, bearing and gear case modifications, and final successful tests...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effectiveness of}} an Oldham- coupling- type balancer in reducing the first- and second-harmonic rotating <b>unbalance</b> <b>couples</b> of a 90 ﮠV 6 even-firing engine. It is shown that the prototype balancer can be configured to eliminate the residual, first-harmonic rocking couple usually remaining in a conventionally balances 90 ﮠV 6 engine. Further, the Oldham- coupling- type balancer {{can be used to}} reduce the elliptical second-harmonic rotating couple to a horizontal rocking couple. The power consumption of the balancer was measured to be approximately 0. 35 kW at 2000 r/min and 1. 5 kW at 4500 r/min...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic Emission (AE) is an {{effective}} nondestructive method for investigating the behavior of materials under stress. In recent decades, AE applications in structural health monitoring have been extended to other areas such as rotating machineries and cutting tools. This research investigates the application of acoustic emission data for unbalance analysis and detection in rotary systems. The AE parameter {{of interest in this}} study is a discrete variable that covers the significance of count, duration and amplitude of AE signals. A statistical model based on Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression is proposed to handle overdispersion and excess zeros of the counting data. The ZIP model indicates that faulty bearings can generate more transient wave in the AE waveform. Control charts can easily detect the faulty bearing using the parameters of the ZIP model. Categorical data analysis based on generalized linear models (GLM) is also presented. The results demonstrate the significance of the <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|Health {{monitoring}} for {{rotating machinery}} such as aircraft engines, motors provide economic benefits and operational efficiencies {{in terms of}} reduced downtime. In this paper we present a methodology of using artificial neural networks (ANN) and frequency-domain vibration analysis to detect and classify common types of unbalances in rotating machines. Frequency domain features are used to train an artificial neural network. The artificial neural network is trained using back-propagation algorithm with a subset of experimental data obtained from a real-world rotating machine, Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS), for known types of unbalances. The trained artificial neural network is then used to classify various types of unbalances such as static unbalance and <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance.</b> The effectiveness of the neural network to classify these different types of unbalances is tested using the remaining set of data. The advantage of this procedure {{is that it can}} be used not only to diagnose unbalance but also to identify the type of unbalance in rotating machines...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} to investigate unbalance in Valeo hydraulically driven fan systems (HDFS). The principles of balancing have been modeled and applied to HDFS assemblies. The process from the initial build of the part during the molding process to the final completed assembly has been evaluated {{to determine how to}} best decrease unbalance in a manufacturing environment. The areas that were deemed to need significant improvement are the <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> specification and the act of inserting balls into the fan groove to correct for unbalance. A new specification of 48 kg-mm 2 was recommended and has been introduced to help expedite production cycle times, and a recommendation of a laser system to remove material from the outside of the ring has been made also been made. Preliminary {{studies have shown that the}} implementation of a laser balance system could yield very positive results with respect to repeatability and decreased cycle time. Improvement of this process has showed the potential to increase the profitability of Valeo HDFS assemblies in the current automotive market...|$|E
40|$|High {{speed drive}} shafts are {{traditionally}} balanced using trim balance weights {{applied to the}} shaft ends. This paper considers the development and theoretical analysis of a novel and alternative strategy of balancing long flexible coupling shafts, whereby the trim balancing weights are applied by the means {{of a pair of}} 'Balancing Sleeve' arms that are integrally attached to each end of the coupling shaft. The trim balance weights are intended to apply a corrective centrifugal force to the coupling shaft in order to limit shaft end reaction forces. With increasing speed, the magnitude of the corrective force also increases due to the flexibility of the balance sleeve. This thereby counteracts the increased <b>coupling</b> shaft <b>unbalance</b> resulting from its own flexibility. Additionally, it is also found that the mechanism imparts a corrective bending moment to the coupling shaft ends, which has a tendency to limit deflection. The methodology is modelled as a rotating simply supported shaft with uniform eccentricity and allows application to the problem of drivetrain balancing of sub- 15 MW industrial gas turbines. Results show that reaction loads can theoretically be reduced from 10, 000 N to approximately zero. The bending moment applied to the shaft is also shown to reduce shaft deflection theoretically to zero. In practical applications this will be unrealistic and achievable results show deflection theoretically reduced by half. Analysis of the balance sleeve feasibility is considered through use of a three-dimensional finite element model. Further to this paper, the aim is to develop a full dynamic model of both shaft and counterbalance sleeve, with verification coming from scaled, experimental test facilities.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, the dynamic behaviour of a Jeffcott rotor was {{studied in the}} presence of pure static unbalance and nonlinear elastic restoring forces. The present paper extends the analysis to a rigid rotor with an axial length such as to make the transverse moment of inertia greater than the axial one. As in the previous investigation, the elastic restoring forces are assumed to be nonlinear and the effects of <b>couple</b> <b>unbalance</b> are also included but, unlike the Jeffcott rotor, the system exhibits six degrees-of-freedom. The Lagrangian coordinates were fixed so as to coincide with the three coordinates of the centre of mass of the rotor and the three angular coordinates needed in order to express the rotor''s rotations with respect to a reference frame having its origin in the centre of mass. The precession motions of such a rotor turn out to be cylindrical at low angular speeds and exhibit a conical aspect when operating at higher speeds. The motion equations of the rotor were written with reference to a system that was subsequently adopted for the experimental analysis. The particular feature of this system was the use of a steel wire (piano wire) for the rotor shaft, suitably constrained and with the possibility of regulating the tension of the wire itself, in order to increase or reduce the nonlinear character of the system. The numerical analysis performed with integration of the motion equations made it possible to point out that chaotic solutions were manifested only when the tension in the wire was given the lowest values – i. e. when the system was strongly nonlinear – {{in the presence of}} considerable damping and rotor unbalance values that were so high as to lose any practical significance. Under conditions commonly shared by analogous real systems characterised by poor damping, where the contribution to nonlinearity is almost entirely due to elastic restoring forces, the analysis pointed out that precession motions may be manifested with a periodic character, whether synchronous or not, or a quasi-periodic character, but in no case is the solution chaotic...|$|E
