At large <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> a triangular wedge will exist {{in front of}} the blade, not moving relative to the blade. This wedge acts as a blade with a smaller blade angle. In fact, this reduces the sum of the 4 angles involved to a value much smaller than 180 °.

50|$|The {{miter saw}} makes cuts by pulling a {{spinning}} {{circular saw blade}} down onto a workpiece in a short, controlled motion. The workpiece is typically held against a fence, which provides a precise <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> between {{the plane of the}} blade and the plane of the longest workpiece edge.

In some weak or non-ductile materials this may form an acceptable chip, usually as a fine dust, but often it gives rise instead to a random [...] "snowplough" [...] effect where the waste material is bunched up ahead of the tool but not cleared decisively away as a well-formed chip.|$|E
5000|$|In 1963, the American Company, Ingersoll Milling Machine Co. in Rockford, Illinois, {{developed}} the first carbide plate saw {{that was used}} to cut steel plates with carbide tipped circular saw blades. The positive <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> of the teeth minimized the life of the tool.Between 1963 and 1969, professor Pahlitzsch and engineers Arno Willemeit and Horst Doepcke at the University of Braunschweig, developed new carbide tip geometry with a negative <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> and a pair of teeth which split the chip into three parts. With this development in tip geometry it became economical to saw alloy steel billets.In 1969, Advanced Machine & Engineering Co.

AME began to build these machines for the company Metalcut Inc., another Rockford based company.The machine was sold on the global market under the name Metalcut 12 and was exhibited at trade shows in Milan, Italy and Chicago. Its cutting efficiency was eight times faster than band saws and four times faster than HSS circular cold saws and revolutionized the production sawing market.|$|E
30|$|A {{digital image}} {{correlation}} (DIC) method {{was applied to}} measure strain which arose and remained beneath the finished surface in slow-speed orthogonal cutting of hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa), to evaluate the damage in the subsurface cell layers. While the quarter-sawn surface was cut parallel to the grain, the side surface, flat-sawn surface, was captured by a high-speed camera. The images were analyzed to calculate strain in a region of 0.67  ×  0.22  mm allocated beneath the finished surface. Almost no strain normal to the cutting direction was detected for the depth of cut and <b>cutting</b> <b>angles,</b> 0.05  mm and smaller than 60 °, respectively. For the depths of cut and <b>cutting</b> <b>angles,</b> larger than 0.1  mm and smaller than 60 °, respectively, the fore-split induced tensile strain normal to the cutting direction, although it hardly remained after the cutting. The compression strain normal to the cutting direction clearly remained for the <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> larger than 70 °, regardless of the depths of cut employed in this study. The subsurface damage assumed from the residual strain distribution corresponded to {{the appearance of the}} subsurface layer in the X-ray computed tomography (CT) images. It was also revealed, and the DIC program could not always measure excessively large strain correctly.|$|R

50|$|With recent {{advances}} in control and motion technology, 5-axis water jet cutting (abrasive and pure) has become a reality. Where the normal axes on a water jet are named Y (back/forth), X (left/right) and Z (up/down), a 5-axis system will typically add an A axis (angle from perpendicular) and C axis (rotation around the Z-axis). Depending on the cutting head, the maximum <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> for the A axis can be anywhere from 55, 60, {{or in some cases}} even 90 degrees from vertical. As such, 5-axis cutting opens up a wide range of applications that can be machined on a water jet cutting machine.|$|E

Direct metal mastering requires a radically different <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> than traditional (lacquer) cutting, almost 0 degrees. However the playback cartridges will always have the standard playback angle of 15-22.5°.

50|$|The Santoku has a straighter edge than a chef's knife, with a blunted sheepsfoot-tip {{blade and}} a thinner spine, {{particularly}} near the point. From 12 cm to 18 cm (5 to 7 inches) long, a true Japanese Santoku is well-balanced, normally flat-ground, and generally lighter and thinner than its Western counterparts, often using superior blade steels {{to provide a}} blade with exceptional hardness and an acute <b>cutting</b> <b>angle.</b> This construction allows the knife to more easily slice thin-boned and boneless meats, fish, and vegetables. Many subsequent Western and Asian copies of the Japanese Santoku do not always incorporate these features, resulting in reduced cutting ability. Some Western Santoku-pattern knives are even fitted with kullen/kuhlen, scallops {{on the sides of}} the blade above the edge, in an attempt to reduce the sticking of foods and reduce cutting friction. A standard in Asian (especially Japanese) kitchens, the santoku and its Western copies have become very popular in recent years with chefs in Europe and the United States.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{considers}} the residual thermal stresses induced by cooling in diamond coated carbides after the {{chemical vapor deposition}} process. Finite element analysis and simulation of thermally induced residual stresses was conducted using a transient thermo-mechanical coupled solver. Cutting tool geometry parameters including <b>cutting</b> edge <b>angle,</b> nose radius and film thickness were varied and the resulting thermal stresses were analyzed and compared. Both radial and hoop stresses {{were found to be}} compressive along the bisector of the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>angle</b> of sharp <b>cutting</b> tools with zero nose radius. Radial stresses were tensile and hoop stresses were compressive for honed tools with large nose radius. It was found that thermal stresses are mainly affected by the ratio of nose radius to film thickness (r/h). But the effect of <b>cutting</b> edge <b>angle</b> was most influential for cutting tools with sharp edges. Increasing the <b>cutting</b> edge <b>angle</b> for these tools generally resulted in an increase in the magnitude of thermal stresses. Qualitative criteria for film fracture was also applied, which revealed that film failure is most likely to occur in thick films and for cutting tools with large <b>cutting</b> edge <b>angles</b> and r/h ratios less than 1. 0. Some experimental validation of these criteria was also provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Owing to {{the complex}} {{geometry}} of helical cutting tools, several manufacturing pro-cesses are required to produce {{the profile of the}} cutter and the <b>cutting</b> <b>angles.</b> If the traditional method of manufacture were used, the cost would be frustratingly expensive. In this paper, a novel straight-sided hob cutter design consisting of two curved cutting edges and three straight cutting edges with different pressure angles is proposed. By applying designed rake profile equations of a hob cutter, the principle of coordinate transformation, the theory of differential geometry, and the theory of gearing, a mathematical model of the helical cutting tool is derived. In addition, the <b>cutting</b> <b>angles,</b> the condition of full undercutting, and the width of the top land of the cutter are also studied. The novelty of the design is such that the multiangles of the helical cutting tool can be manufactured in one hobbing process, thereby simplifying the man-ufacturing process. The results and concepts proposed in the paper will be beneficial as design guidance for tool designers, will enhance the manufacturing processes of helical cutting tools, and will assist tool-related industries in upgrading their technology and competitiveness...|$|R

In this paper, three-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the effect of impacting direction on abrasive cutting process during abrasive flow polishing. The molecular dynamics simulation software Lammps was used to simulate the cutting of single crystal copper with SiC abrasive grains at different cutting angles (0 o– 45 o). At a constant friction coefficient, we found a direct relation between <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> and cutting force, which ultimately increases the number of dislocation during abrasive flow machining. Our theoretical study reveal that a small <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> is beneficial for improving surface quality and reducing internal defects in the workpiece.

Sugarcane stalks were dynanically cut by rotary cutter of fixd of a shaft (Fig 7) The cutting was experimented at six cutting angles {{in a range of}} 0 °to 50 °, and at five cutting speeds in a range of 17 to 21 meters per second. The shape of cut ends of the sugarcane was examined as affected by the <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> and speed. The results obtained were in the following.
