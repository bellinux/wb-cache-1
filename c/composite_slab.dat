40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the fatigue damage process of a plate girder bridge {{supporting}} a steel-concrete <b>composite</b> <b>slab,</b> and to propose a method for maintenance of the <b>composite</b> <b>slab.</b> To analyze a full-scale bridge subjected to heavy traffic, three-dimensional non-linear FE analyses and loading rates based on an actual bridge are used. The full-scale bridge model is a 2 -lane road bridge with 30 m span length and 10. 55 m width, consisting of main girders with vertical stiffeners, cross beams, and <b>composite</b> <b>slab.</b> All structural elements were modeled as solid elements in order to enable detailed examination of stress distributions, although shear studs throughout the bottom plate were implicitly modeled as interface elements. The initial bond and surface friction between transverse ribs and concrete were taken to be the other types of interface elements. First, a static load was applied to the center of the slab at the mid-span of the bridge. Although slips between transverse ribs and concrete were observed during the static loading process, a rapid decrease of load carrying capacity of the <b>composite</b> <b>slab</b> was not observed. Next, four parallel moving loads, simulating the loads of vehicles, were applied to the slab along the bridge axis. Under high cycle load repetition, development of strains around the ribs was observed.

40|$|<b>Composite</b> steel-concrete <b>slabs</b> {{represent}} a popular form of flooring system in high rise buildings and bridges. This thesis comprises of experimental studies and numerical analyses into the behaviour of post-tensioned <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> and <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> with end anchorage. The shear {{bond between the}} profiled steel sheets and the concrete is very crucial to the behaviour and strength of post-tensioned <b>composite</b> <b>slabs.</b> Therefore, the possible influence of prestress on this bond behaviour is a fundamental issue for these types of slabs. In this context, a series of push tests incorporating post-tensioning at the steel bar to apply precompression to the concrete were conducted. The test {{results indicated that the}} prestress has a detrimental effect on the bond between the profiled steel sheets and concrete in post-tensioned <b>composite</b> <b>slabs.</b> This research study developed a three dimensional nonlinear finite element model of a post-tensioned push specimen using ABAQUS to simulate the bond stress-slip relations accurately. The bond stress-slip relations obtained from push tests were then assessed for post-tensioned profiled <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> numerically. A parametric study was conducted using the verified finite element model to study the effects of concrete strength, level of prestress, and thickness of the profiled steel sheets on the overall performance of this type of slabs. The end anchorages in combination with other shear transfer mechanism play an important role into the strength, stiffness and ductility of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs.</b> A series of tests were carried out on solid and profiled <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> under restrained and unrestrained conditions.

40|$|In {{many cases}} the {{capacity}} of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> with profiled steel sheeting depends on the shear resistance at the sheet-concrete interface.

Secondly, it aims to study the influence of different parameters on the load bearing capacity and behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> without performing a large number of full-scale tests. The behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> was investigated experimentally. A small-scale test, the concrete block bending test, was developed to measure the shear resistance at the concrete-sheet interface.

Moreover, six full-scale <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> with profiled steel sheet PEVA 45 were tested to determine the shear capacity of the slabs. The test results were evaluated according to the Swedish code and were used for comparison with the results from numerical simulations.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Composite</b> <b>slab</b> {{construction}} using permanent cold-formed steel decking {{has become}} one of the most economical and industrialized forms of flooring systems in modern building structures. Structural performance of the <b>composite</b> <b>slab</b> is affected directly by the horizontal shear bond phenomenon at steel-concrete interface layer. This study utilizes 3 D nonlinear finite element quasi-static analysis technique to analyze the shear bond damage and fracture mechanics of the composite slabs. Fracture by opening and sliding modes of the plain concrete over the corrugated steel decking had been modeled with concrete damaged plasticity model available in ABAQUS/Explicit module. The horizontal shear bond was simulated with cohesive element. Cohesive fracture properties such as fracture energy and initiation stress were derived from horizontal shear bond stress versus end slip curves. These curves were extracted from bending tests of narrow width <b>composite</b> <b>slab</b> specimens. Results of the numerical analyses match the experimental results accurately.

40|$|The use of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> {{is common}} {{because of its}} acceptance, {{technical}} quality and economic advantages. Design concepts for bending and longitudinal shear of the <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> are already embedded in the standardization. For the verification of the shear force capacity of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs,</b> the code of composite elements refers to the semi-empirical regulations for massive concrete beams without shear reinforcement. These empirical rules were not adapted to the specific bearing behaviour of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> and a discrete model for <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> under shear load is missing. Latest investigations with <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> and structural lightweight aggregate concrete revealed a safety deficit in case of shear failure. The inaccuracy {{in the description of}} the failure mode depended on an unfavourable ratio between concrete tensile strength and compressive strength and interacts with the anchorage of the longitudinal reinforcement. Within the scope of this project the failure mechanisms of vertical shear in <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> were separated and described in their effect in order to develop a suitable shear model. For this purpose, shear tests on <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> with varying plate geometry and an alternating combination with normal and lightweight con-crete were performed. A mechanically justified, variable design model for composite slaps subjected to shear forces was formulated from the gain in knowledge. The model is characterized by a variable formulation. It can be adapted to varying sheet geometries and is valid for lightweight and normal weight concrete. The previously neglected shear bearing capacity of the metal sheet was taken into account. The shear model is composed by the vertical bearing components of the metal sheet, the uncracked compression zone and the activatible part of the fracture process zone. The components act in an additive manner. Thus, a first proposal of a closed solution for the shear design of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> has been developed, which allows an efficient and safe utilization of this ceiling system. As the different bearing effects have been described individually, substitions or supplements of bearing mechanisms are easy. In future, the integration of the effect of fiber-reinforced concrete is conceivable. For the first time a research project dealt with an analysis for steel <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> under shear force. The findings allow conclusions on the structural behavior of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> and the differences to reinforced concrete beams. This provides the basis for further research approaches. An extensive data collection was performed and recorded in a database of <b>composite</b> <b>slabs</b> with vertical shear failure in order to support further investigations. Verbunddecke ist ein Deckensystem, das Akzeptanz und Wirtschaftlichkeit bei gleichzeitig ausgereifter bautechnischer Qualität vereint. Nachweiskonzepte zur Biegetragfähigkeit und Längsschubtragfähigkeit wurden bereits für normative Regelungen erarbeitet. Für die Bemessung unter Querkraft orientiert sich das Regelwerk für Verbundbau am Nachweiskonzept für Massivbauteile. Eine eigenständige, an die besondere konstruktive Gestaltung von Verbunddecken angepasste Bemessung ist nicht vorhanden. Bisher wird somit ein empirisch gestütztes Querkraftmodell verwendet, dessen statistische Kalibrierung ohne Berücksichtigung von Verbunddeckenversuchen vorgenommen wurde. Neuere Untersuchungen an Verbunddecken mit gefügedichtem Leichtbeton zeigten, dass bei einem ungünstigen Verhältnis der Zug- zur Druckfestigkeit des Betons und in Abhängigkeit der Verankerung der Längsbewehrung relevante Sicherheitsdefizite infolge Querkraftversagen auftreten können. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden die das Querkraftversagen bei Verbunddecken auslösenden Mechanismen separiert und in ihrer Wirkung beschrieben. Hierzu wurden eine Vielzahl von Querkraftversuchen an Verbunddecken mit variierender Blechgeometrie und in wechselnder Kombination mit Normal- und Leichtbeton durchgeführt. Aus dem Zugewinn an Erkenntnissen wurde ein mechanisch begründetes, variables Bemessungsmodell für Verbunddecken unter Querkraftbeanspruchung formuliert. Das Modell zeichnet sich durch die Berücksichtigung der bisher vernachlässigten Eigentragfähigkeit des Verbundblechs aus und kann zudem flexibel an die verwendete Betonart sowie an variierende Blechgeometrien angepasst werden. Das Querkraftmodell setzt sich aus den additiv wirkenden Traganteilen des Blechs, der ungerissenen Druckzone sowie der aktivierten Bruchprozesszone zusammen. Damit wurde ein geschlossener Lösungsvorschlag zur Querkraftbemessung erarbeitet, welcher eine optimale und sichere Ausnutzung des Deckensystems ermöglicht. Da die Einzeltragwirkungen individuell und mechanisch beschrieben wurden sind Ergän-zungen leicht möglich, so dass zukünftig auch die Einbindung der Wirkung von Faserbeton denkbar wäre. In der Arbeit wurde erstmals der Frage nach einem ingenieurmäßigen Nachweisformat für Verbunddecken unter Schubbeanspruchung nachgegangen. Die gewonnenen Erkenntnisse ermöglichen Schlussfolgerungen zu dem von Stahlbetonbalken abweichenden Tragverhalten und liefern damit eine Basis für weitere Forschungsansätze. Um dies zu unterstützen wurde eine umfangreiche Datensammlung durchgeführt und in einer Versuchsdatenbank von Stahlverbunddecken mit Querkraftversagen festgehalten. ...|$|R
