40|$|Abstract—Emerging {{applications}} of computer vision and pattern recognition in mobile devices and networked computing require {{the development of}} resourcelimited algorithms. Linear classification techniques {{have an important role}} to play in this context, given their simplicity and low computational requirements. The paper reviews the state-of-the-art in gender classification, giving special attention to linear techniques and their relations. It discusses why linear techniques are not achieving competitive results and shows how to obtain state-of-the-art performances. Our work confirms previous results reporting very <b>close</b> <b>classification</b> accuracies for Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and boosting algorithms on single-database experiments. We have proven that Linear Discriminant Analysis on a linearly selected set of features also achieves similar accuracies. We perform cross-database experiments and prove that single database experiments were optimistically biased. If enough training data and computational resources are available, SVM’s gender classifiers are superior to the rest. When computational resources are scarce but there is enough data, boosting or linear approaches are adequate. Finally, if training data and computational resources are very scarce, then the linear approach is the best choice...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{past and}} current methods the IRS uses {{to determine which}} individual income tax returns to audit. The IRS currently uses the discriminant function to give all individual tax returns two scores; one based on {{whether it should be}} audited or not and one based on if the return is likely to have unreported income. The discriminant function is determined by the IRS’s National Research Program, which takes a sample of returns and ensures their accuracy. Previously, the function was determined by the IRS’s Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program. However, this was too burdensome and time consuming for taxpayers. The data mining techniques of decision trees, regression, and neural networks were researched to determine if the IRS should change its method. Unfortunately IRS tax data were not obtainable due to their confidentiality; therefore credit data from a German bank was used to compare discriminant analysis results to the three new methods. All of the methods were run to predict creditworthiness and were compared based on misclassification rates. The neural network had the best classification rate closely followed by regression, the decision tree, and then discriminant analysis. Since this comparison is not based on IRS tax data, no conclusion can be made whether the IRS should change its method or not, but because all methods had very <b>close</b> <b>classification</b> rates, it would be worthwhile for the IRS to look into them...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel family of {{nonlinear}} diffusions {{and apply it}} tothe problem of segmentation of multivalued images defined on arbitrary graphs. These equations generalize previously proposed scalar-valued diffusion equations which {{have been used for}} segmenting grayscale images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new methods on a large number of color, texture and natural image segmentation tasks. We in addition introduce another extension of our diffusion equations which can process orientation images, i. e., images whose every pixel takes values on a circle. ^ We analyze a specific scalar-valued diffusion equation and show that it {{can be used as a}}n approximate method for solving the constrained total variation minimization problem posed by Osher, Rudin, and Fatemi. We illustrate the resulting algorithm by applying it to noise removal problems. ^ We develop a real-time, strip-based, low-complexity document page classification algorithm, which can be used as a copy mode selector in the copy pipeline. It analyzes the scanned RGB images and classifies them into one of eight modes. Modes are the combinations of mono/color and text/mix/picture/photo settings. Mode classification is 35 % to 99 % accurate with misclassifications tending towards benign modes. The benefits of such a copy mode selector include improving copy quality, simplifying user interaction, and increasing copy rate. We also propose an alternative algorithm working on the image data represented in an opponent color space. The algorithm reduces the computational complexity by a factor of three, and maintains very <b>close</b> <b>classification</b> results to the algorithm designed for the $RGB$ color space. ...|$|E

40|$|Describing {{the pattern}} and the spatial {{distribution}} of land cover is traditionally based on remote sensing data analysis {{and one of the}} most commonly techniques applied has been image classification. The main objective of the present study has been to evaluate the combined use of Hyperion hyperspectral imagery with the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) classifiers for discriminating land-cover classes in a typical Mediterranean setting. Accuracy assessment of the derived thematic maps was based on the analysis of the classification confusion matrix statistics computed for each classification map, using for consistency the same set of validation points. Results indicated a <b>close</b> <b>classification</b> accuracy between the two classifiers, with the SVMs somehow outperforming the ANNs by 3. 31 % overall accuracy and by 0. 038 kappa coefficient. Although both classifiers produced close results, SVMs generally appeared most useful in describing the spatial distribution and the cover density of each land cover category. The higher classification accuracy by SVMs was attributed principally to the ability of this classifier to identify an optimal separating hyperplane for classes? separation which allows a low generalization error, thus producing the best possible classes? separation. On the other, as a key disadvantage of both techniques was identified that both do not operate on a sub-pixel level, which can significantly reduce their accuracy due to possible mixture problems occurred when coarse spatial resolution remote sensing imagery is used. All in all, this study demonstrated that, provided that a Hyperion hyperspectral imagery can be made available at regular time intervals over a given region, when combined with either SVMs or ANNs classifiers, can potentially enable a wider approach in land use/cover mapping. This can be of particular importance, especially for regions like in the Mediterranean basin, since it can be related to mapping and monitoring of land degradation and desertification phenomena which are evident in such areas.

However traditional approaches suffer from either a high false positive rate or high false negative rate, especially when the collected sensor data are unbalanced. Therefore, {{there is a lack}} of tradeoff between false alarms and misses for many traditional data mining methods to be applied. To solve this problem a novel fall detection algorithm based on pattern recognition and human posture analysis is presented in this paper. It firstly extracts thirty temporal features from the original data traces for different length adaptation of samples, and then exploits Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to filter the noisy character data and reduce the dimension of feature vectors. After that, it performs a <b>closer</b> <b>classification</b> with one-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to filter the high false positive samples, and finally applies posture analysis to counteract the effects of high false negative samples until a satisfying accuracy is achieved. Simulation with real data demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing approaches.

This paper introduces a study on two eye components (i. e., iris and sclera) for robust open or <b>closed</b> eye <b>classification</b> that can lead to efficient eye blink detection. Evidently, the area of iris or sclera increases while a person opens an eye and decreases while an eye is closing.

Using that knowledge, an eye state classification can be effectively achieved by Bayes classifier.

The latter in many ways are acknowledged to be far from primitive; their endospores, flagella, and food habits all indicate a relatively high degree of specialization. Hence it would seem biologically more reasonable to look upon this group of Streptothrices with their variable morphology and close relationships as representing the ancestral type that gave rise to both the higher fungi and true bacteria, and not as being themselves higher bacteria. The various bacteria, other than the acid-fast forms, can readily have arisen from the non-acid-fast bacillary types, or even as non-acid-fast specializations of the mixed types. All the various forms shown at present by the bacteria,—cocci, spirilla, bacilli, etc.,—either separate or in chains and masses, are to be recognized in this group, and specializations in one or another line in the past would readily have given rise to the types we consider true bacteria. The processes of evolution have carried them far away from the parent stock and made them into this group. The recognition of this group complex and of the intermediate forms indicates clearly the past history and present relations of these interesting organisms. These relations may be represented by the following scheme. See PDF for Structure It is probable that the relation between the acid-fast organisms and the Streptothrices is a closer one than that between the Streptothrices and the bacteria, perhaps close enough to warrant a common genus for both...|$|R
