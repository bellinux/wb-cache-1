5|$|At {{the center}} of the Sun is the <b>core</b> <b>region,</b> a volume of {{sufficient}} temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur. Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation. Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection. It is believed that the movement of mass within the convection zone creates the magnetic activity that generates sunspots.|$|E
5|$|Core-collapse {{is thought}} to occur when the more massive stars in a {{globular}} cluster encounter their less massive companions. Over time, dynamic processes cause individual stars to migrate {{from the center of}} the cluster to the outside. This results in a net loss of kinetic energy from the <b>core</b> <b>region,</b> leading the remaining stars grouped in the <b>core</b> <b>region</b> to occupy a more compact volume. When this gravothermal instability occurs, the central region of the cluster becomes densely crowded with stars and the surface brightness of the cluster forms a power-law cusp. (Note that a core collapse is not the only mechanism that can cause such a luminosity distribution; a massive black hole at the core can also result in a luminosity cusp.) Over a lengthy period of time this leads to a concentration of massive stars near the core, a phenomenon called mass segregation.|$|E

40|$|Motivation: Homologous protein {{families}} share highly {{conserved sequence}} and structure regions that are frequent targets for comparative analysis of related proteins and families. Many protein families, such as the curated domain families in the Conserved Domain Database, exhibit similar structural cores. To improve accuracy in aligning such protein families, we propose a profile-profile method CORAL that aligns individual <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> as gap-free units. Results. CORAL computes optimal local alignment of two profiles with heuristics to preserve continuity within <b>core</b> <b>regions.</b> We benchmarked its performance on curated domains in CDD, which have pre-defined <b>core</b> <b>regions,</b> against COMPASS, HHalign, and PSI-BLAST, using structure superpositions and comprehensive curatoroptimized alignments as standards of truth. CORAL improves alignment accuracy on <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> over general profile methods, returning a balanced score of 0. 57 for over 80 % of all domain families in CDD, compared to the highest balanced score of 0. 45 from other methods. Further, CORAL provides E-values to aid in detecting homologous protein families and, by respecting block boundaries, produces alignments with improved “readability ” that facilitate manual refinement.

5|$|Like the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the <b>core</b> <b>region,</b> which lasted until the relatively recent past.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large <b>core</b> <b>region.</b> At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small <b>core</b> <b>region.</b> A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E

40|$|We present {{analysis}} of the flux and polarization variability of parsec scale radio jets from a dual-frequency, six-epoch, VLBA polarization experiment monitoring 12 blazars. The observations were made at 15 and 22 GHz at bimonthly intervals over 1996. Here we analyze the flux, fractional polarization, and polarization position angle behavior of <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> and jet features, considering both the linear trends of these quantities with time and more rapid fluctuations about the linear trends. The dual frequency nature of the observations allows us to examine spectral evolution, to separate Faraday effects from changes in magnetic field order, and also to deduce empirical estimates for the uncertainties in measuring properties of VLBI jet features (see the Appendix). Our main results include the following: On timescales � 1 year, we find that jet features generally decayed in flux, with older features decaying more slowly than younger features. Using the decay rates of jet features from six sources, we find I ∝ R − 1. 3 ± 0. 1. Short term fluctuations in flux tended to be fractionally larger in <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> than in jet features, with the more compact <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> having the larger fluctuations. We find significant spectral index changes in the <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> of four sources. Taken together these are consistent with an outburst-ejection cycle for new jet components. Jet features from one source showed a significant spectral flattening over time...|$|R
5|$|The {{interaction}} {{of stars in}} the collapsed <b>core</b> <b>region</b> causes tight binary systems to form. As other stars interact with these tight binaries, they increase the energy at the core, which causes the cluster to re-expand. As the mean time for a core collapse is typically less than {{the age of the}} galaxy, many of a galaxy's globular clusters may have passed through a core collapse stage, then re-expanded.|$|E

The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from {{the formation of the}} Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn's <b>core</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar. A sufficiently dense, and hot, <b>core</b> <b>region</b> will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E

These findings suggest that agglomeration economies are likely to accommodate heterogeneous firms to co-exist in the same region. ...|$|R

40|$|Chicken is {{recognized}} as an excellent model for studies of genetic mechanism of phenotypic and genomic evolution, with large effective population size and strong human-driven selection. In the present study, we performed Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) tests to identify significant <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> employing 600 K SNP Chicken chip in an F 2 population of 1, 534 hens, which was derived from reciprocal crosses between White Leghorn and Dongxiang chicken. Results indicated that a total of 49, 151 <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> with an average length of 9. 79 Kb were identified, which occupied approximately 52. 15 % of genome across all autosomes, and 806 significant <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> attracted us mostly. Genes in candidate regions may experience positive selection and were considered to have possible influence on beneficial economic traits. A panel of genes including AASDHPPT, GDPD 5, PAR 3, SOX 6, GPC 1 and a signal pathway of AKT 1 were detected with the most extreme P-values. Further enrichment analyses indicated that these genes were associated with immune function, sensory organ development and neurogenesis, and may have experienced positive selection in chicken. Moreover, some of <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> exactly overlapped with genes excavated in our previous GWAS, suggesting that these genes have undergone positive selection may affect egg production. Findings in our study could draw a comparatively integrate genome-wide map of selection signature in the chicken genome, and would be worthy for explicating the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic diversity in poultry breeding...|$|R
5|$|All main-sequence {{stars have}} a <b>core</b> <b>region</b> where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Main-sequence stars employ {{two types}} of {{hydrogen}} fusion processes, {{and the rate of}} energy generation from each type depends on the temperature in the <b>core</b> <b>region.</b> Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on which of the two is the dominant fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is primarily generated {{as the result of the}} proton-proton chain, which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficiently high core temperatures to efficiently use the CNO cycle. (See the chart.) This process uses atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen as intermediaries in the process of fusing hydrogen into helium.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the <b>core</b> <b>region.</b> The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E

In present study, we performed Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (EHH) tests to identify significant <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> harboring such signals in Chinese Holstein, and then verified the biological significance of these identified regions based on commonly-used bioinformatics analyses. Results showed a total of 125 significant regions in entire genome containing some of important functional genes such as LEP, ABCG 2, CSN 1 S 1, CSN 3 and TNF based on the Gene Ontology database. Some of these annotated genes involved in the <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> overlapped with those identified in our previous GWAS as well as those involved in a recently constructed candidate gene database for cattle, further indicating these genes under positive selection maybe underlie milk production traits and other important traits in Chinese Holstein. Furthermore, in the enrichment analyses for the second level GO terms and pathways, we observed some significant terms over represented in these identified regions as compared to the entire bovine genome. This indicates that some functional genes associated with milk production traits, as reflected by GO terms, could be clustered in <b>core</b> <b>regions,</b> which provided promising evidence for the exploitability of the <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> identified by EHH tests. Findings in our study could help detect functional candidate genes under positive selection for further genetic and breeding research in Chinese Holstein...|$|R

A definite enhancement of LECP fluxes within the <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> (where the PLS densities and magnetic-field pressure are lower than in the surrounding regions) is shown, indicating that this hot tenuous plasma is present within the <b>core</b> <b>regions.</b> In general {{there is a strong}} anticorrelation between PLS density and LECP fluxes, while a less pronounced anticorrelation between magnetic-field pressure and LECP fluxes is observed. Estimates of LECP pressures suggest that this hot plasma can provide the previously described missing pressure in the core if heavy ions dominate the ion composition. The angular dependence of the LECP data indicates a flow of this hot plasma in the anti-Jupiter direction. This outflowing plasma could be the remnant of the magnetospheric wind observed near Jupiter by LECP. On the basis of this preliminary study, the <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> are found to have similarities to a plasma sheet...|$|R

5|$|The Earth {{formed from}} the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets {{acquired}} different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system. In turn, {{the natural history of}} the Earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98kg. It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%), and aluminium (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to planetary differentiation, the <b>core</b> <b>region</b> is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the <b>core</b> <b>region</b> of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

The mechanism for producing these jets is not well understood.|$|E

In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum. The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of {{this time period}}, as <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> encouraged the development of manufacturing in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.|$|R
5|$|After a {{star has}} formed, it generates thermal {{energy in the}} dense <b>core</b> <b>region</b> through nuclear fusion of {{hydrogen}} atoms into helium. During {{this stage of the}} star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. All main-sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium, where outward thermal pressure from the hot core is balanced by the inward pressure of gravitational collapse from the overlying layers. The strong dependence of the rate of energy generation in the core on the temperature and pressure helps to sustain this balance. Energy generated at the core makes its way to the surface and is radiated away at the photosphere. The energy is carried by either radiation or convection, with the latter occurring in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both.|$|E
5|$|In the Islamic East, the Caliph {{was forced}} to {{acknowledge}} {{the reality of the}} Saffarids' domination and established a modus vivendi with them, perhaps hoping, according to Hugh Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarids were recognized in their possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty that was centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu'tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their <b>core</b> <b>region</b> around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.|$|E

Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be {{explained by the fact that}} a significant portion of the tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but the primary goal of the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by three observations about the link between international trade and international business cycle synchronization: (1) a large increase in trade in manufactures over the last 30 years, (2) a larger fraction of trade between <b>core</b> and periphery <b>regions</b> relative to <b>core</b> <b>regions</b> {{is in the form}} of production sharing, (3) crosscountry output correlations have increased between <b>core</b> and periphery <b>regions</b> relative to <b>core</b> <b>regions.</b> We examine to what extent these observations can be reconciled in a multi-country version of a standard model of international business cycles. Production sharing is captured in a simple way as trade in intermediate inputs that are complements in production. We find that the model is successful qualitatively in account for these observations. Quantitatively, we find that the direct effects from trade do not generate large divergence in output correlationsacrosscountries. Weextendthemodel to allow for cost reduction spillovers from MNEs in the core country to their affiliates in the periphery. This mechanism increases the impact that product sharing has on output correlations between core and peripheral countries. ...|$|R
