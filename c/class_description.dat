40|$|A {{knowledge-based}} system for inferring physical and biological surface properties of vegetation using nadir and/or directional reflectance data as input is developed. A {{portion of this}} system has been developed to discriminate between user-defined vegetation classes using spectral and directional reflectance relationships. This discrimination program was used to classify targets into user-defined ground cover and plant height classes. The program learns class descriptors from samples (both positive and negative) of spectral, directional reflectance data of natural surfaces (bare soils, natural vegetation, and agricultural vegetation). The system is designed to handle any combination of directional view angles. The explicit relationships used in the <b>class</b> <b>descriptions</b> include greater-than relationships between combinations of two view angles and maximum and minimum value relationships.

The core {{idea of the}} DynaBot service discovery system is to use domain-specific service <b>class</b> <b>descriptions</b> powered by an intelligent Deep Web crawler. In contrast to current registry-based service discovery systems – like the several available UDDI registries – DynaBot promotes focused crawling of the Deep Web of services and discovers candidate services {{that are relevant to}} the domain of interest.

40|$|Logic (DL) theory, {{which has}} been {{investigated}} for more than 25 years. OWL reasoning systems offer various DL-based inference services such as (i) checking <b>class</b> <b>descriptions</b> for consistency and automatically organizing them into classification hierarchies, (ii) checking descriptions about individuals for consistency and recognizing individuals as instances of <b>class</b> <b>descriptions.</b> These services can therefore be utilized {{in a variety of}} application domains concerned with representation of and reasoning about knowledge, for example, in biological sciences. Classification {{is an integral part of}} all biological sciences, including the new discipline of genomics. Biologists not only wish to build complex descriptions of the categories of biological molecules, but also to classify instances of new molecules against these <b>class</b> level <b>descriptions.</b> In this chapter we introduce to the non-expert reader the basics of OWL DL and its related reasoning patterns such as classification.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} both an object-oriented multi-layered {{approach to}} application design {{as well as}} the programming system which implements the methodology presented. The layered approach was motivated by the need for providing support for different kinds of knowledge representation in the application design process and sharing the same object base between software components using these representations. The approach presented is based on layered representation of application using logic for description of application concepts on high level of abstraction and incorporating these into an Object-Oriented (OO) environment. In addition to traditional levels of description in OO systems two original layers are introduced: implicit <b>class</b> <b>description</b> and metaspecification. These both are based on logic but of different kind. The implicit <b>class</b> <b>description</b> uses Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus and metaspecification relies on Horn logic as underlaying fundamental framework. The approach p [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Pre-publication {{draft of}} paper {{accepted}} for publication in the Proceedings of AI’ 92, pp 374 - 379 This paper describes a method for extending domain models in classification learning by deriving new attributes from existing ones. The process starts by examining examples of different classes which have overlapping ranges in all of their numeric attribute values. Based on existing attributes, new attributes which enhance the distinguishability of a class are created. These additional attributes are then used in the subsequent classification learning process. The research revealed that this method can enable relationships between attributes to be incorporated in the classification procedures and, depending {{on the nature of}} data, significantly increase the coverage of class descriptions, improve the accuracy of classifying novel instances and reduce the number of clauses in <b>class</b> <b>description</b> when compared to classification learning alone. Evaluation with the data on iris flower classification showed that the classification accuracy is slightly improved and the number of clauses in the <b>class</b> <b>description</b> is significantly reduced. ...|$|E
