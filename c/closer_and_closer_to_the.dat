25|$|This bizarre {{method of}} {{insemination}} probably evolved as male bed bugs competed {{with each other}} to place their sperm <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mother lode of eggs, the ovaries. Some male insects evolved long penises with which they enter the vagina but bypass the female's storage pouch and deposit their sperm further upstream close to the ovaries. A few males, notably among bed bugs, evolved traumatic insemination instead, and eventually this strange procedure became the norm among these insects.|$|E

25|$|In August 1918 the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) {{was working}} on {{building}} a level crossing at Smørstein {{as part of a}} realignment of a road. The earthwork from the construction was piled up close to the fjord. Its weight caused a landslide on 17 August, in which the masses slid into the fjord. This caused a series of successive smaller slides, each wave originating <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railway tracks. All available maintenance of way crew were prescribed from the district. NSB originally operated trains past the section, but eventually chose to evacuate the trains while they ran past the site.|$|E
25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to the optimal solution in cases where finding the optimal solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> optimal solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find the optimal solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to the optimal solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic. When a bound on the error of the non-optimal solution is known, the algorithm is further categorized as an approximation algorithm.|$|E
25|$|The {{peace talks}} in Paris, the {{viability}} of South Vietnam, of its military and its government, {{and its effect on}} American disengagement, became the prime stories during this period for the news media. The reportage of the Tet/Khe Sanh period had been unique, and after it was over reportage settled back into its normal routines. According to Clarence Wyatt, the American disengagement was:like watching a film running backward. American troops were leaving, until there were only a handful of advisers left. The communists were once again on the advance, spreading their influence <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> major cities. The South Vietnamese military was once again on the defensive, and the leadership of the nation was isolated and increasingly paranoid... Nixon's goal, like Kennedy's, was for the press to have nothing to report.|$|E

25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a spiral flight path that gets <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> light source.|$|E
25|$|Node lookups {{can proceed}} asynchronously. The {{quantity}} of simultaneous lookups is denoted by α and is typically three. A node initiates a FIND_NODE request by querying to the α nodes {{in its own}} k-buckets that are the closest ones to the desired key. When these recipient nodes receive the request, they will look in their k-buckets and return the k closest nodes to the desired key that they know. The requester will update a results list with the results (node ID's) he receives, keeping the k best ones (the k nodes that are closer to the searched key) that respond to queries. Then the requester will select these k best results and issue the request to them, and iterate this process again and again. Because every node has a better knowledge of his own surroundings than any other node has, the received results will be other nodes that are every time <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> searched key. The iterations continue until no nodes are returned that are closer than the best previous results. When the iterations stop, the best k nodes in the results list are {{the ones in the}} whole network that are the closest to the desired key.|$|E
25|$|Colony-level {{inhibitory}} {{strategies can}} also create 'organizational immunity'. For example, social insect workers tend to work initially at {{the centre of}} the nest, nursing the brood, and as they age adopt tasks <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> periphery, e.g., foraging. This compartmentalization, termed centrifugal polyethism, means that workers of the same age interact mainly with others of the same age, who are performing the same task in the same spatial compartment: thus if a new disease arises that is transmitted through physical worker-worker contact it is limited to one section of the colony. The spatial structuring of western honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera) privileges young individuals-when colonies are afflicted with diseases that have a short infectious period (the time period during which infected individuals can transmit the disease to susceptible individuals), it is confined only to the older individuals closer to the outside. In the common eastern bumblebee (Bombus impatiens), workers who feed larvae tend to remain near {{the centre of the}} nest even when not performing this activity, and the converse is true for workers who forage; 11–13% of workers remain in small zones a particular distance from the nest centre throughout their life. The demographic distribution of a colony can also can be utilized for antiparasite purposes: work on Z. angusticollis has shown that not only are there differences to parasite susceptibility between instars but that the demographic constitution of a group significantly affects survivorship (mixed age groups do better than single-age groups). The effect of colony structuring on disease dynamics and social immunity is also analyzed theoretically using mathematical models.|$|E

25|$|Together {{with the}} Waldensians and the Lollards (led by John Wycliffe), the Bohemian Reformation is {{considered}} to be the precursor to the Protestant Reformation. These movements are sometimes referred to as the First Reformation in the Czech historiography. Despite the influence of the German and Swiss Reformations, the Bohemian Reformation did not bleed into them, although many Czech Utraquists grew <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lutherans. The Bohemian Reformation kept its own development until the suppression of the Bohemian Revolt in 1620. The victorious restored King Ferdinand II decided to force every inhabitant of Bohemia and Moravia to become Roman Catholic in accordance with the principle cuius regio, eius religio of the Peace of Augsburg (1555). The Bohemian Reformation ended up being diffused in the Protestant world and gradually lost its distinctiveness. The Patent of Toleration issued in 1781 by Emperor Joseph II did not lead to a restoration of the Bohemian Reformation. Joseph II did not respect the Bohemian religious tradition and therefore only Lutheran, Calvinist and Eastern Orthodox faiths were made legal in the Crown of Bohemia and other parts of his realm. In spite of the extinction of the Bohemian Reformation as a distinctive Christian movement, its tradition did not disappear. Many churches (not only in the Czech Republic) do not forget their legacy, refer to the Bohemian Reformation and try to continue its tradition, e. g. the Moravian Church (the continuator of the scattered Unity of the Brethren), Protestant Church of Czech Brethren (Českobratrská církev evangelická), Czechoslovak Hussite Church (Československá církev husitská), Church of Brethren (Církev bratrská), Unity of Brethren Baptists (Bratrská jednota baptistů) and other denominations.|$|E

500|$|Aronofsky {{planned to}} have a strong {{presentation}} of the thematic movement from darkness into light. He originally sought to show only a silhouette of the man until the second of the film's three acts, but he chose not to be so extreme, wanting to be more communicative to the audience. The movement was presented less aggressively in the film; Jackman's characters are seen in silhouette at the beginning, kept out of key light. In each of the three periods, the lighting on Jackman's characters is initially dim and gradually grows brighter as the storylines unfold. Meanwhile, Weisz's characters are frequently awash with light in the storylines. Libatique described the metaphoric change of the lighting on Jackman's characters, [...] "We follow the arc of the Thomas character as he gets <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{variation}} {{in a physical}} coupling constant under changes of scale can be understood qualitatively as coming from {{the action of the}} field on virtual particles carrying the relevant charge. [...] The Landau pole behavior of QED (related to quantum triviality) is a consequence of screening by virtual charged particle–antiparticle pairs, such as electron–positron pairs, in the vacuum. [...] In the vicinity of a charge, the vacuum becomes polarized: virtual particles of opposing charge are attracted to the charge, and virtual particles of like charge are repelled. [...] The net effect is to partially cancel out the field at any finite distance. [...] Getting <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central charge, one sees less and less of the effect of the vacuum, and the effective charge increases.|$|E
2500|$|The clinician-historian Joel Braslow {{argues that}} from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, {{physical}} psychiatric therapies [...] "spiral <b>closer</b> <b>and</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{interior of the}} brain" [...] with this organ increasingly taking [...] "center stage {{as a source of}} disease and site of cure." [...] For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances or, at least they were deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate if desperate remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless. Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights.|$|E
