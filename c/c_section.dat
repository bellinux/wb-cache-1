500|$|From these chords, Copland builds {{an overall}} {{structure}} that he calls [...] "closest {{to a free}} treatment of the baroque form of the chaconne," [...] with a succession of variations [...] "based on the opening chords and their implied melodic intervals." [...] A series of variations alternate fast and slow sections, which according to Copland biographer Howard Pollack creates a complex structure overall. This structure forms a musical arch, sectioned ABCBA. Pollack calls the A sections [...] "prophetic, tragic," [...] the B sections [...] "jazzy, frentic [...] " [...] and the <b>C</b> <b>section</b> [...] "pastoral, reflective." [...] While these are all moods long familiar to listeners of Copland's music, Pollack asserts, [...] "a new darkness hangs over the whole. The outer sections are grave; the jazzy sections rather cheerless; the pastoral contrast more weary than peaceful. The music often seems lost, uncertain, trapped." [...] The piece ends {{in a series of}} strict 12-note chords that Copland called [...] "aggregates." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{available data}} on the frequency of obstetrical interventions (<b>C.</b> <b>sections,</b> episiotomies, and oxytocics) in developing countries. Rates of <b>C.</b> <b>sections</b> are increasing and are higher than 15 % in a majority of Latin American countries and in some regions of Asia. There is no indication of rising rates of <b>C.</b> <b>sections</b> in Africa, but rates are already higher than 5 % in many urban areas of East and Southern Africa. The situation is different in West Africa, where only Ghana has a rate higher than 5 % in urban areas. High episiotomy rates {{have been reported in}} Africa and Latin America. Hospitals in Argentina and Nigeria have episiotomy rates higher than 80 % among primiparae. A 37 % episiotomy rate among primiparae was reported in Burkina Faso. High rates of use of oxytocin during the first and second stage of labor have also been observed in Africa. In three African urban areas, oxytocin was used in more than 20 % of deliveries. We conclude that the epidemic of <b>C.</b> <b>sections</b> continues in Latin America and extends into Asia. In addition, there are signs of a worldwide epidemic of other obstetrical interventions. There is an urgent need to build strong strategies to promote evidence-based interventions...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} use of thin steel <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with large circular, hexagonal and diamond web openings in applications where service integration in beams is required or where thermal bridging of members crossing the building envelope has to be minimised. The effect of these openings in terms of combined bending and shear effects on stainless steel and thin steel <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> is evaluated. The behaviour of thin steel <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with large web openings in shear is a new subject and the knowledge gap is mainly concerned with the local buckling around and between openings which affect {{the ability of the}} perforated section to resist shear. Simply supported beams were considered in this research. The main part of the research was divided into various parts as follows: Simple theories were developed for the design of thin steel with circular web openings (Tangential Stress Method) and with hexagonal web openings. The Tangential Stress Method is a method in which the tangential stresses around the web openings are determined {{as a function of the}} applied shear force. A total of 16 tests on pairs of <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with web openings was carried out. Three groups of beams were tested as follows: 1 -	Stainless steel <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> of 210 mm depth and 70 mm width with 150 mm diameter openings at 50, 100 and 250 mm edge distances were tested. Two groups of stainless steel were tested; Austenitic and Lean Duplex (LDX) grades of 2 and 3 mm thickness. For beams with isolated and widely spaced web openings, Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling was the mode of failure. Beams with closely spaced web openings failed by web-post buckling. 2 -	Galvanized steel sections of 250 mm depth and 63 mm flange width with 150 and 180 mm diameter web openings at 60 and 90 mm edge distances were tested in 1. 5 and 1. 8 mm steel thicknesses. The failure of the <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with isolated web openings was due to Vierendeel bending associated with local buckling. For closely spaced web openings, the failure was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. 3 -	Galvanized <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with diamond and hexagonal web openings were tested to investigate the shape of the web openings effect on the behaviour of the beams subject to shear. The diamond-shaped openings were 180 mm deep and hexagonal openings were 167 mm deep. The failure of beams with isolated diamond-shaped web openings was due to buckling of the un-supported web next to the openings. For the <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> with pairs of openings, it was due to web-post buckling and twisting of the top flange. The bending resistances of the two <b>C</b> <b>sections</b> were then predicted from the parametric study and were compared with the design resistance calculated using section properties to BS EN 1993 - 1 - 3 and BS EN 1993 - 1 - 4. The tangential stresses using the method presented in Chapter 4 were calculated at the failure loads in all tests for beams with circular web openings and compared to the measured steel strengths fy at 0. 2...|$|R

2500|$|A Proposition 218 {{specialist}} {{law firm}} representing local governments in California {{concluded that the}} California Cannabis Coalition case was a narrow decision that “leaves the two-thirds-voter-approval requirement for local taxes in place and makes only a very modest change to earlier understandings of Proposition 218 and the law of initiatives.” In support of the foregoing conclusion, the analysis stated: [...] “The Court goes on, however, to make clear the two-thirds-voter-approval requirement for special taxes -- taxes which may be spent only for a stated purpose -- does apply to initiatives: [...] ‘In article XIII <b>C,</b> <b>section</b> 2, subdivision (d), for example, the enactors adopted a requirement providing that, before a local government can impose, extend, or increase any special tax, voters must approve the tax by a two-thirds vote. That constitutes a higher vote requirement than would otherwise apply. … That the voters explicitly imposed a procedural two-thirds vote requirement on themselves in article XIII <b>C,</b> <b>section</b> 2, subdivision (d) is evidence {{that they did not}} implicitly impose a procedural timing requirement in subdivision (b).’” ...|$|E
