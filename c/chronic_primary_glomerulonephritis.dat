40|$|AbstractIgA {{nephropathy}} (nephropathy with mesangial IgA and IgG deposits, so-called Berger's disease) is {{the most}} common <b>primary</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> worldwide, and was first described in 1968. Histopathologically, IgA nephropathy is characterized by expansion of the glomerular mesangial matrix with mesangial cell proliferation and/or mononuclear cell infiltration. Glomeruli typically contain generalized-diffuse granular mesangial deposits of IgA (mainly IgA 1), IgG and C 3. This disease, therefore, is considered to be an immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis although the antigenic agents are still obscure. Clinically, patients with IgA nephropathy show microscopic and macroscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria. Although the clinical course is generally gradual in patients with IgA nephropathy, progression to renal hypertension, renal anemia, and end-stage kidney disease is not as rare as originally thought. Since pathogenesis and radical treatment for IgA nephropathy are still not established, it is necessary to study them using various clinical findings...|$|R
40|$|Early {{increase}} {{in blood pressure}} and diastolic left ventricular malfunction in patients with glomerulonephritis. In patients with diabetic nephropathy blood pressure increases progressively before the conventional threshold of normal blood pressure (140 / 90 mm Hg) is transgressed. In patients with glomerulonephritis, no information on this point is available. To clarify this issue we sequentially examined 20 untreated patients with biopsy-proven <b>primary</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (GN) who had casual blood pressure below 140 / 90 mm Hg and normal GFR by inulin clearance. Patients were compared with normotensive healthy controls who were matched for BMI, gender and age. We measured ambulatory 24 -hour blood pressure (SpaceLab system), echocardiography (ASE criteria, Acuson 128 XP 10), CIn and CPAH, urinary Na excretion, PRA and insulin concentration. In patients with GN, the median 24 hour (P < 0. 0005), daytime (P < 0. 001) and nocturnal sleeping time (P < 0. 0001) MAP values {{were significantly higher than}} in matched controls (daytime, mean 97 mm Hg, 85 to 106 GN vs. 89 controls range 82 to 102; nocturnal sleeping time, mean 80. 3 mm Hg, 71 to 89. 5 GN vs. 73 controls, range 63 to 84). Echocardiographic examination showed significantly greater posterior wall thickness (P < 0. 01) and ventricular septal thickness (P < 0. 003). In addition the early diastolic to late diastolic (E/A) ratio of mitral valve peak inflow velocity was significantly (P < 0. 0008) lower in patients. The data point to left ventricular wall thickening accompanied by LV diastolic malfunction. The study documents elevated ambulatory blood pressure in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> despite normal body weight and normal GFR. This is associated with evidence of target organ damage in the heart. The findings suggest that in patients with glomerulonephritis blood pressure increases initially within the normotensive range.

Human paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) is {{an enzyme}} related with {{high-density}} lipoprotein cholesterol. The link between genetic polymorphisms of PON 1 and hyperlipidemia and increased lipid oxidation may explain these complications {{in the course}} of glomerular diseases. In this study, we aimed to investigate PON 1 192 and PON 1 55 polymorphisms in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and healthy individuals. Materials and Methods. Eighty-six patients with biopsy-proven <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and 50 healthy controls were included in the study. Clinical characteristics, lipid profile, paraoxonase activity, and PON 1 genotypes (PON 1 192 and PON 1 55) of all of the participants were studied. Results. Histopathological diagnoses of the patients were membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (53. 5 %), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (33. 7 %), and membranous nephropathy (12. 8 %). The patients had lower PON 1 activity levels than the healthy controls. No differences were observed in PON 1 192 genotypes between the two groups. However,  the controls were more likely to carry PON 1 55 LM genotype (odds ratio, 4. 10; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 96 to 8. 61; P P =. 003) compared to the patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> There was a marked elevation in the frequency of PON 1 55 LL genotype in the patients compared to the controls (odds ratio, 0. 33; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 16 to 0. 68; P =. 003).

Of these patients, 59 % had <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> 21 % had secondary glomerulonephritis, while 20 % had other nephropathies (noninflammatory conditions like amyloidosis, diabetic nephropathy, nephrosclerosis, etc.). Forty-one of these patients (13. 4 %) were positive for IgG/IgM antibodies against entactin; 60 % of them had <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> 35 % had secondary glomerulonephritis, while the remaining 3 patients had other nephropathies. Fifteen (70 %) of the 23 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> had proliferative glomerulonephritis (PGN), whereas 13 (87 %) of the 15 patients with secondary glomerulonephritis were due to systemic connective tissue diseases (SCTD); 7 due to SLE, 4 due to SLE like SCTD and two due to other SCTD. There was a peak of incidence corresponding to the group aged 18 to 30 years. A majority of these patients (12 of the total 17) had <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and were associated with nephrotic or subnephrotic grade proteinuria, poorly or nonresponsive to immunosuppressive treatment and associated, in several cases, with progressive deterioration of renal function. In addition, there was a tendency to another peak in the age group 51 to 60 years. Most of these patients (6 of the total 8) had glomerulonephritis secondary, mainly, to SLE or SLE like SCTD with milder degree of proteinuria and better preserved renal functions Anti-entactin antibodies were not found in certain glomeruionephritides like IgA nephropathy and those secondary to systemic vasculitides and in control subjects (healthy subjects, and patients with a variety of non-renal disorders including inflammatory diseases).

BackgroundChronic renal failure (CRF) {{is a complex}} phenotype that results from an underlying kidney disease and superimposing environmental and genetic factors. The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of polymorphisms in the genes encoding for components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development and/or progression of CRF. MethodsTwo hundred forty-seven family trios (patients with CRF and both parents; 120 with <b>primary</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> 80 with interstitial nephritis, and 47 with type 1 diabetes with nephropathy) were examined, and transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) {{was used to evaluate}} allele transmission from heterozygous parents to affected offspring. ResultsThe D allele of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion polymorphism was transmitted significantly more frequently than expected for no association among all examined trios and in the subgroup of patients with interstitial nephritis. The angiotensinogen 235 T allele was transmitted significantly more frequently to patients with CRF than expected for no association, but the effect was seen only in patients with interstitial nephritis. The presence of the DD or ID genotype was associated with a faster rate of decline of renal function, which was not observed for the angiotensinogen M 235 T polymorphism. For chymase gene and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene, allele transmission did not deviate significantly from a random proportion of 50 : 50 %. ConclusionsThe {{results of this study suggest}} that ACE gene insertion/deletion and angiotensinogen M 235 T polymorphisms contribute to the increased risk for the development of CRF, but the magnitude of the effect within subsets of patients with specific etiologies of CRF must be evaluated further...|$|R
40|$|Background. Proteinuria is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} predictor of development of progressive renal insufficiency, with increasing focus on the composition of proteinuria, particularly high molecular weight proteins such as immunoglobulin G (IgG) (molecular weight 150 kDa). Differing methods of assessing excretion of proteinuria molecules have limited interpretation of results. We aimed to assess the utility of available indices of IgG, total proteinuria and albumin excretions as predictors of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Methods. We recruited 97 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and measured 24 -h urinary protein excretion, 24 -h urinary albumin excretion, selectivity index, albumin: creatinine ratio, urinary IgG: creatinine ratio, fractional excretion of albumin (FE Alb) and fractional excretion of IgG (FE IgG) at baseline. The composite endpoint was developing stage 5 CKD, requiring RRT or death. Receiver operating characteristics curve {{analysis was used to}} assess the value of each measure in predicting outcome. From this analysis, high-and low-risk patient groups according to each measure were established. These were then tested using Kaplan-Meier and Cox survival analysis. Results. During a median follow-up of 7. 07 years, 23 patients developed the primary endpoint. FE IgG and FE Alb were the most sensitive predictive tests. The hazard ratios (HR) of developing the primary endpoint using FE IgG [HR 37. 1 (95 % CI 8. 6 - 158. 8) ] and FE Alb [HR 35. 2 (95 % CI 8. 2 - 150. 8) ] cut-offs were double those using the other measures. Conclusions. FE IgG and FE Alb are superior to conventional measures of proteinuria in predicting outcome in patients with <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> possibly because they are more accurate indicators of impairment of glomerular permselectivity.

Our study suggests that hepatitis B virus antigenaemia may {{play a significant role in}} the development of specific forms of glomerulonephritis and that these hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritides can run an indolent but relentless progressive clinical course...|$|R
40|$|Goal. Determination of the {{relationship}} between the concentration of VAP- 1 and the clinical and morphological parameters of the structural reorganization of the renal tissue. Materials and methods. The study included 80 patients with <b>primary</b> <b>chronic</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> in the period of exacerbation.  The predominant morphological variants were IgA-nephropathy (42 patients) and focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis (16 patients). All patients underwent general clinical examination, with the establishment of stages of CKD, and nephrobiopsy was performed. Based on the results of morphological analysis, the parameters of remodeling of renal tissue were taken into account. A blood sample was taken to study the concentration of Vascular Adhesion- 1 protein (VAP- 1). Nine months after the patients were admitted to the study and treated according to standard therapy, several indicators were re-recorded. Results. It was found that the age, duration of the disease, urea, proteinuria of a single and a daily portion of urine were inversely proportional to the level of VAP- 1. Moreover, a signifi cant difference was found between the groups of patients ranked by median VAP- 1, by prevalence in the group of patients with higher VAP- 1 concentration of nephritic syndrome, IgA nephropathy, cases with mesangium expansion, mesangial and endothelial hypercellularity, endothelial swelling, IgA immune deposits In mesangium and capillary loops. Conclusion. As a result of the study, the prognostic signifi cance of VAP- 1 concentration in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis was demonstrated. The formulas and the table of risk stratifi cation for the development of morphological reconstruction of kidney tissue are presented. It was found that the concentration of VAP- 1 is statistically signifi cantly increased in the early stages of glomerulonephritis, with the predominance of infl ammatory and proliferative changes. At the stage of fi brous restructuring of renal tissue, there was no reliable difference. When analyzing the material obtained, it was concluded that it is necessary to determine the level of VAP- 1 in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, especially IgA-nephropathy, in the early stages of the disease, in order to predict its course. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{degree of}} tubular atrophy and {{interstitial}} fibrosis (IFTA) {{is an important}} prognostic factor in glomerulonephritis. Imbalance between pro-inflammatory cytokines such as monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and protective cytokines such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) likely determine IFTA severity. In separate studies, elevated MCP- 1 and decreased EGF {{have been shown to}} be associated with IFTA severity. In this study, we aim to evaluate the predictive value of urinary EGF/MCP- 1 ratio compared to each biomarker individually for moderate to severe IFTA in <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (GN). Methods: Urine samples were collected at biopsy from primary GN (IgA nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy). MCP- 1 and EGF were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: EGF, MCP- 1 and EGF/MCP- 1 ratio from primary GN, all correlated with IFTA (n= 58). By univariate analysis, glomerular filtration rate, EGF, and EGF/MCP- 1 ratio were associated with IFTA. By multivariate analysis, only EGF/MCP- 1 ratio was independently associated with IFTA. EGF/MCP- 1 ratio had a sensitivity of 88 % and specificity of 74 % for IFTA. EGF/MCP- 1 had good discrimination for IFTA (AUC= 0. 85), but the improvement over EGF alone was not significant. Conclusion: EGF/MCP- 1 ratio is independently associated IFTA severity in <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> but the ability of EGF/MCP- 1 ratio to discriminate moderate to severe IFTA may not be much better than EGF alone...|$|R
40|$|This study {{retrospectively}} {{investigates the}} indications and results of renal biopsy in children {{to determine the}} patterns of childhood kidney disease in a single tertiary children′s hospital in Egypt. We included all the patients who underwent ultrasound-guided renal biopsy from 1998 to 2012. All the kidney biopsies were studied under light microscopy, while immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were performed when indicated. A total of 1246 renal biopsies were performed over 15 years, on 1096 patients. The {{mean age of the}} patients at the time of biopsy was 9. 2 ± 3. 7 years. The main indication for a biopsy was the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (n = 354, 28. 4 %), followed by the atypical nephrotic syndrome (n = 250, 20. 1 %), and renal abnormalities in the systemic diseases (n = 228, 18. 3 %). In the 1226 pathologically diagnosed specimens, <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> was the most common finding (n = 826, 67. 4 %), followed by secondary glomerulonephritis (n = 238, 19. 4 %). The most common causes of <b>primary</b> <b>glomerulonephritis</b> were Minimal Change Disease (MCD) (n = 267, 21. 8 %), diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (n = 188, 15. 3 %), and focal proliferative glomerulonephritis (n = 164, 13. 3 %). Lupus nephritis (n = 209, 17 %) was {{the most common cause of}} secondary glomerulonephritis. We conclude that the steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome was the most frequent indication for biopsy and minimal change disease was the most common histopathological finding in our population...|$|R
