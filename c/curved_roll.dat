Mean flows in pattern formation systems [1] are the large scale flows whose length scales are much longer than the pattern wavelengths. As the patterns are convected by the mean flows, the latters play important roles in shaping the patterns. In fluids with two dimensional patterns, mean flows arise when vertical vorticities are driven by the roll curvature and amplitude modulation [2].

40|$|We {{study the}} motion of a grain {{boundary}} that separates two sets of mutually perpendicular rolls in Rayleigh-Bénard convection above onset. The problem is treated either analytically from the corresponding amplitude equations, or numerically by solving the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We find that if the <b>rolls</b> are <b>curved</b> by a slow transversal modulation, a net translation of the boundary follows. We show analytically that although this motion is a nonlinear effect, it occurs in a time scale much shorter {{than that of the}} linear relaxation of the <b>curved</b> <b>rolls.</b> The total distance traveled by the boundary scales as ϵ^- 1 / 2, where ϵ is the reduced Rayleigh number. We obtain analytical expressions for the relaxation rate of the modulation and for the time dependent traveling velocity of the boundary, and especially their dependence on wavenumber. The results agree well with direct numerical solutions of the Swift-Hohenberg equation. We finally discuss the implications of our results on the coarsening rate of an ensemble of differently oriented domains in which grain boundary motion through <b>curved</b> <b>rolls</b> is the dominant coarsening mechanism.

50|$|Here is {{an example}} of a {{transmissibility}} curve. Transmissibility is the ratio of vibration of the isolated surface to that of the source. Vibrations are never completely eliminated, but they can be greatly reduced. The curve below shows the typical performance of a passive, negative-stiffness isolation system with a natural frequency of 0.5 Hz. The general shape of the curve is typical for passive systems. Below the natural frequency, transmissibility hovers near 1. A value of 1 means that vibration is going through the system without being amplified or reduced. At the resonant frequency, energy is transmitted efficiently, and the incoming vibration is amplified. Damping in the system limits the level of amplification. Above the resonant frequency, little energy can be transmitted, and the <b>curve</b> <b>rolls</b> off to a low value. A passive isolator can be seen as a mechanical low-pass filter for vibrations.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} and policy discussions have noted that the potentially increased competition among firms since the 1990 s may affect inflation and economic activity. This paper considers {{the implications of this}} structural change on short-run inflation dynamics, and for assessing shocks to inflation and output. The importance of firms' price-setting behaviour is highlighted in this context using a standard New Keynesian model with microfoundations. It is well known that both Rotemberg and Calvo price-setting assumptions imply the same reduced-form New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC). Increased competition among firms, however, increases price flexibility in the former, and has either no effect or decreases price flexibility in the latter. The effects of mark-up shocks on inflation and output are small when firms' price-setting behaviour incorporates concerns about potential loss of market share. These effects are further dampened in an environment of more intense competition. Under the assumption of increased competition, both models lead to unambiguous predictions about the direction of change in the slope of the Phillips <b>curve.</b> <b>Rolling</b> estimates of the NKPC indicate that the slope has declined or flattened for several countries since the 1990 s. This evidence is consistent with the prediction of the Calvo model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{extensive}} analysis {{carried out}} in last years on the nonlinear rolling of a ship, {{through the use of}} different versions of perturbation methods, allowed many researchers to discover some very peculiar features of this motion. In a deterministic beam sea, it appeared the possibility of resonances different from synchronism, in particular suharmonic oscillations in both the upright and heeled conditions. Moreover, the resonance peaks as a function of tuning ratio are bent, mainly as a consequence of righting arm nonlinearity, so that in a suitable range of frequencies, the oscillation can have two different amplitude steady states. Later on, the possibility of successive bifurcations to chaotic behaviour was detected and is presently under study. This “deterministic chaos” is in fashion and is very interesting in principle, although it is still related to the action of a strictly monochromatic sea, a possibility hardly realized at sea. At the other extremum, stochastic nonlinear rolling was mainly treated as a sufficiently broadband process to have no possibility of jump phenomena. To clarify this puzzling aspect, the nonlinear model introduced in previous works with the excitation represented by filtered white noise is studied in detail. The filter was allowed to vary centerpeak and bandwidth. A representation as a sum of two sinusoidal processes with Gaussian slowly varying amplitudes was introduced. This description is particularly suitable for the description of narrow band processes. The system of differential equations rolling/filter was solved by means of the perturbation method of the multiple scales. Several <b>curves</b> <b>roll</b> variance/tuning ratio were obtained varying the bandwidth for an excitation variance corresponding to a moderate sea. The results indicate that, provided the bandwidth of the excitation doesn’t exceed that of a sharp JONSWAP spectrum, at least in the considered cases, the main resonance exhibits the same characteristic features shown in the deterministic, iee. the multivaluedness and jump possibility. This similarity is related to the fact that narrow band means high autocorrelation. The perturbation method allows to obtain simplified equations giving the maximum roll variance {{as a function of the}} excitation variance. These results are confirmed by means of the envelope analysis of a preliminary stochastic time-domain numerical simulation. The curve giving the pdf as a function of the variance of the motion appears, in fact, bimodal. Finally, the region of the first subharmonic has been analysed giving the response <b>curves</b> for the <b>roll</b> variance of the subharmonic component and the excitation threshold variance for its onset...|$|R

In this study, the processes of particle vaporization and analyte atom diffusion and ionization in the ICP were investigated using computer simulation. Gold nanoparticles of particle diameter 10 to 250 nm were used as the model particle. The parameters of the model were optimized with respect to the experimental data. The relative importance of these parameters was investigated. Simulated ICP-MS intensity versus sampling depth for different particle size was calculated. Two models of particle vaporization, namely heat-transfer-limited and mass-transfer-limited, were adopted to describe the kinetics of vaporization of the gold nanoparticles. The rate of particle vaporization of the limiting model in each 5 -µs time step was used in the simulation. The heat-transfer-limited process dominates at lower position of the ICP. The mass-transfer-limited process takes over at sampling depth of 4 mm or above where the ICP temperature is higher than 4000 K. The simulation assumed that the gold atoms vaporized from the particle in each time step diffuse independently. The number density of the gold atoms was calculated using the Chapman-Enskog diffusion theory for each subsequent time step. The degree of ionization of the gold atoms was estimated using Saha equation and was assumed to be dependent on the plasma temperature only. The simulated ICP-MS intensity at any instant was the sum of the gold ions in the ion plumes from all previous time steps that pass through a 1 -mm sampler cone. The effects of several simulation parameters on the calculated ICP-MS intensity were investigated. The simulation depth profile of ICP-MS intensity of 100 -nm gold nanoparticle was compared to the experimental ICP-MS depth profile. The ICP-MS intensity depends strongly on the ionization temperature of the plasma and the evaporation coefficient of the analyte. The ICP temperature profile, gas velocity, ionization temperature and evaporation coefficient were optimized for the best fit of simulated results to the experimental data. Simulated calibration curves of gold nanoparticles of nominal diameter of 10 nm to 250 nm are non-linear at any sampling depth. The calibration <b>curve</b> <b>rolls</b> off at high mass due to incomplete vaporization of the larger particles in the ICP.
