25|$|Its largest {{work done}} was the {{coat of arms}} of Queen Victoria and the entire {{northern}} facade which had been destroyed. An ornate rose timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> in the original galleries were hidden by false ceilings constructed for air-conditioning in the 1980s. The rear of the building had few windows and replicas {{had to be made}} for windows facing Fort Canning and timber wood was imported from Indonesia. A 22-metre long and 11-metre high glass connector replaced a hard ceiling for visitors to view the museum's dome from the museum itself, whereas previously, one had to view the entire dome across Stamford Road.|$|E
25|$|The timber {{ceiling is}} in a concave form and {{is made up}} of three rows of six {{rectangular}} panels. All eighteen panels are rather simply ornamented, with a simple rectangular border and a <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> at their centres. The ceiling roses in the centre row are larger and more elaborate than those in the side rows. From the centre of each circle hangs a lamp. The ceiling edge ends in deeply mouled plaster cornice that runs {{along the length of the}} cathedral. As the height of the east end has been raised at different times, the dimensions of the entablature no longer relate to the columns properly, as their bases have been raised. The Cathedral was once lit with victorian crystal chandeliers, but these have since been replaced with the simpler lamps one sees today.|$|E
2500|$|The {{auditorium}} seats 1,785. The ceiling panelling fans {{out from}} a single centre <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> - each panel originally contained painted scenes, although they are currently plain. The proscenium is surrounded by heavy marble and plasterwork borders. Above the proscenium an elegant design with cherubs flanking a crown and a K/T emblem provides a focal point to the theatre when the curtain is down. The red curtain has simple gilding, but often remains unseen as it is unused for many of today's productions. The seats and drapes are of a rich red material. The safety curtain features a painted design of drapes, and framed in the centre is a projection screen. At Grand Circle level two boxes {{on either side of}} the auditorium continue where the grand circle balcony finishes. A further box (now disused) is located at Upper Circle level above this, with an elaborate domed canopy. Three domed alcoves sit along either side of the upper circle. Comedian and actor Billy Connolly famously described it as [...] "like performing inside a wedding cake".|$|E

60|$|Then {{she folded}} her arms, and stood silent; and the house, from floor to <b>ceiling,</b> <b>rose</b> and cheered her until {{there was no more}} breath left in its lungs.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hooker {{fixed his}} eyes on the <b>ceiling,</b> <b>rose,</b> and pretended to look out of the window; then, taking his seat again by the table, as if {{fronting}} an imaginary audience, and pulling slowly at his gauntlets after the usual theatrical indication of perfect sangfroid, said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{the door}} {{there were two}} branches, at right angles. Dick chose one of them at random, and the pair hurried, with echoing footsteps, along the hollow of the chapel roof. The top of the arched <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> like a whale's back in the dim glimmer of the lamp. Here and there were spy-holes, concealed, on the other side, by the carving of the cornice; and looking down through one of these, Dick saw the paved floor of the chapel--the altar, with its burning tapers--and, {{stretched}} before it on the steps, the figure of Sir Oliver praying with uplifted hands.|$|E
50|$|Internally {{the rooms}} of the {{original}} house have 13 ft 6in high ceilings, picture rails, timber fretwork <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> and timber partitioning in 5in wide tongue-and-groove boards. The main drawing room has a large bay window framed by an arch. The windows are large double-hung timber sashes with two panes per sash. While the side windows have long been removed and replaced by French windows and fanlights, evidence of their existence remains behind the door-jambs on the verandah, above the fan light and from the part removal of diagonal bracing. Original timber <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses</b> have been uncovered throughout the house and replicas have replaced those that were missing. Electric fans have been installed {{in some of the}} rooms and wired up through the <b>ceiling</b> <b>roses.</b> Above the internal doors are decorative timber fretwork panels.

60|$|She {{took him}} along {{a passage in}} the basement, {{up a flight of}} steps, and into a huge, solitary, chill apartment. It was the ball-room. Spacious mirrors in gilt frames formed panels in {{the lower part of the}} walls, the {{remainder}} being toned in sage-green. In a recess between each mirror was a statue. The <b>ceiling</b> <b>rose</b> in a segmental curve, and bore sprawling upon its face gilt figures of wanton goddesses, cupids, satyrs with tambourines, drums, and trumpets, the whole ceiling seeming alive with them. But the room was very gloomy now, there being little light admitted from without, and the reflections from the mirrors gave a depressing coldness to the scene. It was a place intended to look joyous by night, and whatever it chose to look by day.|$|E
