5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a <b>car</b> <b>theft</b> charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he}} was not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it was unlikely for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. <b>Car</b> <b>theft</b> sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. was unlikely.|$|E

40|$|My diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{distribution}} analysis of <b>car</b> <b>thefts</b> {{in the town}} of Liberec and will look at the options of situational crime prevention techniques. In my diploma thesis I have used the concept of hot spots which is able to show higher than average concentrations of <b>car</b> <b>thefts</b> in the study area. The database is relatively unique, provided by the regional police department in Liberec and contains the records of more than a thousand reported <b>car</b> <b>thefts</b> in Liberec between the years 2011 - 2014. The provided data contains GPS coordinates and thanks to them, it was possible, with relatively high accuracy, to identify hot spots of <b>car</b> <b>thefts</b> in Liberec. The identification of hot spots was possible as spatial statistics were used that enabled concrete calculations of kernel density, which made it possible to identify problem locations. In our chosen hot spots we then undertook our fieldwork, whose main goal was to evaluate the options of utilization strategy CPTED, so as to obtain preventive measures in problem locations. The output of this thesis include hot spot maps of <b>car</b> <b>thefts</b> 2011 - 2014 and also recommendations for preventive measures, which would be advisable to implement in chosen hot spots.
