Ninemsn referred to them as [...] "everyone's favourite on ... off ... on (a break!) duo," [...] while Us Weekly and BuzzFeed ranked them the first and second best television couple, respectively. TV Guide ranked Ross and Rachel the third greatest television couple, dubbing them [...] "the most iconic TV couple in recent memory". Extra placed the couple at number eight, writing, [...] "Never did we want two people to get together more than Ross ... and Rachel". Refinery29 included Rachel and Ross in the website's [...] "16 TV Couples We Want To Be Together Forever" [...] list. The pair is also often ranked among television's greatest [...] "will they or won't they" [...] couples. Naming Ross and Rachel the greatest [...] "will they, won't they" [...] couple, Network Ten believes they defined the term, while Suggest dubbed them [...] "The quintessential will they/won’t they couple." [...] According to Sarah Doran of Radio Times, the couple [...] "became synonymous with the phrase 'we're on a break'". Phoebe's line, in which she refers to the couple as each other's lobsters, {{has become one of the}} show's most popular and oft-quoted. Kaitlin Reilly of Bustle magazine defined the term as [...] "the person of whom another is meant to be with forever". Tara Aquino of Complex magazine believes that [...] "Every other person <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> exactly a 'Ross and Rachel' relationship means". Ultimately, Rachel's season eight pregnancy arc is credited with reviving the show's ratings and reviews.|$|E

2500|$|When President Jimmy Carter in 1979 {{broke off}} {{relations}} with the ROC {{in order to establish}} {{relations with the}} PRC, Congress responded by passing the Taiwan Relations Act that maintained relations, but stopped short of full recognition of the ROC. In 1982 President Ronald Reagan also saw that the Six Assurances were adopted, the fifth being that the United States would not formally recognize Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. Still, United States policy has remained ambiguous. In the House International Relations Committee on April 21, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James A. Kelly, was asked by Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA) whether America's commitment to Taiwan's democracy conflicted with the so-called One-China Policy. He admitted the difficulty of defining the U.S.'s position: [...] "I didn’t really define it, and I’m not sure I very easily could define it." [...] He added, [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> it is not. It is not the One-China principle that Beijing suggests." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he was {{a visible}} figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and {{developed}} working relationships in both the West and {{what was to become}} the Soviet bloc. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism Einstein was writing about a single world government; it was at this time that he wrote, [...] "I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> they will use in the Fourth— sticks and stones." [...] In a 1949 Monthly Review article entitled [...] "Why Socialism?" [...] Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the [...] "predatory phase of human development" [...] With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, while {{promoting}} his second solo album Cauterize, Mark Tremonti claimed {{in an interview}} with Kerrang that he [...] " [...] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". He said that Stapp believed that the other members would end Alter Bridge and perform solely with him in Creed, which they didn't wish to do, as they had established a unique foundation in that band. The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge. [...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what,</b> I sure hope so. I love the guys with all my heart and if they’re watching, 'Come on guys, let’s make a record.'" [...] He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would [...] "definitely" [...] reunite and that he expected new material from the band within [...] "the next two years." [...] When asked about Stapp's statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy {{promoting his}} solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp's proposed timeline.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed us about this production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
