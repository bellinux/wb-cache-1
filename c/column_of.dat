5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling <b>column</b> <b>of</b> air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the <b>column</b> <b>of</b> hot, rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E

5|$|An {{asterisk}} is occasionally used {{to refer}} to whole rows or columns in a matrix. For example, a'i,‚àó refers to the ith row of A, and a‚àó,j refers to the jth <b>column</b> <b>of</b> A. The set of all m-by-n matrices is denoted ùïÑ(m, n).|$|E

5|$|Appointed to be {{commander}} of the Austrian winter cordon, Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser ordered a small assault column {{under the command of}} Colonel Wilhelm Klebeck to attack the village of Dittersbach. Klebeck led a <b>column</b> <b>of</b> Croats into the village. During the action, four hundred Prussians were killed, another four hundred made prisoner, and eight colors were captured.

5|$|In {{discrete}} tomography, {{a simplified}} {{version of the}} problem that has been frequently studied, the shape to be recovered is a polyomino (a subset of the squares in the two-dimensional square lattice), and the cross-sections provide aggregate information about the sets of squares in individual rows and columns of the lattice. For instance, in the popular nonogram puzzles, also known as paint by numbers or griddlers, the set of squares to be determined represents the dark pixels in a binary image, and the input given to the puzzle solver tells him or her how many consecutive blocks of dark pixels to include in each row or <b>column</b> <b>of</b> the image, and how long each of those blocks should be. In other forms of digital tomography, even less information about each row or column is given: only {{the total number of}} squares, rather than the number and length of the blocks of squares. An equivalent version {{of the problem is that}} we must recover a given 0-1 matrix given only the sums of the values in each row and in each <b>column</b> <b>of</b> the matrix.|$|E
