5|$|Texas's large population, {{abundance}} of natural resources, thriving cities and leading <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> higher education {{have contributed to}} a large and diverse economy. Since oil was discovered, the state's economy has reflected {{the state of the}} petroleum industry. In recent times, urban <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> the state have increased in size, containing two-thirds of the population in 2005. The state's economic growth has led to urban sprawl and its associated symptoms.|$|E

5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of drastic changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth.

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have {{found evidence of}} domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 years from the very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. <b>Centers</b> <b>of</b> domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the New Kingdom, a {{tradition}} had developed that Set had cut Osiris's body into pieces and scattered them across Egypt. Cult <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> Osiris all over the country claimed that the corpse, or particular pieces of it, were found near them. The dismembered parts could be said to number as many as forty-two, each piece being equated with one of the forty-two nomes, or provinces, in Egypt. Thus, the god of kingship becomes the embodiment of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high {{mountain}} areas. With one exception, they are {{native to the}} Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> diversity exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which {{is the center of}} diversity for the subfamily Rhipsalideae; and in forested regions of Central America, where the climbing Hylocereeae are most diverse.|$|E
