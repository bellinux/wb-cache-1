5|$|For centuries, in {{accordance}} with the vision of Zeami, Noh costumes emulated the clothing that the characters would genuinely wear, such as the formal robes for a courtier and the street <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> a peasant or commoner. But in the late sixteenth century, the costumes became stylized with certain symbolic and stylistic conventions. During the Edo (Tokugawa) period, the elaborate robes given to actors by noblemen and samurai in the Muromachi period were developed as costumes.|$|E

5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} paint was applied {{by both sides}} during the Union blockade of 1861–1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted their ships all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|The first {{police to}} deploy to the Yukon {{equipped}} themselves with specialised cold-weather clothing, and subsequent detachments were equipped with deer-skin parkas, fur hats and boots. In the more extreme {{conditions of the}} far north, the police adopted local Inuit <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> use on their patrols, even though this required daily maintenance, often carried out by local Inuit women. Mounted police deployed to Siberia wore the standard army khaki uniform used by mounted forces.|$|E

5|$|The {{manufacturing}} industry {{is an important}} employer, mostly in the textile industry. One of its tradicional and high-end products are the Tapetes Beiriz, an handmade rug produced since 1918, which currently also produces contemporary rugs. The clothing industry balanced back from European Union's expansion to Eastern Europe and Globalization, by shifting to luxury <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> high fashion brands or reinventing uniforms, with specific needs or complexity, {{as seen in the}} case of Damel. In construction and civil engineering, Monte Adriano is a large Portuguese company.|$|E
5|$|Camp Morton's first Confederate prisoners {{arrived on}} February 22–23, 1862. Many of the 2,398 Confederates {{in the first}} group were sick, ill fed, and without {{sufficient}} <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> the cold, northern winters. The citizens of Indianapolis rallied to provide humanitarian aid for the prisoners, which included additional food, clothing, and supplies. Local doctors aided the sick and local women provided nursing care. The Athenaeum, {{at the corner of}} East Michigan Street and Massachusetts Avenue, and another local building were converted into hospitals to treat the Confederate prisoners. For the remainder of the war, Camp Morton typically housed between 3,000 and 6,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of <b>clothing,</b> <b>for</b> example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E

Her modelling work has included campaigns for Burberry and Lancôme. As a fashion consultant, she {{helped create a}} line of <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> People Tree. She was honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 2014, winning for British Artist of the Year. That same year, she was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador and helped launch the UN Women campaign HeForShe, which calls for men to advocate gender equality.|$|E
5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals. Field sports such as driven grouse shooting conceal hunters in hides (also called blinds or shooting butts). Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2007, Chris Taylor, {{mounted on}} a {{pantomime}} horse, confronted police officers, who were on foot, and {{asked them if they}} needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters. When his offer was refused, Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway, and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel. He was later asked by police officers to remove his <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> examination, since it resembled a police uniform; but no charges of impersonating police were laid. The reference was to the horse flu outbreak, which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot. This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode.|$|E

5|$|The Melbourne Club {{decided that}} the team should wear red, white and blue colours on their <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> the game. Although they had {{a long time to}} prepare, the MCC had some {{difficulty}} in assembling enough men to represent Port Phillip; many potential players were unable to spare the time to travel to Van Diemen's Land. Even as the team prepared to depart, only ten people had been found, and the eleventh, Duncan Cooper, only joined as they left on the steamer Shamrock. The eleven Victorian players, accompanied by many acquaintances, both men and women, arrived in Launceston on 9 February. On the evening of their arrival, they attended a dinner at the Cornwall Hotel with 100 paying guests. The following day, the team won a match against Bishopthorpe College. There was little time to practise before the intercolonial game.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a short time for finalizing the {{different}} aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also had just one night to complete shooting and due to the casual nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family to be in it. Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.|$|E
5|$|Although the 9th Corps Army {{was one of}} China's elite formations, {{composed}} of veterans and former POWs from the Huaihai Campaign, several deficiencies hampered its ability during the battle. Initially the 9th Army {{was intended to be}} outfitted in Manchuria during November, but Mao suddenly ordered it into Korea before that could happen. As the result, the 9th Corps Army had almost no winter <b>clothing</b> <b>for</b> the harsh Korean winter. Similarly, poor logistics forced the 9th Corps Army to abandon heavy artillery, while working with little food and ammunition. The food shortage forced the 9th Corps Army to initially station a third of its strength away from the Chosin Reservoir as reserve, and starvation and exposure broke out among the Chinese units since foraging was not an option at the sparsely populated reservoir. By the end of the battle, more Chinese troops had died from the cold than from combat and air raids.|$|E
