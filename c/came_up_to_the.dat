5|$|Deep and fast-flowing, the el Auja river {{could not}} be crossed except at known and {{well-established}} places, so at 01:00 on 24 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment crossed at the ford on the beach. They moved at a gallop and quickly seized the hills which overlooked the ford, capturing the village of Sheikh Muannis (which gave {{its name to the}} ford), but the Ottoman cavalry garrison escaped. The Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Canterbury Regiment and then advanced eastwards to Khurbet Hadrah, which commanded the bridge on the main road. They captured 29 prisoners, one machine gun, and one British Lewis gun. Two infantry companies of the Essex Regiment, 161st (Essex) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division crossed the Hadrah bridge and occupied the village. The 4th and 11th Squadrons of the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment with the 2nd Squadron of the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment, were placed at the bridge and in the village of Sheikh Muannis in front of the infantry posts. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment's 1st Squadron took up a post on the sea beach; each of these squadrons had two machine guns to strengthen them.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with two straight singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E

25|$|German {{infantry}} massing for a counter-attack {{during the}} afternoon at the higher end of the valley between Polderhoek and the Gheluvelt Spur was easily seen and a Stokes mortar was moved to Jericho. The crew opened rapid fire, which sent the German troops running for cover, casting away rifles and equipment. Very few of the Germans reached Gheluvelt, no attack followed and German stretcher-bearers under a Red Cross flag were allowed off the Menin road to rescue wounded for several hours. During the evening {{a large number of}} German reinforcements <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> château and some were shot down by Lewis gunners. Braithwaite wanted another attack after dark, possibly an enveloping movement from the Reutelbeek but the German reinforcements, the vigilance of the château garrison and the doubtful situation on the New Zealand left led to caution. The only troops available were the reserve companies and parties from the support companies. If these troops attacked, the New Zealand positions would be vulnerable to a repulse on the left flank. During the night the area on the left flank south of the Reutelbeek was consolidated but the full moon came up and illuminated the ground. New Zealand stretcher-bearers searched the shell holes among the trees under machine-gun fire and got the wounded away by first light.|$|E

The unsuspecting band members got out and were politely told to line up facing the ditch at the rear of the minibus with their hands on their heads. More uniformed men appeared from out of the darkness, their guns pointed at the minibus. About 10 gunmen were at the checkpoint, according to author and journalist Martin Dillon.|$|E

500|$|With {{two outs}} and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel <b>came</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate, with Lou Gehrig {{waiting in the}} batting circle after him. Meusel was a [...]315 hitter that year and had batted in 81runs in just over 100 regular-season games. Meusel also had success in Game6 against Alexander, with a double and triple. Just as Meusel {{was about to take}} his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly {{aggressive}} baserunner, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium. Meusel swung and missed at the pitch, and Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. Ruth was out by a good , and the game was over. As the game announcer described it, [...] "Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel. Going down to second! The game is over! Babe tried to steal second and is put out catcher to second!" ...|$|E
