5|$|<b>Convective</b> rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from <b>convective</b> clouds (e.g., {{cumulonimbus}} or cumulus congestus). It falls as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. <b>Convective</b> precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as <b>convective</b> clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, <b>convective</b> precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E
5|$|Ages for star {{clusters}} {{can be estimated}} by comparing the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram for the cluster with theoretical models of stellar evolution. Using this technique, ages for the Pleiades of between 75 and 150 million years have been estimated. The wide spread in estimated ages {{is a result of}} uncertainties in stellar evolution models, which include factors such as <b>convective</b> overshoot, in which a <b>convective</b> zone within a star penetrates an otherwise non-convective zone, resulting in higher apparent ages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Convective</b> outlooks {{are issued}} by the Storm Prediction Center in Zulu time (also known as Universal Coordinated Time or UTC).|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center issues <b>convective</b> outlooks (AC), {{consisting}} of categorical and probabilistic forecasts describing the general threat of severe <b>convective</b> storms over the contiguous United States {{for the next}} six to 192 hours (Day 1 through Day 8). These outlooks are labeled and issued by day, and are issued up to five times per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{time period}} in the Plains where {{thunderstorm}} areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. Mesoscale <b>convective</b> systems develop over the region during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time. Mesoscale <b>convective</b> systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to the Plains. A subset of these systems known as mesoscale <b>convective</b> complexes lead to up to 10% of the annual rainfall across the Plains and Midwest. Squall lines account for 30% of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the region.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on July 19, 1970. As the depression {{moved through the}} Yucatán Channel, the <b>convective</b> cloud system became better organized. On July 20, in light of data from a Reconnaissance Aircraft flight, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Becky.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images. The implication is that the ice is too thin to support the <b>convective</b> diapir model of feature formation.|$|E
5|$|Day 2 outlooks, issued {{twice daily}} at 0600Z and 1730Z, refer to {{predicted}} risks of <b>convective</b> weather {{for the following}} day (1200Z to 1200Z of the next calendar day; for example, a Day 2 outlook issued on April 12, 2100 would be valid from 1200Z on April 13, 2100 through 1200Z on April 14, 2100) and include only a categorical outline, textual description, and a probability graph for severe <b>convective</b> storms generally. Day 2 moderate risks are fairly uncommon, and a Day 2 high risk has only been issued twice (for April 7, 2006 and for April 14, 2012).|$|E
5|$|From this solution, it is {{possible}} to characterize the <b>convective</b> heat/mass transfer constants based on the region of boundary layer flow. Fourier’s law of conduction and Newton’s Law of Cooling are combined with the flux term derived above and the boundary layer thickness.|$|E
5|$|Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is {{tasked with}} {{forecasting}} {{the risk of}} severe thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues <b>convective</b> outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches {{as a part of}} this process. <b>Convective</b> outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day1, Day2, Day3, and Days 4–8), and detail the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given forecast period, although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Day 1. Days 2 and 3, as well as 4–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fred {{was one of}} the easternmost forming major hurricanes in the North Atlantic basin since {{satellite}} observations became available. Forming out of a strong tropical wave on September7, 2009 near the Cape Verde Islands, Fred gradually organized within an area of moderate wind shear. The following day, decreasing shear allowed the storm to intensify and develop well-organized <b>convective</b> banding features. Later on September8, Fred attained hurricane intensity and underwent rapid intensification overnight, attaining its peak intensity as a strong Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane began to weaken as wind shear increased and dry air hampered <b>convective</b> development.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the SPC {{incorporated}} {{a small table}} under the <b>Convective</b> Outlook's risk category map that indicates the total coverage area by square miles, the total estimated population affected and major cities included within a severe weather risk area.|$|E
5|$|In Louisiana, {{damage was}} light, as the {{majority}} of Hanna's <b>convective</b> activity was to the east. Rainfall was mostly less than 1inches (25mm), and little rise in tide was reported. Little or no damage occurred in neighboring Mississippi, where similar effects were reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{south-west}} of England has a favoured location {{with respect}} to the Azores high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. <b>Convective</b> cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,700hours.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were {{possible in a}} <b>convective</b> band to the north. On the Yucatan Peninsula, heavy rainfall led to mudslides across Quintana Roo, leaving some areas isolated.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Etau {{originated}} on August5 {{out of an}} area of {{low pressure}} associated with disorganized <b>convective</b> activity located about 550km (280mi) east-northeast of Guam. The following day, the system relocated several dozen kilometers to the north. <b>Convective</b> turning began to appear on satellite imagery and a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the north provided a northward component to the system's movement. Early on August7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the developing system as deep convection consolidated around the low pressure system. Around 0000UTC on August8, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} {{a tropical}} depression, the NHC {{noted that the}} center of circulation was difficult to locate and the mid-level circulation was displaced from the low-level circulation. The cyclone tracked slightly north of due west {{in response to a}} small ridge to the north. Moderate wind shear initially displaced <b>convective</b> activity to the west. Several hours after being classified, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fred; this was the first use of the name Fred in the Atlantic basin after it replaced Fabian which was retired in 2003. This followed the development of <b>convective</b> banding features along the periphery of the storm and strong shower and thunderstorm activity forming over the center of Fred. The system continued to organize, with the banding features becoming well-defined within hours and strong outflow developing around the storm.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{ridge of}} high {{pressure}} continued {{to push the}} system west, towards the Caribbean Sea. That afternoon, <b>convective</b> banding and increasing upper-level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye disappeared briefly overnight, possibly {{as part of a}} diurnal fluctuation, but returned by the morning of August17.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the western coast of Africa on September1 and continued westward until reaching the eastern Pacific fifteen days later. A broad {{area of low pressure}} formed along the wave axis on September16 as <b>convective</b> activity organized, and by 0600UTC on September18, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. <b>Convective</b> bands began to form {{near the center}} a few hours later, leading to an improved satellite presentation overall. Tracking west-northwestward {{as a result of the}} mid-level ridge, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Ivo at 0000UTC on September19. Turning northwest, a well-defined eye became visible on satellite, prompting the NHC to upgrade the system to a Category1 hurricane 24 hours later. With an area of deep convection near the center, the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 984mb (hPa; 29.06inHg) at 0000UTC on September21. Westerly flow associated with a large upper-level low began to undercut the outflow of Ivo, and it weakened to a tropical storm by the afternoon hours. The <b>convective</b> pattern rapidly deteriorated due to southeasterly wind shear, and despite a brief burst of convection, the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression to the west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California at 0000UTC on September 23. Associated deep convection dissipated later that day as Ivo turned eastward, and the system degenerated into a remnant low accordingly. The remnant low dissipated two days later as it continued in the same direction.|$|E
5|$|Also {{under study}} are the {{low-level}} mesocyclone and the stretching of low-level vorticity which tightens into a tornado, in particular, {{what are the}} processes {{and what is the}} relationship of the environment and the <b>convective</b> storm. Intense tornadoes have been observed forming simultaneously with a mesocyclone aloft (rather than succeeding mesocyclogenesis) and some intense tornadoes have occurred without a mid-level mesocyclone.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, <b>convective</b> cooling of the water in the {{reservoir}} is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the <b>convective</b> rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen was consumed and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|Early on September4, the {{hurricane}} moved beneath a large upper-level anticyclone which provided a reprieve from the strong southwesterly wind shear. Although its <b>convective</b> organization {{had yet to}} become fully symmetrical, an eye became increasingly apparent on infrared imagery. The center moved very near the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's buoy 41044—which registered a maximum sustained wind of 90mph (145km/h) and a maximum wind gust of —around 12:00UTC, indicating that Katia had intensified into a Category2 hurricane. Although an eyewall replacement cycle briefly caused the storm's <b>convective</b> pattern to deteriorate, Katia attained major hurricane status—a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale—by 12:00UTC on September5. Twelve hours later, the cyclone further intensified into a Category4 hurricane and attained peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 942mbar (hPa; 27.82inHg) as its eye warmed, deep convection became much more symmetric about the center, and upper-level outflow expanded.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. <b>Convective</b> motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Generally, the <b>convective</b> outlook {{boundaries}} or lines – general thunderstorms (light green), marginal (dark green), slight (yellow), enhanced (orange), moderate (red) {{and high}} (purple) – will be continued as an arrow or line not filled with color if the risk area enters another country (Canada or Mexico) or across waters beyond the United States coastline. This {{indicates that the}} risk for severe weather is also valid in that general area {{of the other side}} of the border or oceanic boundary.|$|E
5|$|In Belize, the {{tropical}} storm produced a wind gust of 71miles per hour (115km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were {{possible in a}} <b>convective</b> band to the north. Moderate rainfall was reported across the country, peaking at 9.81inches (249mm) at Towerhill station. Along the coast, high waves damaged seawalls and piers. Further inland, the combination of winds and flooding caused agriculture and infrastructure damage; overall damage in the country totaled $4million (2001USD; $ USD).|$|E
5|$|In mid- to late-April, a {{pulse in}} the Madden–Julian oscillation, {{coupled with a}} Kelvin wave, (which later contributed to the {{formation}} of Typhoon Chanchu in the western Pacific) enhanced <b>convective</b> activity over the Bay of Bengal. By April22, a trough developed along an axis from the southern Bay of Bengal eastward to the Andaman Sea. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the system for potential tropical cyclogenesis the following day. By 0600UTC on April24, an area of low pressure formed southeast of the Andaman Islands and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) began monitoring the disturbance. Quickly organizing, the low developed into a tropical depression later on April24 and the JTWC began writing full advisories on the cyclone without issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Organization slowed thereafter due to moderate wind shear, but continued at a near-climatological rate as upper-level outflow allowed for continued <b>convective</b> development. Early on April25, the JTWC estimated the system to have attained gale-force winds. The IMD followed suit later that day and subsequently assigned it the name Mala. Weak steering currents prompted slow and erratic movement with an overall northward trajectory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the <b>convective</b> systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads to an {{increase}} in moisture and significant vertical motion. This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|North American forecasters, however {{surprised}} as they were, considered this storm a hurricane immediately upon reviewing the satellite-derived evidence. Since Catarina {{had a clear}} eyewall structure bounded by deep <b>convective,</b> dense central overcast, well-defined spiral outer bands and outflow structure, warm water temperatures of 79°F (26°C), little shear, a warm core low, overall tropical characteristics, and occurred in March (equivalent to September in the Northern Hemisphere, the peak of hurricane season), it {{was considered to be}} a hurricane by the National Hurricane Center in the United States.|$|E
5|$|On June18, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—along its axis {{for the next several}} days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June24 and Central America on June29, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter. During the evening of July1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development. The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July2, leading to an increase in <b>convective</b> coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared {{a tropical}} depression at 1200UTC on July4, while centered 205mi (330km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as <b>convective</b> banding increased and gained more curvature. This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000UTC on July5.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or <b>convective,</b> and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall {{is highly}} variable. When winter low {{pressure}} systems move from south west to north east the Malvern area is {{often on the}} northern flank, meaning heavy snowfall while areas further south and east receive rain or no precipitation at all. However, when snowfall arrives by means of <b>convective</b> showers driven by northerly, north westerly or north easterly winds the area tends {{to be one of}} the least snowy parts of the UK, owing to its sheltered positioning.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center {{began in}} 1952 as SELS (Severe Local Storms Unit), a special unit of {{forecast}}ers at the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C. In 1954, the unit moved its forecast operations to Kansas City, Missouri. SELS began issuing <b>convective</b> outlooks for predicted thunderstorm activity in 1955, and began issuing radar summaries in three-hour intervals in 1960; {{with the increased}} duties of compiling and disseminating radar summaries, this unit became the National Severe Storms Forecast Center (NSSFC) in 1966, remaining headquartered in Kansas City.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} {{at the center of}} the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} <b>convective</b> motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{convection}} zone {{extends from}} 0.7 solar radii (200,000km) to near the surface. In this layer, the solar plasma is not dense enough or {{hot enough to}} transfer the heat energy of the interior outward via radiation. Instead, {{the density of the}} plasma is low enough to allow <b>convective</b> currents to develop and move the Sun's energy outward towards its surface. Material heated at the tachocline picks up heat and expands, thereby reducing its density and allowing it to rise. As a result, an orderly motion of the mass develops into thermal cells that carry the majority of the heat outward to the Sun's photosphere above. Once the material diffusively and radiatively cools just beneath the photospheric surface, its density increases, and it sinks {{to the base of the}} convection zone, where it again picks up heat from the top of the radiative zone and the <b>convective</b> cycle continues. At the photosphere, the temperature has dropped to 5,700 K and the density to only 0.2 g/m3 (about 1/6,000 the density of air at sea level).|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the hurricane season is most {{closely related to the}} timing of increases in sea surface temperatures, <b>convective</b> instability, and other thermodynamic factors. Although June marks the {{beginning of}} the hurricane season, generally little activity occurs during the month with an average of 1 tropical cyclone every 2years. Tropical systems usually form in the Gulf of Mexico or off the east coast of the United States.|$|E
