40|$|Mass {{transport}} and fluid dynamics characteristics {{in the vicinity}} of an oscillating cylindrical fiber with an imposed pulsatile inflow condition are computationally investigated in the present study. The work is motivated by a recently proposed design modification to the Total Artificial Lung (TAL) device, which is expected to provide better gas exchange. Navier–Stokes computations, coupled with convection–diffusion equation are performed to assess flow dynamics and mass transport behavior around the oscillating fiber. The oscillations and the pulsatile free stream velocity are represented by two sinusoidal functions. The resulting non-dimensional parameters are Keulegan–Carpenter number (KC), Schmidt number (Sc), Reynolds number (Re), pulsatile inflow amplitude (), and amplitude of cylinder oscillation (). Results are computed for, Sc = 1000, Re = 5 and 10, and 0. 7 and 0. 25 5. 25. The pulsatile inflow parameters correspond to the flow velocities found in human pulmonary artery while matching the operating TAL Reynolds number. Mass transport {{from the surface of the}} cylinder to the bulk fluid is found to be primarily dependent on the size of surface vortices created by the movement of the cylinder. Time-averaged surface Sherwood number (Sh) is dependent on the amplitude and KC of cylinder oscillation. Compared to the fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>case,</b> a significant gain up to 380 % in Sh is achieved by oscillating the cylinder even at the small displacement amplitude (AD = 0. 75 D). Moreover, with decrease in KC the oscillating cylinder exhibits a lower drag amplitude compared with the fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>case.</b> Inflow pulsation amplitude has minor effects on the mass transport characteristics. However, an increase in results in an increase in the amplitude of the periodic drag force on the cylinder. This rise in the drag amplitude is similar to that measured for the fixed <b>cylinder</b> <b>case.</b> Quantifications of shear stress distribution in the bulk fluid suggest that the physiological concerns of platelet activation and injury to red blood cells due to cylinder oscillation are negligible...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePrevious {{studies of}} {{flexible}} flaps {{attached to the}} aft part of a cylinder have demonstrated a favourable effect on the drag and lift force fluctuation. This observation {{is thought to be}} linked to the excitation of travelling waves along the flaps and as a consequence of that, periodic shedding of the von Karman vortices is altered in phase. A more general case of such interaction is studied herein for a limited row of flaps in an oscillating flow; representative of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>case</b> since the transversal flow in the wake-region shows oscillating character. This reference case is chosen to qualify recently developed numerical methods for the simulation of fluid-structure interaction {{in the context of the}} EU funded 'PELskin' project. The simulation of the two-way coupled dynamics of the flexible elements is achieved via a structure model for the flap motion, which was implemented and coupled to two different fluid solvers via the immersed boundary method. The results show the waving behaviour observed at the tips of the flexible elements in interaction with the fluid flow and the formation of vortices in the gaps between the flaps. In addition, formation of vortices upstream of the leading and downstream of the trailing flap is seen, which interact with the formation of the shear-layer on top of the row. This leads to a phase shift in the wave-type motion along the row that resembles the observation in the <b>cylinder</b> <b>case...</b>|$|E

40|$|To date, all linear {{stability}} {{analyses of}} shallow wakes are performed {{on a series}} of wake-type profiles, but the wake generating object and its associated separation points are always neglected in such analyses. The results of numerical modeling of depth-averaged shallow water equations are presented in order to assess the importance of a wake generating body (cylinder) for the vortex structure and the global frequency of oscillations. More specifically, this Brief Communication seeks to answer the following question: is it possible to reproduce the dynamics of a vortex street in shallow wakes by only knowing the time-averaged profile at a particular location downstream of the bluff body? This is accomplished by comparing the wake characteristics for the case with a cylinder situated {{in the middle of the}} flow domain with the flow characteristics for the case without a cylinder. The upstream boundary condition for the no <b>cylinder</b> <b>case</b> consists of a wake-type velocity profile. It is found that spatio-temporal patterns for the case with and without the cylinder are similar. The global frequency of oscillations, however, differs by 20 % to 30 % for the vortex street regime and by more than 50 % for the unsteady bubble regime. Better agreement between the vortex shedding frequencies for the cases with a cylinder and without a cylinder is achieved by introducing transverse perturbations at the upstream boundary for the no <b>cylinder</b> <b>case.</b> (C) 2006 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for the axial and transverse acoustic radiation {{forces as}} well as the radiation torque per length are derived for a rigid elliptical cylinder placed arbitrarily in the field of in plane progressive, quasi-standing or standing waves. The rigid elliptical <b>cylinder</b> <b>case</b> is important to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a fluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance mismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion method in cylindrical coordinates, non-dimensional acoustic radiation force and torque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering coefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is obtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface in a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after performing a single numerical integration procedure. Computational results for the non-dimensional force components and torque, showing the transition from the progressive to the (equi-amplitude) standing wave behavior, are performed with particular emphasis on the aspect ratio a/b, where a and b are the semi-axes of the ellipse, the dimensionless size parameter, {{as well as}} the angle of incidence ranging from end-on to broadside incidence. The results show that the elliptical geometry has a direct influence on the radiation force and torque, so that the standard theory for circular cylinders (at normal incidence) leads to significant miscalculations when the cylinder cross-section becomes non-circular. Moreover, the elliptical cylinder experiences, in addition to the acoustic radiation force, a radiation torque that vanishes for the circular <b>cylinder</b> <b>case.</b> The application of the formalism presented here may be extended to other 2 D surfaces of arbitrary shape...|$|E
