This research work examined the thermodynamic behaviour of a crude oil from land rig location in the Niger Delta Area of Nigeria. Thermophysical and physicochemical analyses of the crude oil were determined at standard condition (600 F, 14. 7 psia) and several operating or reservoir conditions (770 F, 1040 F, 1300 F, 1500 F & 2120 F). Test result indicated that while increased in temperature resulted in increase in concentration of some physicochemical properties like Electrical conductivity, TDS and Ph, there were reduction in concentration of thermophysical properties like viscosity, density and specific gravity. While viscosity value at standard condition (600 F) gave 2. 8 cst, the values were 2. 12 <b>cst,</b> <b>1.</b> 98 <b>cst,</b> <b>1.</b> 60 <b>cst,</b> <b>1.</b> 32 <b>cst</b> and <b>1.</b> 05 <b>cst</b> at elevated temperature of 770 F, 1040 F, 1300 F, 1500 F, and 2120 F respectively.

A key to the success of T. gondii as a {{parasite}} is its ability to persist for the life of its host as bradyzoites within tissue cysts. The glycosylated cyst wall is the key structural feature that facilitates persistence and oral transmission of this parasite. Because most of the antibodies and reagents that recognize the cyst wall recognize carbohydrates, identification of the components of the cyst wall has been technically challenging. We have identified <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> (TGME 49 _ 064660) as a 250 kDa SRS (SAG <b>1</b> related sequence) domain protein with a large mucin-like domain. <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> is responsible for the Dolichos biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) lectin binding characteristic of T. gondii cysts.

This cyst is cloaked with a glycosylated structure called the cyst wall. Previously, we demonstrated that a mucin-like glycoprotein, <b>CST</b> <b>1,</b> localizes to the cyst wall and confers structural rigidity on brain cysts in a mucin-like domain-dependent manner. The mucin-like domain of <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> is composed of 20 units of threonine-rich tandem repeats that are O-GalNAc glycosylated. A family of enzymes termed polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts) initiates O-GalNAc glycosylation. To identify which isoforms of ppGalNAc-Ts are responsible for the glycosylation of the <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> mucin-like domain and to evaluate the function of each ppGalNAc-T in the overall glycosylation of the cyst wall, all five ppGalNAc-T isoforms were deleted individually from the T.  gondii genome. The ppGalNAc-T 2 and -T 3 deletion mutants produced various glycosylation defects on the cyst wall, implying that many cyst wall glycoproteins are glycosylated by T 2 and T 3. Both T 2 and T 3 glycosylate the <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> mucin-like domain, and this glycosylation is necessary for <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> to confer structural rigidity on the cyst wall.

Fifteen patients with SAR-JC and 13 control subjects were enrolled in 2009, and 17 SAR-JC patients, 13 sensitized asymptomatic subjects (Sensitized), and 15 control subjects were enrolled in 2010. Total RNA was extracted from nasal epithelial cells and 8 SAR-JC patients and 6 control subjects in 2009 were subjected to microarray analysis with the Illumina HumanRef- 8 Expression BeadChip platform. Allergen-stimulated histamine release was examined in the peripheral blood basophils isolated from patients with SAR.

40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{important}} protozoan pathogen of humans that can cause encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS. This encephalitis is due to reactivation of latent infection in T. gondii-seropositive patients. Latent organisms survive within tissue cysts, which are specialized parasitophorous vacuoles containing bradyzoites. The cyst wall of this structure is produced by modification of the parasitophorous vacuole by the parasite and is important in cyst survival. The components of the cyst wall have been poorly characterized. By using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, we have identified a monoclonal antibody (MAb 93. 18) that reacts with the cyst wall. This antibody recognizes a 116 -kDa glycoprotein, which we have termed <b>CST</b> <b>1,</b> containing sugar residues that bind Dolichos biflorans lectin (DBA). <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> is distinct from T. gondii antigen labeled with succinyl Triticum vulgare lectin (S-WGA) and represents the major DBA-binding component in T. gondii.

Saponins have pharmacological effects like anti-inflammatory, molluscicidal, antimicrobial, antispasmodic, antidiabetic, anticancer, anticonvulsant, anthelmintic, antitussive and cytotoxic activities. The current work describes the anthelmintic and cytotoxic activities of crude saponins of Achillea Wilhelmsii and Teucrium Stocksianum as these plants are rich with saponins. Methods Brine shrimp cytotoxic activity of crude saponins was determined by Meyer et al. (1982) at test concentrations of 1000 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, 7. 5 μg/ml, 5. 0 μg/ml, 2. 5 μg/ml and <b>1.</b> 25 μg/ml. Percentage mortality of test concentrations was determined. Similarly, in vitro anthelmintic activity was determined against roundworms, tapeworms and earthworms. Albendazole and piperazine citrate at concentration 10 mg/ml were used as standard anthelmintic drugs. Results Crude saponins of Achillea wilhelmsii (CSA) and Teucrium stocksianum (CST) had, respectively, cytotoxic activity with LC 50 values 2. 3 ± 0. 16 and 5. 23 ± 0. 34 μg/ml. For in vitro anthelmintic activity, time for paralysis and death of parasites (parasiticidal activity) was noted. At concentration 40 mg/ml, crude saponins of Achillea wilhelmsii are <b>1.</b> 96 and 2. 12 times more potent than albendazole against Pheretima posthuma and Raillietina spiralis, respectively.

Conservation between CTC <b>1</b> and RPA <b>1</b> is less apparent. Currently the mechanism underlying CST action is largely unknown. Here we address CST mechanism by using a DNA-binding mutant, (STN <b>1</b> OB-fold mutant, STN <b>1</b> -OBM) {{to examine the relationship}} between DNA binding and CST function. In vivo, STN <b>1</b> -OBM affects resolution of endogenous replication stress and telomere duplex replication but telomeric C-strand fill-in and new origin firing after exogenous replication stress are unaffected. These selective effects indicate mechanistic differences in CST action during resolution of different replication problems. In vitro binding studies show that STN <b>1</b> directly engages both short and long ssDNA oligonucleotides, however STN <b>1</b> -OBM preferentially destabilizes binding to short substrates. The finding that STN <b>1</b> -OBM affects binding to only certain substrates starts to explain the in vivo separation of function observed in STN <b>1</b> -OBM expressing cells. <b>CST</b> is expected to engage DNA substrates of varied length and structure as it acts to resolve different replication problems.

40|$|The ends of chormosomes {{are capped}} by telomeres, which {{distinguish}} the termini from damaged DNA. Paradoxically, DNA repair proteins are also required for telomere maintenance. How DNA repair pathways are regulated to maintain telomeres while remaining competent to repair DNA damage throughout the genome is unknown. In this dissertation, I used a genetic approach to investigate how critical components of telomerase and the telomere protein complex {{interact with the}} DNA damage response (DDR). In the flowering plant, Arabidopsis thaliana telomeres are bound by the <b>CST</b> (CTC <b>1</b> /STN <b>1</b> /TEN <b>1)</b> heterotrimer. Loss of any CST component results in telomere shortening, telomere fusions, increased G-overhang length and telomere recombination. To understand the phenotypes caused by CST deficiency, I examined telomeres from plants lacking CTC <b>1</b> or STN <b>1</b> and TERT or KU. My analysis showed that CST acts in a separate genetic pathway for telomere length regulation from both KU and TERT. Further, I found that KU and CST act in separate genetic pathways for regulation of G-overhang formation. These demonstrate that multiple pathways are used to maintain telomere length and architecture in plants. My study of the interaction of telomere components with the DDR revealed ATR promotes genome stability and telomere length maintenance {{in the absence of}} CTC <b>1,</b> probably by activating programmed cell death of stem cells with high amounts of DNA damage. I also found that poly(ADP-ribosylation) is not required for maintenance of Arabidopsis telomeres, in contrast to human telomeres. Finally, I found an unexpected connection between the DDR and telomerase. My research showed that ATR maintains telomerase activity levels. Further, induction of double- stranded DNA breaks in seedlings led to a rapid decrease in telomerase activity, which correlated with increased abundance of TER 2, an alternate Arabidopsis telomerase RNA. I hypothesize that TER 2 inhibits telomerase to prevent its inappropriate action at internal sites in chromosomes.

The Moi-Tea-Ver (MTV) complex purified in vitro binds and protects ssDNA in a sequence-independent manner. Tea recruits Ver and Moi to telomeres, and point mutations disrupting MTV interaction in vitro result in telomere uncapping, consistent with these proteins functioning as a complex in vivo. MTV thus shares functional similarities with <b>CST</b> or TPP <b>1</b> -POT <b>1</b> in protecting ssDNA, highlighting a conserved feature in end protecting mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Grapevine trunk {{diseases}} (GTD) {{are currently}} {{considered one of}} the most relevant challenges for the viticulture. These destructive diseases cause in vineyards several damages every year, and they are of rapidly growing concern in all wine producing countries. In 2006, the OIV established a resolution about some principal measures used to prevent or limit the proliferation of wood diseases (resolution OIVVITI 2 / 2006), and minor references in <b>CST</b> <b>1</b> / 2008 and <b>CST</b> 2 / 2011 OIV resolutions. Recently, a new initiative has arisen inside the OIV group "vine protection and viticultural technics (PROTEC) "concerning to the development and impact of main trunk diseases, and their different alternatives to control or mitigation of their spread and damage at an international level of the cultivated Vitis species...|$|R
