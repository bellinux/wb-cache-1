40|$|Recently, {{narrative}} {{has emerged}} as an important concept in interrupting the transmission of intergenerational trauma in Indigenous communi-ties. For many Indigenous peoples, narrative {{in the form of}} storytell-ing is a fundamental traditional cultural practice. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> presents findings from a community-based digital storytelling (DS) workshop that focused on eliciting stories of resiliency amidst historical trauma (HT) in the Māori community. The principal investigator worked with Māori community members to create digital stories focused on cultural strengths. Post-workshop in-depth interviews were then conducted to explore participant experiences in the workshop. Analyses of narratives reveal the importance of language to name and define HT, describe the transformative nature of the DS workshop and reaffirm the great promise that DS demonstrates as a healing tool in the disruption of HT in future work with Indigenous communities.

40|$|ABSTRACT We found {{evidence}} of a mutual suppression effect between anxiety and depression on an individual’s level of commitment within escalation dilemmas. On the one hand, our results demonstrate {{a positive relationship between}} anxiety and level of commitment; on the other, our results demonstrate a negative relationship between depression and level of commitment. Based on the opposing relationships between anxiety and depression and commitment, the broad factor of neuroticism does not demonstrate any relationship with level of commitment, and the significant effects of anxiety and depression on commitment is contingent upon partialling the effect of the other facet of neuroticism. Thus, we contend that applied psychologists, who have focused on neuroticism as a broad construct, should consider the large body of work among clinical <b>Correspondence</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> may be sent to: Henry Moon Robert H.

40|$|The current discourses {{on human}} {{trafficking}} in Canada {{do not take}} into account domestic trafficking, especially of Aboriginal girls. Notwithstanding the alarmingly high number of missing, murdered and sexually exploited Aboriginal girls, the issue continues to be portrayed more as a problem of prostitution than of sexual exploitation or domestic trafficking. The focus {{of this study is to}} examine the issues in sexual exploitation of Aboriginal girls, as identified by the grass root agencies, and to contextualize them within the trafficking framework with the purpose of distinguishing sexual exploitation from sex work. In doing so, the paper will outline root causes that make Aboriginal girls vulnerable to domestic trafficking as well as draw implications for policy analysis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thirty-six {{participants}} in the age group 18 - 22 participated in a simulated experiment designed to examine whether social factors, more specifically the interviewer behaviour, {{play a significant role}} in the level of suggestibility observed. The study had a single factor between-subjects design. The independent variable was interviewer behaviour, which was varied such that there were three conditions: friendly, abrupt and neutral interviewer behaviour. Memory was assessed using a free recall test, forced choice recognition, and confidence ratings. The suggestibility observed in the neutral condition was significantly less as compared to that observed in the abrupt condition. Further, the greatest number of accurate details were recalled when the participants were interviewed by a neutral interviewer. The results are discussed in the context of various factors such as self-esteem, anxiety, compliance and power relations in the interviewer-interviewee relationship.

40|$|Tonneau’s paper {{focuses on}} two main points: One of them {{deals with the}} {{adequacy}} of the ac-count of stimulus equivalence in terms of math-ematical set theory. The second point deals with the usefulness of stimulus equivalence derived from matching to sample procedures to under-stand symbolic behavior. Tonneau states that many concepts of stimulus equivalence are inad-equate and the theory is too bound to matching to sample procedures. Tonneau suggests focus-ing on functional equivalence, rather than on stimulus equivalence, and to use other procedures besides matching to sample, that implies stimu-lus correlations. I will discuss first the place of stimulus equiva-lence {{in the context of the}} study of complex behavior; second, I will discuss about the direc-tion the research must take for better understand-ing complex verbal behavior.

40|$|Grandparents {{are valued}} in {{traditional}} and contemporary Aboriginal societies. In this paper we summarize traditional knowledge from Manitoba Aboriginal experiences, and we provide data from contemporary on-reserve grandmothers. Data {{for this study}} were collected in 2007 in 16 First nations Manitoba communities. Open-ended semi-structured in-person interviews were conducted in maternal-child centers that provide programs for developmental health for children and their parents (prenatal to age 6). Of the 100 people interviewed, ten of those were grandmothers, and their stories are analyzed in this paper. Results showed that grandmothers provided cultural transmission to subsequent generations, ensured child safety, provided acceptance and care for granchildren, were challenged by inadequate and unsafe housing and communities, had difficulty providing educational supports for grandchildren, were supported by a network of kin, found community support inconsistent, needed to make a living, and needed more health supports.

40|$|The colonial {{relationship}} between Māori and Pākehā cultures has often {{resulted in the}} deprioritisation of mātauranga Māori (including te reo Māori) from both Māori and Pākehā (NZ Europeans). Interviews with 19 Māori language learners explored how Māori and Pākehā relationships developed in a post/neo-colonial society where Pākehā cultural norms govern public domains. Participants explained how {{it was possible to}} prioritise Māori knowledge and language in a society that is discrimina-tory towards Māori. Predominant ways in which Māori were protected from discrimination towards their own language, culture and people were through creating spaces where Māori language and customs were normalised. For some participants, the unequal {{relationship between}} Pākehā and Māori was highlighted {{as a result of their}} increased engage-ment with Māori culture and communities. Finally, results indicated that Māori often needed to take on the responsibility of educating Pākehā about preconceived ideas that they held towards their culture.

40|$|The octave {{illusion}} (D. Deutsch, 1974) {{occurs when}} 2 tones separated by an octave are alternated repeatedly, such {{that when the}} right ear receives the high tone, the left ear receives the low tone, and vice versa. Most subjects in the original study reported hearing a single tone that alternated from ear to ear, whose pitch also alternated from octave to octave, and D. Deutsch (1975 a) proposed an explanation in terms of separate what and where auditory pathways. C. D. Chambers, J. B. Mattingley, and S. A. Moss (2002) argued that the perceived pitch difference generally corresponds more to a semitone and proposed an alternative explanation in terms of diplacusis. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> argues that Chambers et al. used problematic procedures and reports a new experiment on the octave illusion. The findings confirm that an octave difference is generally perceived, and they agree with the model of Deutsch (1975 a) but are at variance with the diplacusis hypothesis.

40|$|One of {{the many}} {{associations}} activated in my “mind ” by Tonneau’s excellent article is perhaps the arch-enemy of his intended audience: Noam Chomsky. Protestations by behavioral analysts, henceforth termed Skinnerians, notwithstanding (MacCorquodale, 1970; Skinner, 1972) Chomsky’s critique of Skinner’s Verbal Behavior (Chomsky, 1959) revealed a central fallacy of the Skinnerian approach: namely that the emergence of all be-haviors are NOT {{the direct result of}} simple rein-forcement histories. Indeed, I feel that the cur-rent popularity of the equivalence class concept owes itself to Chomsky. At last, it would seem, 50 years after the fact Skinnerians have found an answer to Chomsky’s smug dismissal of their approach to explaining the (relatively) spontane-ous emergence of certain types of behaviors. This excitement is captured in the following quote: I think it is crucial in this context to keep our eye on the prize. It would be a very bad thing if the development of behav-ioral theories leads to traditional hypoth-esis-testing research. The goal is not to test theories. The goal is to predict and control behavior with precision and scope.
