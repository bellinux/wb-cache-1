40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{monitoring}} of indoor air quality parameters, namely: indoor temperature, humidity, velocity, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide in day care centres. This study selected 15 day care centres located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. These day care centres were categorized as follows: (1) day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near an industrial area, (2) day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near a main road, and (3) day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in a residential area. The obtained data showed that the values for the indoor air quality parameters in all day care centres were still well below the recommended value according to the Department of Safety and Health, Malaysia. The day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near an industrial area had the highest value of carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide {{as compared to the}} day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> near a main road and the day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> in a residential area.

As Olivia waits for her stepfather, she sketches {{a picture of her}} and Peter in her book. As her stepfather is about to arrive, Olivia decides she must tell Walter about him, and rushes to his office. Olivia, in tears, hands Walter the sketchbook, explaining about her stepfather's abuse and that she knew she had crossed over to the parallel universe. She is interrupted by a sound from behind her: it is Walter. Olivia had temporarily entered the parallel universe and spoken to Walternate. Walter takes Olivia to her stepfather, but warns the man that he will be reported to social services if Olivia is harmed again.|$|E

5|$|Utilities {{and other}} {{services}} also have significantly changed since 1990. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was renovated and expanded in 1976, 1985, 1995, and 2000. In 2009, the hospital opened a new heart <b>care</b> <b>center</b> during its latest expansion. Bassett Army Hospital on Fort Wainwright went through a $132 million renovation in 2005. To meet the demand for a convention center and large sporting arena, the city paid for construction of the Carlson Center, a 5,000-seat arena that opened in 1990. In 1996, the city of Fairbanks privatized its utilities when the Municipal Utilities Service was sold to a private company. About $74 million from the sale was deposited into a savings account called the Fairbanks Permanent Fund, which was invested and managed in a fashion similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, though residents do not receive any income from the Fairbanks Permanent Fund.|$|E

Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad.

She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt {{that it should be}} more conversational. As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community. She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African American graduates, requesting they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded, and her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African American community, even though they had attended an elite university with all of the advantages that accrues to its graduates. She majored in sociology and minored in African American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.|$|E

30|$|In Mexico, in 2007 a supply-side {{grant program}} to expand child care {{services}} was created {{with the goal}} of increasing labor force participation of poor mothers (Mateo Díaz and Rodriguez Chamussy 2013).

Additionally, monthly grants were provided to day <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> on a per-capita (per child) basis (Calderon 2014). The operational costs of these centers are covered by the public subsidy plus a fee collected from the parents (Staab and Gerhard 2010).

40|$|Abstract Background Due to long {{waits for}} primary care {{appointments}} and extended emergency department wait times, newer sites for episodic primary care services, such as urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers,</b> have developed. However, {{little is known}} about these centers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide information about the organization and functioning of urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> based on a nationally representative U. S. sample. Methods We conducted a mail survey with telephone follow-up of urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> identified via health insurers' websites, internet searches, and a trade association mailing list. Descriptive statistics are presented. Results Urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> are open beyond typical office hours, and their scope of services is broader than that of many primary care offices. While these characteristics are similar to hospital emergency departments, such centers employ significant numbers of family physicians. The payer distribution is similar to that of primary care, and physicians' average salaries are comparable to those for family physicians overall. Urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> report early adoption of electronic health records, though our findings are qualified by a lack of strictly comparable data. Conclusion While their hours and scope of services reflect some characteristics of emergency departments, urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> are in many ways similar to family medicine practices. As the health care system evolves to cope with expanding demands in the face of limited resources, it is unclear how patients with episodic care needs will be treated, and what role urgent <b>care</b> <b>centers</b> will play in their care. </p...|$|R
