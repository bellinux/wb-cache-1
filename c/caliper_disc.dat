50|$|The ADO16 (Amalgamated Drawing Office {{project number}} 16) was {{designed}} by Alec Issigonis. Following his success with the Mini, Issigonis set out to design a larger and more sophisticated car which incorporated more advanced features and innovations. In common with the Mini, the ADO16 was designed around the BMC A-Series engine, mounted transversely and driving the front wheels. As well as single piston swinging <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brakes at the front, which were not common on mass-produced cars in the early 1960s, the ADO16 featured a Hydrolastic interconnected fluid suspension system designed by Alex Moulton. The mechanically interconnected Citroen 2CV suspension was assessed in the mid-1950s by Alec Issigonis and Alex Moulton (according to an interview by Moulton with CAR magazine in the late 1990s), and was an inspiration {{in the design of}} the Hydrolastic suspension system for the Mini and Austin 1100, to try to keep the benefits of the 2CV system (ride comfort, body levelling, keeping the roadwheel under good control and the tyre in contact with the road), but with added roll stiffness that the 2CV lacked. Pininfarina, the Italian styling studio which had worked with BMC before on the Austin A40 Farina, was commissioned to style the car. ADO16 had comparable interior space to the larger Ford Cortina.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the onset}} of the dynamic {{instability}} in a floating <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brake system is studied. The disc is modelled as a flexible rotating plate, the pad is taken as a small mass and a distributed stiffness, and the motion of the caliper is also taken into consideration. The linearized equations of motion about the equilibrium position are derived assuming a constant braking force. The equations are subsequently discretized with the help of appropriate shape functions. The eigenvalue problem is then solved to detect {{the onset of}} instability. The effects of damping on the stability of motion are investigated as well...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{introduces a}} new approach to model the non-linear relations among different design and manufacturing evaluation measures for multiobjective optimal concurrent design. In this approach, different design and manufacturing evaluation measures are mapped to comparable evaluation indices. The non-linear relation between an evaluation measure and its evaluation index is identified based on the least-square curve-fitting method. The weighting factors for different design and manufacturing evaluation indices, representing the importance measures of these indices in the multiobjective design optimization, are achieved using the pair-wise comparison method. An example case study of automobile <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brake design considering 3 design evaluation measures and 1 manufacturing evaluation measure is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the introduced approach...|$|E
40|$|Decomposition {{synthesis}} in optimal {{design is}} the process of creating an optimal design model by selecting objectives and constraints {{so that it can be}} directly partitioned into an appropriate decomposed form. Such synthesis results are not unique since there may be many partitions that satisfy the decomposition requirements. Introducing suitable criteria an optimal decomposition synthesis process can be defined in a manner analogous to optimal partitioning formulations. The article presents an integer programming formulation and solution techniques for synthesizing hierarchically decomposed optimal design problems. Examples for designing a pressure vessel, an automotive <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brake and a speed reducer are presented. The application of the integer programming formulation in the decomposition synthesis of large systems is illustrated using an automotive powertrain design problem...|$|E

5000|$|The 996 had larger 98 mm pistons, larger valves, a {{stronger}} crankshaft and crankcases ported from the 916 SPS. But since the 916 camshaft gave a softer, less peaky power delivery and less top-end power ( [...] versus the SPS’s [...] ) the 996 was built {{with a new}} air intake system with two fuel injectors per cylinder. A new airbox and a distinctive underseat exhaust system were also built into the new design. The chassis was also modified. Lighter wheels were introduced along with improved <b>calipers,</b> <b>discs</b> and pads stronger compared to the 916. The suspension system was still the same Showa design but both {{the front and back}} were fully adjustable for damping and preload.|$|R

40|$|Asymmetry {{is applied}} to a {{heavy-duty}} commercial twin <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brake rotor {{as a means to}} alleviate an undesirable high amplitude noise. The problematic frequency is 2400 Hz, the rotor blade exhibiting a 5 - diametric mode order of vibration. The asymmetry is introduced by drilling sets of radial holes into the disc rim. Modal analysis is carried out over a range of frequencies using added masses applied magnetically to the rim of the rotor. This shows the amplitudes at set frequencies to reduce considerably when asymmetry is introduced. When a set of 5 masses is added to the rotor the vibration amplitude at the troublesome frequency is seen to be considerably reduced. Finite element analysis complements the experimental results. The analysis of a plain disc initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes. This is also accompanied by a distinct positioning of the antinodes with the antinodes of one mode positioning at the sets of drilled holes, the other mode antinodes being between the holes. When an asymmetric disc is fitted to the vehicle the noise is eradicated. Significant testing of the vehicle has since been undertaken without noise being generate...|$|E
40|$|The out-of-plane {{vibration}} {{characteristics of}} a noisy brake are generally better understood than in-plane characteristics. The fundamental {{reason for this is}} that in-plane vibration was not considered a significant effect until recently when technology has allowed the in-plane vibration characteristics to be determined with some degree of confidence. Detailed investigations of the side views of out-of-plane holographic images indicated that the in-plane displacement could be quite significant and possibly larger than the out-of-plane displacement. It was because the fringe pattern could not be attributed solely to out-of-plane displacement that a study of in-plane vibration was initiated. The paper discusses the measurement of both out-of-plane and in-plane vibration of a twin <b>caliper</b> <b>disc</b> brake during noise generation. The technique makes use of a series of 11 time-related holograms recorded from three different viewing perspectives of the brake - a total of 33 holograms covering a single cycle of excitation. Each image records absolute displacement but as each of the three holograms view the brake from a different viewpoint then each comprises varying degrees of out-of-plane and in-plane vibration, dependant on their angular position. This varying degree of displacement allows their manipulation to identify and isolate the in-plane and out-of-plane contributions to the overall excitation so that each may be considered separately. The out-of-plane is represented as a three-dimensional image whereas arrows represent the in-plane amplitude as a "quiver" plot. The series allows a dynamic representation of each mode of vibration to be created separately and then combined to indicate the absolute vibration mode characteristics. The results indicate the disc modal behavior to be extremely complex for the two-caliper brake, the disc antinodes tending to ""index" between the two caliper...|$|E
