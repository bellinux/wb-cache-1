The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to establish a methodology in which remote sensing can be used to support the monitoring of water resources. SPOT XS imagery and object-oriented classification was used to identify farm dams and their surface area. Two equations applied to determining the <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> were used to convert surface area to volume. The results showed a similarity between fieldwork and object-oriented classification data for surface area. Overall, there appears to be a strong positive correlation between object-oriented classification and unsupervised classification. The correlation between object-oriented classification and supervised classification ranged from strong positive association to little or no association. This study concludes that remote sensing is a useful tool in identifying water bodies and generating an estimate of volume stored...|$|E
40|$|Sediment {{deposits}} in North African catchments contribute to around 2 %– 5 % of the yearly {{loss in the}} water storage <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams.</b> Despite its semi-arid climate, the Tafna River {{plays an important role}} in Algeria’s water self-sufficiency. There is continuous pressure on the Tafna’s dams to respond to the demand for water. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to evaluate the contribution of different compartments in the basin to surface water and the dams’ impact on water and sediment storage and its flux to the sea in order to develop reservoir management. The hydrological modelling fitted well with the observed data (Nash varying between 0. 42 and 0. 75 and R 2 varying between 0. 25 and 0. 84). A large proportion of the surface water came from surface runoff (59 %) and lateral flow (40 %), while the contribution of groundwater was insignificant (1 %). SWAT was used to predict sediments in all the gauging stations. Tafna River carries an average annual quantity of 2942 t·yr− 1 to the Mediterranean Sea. A large amount of water was stored in reservoirs (49 %), which affected the irrigated agricultural zone downstream of the basin. As the dams contain a large amount of sediment, in excess of 27, 000 t·yr− 1 (90 % of the sediment transported by Tafna), storage of sediment reduces the lifetime of reservoirs...|$|E
40|$|The {{dams and}} {{reservoirs}} {{are one of}} the largest sources to store surface water. The escalating water crisis in the new millennium has made it very important to preserve available water and in turn to preserve the storage <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> and reservoirs. Dams and reservoirs lose their capacity due to sedimentation. Climate change and land-use changes have the potential to generate more sediment load hence accelerating this depleting process. An example is the Mangla Dam in Pakistan - the second largest dam in the country. Agriculture in the Punjab province, with almost 65 % of the country’s population, is dependent on this dam. Due to sedimentation, the Mangla Reservoir has already lost 20 % of its original storage capacity and an accelerated capacity loss is expected due to climate and land-use changes in the future.

In addition to mean climate factors, climate change will have a more profound impact on climate variability, which will likely lead to a more intensified and frequent extreme rainfall events than is currently experienced. Rainfall is the main driving factor of river sediment load, especially extreme rainfall events, which can cause exceptionally high sediment load compared to normal rainfall events. Therefore impacts of climate change was investigated by transient climate change scenarios from 1980 to 2098 constructed through bias correction of General Circulation Models (GCM) daily simulation outputs for the observed weather stations in the catchment. Land-use change scenarios were generated for two broad conditions based on socio-economic data and physical factors influencing the land-use: (i) pro-agriculture scenario and (ii) pro-industrialization scenario. The impact of climate and land-use changes on the reservoir life was then investigated by using various combinations of climate change scenarios and land-use change scenarios. The results show that both climate and land-use changes can have significant impacts on the Mangla basin sediment transported by the river to the dam reservoir; climate change has a large impact on the annual sediment load, monthly variation in the sediment load, and in turn the reservoir life. The superimposed effects of land-use on climate change can exacerbate or reduce such impacts. Land-use change has the potential to effectively reduce climate change impacts. Therefore various land-use management measures were further evaluated based on economic analysis as adaptation options to mitigate the climate change impacts...|$|E

40|$|Reservoir {{sedimentation}} and {{the consequence}} long term loss of storage capacity {{have been a}} serious threat to the natural environmental system. However, there is only few information and physical measurements regarding to the sediment accumulation rate within the reservoirs. The average age of dams in the country is more than 50 years old, and with aging dams, the number of high-hazard dams continues to increase. There are some serious risks associated with aging dams. Dam removal or dam failure can release considerable sediment load to downstream reaches, eventually deteriorate water quality and fish habitat. The present dissertation investigates the historical function of Great Lakes dams as sediment storage points and provides insight into the remaining <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams</b> in the Great Lakes watershed. to better understand the historical and current sediment yield, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been used. The regression analysis has been done on SWAT output to predict the sediment yield in un-modeled watershed. The overall objectives of this research are: 1 -	 Determine the historical and current sediment yield within the Great Lakes watershed. 2 -	Estimate the sediment accumulation rate within the reservoirs and forecast the remaining capacity of reservoirs in the Great Lakes. 3 -	Evaluate the net effect that humans have caused to the sediment delivery to the Great Lakes. The difference between pre- European settlement and the present- day sediment delivery rate is anthropogenic effects. The research of this investigation includes field studies and modeling for eleven reservoirs in the Great Lakes watershed...|$|E

Total Nineteen species of Macrophytes belonging to fifteen families were occurred in the seven fresh water bodies, out of which sixteen in Pus, fourteen in Adharpus, eighteen in Arunawati, nine in Goki, eleven in Saikheda, ten in Borgaon, fifteen in Waghadi. It was noticed {{that the number of}} weeds were more in dams which are used for drinking and pisiculture purposes. Water bodies which are places of recreational and aesthetic use are badly affected by unwanted growth of aquatic weeds. They increase water loss through absorbs and transpire more water by the process called evapotranspiration. They also affect quality of water. They can also change the taste of drinking water. The impacts of aquatic weeds that they were reducing the storage and conveyance <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams.</b> It was observed that many of these weeds survive well in their new environments and grow at a fast rate. They can be excluded native plants and could also have an impact on native animals. They may also cause reduction in oxygen levels and present gaseous exchange with water resulting in adverse fish production. When weeds occupied large areas of a water body, a reduction in the fish condition could be occurred, resulting in a stunted fish population. They can provide a favorable and protected habitat for disease vectors mainly the insects. The rapid spread of aquatic weeds in the dam’s vegetative and other means is creating serious socio-economic problems. So the management of weeds is important and immediate action should be taken by the authority for to improving the availability of dam water which is mainly used for drinking, pisiculture and irrigation purposes by Taluka (where the dam is constructed) of Yavatmal District...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} half century, {{there has been a}} {{remarkable}} expansion in the rate and scale of dam construction worldwide. Many of these dams have been successful in providing various economic benefits. However, reservoir sedimentation decreases useful <b>capacity</b> <b>of</b> <b>dams,</b> shortens their economic life, and increases the need of potential dam development in the future. Also, maintenance of aging dams often involves considerable environmental and social costs to the society. Management of dams requires the study of available options and possible solutions to the problem of reservoir sedimentation and dam removal. ^ This dissertation provides a framework for assessing management strategies to achieve sustainable use of dams. First, an analysis of sediment removal techniques is made to examine their economic performance and the need for actions to conserve storage reservoirs. The case study of the Sefid-Rud reservoir in Iran shows that the technique of sediment-flushing is capable of retaining the useful storage capacity {{for a wide range of}} economic parameters and site-specific technical constraints. Innovations that relax some of these constraints could produce significant economic benefits. ^ Second, the framework of analysis is extended to situations involving externalities through sedimentation. Using the data from Mahaweli Cascade, Sri Lanka, it is shown that the total economic return from managing a system of cascading dams is increased when the negative externality from sediment release to downstream reservoirs is controlled. The results also indicate that the imputed external cost of sedimentation is likely to be high for a large-scale reservoir. The estimated external cost can be used to design policies for managing sediment along the river. ^ Lastly, an option-pricing model is developed to help formulate guidelines for dam removal decisions. Key factors that determine the desirability of dam rehabilitation versus removal are identified. For example, lower discount rates and a lower level of uncertainty make dam removal a more attractive option, while high decommissioning cost is likely to delay its timing. The case study of the Pak Mun Dam in Thailand indicates that the threshold level of damage for dam rehabilitation is $ 5. 27 M and dam removal should be undertaken when the damage reaches $ 15. 26 M. ...|$|E
