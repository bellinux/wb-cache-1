5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the Almanac Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, {{different}} aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension that serve as sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} to subdivision based {{on the evolution of}} surfaces under curvature motion is presented. Such an evolution can be understood as a natural geometric filter process where time corresponds to the filter width. Thus, subdivision can be interpreted as the application of a geometric filter on an initial surface. The approach <b>closely</b> <b>connects</b> subdivision to surface fairing concerning the geometric smoothing and to cascadic multigrid methods with respect to the actual numerical procedure. The derived method does not distinguish between different valences of nodes nor between different mesh refinement types...|$|R
50|$|According to J. Dawson, eco-nationalism is {{the rise}} of social {{movements}} that <b>closely</b> <b>connect</b> problems of environment protection with nationalist concerns. In former Soviet Union citizens perceived environmental degradation as both a systemic fault of socialism and {{a direct result of}} Moscow's desire to weaken a particular nation by destroying its natural base, and exploiting its resources. Estonian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian independence movements drew great strength from environmental activism, especially from an antinuclear stance. In 1985-1991, eco-nationalism was one of symptoms {{and at the same time}} a new impulse for disintegration of the Soviet Union.|$|R

Additionally all internal stock movements of tool components for the costing can be handed to the ERP system with the integration.|$|R

For example, his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death. His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans, or regulated the status of serfs.|$|E
5|$|Coloman routed two {{bands of}} crusaders (the {{perpetrators}} of the Rhineland massacres) who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svačić in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding {{an agreement with}} twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the region known as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Dráva, became <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land grants from the monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman's suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern borderland of the kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Mentoring {{relationships}} are dynamic alliances {{that can be}} used as a supportive mechanism for growing nurse leaders and promoting the future of the nursing profession. This article explores imagination as one of the central meanings of being a mentor for nursing leadership. Findings from a hermeneutic-phenomenological study concerned with Australian nurse leaders' experiences and understandings of mentorship for leadership revealed that imagination was a key characteristic of being a nurse leader-mentor. Imagination that moved beyond fantasy to <b>closely</b> <b>connect</b> with reason was essential for nurse leader-mentors to recognize and activate the myriad possibilities available to mentees and the nursing profession more broadly...|$|R
40|$|Conversion symptoms, as {{identified}} by the existing classification systems, do not form a single unitary class. It is therefore difficult to find an adequate treatment that <b>closely</b> <b>connects</b> to the basic characteristics of the disease.

We reasoned that motor patterns can be taught straightforwardly by means of operant conditioning methods and that movement disorders in conversion should be treated accordingly. Our case study shows that carefully retraining deficient motor patterns may constitute {{the core of the}} treatment for conversion disorders...|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Edith rapidly {{weakened}} {{over the}} mountainous terrain of northeastern Central America, and 18 hours after it made landfall, it emerged into the Gulf of Honduras as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. It continued to weaken {{as it moved}} northwestward, and made landfall near Belize City with tropical storm winds of 70 mph (115 km/h). Edith weakened further while crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, and emerged into the Gulf of Mexico near Campeche, Mexico late on September 11 as a minimal tropical storm. Edith initially failed to re-intensify as it moved northwestward, despite low amounts of wind shear and warm waters. This was because an anticyclone over the Gulf was <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> with Hurricane Fern, which developed and moved over the northwestern portion of the Gulf of Mexico. The anticyclone resulted in an easterly upper-level flow across Edith, creating conditions not conducive for intensification. As Fern moved inland over Texas, the flow became more favorable around Edith, and 36 hours after entering the Gulf of Mexico, the storm began to reintensify slightly.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686BC), {{the first}} pharaohs built funerary {{complexes}} {{in the religious}} center of Abydos following a single general pattern, with a rectangular mudbrick enclosure. In the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized {{the cult of the}} divine king more than the direct worship of deities. Deities <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> with the king, such as the sun god Ra, received more royal contributions than other deities. Ra's temple at Heliopolis {{was one of the great}} religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large sun temples in his honor near their pyramids. Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more <b>closely</b> <b>connected</b> with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
