The fine structure of the primary cell wall surface of a cotton hairs and adjoining plasma lemma were studied by the replications-prints method by using optical and electron microscopy. The observations of the apical parts of the growing hairs on some ovary seeds, as well as the direct measurement of the rates of their growth on the cotton segments show that the process of the cell-hair growth has an oscillatory character and depends on the location of the hair on the ovary seed epidermis, on curvature of the apical part surface and the hair age.

The final publication is available at [URL] audienceUpon swelling and dissolution, native cellulose fibers such as <b>cotton</b> <b>hairs</b> or wood fibers are rotating and contracting. Regenerated cellulose fibers are only contracting, not rotating. <b>Cotton</b> <b>hairs</b> show two rotation mechanisms, a well known untwisting, not seen in wood fibers, due to the unwinding of the twists initially induced by the desiccation that occurs {{at the end of}} the growth, and a "microscopic rotation" that can also be slightly observed in wood fibers. In addition to these rotation mechanisms, <b>cotton</b> <b>hairs</b> and wood fibers show a rolling up of their primary wall that is due to the higher elongation of the external layers as compared to the internal layers arising during the elongation phase of the cell. Contraction originates from the fact that the cellulose chains are in an extended conformational state due to the spinning process for the regenerated fibers and to the bio-deposition process for native fibers. The contraction is related to the relaxation of the mean conformation of cellulose chains from an extended state to a more condensed state.

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} consensus that higher plants synthesize cellulose microfibrils that initially comprise 18 chains. However, {{the mean number}} of chains per microfibril in situ is usually greater than 18, sometimes much greater. Microfibrils from woody tissues of conifers, grasses and dicotyledonous plants, and from organs like <b>cotton</b> <b>hairs,</b> all differ in detailed structure and mean diameter. Diameters increase further when aggregated microfibrils are isolated. Because surface chains differ, the tensile properties of the cellulose may be augmented by increasing microfibril diameter. Association of microfibrils with anionic polysaccharides in primary cell walls and mucilages leads to in vivo mechanisms of disaggregation that may be relevant to the preparation of nanofibrillar cellulose products. For the preparation of nanocrystalline celluloses, the key issue is the nature and axial spacing of disordered domains at which axial scission can be initiated. These disordered domains do not, as has often been suggested, take the form of large blocks occupying much of the length of the microfibril. They {{are more likely to be}} located at chain ends or at places where the microfibril has been mechanically damaged, but their structure and the reasons for their sensitivity to acid hydrolysis need better characterization...|$|R

40|$|Context: Institutional {{waste from}} {{clinical}} centers {{can be classified}} as those coming from health institutions dedicated to human attention and those coming from centers for animal veterinary care. The latter are mainly hazardous wastes, hence their disposal requires incineration.

This work is motivated because no literature was found on the pyrolysis kinetics veterinary waste, as this kind of studies are mainly focused on hospital waste of human health care. Method: The kinetics of pyrolysis is characterized and studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis of 6 major veterinary waste (gauze, cotton swabs, <b>cotton,</b> nails, <b>hair,</b> plastic syringes). The characterization is performed by proximate and elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Reactivity characteristics and pyrolytic capability of wastes are established. The kinetics study on pyrolysis was carried out by determining the kinetic triplet by isoconversional Starink method. Results: It was established that the pyrolysis index increases with the heating rate and that the thermal degradation depends on the material type of the waste. Similarly, {{it was found that the}} temperature (ΔT = Tf - Ti) for the thermal decomposition of veterinary waste is: ΔTnails> ΔThair > ΔTcotton swabs > ΔTgauze > ΔTcotton > ΔTplastic syringes; the activation energy is Enails> E hair > Eplastic syringes > Ecotton swabs > E gauze > Ecotton, and the reaction order is: n hair > nnails > ncotton swabs > ncotton > n gauze > n plastic syringes.

Woven horse <b>hair,</b> <b>cotton,</b> and linen are examples of natural fibers used in sutures; in fact, silk is still used today. With the evolution of advancing technology, arrays of synthetic polymeric threads have replaced natural fibers for the majority of purposes with Vicryl™ (Ethicon, Kirkton, Scotland) absorbable sutures becoming one of the most popular. Cyanoacrylate adhesives offer the surgeon and patient an alternative to suturing wounds. They offer a fast and less traumatic closure for appropriately selected wounds and typically do not require the use of local anesthesia [2]. These adhesives are commonly used for the closure of topical skin incisions and trauma-induced lacerations in areas of low skin tension [3]. Numerous potential advantages have been reported for both surgeons, healthcare system providers, and patients compared to conventional surgical wound closure techniques, including faster closure time, good cosmesis, non-invasive, less tissue trauma, no requirement for secondary dressing, ease of bathing, and no requirement for suture or staple removal [4]. Additionally, they spontaneously slough off in a short time period of time (5 – 10  days), thereby not requiring clinician removal [5]. These unique benefits have resulted in a significant increase in both the use and acceptance of the product within the medical community.|$|R
40|$|Indigenous Andeans and the Spanish chroniclers in {{the early}} colonial era wrote about the pre-Hispanic and colonial use of what we {{commonly}} call cactus fiber for clothing and other textiles in Ecuador. In this paper I use colonial accounts and ethnographic evidence to examine {{the use of such}} fibers in clothing and other textiles and their social and cultural significance. For example, the Incas considered cactus-fiber garments barbarous and uncivilized compared to those made of <b>cotton</b> and camelid <b>hair,</b> and used this as part of their justification for conquest; they were bringing civilization to the savages. While Ecuador 2 ̆ 7 s damper climate prevents the preservation of pre-Hispanic textiles like those found on Peru 2 ̆ 7 s arid coast, there is some archaeological and ethno-historical evidence that allows us to trace continuities in the use of cactus fiber for cloth. This practice continues today with fiber from the Furcrea and Agave plants, the former indigenous to the Andes and the latter introduced from Mexico. Although there have been changes in many of the garments and textiles produced, recent ethnographic. research conducted by myself and others offers information about how Furcrea and Agave are harvested, processed, spun, and woven or looped into finished textiles, which permits us to postulate how pre-Hispanic cactus-fiber cloth may have been made. Such reconstruction is possible because of the conservatism of cactus fiber-processing techniques in the Ecuadorian Andes. Barbarous or practical? Savage or sophisticated?

30|$|Although some {{intercellular}} hyphal growths and ramifications involving cortical cells after invasion were observed, most hyphal growths were restricted {{within the}} cortical tissues. Only a few hyphae could extend in a directed manner toward the xylem vessels where the rapid proliferation of the hyphae took place. These observations, {{together with the}} intercellular but not intracellular colonization, {{were consistent with the}} studies of V. dahliae on oilseed rape, lettuce and cotton roots (Eynck et al., 2007; Vallad and Subbarao, 2008; Zhang et al., 2012), which suggested that plant roots were able to impede the progress of V. dahliae hyphae within the cortical tissue either due to intercellular space blockage, active cellular defenses or a combination of both processes. Once the hyphae xylem vessel infection was established, it triggered a typical Verticillium resistance in the above-ground plant organs, even though it ultimately caused wilt disease as reported in a recent study (Yadeta et al., 2011). In contrast with V. dahliae infection on lettuce roots, where the tips of the lateral roots were the first to invade vascular tissues (Vallad and Subbarao, 2008), we observed that colonies established on Arabidopsis and <b>cotton</b> root <b>hair</b> zones appeared to be the most successful, as they were the first to germinate, display hyphal growth and invade vascular tissues. Nevertheless, despite massive hyphae encompassing the root surface, only a few hyphae successfully invaded the root internal tissues. However, a strategy involving the formidable proliferation of hyphae in xylem vessels compensated for the low hyphae penetration ratio, demonstrating the serious pathogenic threat of V. dahliae that led to wilt disease. Unlike in infections with V. longisporum, plants maintain their water status (Floerl et al., 2008, 2010) due to a pathogen-triggered plant VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN 7 (VND 7)-dependent de novo xylem formation that involves enhanced water storage capacity and is accompanied by increased plant drought tolerance (Reusche et al., 2012). It has been reported that hop plants tolerant to V. albo-atrum infection displayed newly formed xylem cells that were free of tyloses and fungal hyphae (Talboys, 1958). Of the many Verticillium species, V. dahliae is the only species that blocks vessels and causes cotton wilt under field conditions. This natural plant-fungus pathosystem is interesting and worthy of further investigation focused on the efforts to alleviate the effects of the vascular pathogen on the water status of infected cotton.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{efficient}} alkaline protease producer {{was isolated}} from {{the water of the}} hyperalkaline-saline Lonar soda lake and identified as Bacillus alcalophilus LW 8 by culture-dependent techniques by its morphological, microscopic, biochemical, physiological and molecular characteristics. The 16 S rRNA gene sequence was submitted to the GenBank nucleotide repository under accession number KC 689353. Alkaline protease production was optimized by adopting a one-variable-at-a-time approach in a submerged fermentation system in modified fermentation medium (MFM). The optimized components of MFM were (w/w) casein (1 %), sugarcane molasses (1 %), NaCl (1 %), ammonium sulphate (0. 5 %), KH 2 PO 4 (0. 05 %), K 2 HPO 4 (0. 05 %) and Na 2 CO 3 (1 %). Optimized culture conditions were used for alkaline protease production. The final yield of partially purified alkaline protease after dialysis was 53. 35 %. The molecular mass of the dialysed alkaline protease was 27 kDa. On a Lineweaver–Burk plot, the calculated Km and Vmax values were 24 mg/mL and 1000 U/mg, respectively. The enzyme was remarkably stable in the pH range 7. 0 – 12. 0, with optimum activity at pH 10. 0. LW 8 alkaline protease was completely inhibited by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride at 10 mmol/L, indicating that the enzyme belongs to the serine protease class. The metal ions Ca 2 +, Ba 2 +, Mg 2 +, Zn 2 +, Fe 3 +, Cu 2 + and Mn 2 + increased the catalytic activity of partially purified alkaline protease. The protease effectively decomposed the gelatinous coating on an X-ray film, hydrolysed blood clot, a blood-stain from a piece of <b>cotton</b> fabric and <b>hairs</b> from a piece of goat skin...|$|R
