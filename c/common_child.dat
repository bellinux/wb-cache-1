2500|$|Since many {{nationality}} laws now allow {{both parents}} to transmit their nationality to their <b>common</b> <b>child</b> (and {{not only the}} father, as used to be often the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. This is especially frequent in Switzerland, since a relatively high {{proportion of the population}} holds a foreign passport (up to 54% in Geneva and 20% nationally). However, the Federal Office for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any practical problems worth mentioning. [...] Military service, the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription.|$|E

"We {{must live}} {{before we can}} learn," [...] said the Mugger, [...] "and there is this to say: Little jackals are very <b>common,</b> <b>child,</b> but such a mugger as I am is not common. For all that, I am not proud, since pride is destruction; but take notice, it is Fate, and against his Fate no one who swims or walks or runs should say {{anything}} at all.

"Mrs. Matilda Pitman said before--and meant it--that she doesn't take pay for {{entertaining}} strangers, nor let other people {{where she lives}} do it, much as their natural meanness {{would like to do}} it. You go along to town and don't forget to call the next time you come this way. Don't be scared. Not that you are scared of much, I reckon, considering the way you sassed Robert back this morning.

Suppose they see quite clearly that all these pretensions of an inviolate superiority of birth and breeding vanish at the touch of a Whitaker Wright, soften to a glowing cordiality before the sunny promises of a Hooley. Suppose they perceive that neither King nor lords really believe in their own lordliness, and that at any point in the system one may find men with hands for any man's tip, provided it is only sufficiently large!
