5|$|Accessus was {{a method}} for {{cardinals}} to change their most recent vote to accede to another candidate {{in an attempt to}} reach the requisite two-thirds majority and end the <b>conclave.</b> This method was first disallowed by the Cardinal Dean at the 1903 <b>conclave.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{dictated}} by the prescriptions Ubi periculum and Ne Romani, the <b>conclave</b> should have begun on 4 August, ten days {{after the death of}} Innocent VIII; however, the <b>conclave</b> was delayed to await the slow arrival of the aged Gherardo, bearing a letter from Venice's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College. The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use the Sistine Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the <b>conclave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before abdicating, Celestine re-enacted Ubi Periculum, the Apostolic Constitution of Pope Gregory X, {{which has}} governed all {{subsequent}} papal elections {{under the laws}} of the <b>conclave.</b> Two subsequent papal elections may be considered possible exceptions, although they adhered to {{the laws of the}} <b>conclave</b> to a great degree: the Council of Constance, which elected Pope Martin V to end the Western Schism, and the papal <b>conclave,</b> 1799-1800, for which Pope Pius VI suspended Ubi Periculum due to the interference of Napoléon Bonaparte.|$|E

50|$|In his {{capacity}} of cardinal, Pignedoli {{was one of}} the electors in the <b>conclaves</b> of August and October 1978, which selected Pope John Paul I and Pope John Paul II respectively. He was considered by many as a papabile in both of those <b>conclaves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Giuseppe Siri {{was widely}} {{expected}} to be elected pope in the 1958 and 1963 <b>conclaves</b> and {{continued to be a}} prime contender in both 1978 <b>conclaves.</b> On the first of these occasions, Angelo Roncalli, an utterly unexpected choice, was elected and became Pope John XXIII.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} or {{resignation}} of a pope, {{members of the}} College of Cardinals who are under age 80 act as electoral college, meeting in a papal <b>conclave</b> to elect a successor. Although the <b>conclave</b> may elect any male Catholic as pope, since 1389 only cardinals have been elected.|$|E
5|$|Noted for the {{extensive}} interference of European powers, the <b>conclave</b> {{was to determine}} whether and on what terms the Council of Trent would reconvene (supported by Charles V and opposed by Henry II) and the fate of the Duchies of Parma and Piacenza (claimed by both Charles V and the House of Farnese). Although the <b>conclave</b> nearly elected Reginald Pole, the late arrival of additional French cardinals pushed the <b>conclave</b> back into deadlock, and eventually Giovanni del Monte was elected Pope Julius III as a compromise candidate.|$|E
5|$|Papal {{elections}} since 1276 {{have taken}} the form of papal conclaves, which are elections that follow {{a set of rules}} and procedures developed in Ubi periculum (1274) and later papal bulls; observance of the <b>conclave</b> varied until 1294, but all papal elections since have followed relatively similar <b>conclave</b> procedures.|$|E

5|$|Sources {{from the}} time of the March 1605 <b>conclave</b> listed up to twenty-one {{possible}} candidates considered by the cardinals, but the only ones that were seriously discussed during the <b>conclave</b> were Cesare Baronius and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici. That <b>conclave</b> saw Spain veto Cesare Baronius after the first ballot. Medici, the candidate who was finally elected, was also vetoed by the cardinal representing Spain but this occurred after the election of Leo XI, and the cardinals did not view the veto as valid.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the <b>conclave,</b> and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 <b>conclave</b> was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the <b>conclave</b> began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the <b>conclave.</b>|$|E
5|$|The papal <b>conclave</b> from November 29, 1549, to February 7, 1550, convened {{after the}} death of Pope Paul III and {{eventually}} elected Giovanni Del Monte to the papacy as Pope Julius III. It was the second-longest papal <b>conclave</b> of the 16th century, and (at the time) the largest papal <b>conclave</b> in history {{in terms of the number}} of cardinal electors. The cardinal electors (who at one point totalled fifty-one) were roughly divided between the factions of Henry II of France, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III.|$|E

5|$|According to Professor Picotti, who {{extensively}} {{researched the}} <b>conclave</b> {{and came to}} the conclusion that simony had occurred, no accounts of papal income and expenditure exist in the registers of Introitus et Exitus for August 1492, and debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, Domenico della Rovere, Sanseverino, and Orsini appeared soon afterwards. The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, was said to have nearly crashed after the <b>conclave</b> due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E

5|$|As a cardinal, Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous <b>conclave</b> and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as a cardinal and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third <b>conclave</b> soon.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the length of the election, during which three of the twenty cardinal-electors died and one resigned, Gregory X promulgated the apostolic {{constitution}} Ubi periculum on July 7 (or 16), 1274, during the Second Council of Lyon, establishing the papal <b>conclave,</b> whose rules were based on the tactics employed against the cardinals in Viterbo. The election itself is sometimes viewed as the first <b>conclave.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the <b>conclave,</b> Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the second choice of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} <b>conclave,</b> demanding that the <b>conclave</b> wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would be likely to cause a schism.|$|E

5|$|Designed both to {{accelerate}} future elections and reduce outside interference, {{the rules of}} Ubi periculum provide for the cardinal electors to be secluded for {{the entirety of the}} <b>conclave,</b> including having their meals passed through a small opening, and for their rations to be reduced to a single meal at the end of three days, or bread and water (with a little wine) after eight days. Cardinals also do not collect from the Apostolic Camera any payments they might otherwise receive during the <b>conclave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the <b>conclave</b> began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy <b>conclave,</b> because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Leo, another cardinal had died, {{reducing the number}} of cardinal electors in the May <b>conclave</b> to 59. At the beginning of the <b>conclave</b> Alessandro Peretti di Montalto supported Antonio Sauli. A significant number of the electors loyal to Pietro Aldobrandini, the nephew of Clement VIII, were willing to support Sauli. Aldobrandini, however, opposed Sauli's election due to Sauli's previous opposition to electing Clement, and was able to prevent Sauli from reaching the two-thirds majority required for election.|$|E
