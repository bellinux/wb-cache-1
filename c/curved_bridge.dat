25|$|In {{the fusion}} process, the lipid head group {{is not only}} {{involved}} in charge density, but can affect dehydration and defect nucleation. These effects are independent {{of the effects of}} ions. The presence of the uncharged headgroup phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) increases fusion when incorporated into a phosphatidylcholine bilayer. This phenomenon has been explained by some as a dehydration effect similar to the influence of calcium. The PE headgroup binds water less tightly than PC and therefore may allow close apposition more easily. An alternate explanation is that the physical rather than chemical nature of PE may help induce fusion. According to the stalk hypothesis of fusion, a highly <b>curved</b> <b>bridge</b> must form between the two bilayers for fusion to occur. Since PE has a small headgroup and readily forms inverted micelle phases it should, according to the stalk model, promote the formation of these stalks. Further evidence cited in favor of this theory is the fact that certain lipid mixtures have been shown to only support fusion when raised above the transition temperature of these inverted phases. This topic also remains controversial, and even if there is a curved structure present in the fusion process, there is debate in the literature over whether it is a cubic, hexagonal or more exotic extended phase.|$|E

2500|$|Just {{after the}} {{completion}} of the KLIA Ekspres, the project proponent YTL Corporation Berhad proposed a high-speed rail link between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. At that time, Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia could not afford such an expensive project. YTL again proposed the project in 2006 and as of June 2007, the Malaysian Government said the feasibility of the proposal was still being studied. The RM8 billion project would slash rail travel time from more than 6 hours to about 90 minutes. [...] The main stumbling blocks, apart from costs, appears to be the JB-Woodlands Causeway which Mahathir had once hoped to replace with a 'scenic bridge'. There were doubts about the capacity of such a <b>curved</b> <b>bridge</b> to carry a rail line and YTL having to use KTM land which runs from Woodlands to Keppel. [...] Redevelopment of this land in Singapore could probably help fund the proposed railway if the various parties involved each had a stake in each other. [...] If the Causeway remains or a straight bridge is one day built to replace it, there should be no difficulty to have a high speed line on either. The high speed line proposal, like the bridge proposal, appears to have reached a stumbling block which only can be overcome at the highest political levels where other bilateral issues have to first be resolved or dealt with at the same time.|$|E

40|$|With {{the quick}} {{development}} of transportation infrastructure, {{there is an}} increase in the number of construction of <b>curved</b> <b>bridges,</b> particularly in the construction of highway interchanges and overpasses. The most popular type of <b>curved</b> <b>bridges</b> structure being used is Box-Girder. This is due to its efficiency, high strength to weight ratio and aesthetic appealing, and occasionally the use of straight beam is not possible. The LUSAS analysis software was used in this study to simulate and analyze the box-girder <b>curved</b> <b>bridges</b> in various models, namely Grillage, Beam, Finite Element Solid Element and Finite Element Thick Shell models. The study examines and compares the maximum displacement, shear force, bending moment and torsional moment for each model. The results demonstrated that the beam and grillage model produce moment, shear force and torsional moment that can be used directly for design. On the other hand, finite element model gives only stresses which is much more difficult to be used in the design, but useful for local effect analysis. The finite element model with solid element suffered the largest displacement while the beam model had the least amount of displacemen...|$|R
40|$|Box girders are {{generally}} used as main girders of horizontally <b>curved</b> <b>bridges,</b> because the torsional rigidity of box girder {{is larger than}} that of I-girder.

Yesterday evening Mrs. Arundel insisted on my going to the window, and looking at the glorious sky, as she called it. Of course I had to look at it. She is one of those absurdly pretty Philistines to whom one can deny nothing. And what was it? It was simply a very second-rate Turner, a Turner of a bad period, with all the painter's worst faults exaggerated and over- emphasised. Of course, I am quite ready to admit that Life very often commits the same error. She produces her false Renes and her sham Vautrins, just as Nature gives us, on one day a doubtful Cuyp, and on another a more than questionable Rousseau. Still, Nature irritates one more when she does things of that kind. It seems so stupid, so obvious, so unnecessary. A false Vautrin might be delightful. A doubtful Cuyp is unbearable. However, I don't want to be too hard on Nature. I wish the Channel, especially at Hastings, did not look quite so often like a Henry Moore, grey pearl with yellow lights, but then, when Art is more varied, Nature will, no doubt, be more varied also. That she imitates Art, I don't think even her worst enemy would deny now. It is the one thing that keeps her in touch with civilised man. But have I proved my theory to your satisfaction? ...|$|E
