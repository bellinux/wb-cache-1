5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 familial dyslipidemia. There are five types of familial dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in <b>chylomicron</b> metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
25|$|The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are {{now called}} <b>chylomicron</b> {{remnants}}. The <b>chylomicron</b> remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with <b>chylomicron</b> remnant receptors, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the endocytosis of the <b>chylomicron</b> remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within lysosomes. Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, {{which can be}} used for energy or stored for later use.|$|E
25|$|In {{the blood}} stream, nascent <b>chylomicron</b> {{particles}} interact with HDL particles resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent <b>chylomicron.</b> The <b>chylomicron</b> {{at this stage}} is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (glycerol covalently joined to three fatty acids) that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Chylomicrons</b> {{have been}} shown to protect against endotoxin-induced lethality. LPS-binding protein (LBP) is {{involved}} in the inactivation of bacterial toxin by lipoproteins. The current study examined the interaction among LBP, <b>chylomicrons,</b> and bacterial toxin. LBP was demonstrated to associate with <b>chylomicrons</b> and enhance the amount of LPS binding to <b>chylomicrons</b> in a dose-dependent fashion. In addition, LBP accelerated LPS binding to <b>chylomicrons.</b> This LBP-induced interaction of LPS with <b>chylomicrons</b> prevented endotoxin toxicity, as demonstrated by reduced cytokine secretion by PBMC. When postprandial circulating concentrations of <b>chylomicrons</b> were compared with circulating levels of low density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein, <b>chylomicrons</b> exceeded the other lipoproteins in LPS-inactivating capacity. Furthermore, highly purified lipoteichoic acid, an immunostimulatory component of Gram-positive bacteria, was detoxified by incubation with LBP and <b>chylomicrons.</b> In conclusion, our results indicate that LBP associates with <b>chylomicrons</b> and enables <b>chylomicrons</b> to rapidly bind bacterial toxin, thereby preventing cell activation. Besides a role in the detoxification of bacterial toxin present in the circulation, we believe that LBP-chylomicron complexes may be part of a local defense mechanism of the intestine against translocated bacterial toxi...|$|R
50|$|Dietary fats are {{packaged}} by intestine into triglyceride-rich lipoproteins called <b>chylomicrons.</b> The triglycerides in <b>chylomicrons</b> are hydrolyzed by {{lipoprotein lipase}} (LPL) along the luminal surface of capillaries, mainly in heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. GPIHBP1 is a capillary endothelial cell protein {{that provides a}} platform for LPL-mediated processing of <b>chylomicrons.</b>|$|R

25|$|The chylomicrons {{circulate}} {{throughout the}} body, giving the blood plasma a milky, or creamy appearance after a fatty meal. Lipoprotein lipase on the endothelial {{surfaces of the}} capillaries, especially in adipose tissue, but {{to a lesser extent}} also in other tissues, partially digests the chylomicrons into free fatty acids, glycerol and <b>chylomicron</b> remnants. The fatty acids are absorbed by the adipocytes, but the glycerol and <b>chylomicron</b> remnants remain in the blood plasma, ultimately to be removed from the circulation by the liver. The free fatty acids released by the digestion of the chylomicrons are absorbed by the adipocytes, where they are resynthesized into triglycerides using glycerol derived from glucose in the glycolytic pathway. These triglycerides are stored, until needed for the fuel requirements of other tissues, in the fat droplet of the adipocyte.|$|E
25|$|Chylomicrons, {{the least}} dense {{cholesterol}} transport molecules, contain apolipoprotein B-48, apolipoprotein C, and apolipoprotein E (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues {{in need of}} fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich <b>chylomicron</b> remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.|$|E
50|$|The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are {{now called}} <b>chylomicron</b> {{remnants}}. The <b>chylomicron</b> remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with <b>chylomicron</b> remnant receptors, found chiefly in the liver.

40|$|Rat lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> {{were treated}} with Pronase {{resulting}} in particles completely devoid of surface apoproteins. On re-incubation with serum, the Pronase-treated <b>chylomicrons</b> re-acquired, by transfer from other lipoproteins, all apoproteins except apoprotein B, which is water-insoluble and non-transferable. When two groups of rats were injected with [3 H]cholesterol-labelled control or Pronase-treated <b>chylomicrons,</b> radioactivity was incorporated into the liver of both groups at similar rates. It is concluded that {{the remnants of the}} control and Pronase-treated <b>chylomicrons</b> formed in the vascular space were recognized and taken up by liver cells by a process that does not require apoprotein B...|$|R
40|$|Acylation-stimulating protein (ASP), {{a product}} of {{complement}} C 3, stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis in adipocytes. Previous studies have identified transthyretin, associated with <b>chylomicrons,</b> as a stimulator of C 3 and ASP production. Since both transthyretin and <b>chylomicrons</b> transport retinyl ester/retinol, {{our goal was to}} investigate whether retinoic acid (RA) could be a potential hormonal mediator of the effect. Inhibitors of protein synthesis and protein secretion eliminated the stimulatory effects of <b>chylomicrons</b> on both C 3 and ASP production in human differentiated adipocytes, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis and secretion are both required. Incubation with <b>chylomicrons</b> increased C 3 mRNA levels (37 +/- 1. 5 %). RA alone or with <b>chylomicrons</b> had a stimulatory effect on C 3 production (29 -fold at 16. 6 nM RA) and ASP production. An RA receptor antagonist blocked stimulation of C 3 mRNA and C 3 secretion by both RA and <b>chylomicrons.</b> Finally, RA and <b>chylomicrons</b> activated a 1. 8 kb C 3 -promoter-luciferase construct transfected into 3 T 3 -F 442 and 3 T 3 -L 1 cells (by 41 +/- 0. 2 % and 69 +/- 0. 3 % respectively), possibly via RA receptor half-sites identified by sequence analysis. This is the first evidence documenting stimulation by RA of the C 3 gene. Thus we propose RA as a novel cellular trigger in <b>chylomicrons</b> that subsequently results in increased ASP production by adipocytes after a meal...|$|R
40|$|Light and {{electron}} microscopic {{study of}} aspirated bone marrow {{of a patient}} with type I hyperlipoproteinemia disclosed large, birefringent foam cells which develop from phagocytosis of <b>chylomicrons</b> by histiocytes. <b>Chylomicrons</b> are taken up, singly and in aggregates, by infoldings of the plasma membranes of histiocytes; these infoldings become phagocytic vacuoles within the cytoplasm. As <b>chylomicrons</b> are metabolized, the foam cells decrease in size, lose birefringence and develop autofluorescent, electron-dense deposits of ceroid...|$|R
50|$|Once {{triglyceride}} {{stores are}} distributed, the <b>chylomicron</b> returns APOC2 to the HDL (but keeps APOE), and, thus, becomes a <b>chylomicron</b> remnant, now only 30-50 nm. APOB48 and APOE {{are important to}} identify the <b>chylomicron</b> remnant in the liver for endocytosis and breakdown.|$|E
50|$|ApoB 48 is {{a unique}} protein to chylomicrons from the small intestine. After most of the lipids in the <b>chylomicron</b> have been absorbed, ApoB48 returns to the liver {{as part of the}} <b>chylomicron</b> remnant, where it is endocytosed and degraded.|$|E
50|$|As a class, {{cholesterol}} absorption inhibitors {{block the}} uptake of micellar cholesterol, {{thereby reducing the}} incorporation of cholesterol esters into <b>chylomicron</b> particles. By reducing the cholesterol content in chylomicrons and <b>chylomicron</b> remnants, cholesterol absorption inhibitors effectively {{reduce the amount of}} cholesterol that is delivered back to the liver.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which high-fat, high-cholesterol diets lower serum apolipoprotein E (apoE) concentration was studied in rats by feeding a single high-fat, high-cholesterol meal and by intravenously infusing <b>chylomicrons</b> containing low and high amounts of cholesterol. Serum apoE concentrations were unchanged 9 hours after an olive oil meal but were decreased by 35 % after an olive oil/cholesterol-enriched meal. The decrease in serum apoE concentrations with the olive oil/cholesterol meal {{was accompanied by a}} decrease in apoE concentration in the high density lipoprotein fraction. Three hours after the intravenous infusion of cholesterol-enriched <b>chylomicrons,</b> serum apoE concentrations decreased 40 %, whereas serum apoE concentrations decreased by only 10 % when <b>chylomicrons</b> with low cholesterol concentrations or saline were infused. It is concluded that the metabolism of cholesterol-enriched <b>chylomicrons</b> results in an increased removal of serum apoE and that the cholesterol content of <b>chylomicrons</b> is a determinant of serum apoE removal...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{isolated}} perfused rat liver to differentiate between <b>chylomicrons</b> and remnants with either high or low apoprotein E:C ratios was investigated. Remnants were prepared in hepatectomized rats injected with <b>chylomicrons</b> double-labeled with [3 H]cholesterol and 14 C-labeled fatty acids. By densitometric scanning of polyacrylamide gels, the apoprotein E:C ratio of the <b>chylomicrons</b> was 0. 8 {{and that of the}} remnants was 1. 5. When livers were perfused with these lipoproteins in a recirculatory system for 4 min, uptake of remnants was about 3 -fold greater than that of <b>chylomicrons.</b> Preparation of remnants as well as <b>chylomicrons</b> with a low apoprotein E:C ratio was achieved by (i) removal of all apoproteins {{from the surface of the}} lipoproteins by trypsin digestion, followed by (ii) transfer of soluble apoproteins from serum lipoproteins to the apoprotein-free particles. The apoprotein E:C ratio of the reconstituted lipoproteins was decreased from 1. 5 to 0. 3 for remnants and from 0. 8 to 0. 2 for <b>chylomicrons.</b> In spite of these changes in apoprotein E:C ratios, the hepatic uptake of the reconstituted lipoproteins with low apoprotein E:C ratios was similar to their unmodified controls. These results indicate that the hepatic discrimination between <b>chylomicrons</b> and remnants is not determined by the relative amounts of apoproteins E and C on the surface of the lipoproteins...|$|R
40|$|We {{have found}} that, in <b>chylomicrons</b> from {{intestinal}} lymph fistulas in the rat, the sole molecular species of apolipoprotein B (apo B) is B- 48. This protein {{is analogous to}} the B- 48 apoprotein of human <b>chylomicrons.</b> In contrast, preparations of <b>chylomicrons</b> from blood serum are known to contain species of B apolipoproteins of higher molecular weight, presumably due to the presence of hepatogenous lipoproteins. We studied the removal of 125 I-labeled apo B- 48 of intestinal lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> from blood plasma of rats. The removal of [14 C]cholesteryl esters of biologically labeled <b>chylomicrons</b> was unaffected by radioiodination. The labeled cholesteryl esters and apo B- 48 disappeared rapidly from the density (P) less than 1. 006 g/ml fraction of plasma. In contrast to the apo B of very low density lipoproteins (1. 019 less then p less then 1. 063 g/ml) after 1 hr. No 125 I was found in the B- 100 or B- 95 apolipoproteins at any time. We conclude that, unlike the species of apo B found uniquely in hepatogenous very low density lipoproteins, the apo B- 48 protein of <b>chylomicrons</b> is not a precursor of the B apoprotein of low density lipoproteins...|$|R
5000|$|While {{circulating}} in blood, chylomicrons exchange components with high-density lipoproteins (HDL). The HDL donates apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) to the nascent <b>chylomicron</b> and, thus, converts it to a mature <b>chylomicron</b> (often referred to simply as [...] "chylomicron"). APOC2 is the coenzyme for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{the blood}} stream, nascent <b>chylomicron</b> {{particles}} interact with HDL particles resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent <b>chylomicron.</b> The <b>chylomicron</b> {{at this stage}} is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (glycerol covalently joined to three fatty acids) that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the effects of n- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (PUFAs) of different marine origins on the metabolism of <b>chylomicrons</b> following a single ingestion of oil. Two oils both rich in n- 3 PUFAs but differing with respect to the intramolecular structure of the triglycerides (TGs) were compared, the first a fish oil with the m- 2 position of TGs enriched with n- 3 PUFAs and the second a seal oil with the n- 3 PUFAs located in the m- 1 / 3 positions of the TGs. Radiolabeled rat mesenteric lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> were prepared following intragastric administration of the respective oil in which [‘HI-cholesterol and [‘ 4 C]-palmitic acid were dissolved to label the lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively. After intravenous injection of <b>chylomicrons</b> into unanesthetized rats, removal from plasma of radiolabeled cholesterol and palmitate, and uptakes of radiolabels by the liver and spleen were measured. The disappearance of cholesterol label was faster following injection of seal oil <b>chylomicrons</b> compared with fish oil <b>chylomicrons</b> whereas there were no differences in the disappearance of palmitate label. The recovery of palmitat...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a new method to evaluate the antioxidant effect of food products in a biological system. The antioxidant status of HepG 2 cells was quantified after incubation with postprandial human <b>chylomicrons</b> after the intake of vegetable products. Three subjects consumed in a meal a vegetable soup containing 8. 4 mg of beta-carotene and 9 mg of lycopene. After 5 h, the subjects consumed a second meal without carotenoids. Blood samples were collected at basal time and every hour for 9 h. <b>Chylomicrons</b> were isolated from serum samples and used for both carotenoid quantification and HepG 2 stimulation. Carotenoid in <b>chylomicrons</b> followed an inter-individual and bimodal carotenoid response. We demonstrated the antioxidant effect of postprandial <b>chylomicrons</b> in HepG 2 {{at the time of}} maximum carotenoid concentration of <b>chylomicrons</b> with respect to basal time. This cell-based assay seems to be a useful method to evaluate the antioxidant effect of fruit and vegetable products in a biological system...|$|R

50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study in vivo the over-all fatty acid specificity of the mechanisms involved in <b>chylomicron</b> cholesterol ester and triglyceride formation during fat absorption in the rat. Mixtures containing similar amounts of two, three, or four C14-labeled fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids), but with varying ratios of unlabeled fatty acids, were given by gastric intubation to rats with cannulated thoracic ducts. The chyle or <b>chylomicron</b> lipid so obtained was chromatographed on silicic acid columns to separate cholesterol esters and glycerides (the latter being 98.2% triglycerides). After assaying each lipid class for total radioactivity, gas-liquid chromatography was employed to measure the total mass {{and the distribution of}} mass and of radioactivity in the individual fatty acid components of each lipid fraction. The specific radioactivity of each fatty acid in each fraction could then be calculated. The data provided quantitative information on the relative specificity of incorporation of each fatty acid into each <b>chylomicron</b> lipid class and on the relative extent to which each fatty acid in each lipid fraction was diluted with endogenous fatty acid. With the exception of a slight discrimination against stearic acid, the processes of fatty acid absorption and <b>chylomicron</b> triglyceride formation displayed no specificity for one fatty acid relative to another. In contrast, <b>chylomicron</b> cholesterol ester formation showed marked specificity for oleic acid, relative to the other three fatty acids. This specificity was not significantly altered by varying the composition of the test meal, by including cholesterol in the test meal, or by feeding the animal a high-cholesterol diet for several weeks preceding the study. Considerable dilution of the dietary fatty acids with endogenous fatty acids was observed. In one experiment, 43% of the <b>chylomicron</b> triglyceride fatty acids was of endogenous origin. Relatively more (54%) of the cholesterol ester fatty acids was of endogenous origin.|$|E
50|$|Short- {{and medium}} chain fatty acids are absorbed {{directly}} into the blood via intestine capillaries and travel through the portal vein. Long-chain fatty acids, on the other hand, are too large to be directly released into the tiny intestine capillaries. Instead they are coated with cholesterol and protein (protein coat of lipoproteins) into a compound called a <b>chylomicron.</b> The <b>chylomicron</b> enters a lymphatic capillary and enters into the bloodstream first at the left subclavian vein (having bypassed the liver).|$|E
50|$|<b>Chylomicrons</b> (from the Greek chylo, meaning milky fluid, and micron, meaning small particle) are {{lipoprotein}} {{particles that}} consist of triglycerides (85-92%), phospholipids (6-12%), cholesterol (1-3%), and proteins (1-2%).They transport dietary lipids from the intestines to other {{locations in the}} body. <b>Chylomicrons</b> {{are one of the}} five major groups of lipoproteins: <b>chylomicrons</b> (a.k.a. ULDL ultra low-density lipoprotein relative to surrounding water), very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, that enable fats and cholesterol to move within the water-based solution of the bloodstream.|$|R
50|$|Once {{absorbed by}} the enterocyte, {{cholesterol}} is reassembled into intestinal lipoproteins called <b>chylomicrons.</b> These <b>chylomicrons</b> are then secreted into the lymphatics and circulated to the liver.

40|$|The {{addition}} of apoprotein E isolated from human very low density lipoproteins to both rat lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> and a triglyceride emulsion significantly increased the hepatic uptake of these particles in a nonrecycling isolated rat liver perfusion system.

When lymph <b>chylomicrons</b> were loaded with both Apo E and Apo C proteins {{by exposure to}} rat plasma, no increment in hepatic clearance was observed. Sequential evalutions {{of the influence of}} the C apoproteins on the hepatic clearance of both emulsions and <b>chylomicrons</b> revealed that the CIII (CIII- 1) protein had a pronounced inhibitory effect on hepatic removal. The inhibition was observed for both Apo E-enriched <b>chylomicrons</b> and those containing little of this apoprotein...|$|R

50|$|The liver {{receives}} many lipids {{from the}} systemic circulation and metabolizes <b>chylomicron</b> remnants.It also synthesizes cholesterol from acetate and further synthesizes bile salts.The liver {{is the sole}} site of bile salts formation.|$|E
50|$|It is {{associated}} with hypercholesterolemia (typically 8-12 mmol/L), hypertriglyceridemia (typically 5-20 mmol/L), a normal ApoB concentration, and two types of skin signs (palmar xanthomata or orange discoloration of skin creases, and tuberoeruptive xanthomata on the elbows and knees). It {{is characterized by the}} early onset of cardiovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease. Remnant hyperlipidemia occurs as a result of abnormal function of the ApoE receptor, which is normally required for clearance of <b>chylomicron</b> remnants and IDL from the circulation. The receptor defect causes levels of <b>chylomicron</b> remnants and IDL to be higher than normal in the blood stream. The receptor defect is an autosomal recessive mutation or polymorphism.|$|E
