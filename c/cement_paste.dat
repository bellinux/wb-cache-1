40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{hydration}} progress in metakaolin (MK) -blended high-performance <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> with age from the measurements of compressive strength, porosity, and pore size distribution, {{the degree of}} pozzolanic reaction, and the Ca(OH) 2 (CH) content of the MK-blended <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> at a water-to-binder ratio (w/b) of 0. 3. Comparisons are also made with pastes containing silica fume (SF), fly ash (FA), and control Portland cement (PC). It is found that at early ages, the rates of pozzolanic reaction and CH consumption in the MK-blended <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> are {{higher than in the}} SF- or FA-blended <b>cement</b> <b>pastes.</b> The higher pozzolanic activity of MK results in a higher rate of strength development and pore structure refinement for the <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> at early ages. Although the rate of pozzolanic reaction of MK becomes slower after 28 days of curing, the pozzolanic reaction in the blended <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> with a w/b of 0. 3 still continues at the age of 90 days.

25|$|Separate paste mixing {{has shown}} that the mixing of cement and water into a paste before {{combining}} these materials with aggregates can increase the compressive strength of the resulting concrete.

In cold weather concreting, many precautions are observed. Low temperatures significantly slow the chemical reactions involved in hydration of cement, thus affecting the strength development.

40|$|An {{experimental}} rheological {{investigation was}} conducted to evaluate the performance of Algerian metakaolin MK on <b>cement</b> <b>pastes.</b> In the present work, several rheological tests were carried out at 20 °C, by using the stress controlled rheometer AR 2000, on the fresh <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> incorporating 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 % and 20 % of MK. Effect of metakaolin on the rheological behaviour of <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> were discussed. Rheological parameters such as viscosity, compliance, loss and storage shear modulus are evaluated by means of rheological techniques of both flow and creep/recovery tests (static mode) and oscillatory test (dynamic mode). Shear moduli allow to give information {{on the evolution of}} the paste structure related to practically interesting problems such as workability. The results obtained have shown that MK improves the flowability and exhibits viscous rheological behaviour of <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> over elastic behaviour of control paste (0 %MK).

40|$|Short fiber-reinforced {{semi-solid}} fresh <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> and mortars, tailored for extrusion, {{have much}} lower water-to-binder ratio and higher viscosity than normal <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> or mortars. The rheology of these pastes or mortars cannot {{be characterized by}} traditional rheology test methods suitable for normal fresh <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> or mortars with much greater water-to-binder ratio and lower viscosity. In this paper, orifice extrusion is employed to calibrate rheology of the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. An analytical model is developed for orifice extrusion of semi-solid pastes and mortars obeying a rigid-viscoplastic constitutive relationship, von-Mises yield criterion and the associated flow rule. Orifice extrusion results are interpreted using the analytical model and the established experiment data interpretation method, and the associated rheological parameters are derived for the semi-solid fresh cement mortar. This study provides a simple analytical model, together with experiment and data interpretation methods, for characterizing the complex intrinsic rheological behavior of semi-solid fresh <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> or mortars.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the influence of swine-waste biochar (SB) on the early-age characteristics of <b>cement</b> <b>pastes.</b> Using a water/binder ratio of 0. 28, SB modified <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> were analyzed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), flow, and Vicat setting tests. Notably, SB reduced the flow and initial setting times of SB modified <b>cement</b> <b>pastes.</b> Due to its porous and negatively charged surfaces, capillary water was adsorbed into the pores of the carbonaceous SB and this reduced the flow of the SB modified <b>cement</b> <b>pastes.</b> Furthermore, it is suspected that the reductions in initial setting times may have been because with the addition of water to the dry SB/cement binder mix, chemical reactions between the calcium cations from Portland cement and carboxylate anions from SB resulted in the development of Calcium Polycarboxylate Salts (C-P-S). Improvements in the properties of SB could enhance its applications in rapid-setting and flow-reducing concrete...|$|R

Two well hydrated <b>cement</b> <b>pastes,</b> CEM I (Ordinary Portland Cement, OPC) and CEM V (blast furnace slag (BFS) and fly ash added to OPC) were degraded using similar protocols. Equilibrium solutions and solid materials were characterised for three degradation states for each paste. All samples are free of portlandite and the pH of the equilibrated cement solutions vary in the range 9. 8 – 12. 2. Three calcium silicate hydrate phases (C-S-H) were synthesised in order to compare the sorption properties of degraded <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> and of hydrate phases in similar pH conditions. In order to avoid precipitation processes, the operational solubility limit was evaluated before batch experiments. These solubility values vary significantly in the pH range [9 – 13] with a 2. 4 × 10 − 7 mol/L minimum at pH close to 10. 5. In batch sorption experiments, the distribution ratio Rd values are high: 30000 – 150000 mL/g. The uptake of U(VI) increases when comparing the least and the most degraded <b>cement</b> <b>pastes</b> whereas the initial composition of cement has relatively insensitive effect. Sorption isotherms, expressed as a log [U(VI) solid]/ log [U(VI) solution] plots are linear. A slope of 1 is calculated indicating the predominance of sorption processes. As sorption and desorption values are close, the uptake mechanism seems reversible. The Rd values measured in C-S-H suspensions are in good agreement with Rd values of degraded <b>cement</b> <b>pastes,</b> and C-S-H materials {{could be one of}} the cementitious phases which control U(VI) uptake in <b>cement</b> <b>pastes...</b>|$|R
