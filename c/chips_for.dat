5|$|Late {{one night}} in 1997, Boston Herald {{reporter}} Tom Mashberg was driven to a warehouse in Red Hook, Brooklyn by William Youngworth {{to see what was}} purported to be The Storm on the Sea of Galilee. Youngworth was a career criminal and associate to New England art thief Myles Connor Jr. Mashberg had been investigating the theft and was briefly allowed to view the painting with a flashlight. He was given a vial of paint <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> authenticity. These were later confirmed by experts to be fragments of Dutch 17th-century origin—but not from the stolen painting. It was never concretely determined to be real or fake, and the FBI quit speaking to Youngworth after not making any progress. The painting has since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> the mode and installed them in cabinets. The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|E

30|$|These {{calculations}} {{produced the}} results that for 1, 500 ton of wood <b>chip</b> <b>for</b> fuel can be substituted around 345  kl of Bunker A, and it is worth about 25.3 million JPY. When Bunker A is used as fuel, 100  % of Bunker A is dependent on imports, while the amount of import <b>for</b> wood <b>chip</b> <b>for</b> fuel is increased to 0.95 million JPY without exporting. Therefore, we can expect 24.3 million JPY of substitution effect, by replacing Bunker A with wood <b>chip</b> <b>for</b> fuel.|$|R

25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued {{because they were too}} expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as nice as the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} Acorn RISC Machine project {{started in}} October 1983. They chose VLSI Technology as the silicon partner, {{as they were}} a source of ROMs and custom <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> Acorn. Wilson and Furber led the design. They implemented it with a similar efficiency ethos as the 6502. A key design goal was achieving low-latency input/output (interrupt) handling like the 6502. The 6502's memory access architecture had let developers produce fast machines without costly direct memory access (DMA) hardware.|$|E
25|$|The DDR3 {{standard}} permits DRAM chip {{capacities of}} up to 8 gibibits, and up to 4 ranks of 64 bits each for a total maximum of 16GiB per DDR3 DIMM. Because of a hardware limitation not fixed until Ivy Bridge-E in 2013, most older Intel CPUs only support up to 4 gibibit <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> 8GiB DIMMs (Intel's Core 2 DDR3 chipsets only support up to 2 gibibits). All AMD CPUs correctly support the full specification for 16GiB DDR3 DIMMs.|$|E
25|$|Finding {{itself with}} excess fab {{capacity}} after {{the failure of}} the Ultrabook to gain market traction and with PC sales declining, in 2013 Intel reached a foundry agreement to produce <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> Altera using 14-nm process. General Manager of Intel's custom foundry division Sunit Rikhi indicated that Intel would pursue further such deals in the future. This was after poor sales of Windows 8 hardware caused a major retrenchment for most of the major semiconductor manufacturers, except for Qualcomm, which continued to see healthy purchases from its largest customer, Apple.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{thermal energy}} {{can be useful}} for drying wood for {{construction}} and wood fuels such as wood <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> combustion. Solar is also used for food products such as fruits, grains, and fish. Crop drying by solar means is environmentally friendly as well as cost effective while improving the quality. The less money {{it takes to make}} a product, the less it can be sold for, pleasing both the buyers and the sellers. Technologies in solar drying include ultra low cost pumped transpired plate air collectors based on black fabrics. Solar thermal energy is helpful in the process of drying products such as wood chips and other forms of biomass by raising the temperature while allowing air to pass through and get rid of the moisture.|$|E
25|$|At the Worldwide Developers Conference {{keynote address}} on June 6, 2005, Jobs {{announced}} that Apple would begin producing Intel-based Mac computers in 2006. On January 10, 2006, the new MacBook Pro and iMac {{became the first}} Apple computers to use Intel's Core Duo CPU. By August 7, 2006, Apple made the transition to Intel <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> the entire Mac product line—over one year sooner than announced. The Power Mac, iBook and PowerBook brands were retired during the transition; the Mac Pro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro became their respective successors. On April 29, 2009, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was building its own team of engineers to design microchips. Apple also introduced Boot Camp in 2006 to help users install Windows XP or Windows Vista on their Intel Macs alongside Mac OS X.|$|E
25|$|For most of 2014, TSMC saw a {{continuing}} increase in revenues {{due to increased}} demand, primarily due to <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results. For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter. Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting fabless chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules, and in August 2014 {{it was reported that}} TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.|$|E

25|$|Although oak barrels {{have long}} been used by winemakers, many wineries now use oak wood <b>chips</b> <b>for</b> aging wine more quickly and also adding desired woody aromas along with vanilla flavors. It is a common {{misconception}} that oak imparts butter flavors to wine. This is not so. The butter flavors come from lactic acid, naturally present in the wine, converted during malolactic fermentation to diacetyl. This process reverses itself, although the addition of sulfur dioxide prevents this, and the diacetyl remains. Oak chips can be added during fermentation or during aging. In the latter case, they are generally placed into fabric sacks and placed into the aging wine. The diversity of chips available gives winemakers numerous options. Oak chips {{have the benefit of}} imparting intense oak flavoring {{in a matter of weeks}} while traditional oak barrels would need a year or more to convey similar intensity. Critics claim that the oak flavoring from chips tend to be one-dimensional and skewed towards the vanilla extract with the wines still lacking some of the physical benefits that barrel oak imparts. The use of oak powder is also less common than chips, although they are a very practical alternative if oak character is to be introduced during fermentation. Oak planks or staves are sometimes used, either during fermentation or aging. Wines made from these barrel alternatives typically do not age as well as wines that are matured in barrels. Improvements in micro-oxygenation have allowed winemakers to better mimic the gentle aeration of oak barrels in stainless steel tanks with oak chips.|$|E
