Charlie is astonished and grateful, and asks if Don has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola. Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself.|$|E
5|$|Transition {{and poor}} play marked the mid- to late-1970s. Though Collier agreed to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns as a quarterbacks coach on an {{informal}} basis, his retirement severed the last direct link to Brown and the team's early years. Meanwhile, {{a new generation}} of players began to replace the old hands who kept Cleveland in playoff contention through most of the 1960s. Gene Hickerson, an anchor on the offensive line in the 1960s, retired {{at the end of the}} 1973 season. An aging Leroy Kelly left the same year to play in the short-lived World Football League. Offensive lineman Dick Schafrath, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, retired in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Kate {{is upset}} about Sawyer not wanting her to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beach {{with him to}} rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is {{defending}} Sawyer, Jack informs Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that it is because he loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches {{him in the face}} repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, the Phillies released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. The Phillies were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to the Phillies for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Phillies if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent {{at the end of the}} 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom the Phillies had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. The Phillies also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for the Phillies in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

This effect was actually observed and is called the Sagnac effect. Currently, the consideration of this effect is necessary for many experimental setups and for the correct functioning of GPS.|$|E
25|$|Castillo {{started playing}} {{full-time}} for the Marlins {{at second base}} during the 1997 season. Both at age 21, he and Édgar Rentería were the youngest middle infield combination {{in the history of}} the National League. He bruised his left heel mid-season, and missed the entire month of May with the injury. He was optioned to the Triple-A Charlotte Knights on July 28 and did not <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> major leagues until the next season. Due to this, he did not play for the Marlins during the 1997 World Series.|$|E

25|$|From the 1960s {{it starts}} to happen the {{electrification}} of the coladeira, in which the percussion instruments are replaced by a drum kit and the bass / accompaniment play performed in the guitar {{is replaced by a}} bass guitar and an electric guitar. From the 1980s there is a big scale usage of electronic instruments (synthesizers, drum machines), being that usage much appreciated by some and criticized by others. In the late 1990s there is a <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roots where unplugged (acoustic) performances are sought after again.|$|E
25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial configuration when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E
25|$|According to Scorsese, {{production}} of the film was then closed down for around four months with the entire crew being paid, so De Niro could go on a binge eating trip around northern Italy and France. When he did <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, his weight increased from 145 to 215pounds (66 to 97kg). The scenes with the heftier Jake LaMotta—which include announcing his retirement from boxing and LaMotta ending up in a Florida cell—were completed while approaching Christmas 1979 within seven to eight weeks {{so as not to}} aggravate the health issues which were already affecting De Niro's posture, breathing, and talking.|$|E

25|$|James Dean {{has been}} a touchstone of many {{television}} shows, films, books and plays. The film September 30, 1955 (1977) depicts the ways various characters in a small Southern town in the US react to Dean's death. The play <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, written by Ed Graczyk, depicts a reunion of Dean fans on the 20th anniversary of his death. It was staged by the director Robert Altman in 1982, but was poorly received and closed after only 52 performances. While the play was still running on Broadway, Altman shot a film adaptation that was released by Cinecom Pictures in November 1982.|$|E

25|$|Two centuries later, the {{well-known}} Ottoman itinerant Evliya Çelebi gave {{a list of}} groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray and Çarşamba, bear {{the names of the}} places of origin of their inhabitants. However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmed allowed the deported Greeks to <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles writes {{in the middle of the}} 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to name any of the ancient Byzantine churches that had been transformed into mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total.|$|E
