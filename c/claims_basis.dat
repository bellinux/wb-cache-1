50|$|Many {{employers}} seek {{to mitigate}} the financial risk of self funding claims under the plan by purchasing stop loss insurance from an insurance carrier. These policies typically provide for risk retention limitations both on a specific claim and aggregate <b>claims</b> <b>basis.</b> An important aspect of self funded group health plans lies in the requirement that the employer remain liable for funding of plan claims regardless of the purchase of stop loss insurance. What this means, in turn, is a fund or company's own bank account creates a pool of their employees and is managed & distributed to claim payouts. In other words, only the employer has a contractual relationship with plan participants and beneficiaries. The stop loss policy runs solely between the employer and the stop loss carrier and creates no direct liability to those individuals covered under the plan. This feature provides the critical distinction between fully insured plans (subject to State law insurance regulations) and self funded health plans which, under the provisions of Section 514 of ERISA, are exempt from state insurance regulations.|$|E

5000|$|In economics, practising {{researchers}} tend {{to emulate}} the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a de facto fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology. Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see [...] "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism {{in the social sciences}} as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In jurisprudence, [...] "legal positivism" [...] essentially refers to the rejection of natural law, with the latter's <b>claimed</b> <b>basis</b> in a [...] "divine" [...] origin, thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a pseudo-"scientific" [...] view of law, based in a view of natural law, which supposes [...] "divine"origins.|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{problems}} which emerge in computer based information systems {{can be traced to}} misunderstandings which occur during systems analysis and design. In analysis we attempt to understand how particular business processes operate, how they fit into the organisation as a whole; in design we describe processes which will only exist in the future. The opportunities for misunderstanding are great. Most systems development methodologies try to deal with this problem by proposing a “good ” description language, a language in which the proposed system can be described clearly and unambiguously. The <b>claimed</b> <b>basis</b> of “goodness ” varies: mathematical rigour, the way people think (Jacobson, 1992, p 42) or the way language works (Stamper, 1992). In this research I investigate the proposition that any attempt to find a special language which clearly describes information systems is bound to fail, because words used will find their meanings in different existing special languages used by different design stakeholders, and because language is the trace of the power play which {{is an essential part of}} the design process. This research starts with semiotics, considering design documents, meetings and prototypes as texts, and attempting to understand to what they refer. I expect to discover (no...|$|R
