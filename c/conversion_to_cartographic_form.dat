Typeform, WuFoo, Google Forms, Survey Monkey, etc.) help to build and deploy them. Nowadays, offering a text area to catch a ZIP code or a select list to point out a country remains the best way to explicitly collect geospatial data. But what about mapping interfaces <b>to</b> integrate <b>cartographic</b> questions and/or cartographic answers as a more suitable solution? How to let form’s respondents indicate in which area(s) they engage in certain activities? The only way to solve these issues is by coding it yourself. This paper shows the design and technical problematic and try to give some solutions to build an efficient UX for the respondents and a standard answers treatment for the data analysts. This paper will also highlight the capacities of open source JavaScript library like OpenLayers to build the solution. Our interface was tested by the cities of Lausanne and Pully (Switzerland) and thousands of people answered <b>to</b> these « <b>cartographic</b> <b>forms</b> » on mobile and desktop.

40|$|In {{this short}} essay, I {{consider}} some {{relationships between the}} integrated cognitive-semiotic approach <b>to</b> <b>cartographic</b> representation that I develop in How Maps Work and Jacques Bertin's contributions <b>to</b> <b>cartographic</b> and graphic theory. I relate my approach to his comprehensive semiologic framework for map and graphic design {{as well as his}} efforts toward a structured method of graphic information processing. In relation to the former, particular attention is given to critiques of Bertin's "graphic variables" and work that extends them into the domains of time, sound, and touch. Then, the commonalities between his concept of geographic information processing and recent developments in geographic visualization (geovisualization) are outlined. Following from the latter, three geovisualization research challenges for the coming decade are highlighted: (1) developing a typology of operations for interactive georepresentations and a syntactics for their use; (2) balancing abstraction and realism in GeoVirtual environments; and (3) facilitating different place collaboration. keywords: geographic visualization, dynamic cartography, interactivity, animation, semiotics, cognition, virtual environment...|$|R

40|$|A {{transportable}} lunar laser ranging station can {{be expected}} to measure the range to the lunar corner retroreflectors from a site on the earth's surface with an uncertainty of about 3 cm. The accuracy with which that station can infer its geocentric position is influenced by many factors including the uncertainties in the pole position and rotation rate of the earth and the data loss due to weather. The results of a simplified modeling study intended to include these factors are presented in <b>cartographic</b> <b>form.</b> The modeling indicates that, assuming the successful operation of three or more widely separated fixed laser stations, the transportable station will be able to determine its relative geocentric position in all three coordinates with an accuracy comparable to the original range uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|In modern {{cartography}} of {{the late}} twentieth century the Internet offers an ideal plat-form for making communication with maps more feasible – on one hand. But on the other hand {{there has to be an}} understanding of the process and the methods of how <b>to</b> generate <b>cartographic</b> models and then how to communicate spatial data, which means geo-information accurately and efficiently. Due to this focus, cartography has to fulfil the obligation to achieve both – the creation of <b>cartographic</b> presentation <b>forms</b> for the new media and to accept the responsibility on understanding the deep relations within the whole cartographic communication process, which includes the user, the models in different cartographic media and the transmission.

40|$|By {{virtue of}} their spatio-cognitive abilities, humans are able to {{navigate}} through geographic space as well as meaningfully communicate geographic information represented in <b>cartographic</b> <b>form.</b> The current dominance of spatial metaphors in information visualization research {{is the result of}} the realization that those cognitive skills also have value in the exploration and analysis of nongeographic information. While mapping or landscape metaphors are routinely used in this field, there is a noticeable lack of consideration for existing cartographic expertise. This is especially apparent whenever problematic issues are encountered, such as graphic complexity or feature labeling. There are a number of areas in which a cartographic outlook could provide a valuable perspective. This paper discusses how geographic and cartographic notions may influence the design of visualizations for textual information spaces.
