5|$|<b>Chromic</b> acid {{anodizing}} (or Type I anodizing) {{of aluminium}} is another electrochemical process, {{which does not}} lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses <b>chromic</b> acid as electrolyte in the solution. During anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of <b>chromic</b> acid, instead of the normally used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep acetic acid away from <b>chromic</b> acid, ethylene glycol, nitric acid, perchloric acid, permanganates, peroxides and hydroxyls.|$|E
5|$|The uncatalyzed interconversion between para and ortho H2 {{increases}} with increasing temperature; thus rapidly condensed H2 contains {{large quantities of}} the high-energy ortho form that converts to the para form very slowly. The ortho/para ratio in condensed H2 is an important consideration in the preparation and storage of liquid hydrogen: the conversion from ortho to para is exothermic and produces enough heat to evaporate some of the hydrogen liquid, leading to loss of liquefied material. Catalysts for the ortho-para interconversion, such as ferric oxide, activated carbon, platinized asbestos, rare earth metals, uranium compounds, <b>chromic</b> oxide, or some nickel compounds, are used during hydrogen cooling.|$|E
25|$|Application of a one-percent {{solution}} of potassium permanganate or <b>chromic</b> acid to the cut, exposed area. The latter substance is notably toxic and carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|The {{new species}} is {{restricted}} to humid <b>chromic</b> luvic cambisols and rendzic leptosols at localities above tree line in the oro- to altimediterranean lifezone between 1550 and 1750 m in the eastern Orjen.|$|E
25|$|Formerly, {{sodium sulfate}} {{was also a}} {{by-product}} of the manufacture of sodium dichromate, where sulfuric acid is added to sodium chromate solution forming sodium dichromate, or subsequently <b>chromic</b> acid. Alternatively, sodium sulfate is or was formed {{in the production of}} lithium carbonate, chelating agents, resorcinol, ascorbic acid, silica pigments, nitric acid, and phenol.|$|E
25|$|The formyl group readily oxidizes to the {{corresponding}} carboxyl group (−COOH). The preferred oxidant in industry is oxygen or air. In the laboratory, popular oxidizing agents include potassium permanganate, nitric acid, chromium(VI) oxide, and <b>chromic</b> acid. The combination of manganese dioxide, cyanide, acetic acid and methanol will convert the aldehyde to a methyl ester.|$|E
25|$|Menthol reacts in {{many ways}} like a normal {{secondary}} alcohol. It is oxidised to menthone by oxidising agents such as <b>chromic</b> acid or dichromate, though under some conditions the oxidation can go further and break open the ring. Menthol is easily dehydrated to give mainly 3-menthene, {{by the action of}} 2% sulfuric acid. Phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) gives menthyl chloride.|$|E
25|$|The cell {{provided}} 1.9 volts. It proved {{popular with}} experimenters {{for many years}} due to its relatively high voltage; greater ability to produce a consistent current and lack of any fumes, but the relative fragility of its thin glass enclosure {{and the necessity of}} having to raise the zinc plate when the cell was not in use eventually saw it fall out of favour. The cell was also known as the 'chromic acid cell', but principally as the 'bichromate cell'. This latter name came from the practice of producing the <b>chromic</b> acid by adding sulphuric acid to potassium dichromate, even though the cell itself contained no dichromate.|$|E
25|$|In November 1953, Time {{magazine}} published evidence gathered variously by Kenneth Page Oakley, Sir Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark and Joseph Weiner {{proving that}} the Piltdown Man was a forgery and demonstrating that the fossil was {{a composite of}} three distinct species. It consisted of a human skull of medieval age, the 500-year-old lower jaw of an orangutan and chimpanzee fossil teeth. Someone had created the appearance of age by staining the bones with an iron solution and <b>chromic</b> acid. Microscopic examination revealed file-marks on the teeth, and it was deduced from this that someone had modified the teeth to a shape more suited to a human diet.|$|E
25|$|A {{wet cell}} battery has a liquid electrolyte. Other names are flooded cell, since the liquid covers all {{internal}} parts, or vented cell, since gases produced during operation can {{escape to the}} air. Wet cells were a precursor to dry cells and are commonly used as a learning tool for electrochemistry. They can be built with common laboratory supplies, such as beakers, for demonstrations of how electrochemical cells work. A particular type of wet cell known as a concentration cell is important in understanding corrosion. Wet cells may be primary cells (non-rechargeable) or secondary cells (rechargeable). Originally, all practical primary batteries such as the Daniell cell were built as open-top glass jar wet cells. Other primary wet cells are the Leclanche cell, Grove cell, Bunsen cell, <b>Chromic</b> acid cell, Clark cell, and Weston cell. The Leclanche cell chemistry was adapted to the first dry cells. Wet cells are still used in automobile batteries and in industry for standby power for switchgear, telecommunication or large uninterruptible power supplies, but in many places batteries with gel cells have been used instead. These applications commonly use lead–acid or nickel–cadmium cells.|$|E
25|$|According to {{preliminary}} observations {{two different}} subunits {{should be separated}} and both communities {{should be regarded as}} sub-associations within a united community. Apart from the subunit within Peucedano-Pinetum heldreichii M. Jank with notable altimediterranean Dinaric dry mountainous grassland and xerophytic tall herb taxa (Peucedanum longifolium, Senecio thapsoides ssp. visianianus and Juniperus nana (now a synonym of Juniperus communis var. saxatilis Pallas)) on not - too - shallow rendzic leptosols at the bases of higher cliffs, there is in depressions with deep <b>chromic</b> luvic cambisols a mesophytic tall herb community with numerous humidity indicators within Seslerion robustae where Iris orjenii forms a community of its own with respect to its spectrum of diagnostic species as well as its physiognomic structure. Associated species are Heracleum sphondylium, Lilium martagon var. cattaniae and Asphodelus albus. The appearance of Paeonia daurica Andrews (syn. Paeonia mascula subsp. triternata Boiss.), as observed at the latter community and nearby scattered individuals of Betula pendula and Acer heldreichii, underline that specially this part of Mt. Orjen belongs to the transitional oromediterranean type where the orophytic vegetation contains mixtures of submediterranean and temperate chorological elements.|$|E
500|$|<b>Chromic</b> acid has the {{hypothetical}} formula [...] It is a vaguely described chemical, despite many well-defined {{chromates and dichromates}} being known. [...] The dark red chromium(VI) oxide , the acid anhydride of <b>chromic</b> acid, is sold industrially as [...] "chromic acid". It can be produced by mixing sulfuric acid with dichromate, and is a strong oxidizing agent.|$|E
500|$|Elemental boron is {{rare and}} poorly studied because the pure {{material}} {{is extremely difficult}} to prepare. Most studies of [...] "boron" [...] involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide, hot concentrated nitric acid, hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and <b>chromic</b> acids.|$|E
500|$|<b>Chromic</b> acid is a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory glassware of any trace of organic compounds. It is prepared by dissolving potassium dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then used to wash the apparatus. Sodium dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (50 g/L versus 200 g/L respectively). The use of dichromate cleaning solutions is now phased out due to the high toxicity and environmental concerns. Modern cleaning solutions are highly effective and chromium free.|$|E

2500|$|Chromium(III) {{chloride}} (also called <b>chromic</b> chloride) describes any {{of several}} compounds of with the formula CrCl3(H2O)x, where x can be 0, 5, and 6. The anhydrous compound with the formula CrCl3 is a violet solid. [...] The {{most common form}} of the trichloride is the dark green [...] "hexahydrate", CrCl3.6H2O. [...] Chromium chloride finds [...] uses as catalysts and as precursors to dyes for wool.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new species}} [...] is {{restricted}} to humid <b>chromic</b> luvic cambisols in the high altimediterranean level. The eu- to supramediterranean I. pseudopallida in contrast is widespread on bare limestones or initial rendzic leptosols (Rendzina) {{in a variety of}} mediterranean and submediterranean alliances of coastal karst plains, on megacliffs in the Ephedero-Cyxthoselinetum palmoidis alliance and on montane limestone escarpments in the Campanula-Moltkeetum petaeae H-Iċ alliance.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, but not commercially significant, is the {{so-called}} [...] "Henkel process" [...] or [...] "Raecke process", named after the company and patent holder, respectively. This process involves the rearrangement of phthalic acid to terephthalic acid via the corresponding potassium salts. Terephthalic acid can be prepared in the laboratory by oxidizing various para-disubstituted derivatives of benzene, including caraway oil or a mixture of cymene and cuminol with <b>chromic</b> acid.|$|E
2500|$|The D {{ring was}} {{synthesized}} starting from chiral (S)-camphor 8 which was converted to oxime 9 (oxidation / hydroxylamine [...] ), then to amide 10 (hydrolysis), lactam 11 (acid-amide condensation), N-nitroso compound 12, diazo compound 13 and to cyclopentene 14 (carbene, methyl group migration). Reduction (LiAlH4) gave alcohol 15, oxidation (<b>chromic</b> acid) gave aldehyde 16, a Wittig reaction with carbomethoxymethylenetriphenylphosphorane gave trans-alkene 17 and hydrolysis gave carboxylic acid 18.|$|E
2500|$|The {{starting}} material for ring B was 3-methyl-4-oxo-2-pentenoic acid 46 which was reacted with butadiene in a Diels-Alder reaction (stannic chloride) to racemic cyclohexene 47. This reaction is stereospecific with the methyl {{group and the}} carboxylic acid group ending up in a cis relationship. [...] Chiral resolution using alpha-phenylethylamine gave optically active 47. Oxidation of the double bond with <b>chromic</b> acid gave the triacid 48 as an intermediate which gave dilactone 49 in two intramolecular esterifications. An Arndt–Eistert reaction elongated the carboxylic acid chain in 50, reaction with ammonia gave lactam 51 and reaction with phosphorus pentasulfide give thiolactam 52.|$|E
2500|$|The German {{scientist}} Johann Christian Poggendorff {{overcame the}} problems with separating the electrolyte and the depolariser using a porous earthenware pot in 1842. [...] In the Poggendorff cell, sometimes called Grenet Cell due to the works of Eugene Grenet around 1859, the electrolyte was dilute sulphuric acid and the depolariser was <b>chromic</b> acid. The two acids were physically mixed together eliminating the porous pot. The positive electrode (cathode) was two carbon plates, with a zinc plate (negative or anode) positioned between them. Because of the tendency of the acid mixture to react with the zinc, a mechanism was provided to raise the zinc electrode clear of the acids.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oxidation}} of aniline {{has been}} heavily investigated, and {{can result in}} reactions localized at nitrogen or more commonly results {{in the formation of}} new C-N bonds. In alkaline solution, azobenzene results, whereas arsenic acid produces the violet-coloring matter violaniline. <b>Chromic</b> acid converts it into quinone, whereas chlorates, in the presence of certain metallic salts (especially of vanadium), give aniline black. Hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate give chloranil. Potassium permanganate in neutral solution oxidizes it to nitrobenzene, in alkaline solution to azobenzene, ammonia and oxalic acid, in acid solution to aniline black. Hypochlorous acid gives 4-aminophenol and para-amino diphenylamine. [...] Oxidation with persulfate affords a variety of polyanilines compounds. These polymers exhibit rich redox and acid-base properties.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to upgrades to the JIM design, other {{variations of the}} original suit were constructed.

2500|$|Expanded {{graphite}} {{is made by}} immersing natural {{flake graphite}} in a bath of <b>chromic</b> acid, then concentrated sulfuric acid, which forces the crystal lattice planes apart, thus expanding the graphite. The expanded graphite {{can be used to}} make graphite foil or used directly as [...] "hot top" [...] compound to insulate molten metal in a ladle or red-hot steel ingots and decrease heat loss, or as firestops fitted around a fire door or in sheet metal collars surrounding plastic pipe (during a fire, the graphite expands and chars to resist fire penetration and spread), or to make high-performance gasket material for high-temperature use. After being made into graphite foil, the foil is machined and assembled into the bipolar plates in fuel cells.|$|E
2500|$|Aromaticity can {{be found}} in {{individual}} ions which satisfy Hückel's rule, which can be accessed by simple redox or acid-base reactions.
