40|$|Summary. -The {{incidence}} of tumours ectopically producing the human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> was studied {{in patients with}} breast cancer. Specific radioimmuno-assay of subunits of HCG was utilized. Nine out of 65 patients with carcinoma of breast showed the presence of circulating HCG. Patients with other pathological conditions of breast tissue did not show any evidence of circulating HCG. OBSERVATIONS indicating ectopic production of the gonadotrophins {{have been made in}} the past. Fusco and Rosen (1966) measured increased levels of gonadotrophins in the urine of 4 patients with advanced bronchogenic carcinoma. They also showed the presence of gonadotrophins in the tumour tissue. Since then a number of observations on gonadotrophin production in men having bronchogeni...|$|R

Having tried the other mammalian hormones available, {{we wish to}} record the reactions of catfish not only to them {{but also to the}} same hormones used in combination with a threshold dose (vide infra) of catfish pituitary gland. In discussing the action of mammalian hormones, Hoar 2 stated that “… fish are so unresponsive to many mammalian (and bird) preparations that it is generally impractical to use them. The fish culturist or physiologist who wishes to hasten gonad development in fish is advised to use fish pituitaries”.

50|$|Patients with KS {{and other}} forms of CHH are almost {{invariably}} born with normal sexual differentiation; i.e., they are physically male or female. This is due to the human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) produced by placenta at approximately 12 to 20 weeks gestation (pregnancy) which is normally unaffected by having KS or CHH.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} morning {{sickness}} is unknown {{but may be}} related to changing levels of the hormone human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin.</b> Some have proposed that it may be useful from an evolutionary point of view.

50|$|With {{the help}} of {{monoclonal}} antibodies, tissues and organs can be classified based on their expression of certain defined markers, which reflect tissue or cellular genesis. Prostate specific antigen, placental alkaline phosphatase, human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> α-fetoprotein and others are organ-associated antigens {{and the production of}} monoclonal antibodies against these antigens helps in determining the nature of a primary tumor.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a 5 year review of {{requests}} pattern for assay of four tumour markers: Prostate specific antigen, (PSA), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> (HCG) and Alpha feto protein (AFP). All plasma samples for the markers from February 1998 – December 2002 were processed weekly by immuno-radiometric assay method. Biodata from request form were collated and analyzed. A total of 4, 249 requests were received for the period under review which showed an increase yearly from inception to {{the last year of}} review. Requests for PSA assay were the most common, 2, 258 (53. 1 %). A total of 845 tests (19. 89 %) were recorded for AFP. This was followed by CEA, 745 tests (17. 53 %) and HCG, 401 (9. 44 %), indicating suspicion of malignancies of colorectal region and gestational trophoblastic diseases, respectively.

40|$|The {{changes in}} uterine artery blood flow in women {{undergoing}} in-vitro fertilization cycles were studied throughout stimulation after gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) desensitization. The data obtained {{showed that the}} uterine vascularity was related to hormonal changes. The GnRH agonist effect was seen only after {{the third week of}} administration, and the uterine perfusion was significantly (P = 0. 002) improved by the oestradiol secretion. Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> increased the resistance index (RI) significantly (P = 0. 0001) for a period of 48 h. Then the progesterone secretion modified the curve with a significant improvement in the uterine blood flow (P = 0. 03). Comparison of the RI value 2 days before human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) commencement, in patients with and without pregnancy, showed a higher RI in patients who did not conceive but no difference was observed on the day of embryo transfer. The pregnancy rates were similar whatever the range of the RI observed. The data available so far suggest that haemodynamic parameters alone, detected by Doppler sonography, do not provide full information on endometrial receptivity on the day of embryo transfer. A resistance index > 0. 79 before HMG commencement seems to indicate poor uterine vascularity and may necessitate an increase in the HMG doses to prevent endometrial immaturity. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Angiogenesis is {{a process}} {{regulated}} by various angiogenic and anti-angioenic factors. To study the regulation of angiogenesis in human endometrium during the implantation window, we compared the expression of Angiopoietin 1 (Ang- 1), Angiopoietin 2 (Ang- 2) and VEGF mRNA and protein expression in the peri-implantation endometrium of patients between natural and stimulated cycles in assisted reproduction cycles. Methods: Human endometrial biopsies were collected 7 days after human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophins</b> injection in stimulated cycles or after leutinizing hormone surge in natural cycles. Ang- 1, Ang- 2 and VEGF mRNA and protein expression were compared in natural cycles (N), stimulated cycles with peak serum E 2 < 20, 000 pmol/L (moderate responders, M) and ≥ 20 000 pmol/ L (excessive responders, H) using real time PCR and Western blot analysis. Results: The expression of Ang- 1 mRNA in endometrial tissue from Groups M and H was significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than that of Group N. However, Group H had significantly higher Ang- 2 (P= 0. 002) and VEGF (P< 0. 05) mRNA expressions than that in Group M and N. Ang- 1 to Ang- 2 ratio was significantly lower in Groups M and H when compared to Group N, while Ang- 2 to VEGF ratio was significantly higher in Group H than in Groups M and N (P= 0. 006). Negative correlation was found between Ang- 1 to Ang- 2 mRNA ratio and serum estrogen level (P= 0. 001). Using Western blot analysis, Ang- 1 was down-regulated while Ang- 2 was up-regulated in Group H. No {{significant difference was found}} in VEGF protein expression among the three groups. Conclusion: The decreased Ang- 1 to Ang- 2 ratio and increased Ang- 2 to VEGF ratio in excessive responder suggested dys-regulation of angiogenesis during perimplantation period may affect normal endometrial development leading to lower implantation and pregnancy rate in these patients...|$|R
50|$|Human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) is {{sometimes}} used to stimulate testosterone production {{in men and}} ovulation induction in women. For men it acts {{in the same way}} as LH; stimulating the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone. Common trade names for hCG products include Pregnyl, Follutein, Profasi, or Choragon.

50|$|Ganirelix {{is used as}} a {{fertility}} treatment {{drug for}} women. Specifically, it is used to prevent premature ovulation in women undergoing fertility treatment involving ovarian hyperstimulation that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs.

Ganirelix prevents ovulation until it is triggered by injecting human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG).|$|E
50|$|Embryo {{cryopreservation}} {{is generally}} performed {{as a component}} of in vitro fertilization (which generally also includes ovarian hyperstimulation, egg retrieval and embryo transfer). The ovarian hyperstimulation is preferably done by using a GnRH agonist rather than human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) for final oocyte maturation, since it decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate (in contrast to fresh cycles where usage of GnRH agonist has a lower live birth rate).|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} notable {{scientists}} conducted {{research at the}} Institute of Animal Genetics, including physiologist John Scott Haldane, zoologist Lancelot Hogben and evolutionary biologist Julian Huxley. It was there that Wiesner built upon the work of Zondek and Aschheim by examining the production and role of hormones during fertilization and pregnancy. Zondek and Aschheim had thought that the hormone <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> was produced by the pituitary gland. But the research conducted at the Edinburgh University-based Institute for Animal Genetics proved that it is secreted by the placenta.|$|E
50|$|Priming is {{the process}} by which the oocytes are primed with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) before retrieval. hCG is {{important}} in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This results in an expanding or dispersed pattern of the cumulus oophorus around the egg cell, facilitating its identification within follicular fluid.This leads to improved maturation and quality of the oocytes. However, the evidence of a clinical effect of hCG priming is still lacking. When IVM was initially introduced, successful pregnancies were low, leading to the use of ovary priming.|$|E

It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.|$|E
50|$|Hydatidiform moles {{should be}} treated by {{evacuating}} the uterus by uterine suction or by surgical curettage {{as soon as possible}} after diagnosis, {{in order to avoid the}} risks of choriocarcinoma. Patients are followed up until their serum human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG) level has fallen to an undetectable level. Invasive or metastatic moles (cancer) may require chemotherapy and often respond well to methotrexate. As they contain paternal antigens, the response to treatment is nearly 100%. Patients are advised not to conceive for half a year after hCG levels have normalized. The chances of having another molar pregnancy are approximately 1%.|$|E
50|$|The egg {{retrieval}} process for oocyte cryopreservation {{is the same}} as that for in vitro fertilization. This includes one to several weeks of hormone injections that stimulate ovaries to ripen multiple eggs. When the eggs are mature, final maturation induction is performed, preferably by using a GnRH agonist rather than human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> (hCG), since it decreases the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with no evidence of a difference in live birth rate (in contrast to fresh cycles where usage of GnRH agonist has a lower live birth rate). The eggs are subsequently removed from the body by transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The procedure is usually conducted under sedation. The eggs are immediately frozen.|$|E

50|$|About 30 {{percent of}} human conceptions do not {{progress}} to full term (22 percent before becoming clinical pregnancies) and {{this creates a}} second arena for conflict between {{the mother and the}} fetus, because the fetus will have a lower quality cut off point for spontaneous abortion than the mother. The mother's quality cut-off point should also decline as she nears the end of her reproductive life and it may be significant that the offspring of older mothers have a higher incidence of genetic defects. Initially, the maintenance of pregnancy is controlled by the maternal hormone progesterone, but in later stages it is controlled by the fetal human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> released into the maternal bloodstream, which causes the release of maternal progesterone. There is also conflict over blood supply to the placenta, with the fetus being prepared to demand a larger blood supply than is optimal for the mother (or even for itself, since high birth weight is a risk factor). This results in hypertension and, significantly, high birth weight is positively correlated with maternal blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} aimed at establishing a range of plasma concentrations of the beta subunit of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> that might predict ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer. From May 1984 to February 1986, 161 consecutive pregnancies at the Monash University in vitro fertilisation unit were analysed by determining plasma beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentrations between two and 10 weeks after oocyte collection. Eighty eight ongoing singleton pregnancies, 25 multiple pregnancies, 27 first trimester spontaneous abortions, 12 anembryonic pregnancies, and nine ectopic pregnancies resulted from these conception cycles. When compared with values for ongoing singleton pregnancies two weeks after oocyte collection plasma beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentrations in ectopic pregnancies were significantly lower (p less than 0. 05; Wilcoxon rank sum test). Two weeks after oocyte collection all plasma beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentrations in the set of ectopic pregnancies were below 30. 6 IU/l, which corresponded to the lower quartile (25 th percentile) of beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentrations in ongoing singleton pregnancies. The beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentration corresponding to the lower quartile of ongoing singleton pregnancies at each week of gestation was used to derive the predictive value of various statistics in detecting ectopic pregnancy in patients after in vitro fertilisation. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a positive result, predictive value of a negative result, and efficiency of a single plasma beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentration in predicting ectopic pregnancy were 100 %, 68. 1 %, 16. 7 %, 100 %, and 70 %, respectively, two weeks after oocyte collection. These results suggest that a single determination of the plasma beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentration beginning 14 days after oocyte collection is clinically useful in predicting the outcome of pregnancy achieved by in vitro fertilisation. Ectopic pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation is more likely when beta human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> concentration is below the lower quartile of values in ongoing singleton pregnancies achieved by the technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of extending second-trimester maternal blood screening for Down syndrome {{so as to}} include screening for trisomy 18 was examined using stored maternal serum samples collected for neural tube-defect screening.

The median maternal serum concentration of alpha-fetoprotein, free alpha-subunit human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> free beta-subunit human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> intact human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> total estriol, unconjugated estriol, estradiol, human placental lactogen, and progesterone were lowered in those pregnancies affected by trisomy 18 when compared with unaffected pregnancies matched for racial origin, maternal age, gestational age, and sample-storage duration. At an estimated odds risk of 1 : 400, 83. 3 % of affected pregnancies were detected using an algorithm which combines the maternal age-related risk with the maternal serum concentrations of unconjugated estriol, free alpha-subunit human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> free beta-subunit human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin,</b> estradiol, and human placental lactogen.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the ability of}} a sensitive one step urine test to detect human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> in women with suspected complications of early pregnancy. DESIGN [...] Test on women presenting to accident and emergency department with gynaecological problems over six months. Results were validated using a quantitative assay for human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> in serum and urine. SETTING [...] Accident and emergency department and gynaecology wards of a university teaching hospital. SUBJECTS [...] 130 unselected women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Detection of human <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> by one step test, presence of ectopic pregnancy, and results of quantitative analysis of <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> in serum and urine. RESULTS [...] 79 women had a positive urine test result and 51 a negative result. All 12 women with ectopic pregnancy had a positive test result, although urinary concentration varied from 191 IU/l to 47, 800 IU/l. Only one woman, who had a faintly positive result, was found not to be pregnant on subsequent examination. The sensitivity and negative predictive values of the urine test were 100 % respectively. 33 women were sent home from the accident and emergency department with normal clinical findings after a negative urine test result. All these women had undetectable concentrations of <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> in matched samples of urine and serum. CONCLUSIONS [...] A simple, rapid one step test for <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotrophin</b> should be available for the initial evaluation of emergency gynaecological problems.
