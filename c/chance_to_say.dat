He was intimidated, forced to watch videos on cults and told his church was just the same. He said he was watched 24 hours a day. On every visit to the bathroom, he was accompanied by at least two men. Every day, Ross argued with Scott about matters of religion, without giving him a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything in return, often tapping him or hitting him on the head to underscore his points while Scott was being restrained or closely watched. Scott was told that he would only regain his liberty once the deprogramming had been concluded successfully and he had given up his beliefs.|$|E

Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why.

Rose breaks down in tears and tells the Doctor that she loves him, and he responds, [...] "Quite right, too, and, I suppose, if {{this is my last}} <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it: Rose Tyler—"; before the Doctor can finish his reply, the breach seals and the Doctor's image disappears. In the TARDIS, tears run down the Doctor's cheeks as he slowly regains his composure and sets a course. As he gets back to piloting the TARDIS, he notices a mysterious woman in a wedding dress standing in the TARDIS console room. With the Doctor shocked and confused, the mysterious bride angrily demands to know where she is, leading to the events of [...] "The Runaway Bride".|$|E

500|$|Tom Hall {{chose the}} Quake engine for Anachronox; its {{developer}} John Carmack took interest {{in its use}} for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the id Tech 2 engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for 32-bit color, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in Lightwave; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited Chrono Trigger as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the Final Fantasy series and Ultima III. As in Chrono Trigger, battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, [...] "if there's a dragon guarding a door, I want the <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where the hell was that?!?'" [...] The team expanded the Final Fantasy-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for Anachronox in mid-2000: [...] "In movies, some inspirational people are Spielberg, Hitchcock, George Roy Hill, Rob Reiner, and now Sam Mendes. Also {{a big fan of}} Chuck Jones, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: Gateway, Ender's Game, Snow Crash, Hitchhiker's, so many more. Games: Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), Ape Escape (buy it now), Mario, Ultima III, Wizardry I, oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" [...] Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in Chrono Trigger in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.|$|E

The Expedition gives Jeannie a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye; Rodney has already regressed to a childlike state and all attempts at medical intervention have failed. Jennifer Keller explains that McKay became infected with the Second Childhood parasite at some point {{over the past two}} weeks, and that she misinterpreted the first symptoms when they appeared after a mission to M44-5YN. The subsequent deterioration of McKay's mind is shown through a series of flashbacks and self-made video recordings. Keller blames herself for not catching the disease sooner, but refuses to give up even as McKay has only a few days left to live. Ronon Dex proposes an alternative: a shrine on the planet Talus that grants those afflicted with the Second Childhood a single day of mental clarity, followed by a quick death. Jeannie overrules Keller's wishes and asks that McKay be brought to the planet. Despite the fact that the planet has become a Wraith stronghold, Richard Woolsey reluctantly approves the mission.|$|E
500|$|The novella Mathilda, {{written by}} Mary Shelley in 1820, {{contains}} similarities to the myth and mentions Myrrha.

Then he tells her that he is in love with her, and, when she refuses him, he commits suicide. In chapter 4, Mathilda makes a direct allusion: [...] "I <b>chanced</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I thought Myrrha the best of Alfieri's tragedies." [...] Audra Dibert Himes, in an essay entitled [...] "Knew shame, and knew desire", notes a more subtle reference to Myrrha: Mathilda spends the last night before her father’s arrival in the woods, but as she returns home the next morning the trees seemingly attempt to encompass her. Himes suggests that the trees {{can be seen as a}} parallel to Ovid’s metamorphosed Myrrha.|$|R

2500|$|The {{turning point}} in Arthur's career came when she was chosen by Frank Capra to star in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Capra had spotted her in a daily rush from the film Whirlpool in 1934 and {{convinced}} Cohn to have Columbia Studios sign her for his next film as a tough newspaperwoman {{who falls in love}} with a country bumpkin millionaire. Even though several colleagues later recalled that Arthur was troubled by extreme stage fright during production, Mr. Deeds was critically acclaimed and propelled her to international stardom. In 1936 alone, she earned $119,000, more than the President of the United States and baseball player Lou Gehrig. With fame also came media attention, something Arthur greatly disliked. She did not attend any social gatherings, such as formal parties in Hollywood, and acted difficult when having to work with an interviewer. She was named the American Greta Garbo – who was also known for her reclusive life – and magazine Movie Classic wrote of her in 1937: [...] "With Garbo talking right out loud in interviews, receiving the press and even welcoming an occasional <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> her say in the public prints, the palm for elusiveness among screen stars now goes to Jean Arthur." ...|$|E
