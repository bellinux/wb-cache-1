40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{deal with}} a {{portfolio}} optimization model involving fuzzy random variabels. Portfolio optimization is an important research field in modern finance. We consider the problem to maximize the the degree of both possibility and necessity that the objective function values satisfy the fuzzy goals. Using the possibility and necessity-based model, we reformulate the problem as a linear programming problem. In order to find the optimum solution, we propose two-level linear programming model to calculate the upper bound and lower bound of the objective function value separately. The lower bound <b>calculates</b> <b>by</b> historical data and the upper bound <b>calculates</b> <b>by</b> new information of stock market which is received during the constant time. Finally, we provide a numerical example to illustrate the proposed model...|$|R

2500|$|A Baraita {{taught that}} [...] “Aaron {{and his sons}} shall set it in order, to burn from evening to morning,” means that God {{instructed}} them to provide the Menorah with the requisite amount of oil {{so that it could}} burn from evening to morning.. And the Sages calculated that a half-log of oil (roughly 5 ounces) would burn from evening to morning. The Gemara reported that some said that they <b>calculated</b> this <b>by</b> reducing the original quantity of oil, first filling each lamp with a large quantity of oil and on finding in the morning that there was still oil in the lamp, gradually reducing the quantity until they arrived at a half-log. [...] Others said that they <b>calculated</b> it <b>by</b> increasing it, first filling the lamp with a small quantity of oil and the next evening increasing the quantity of oil until they arrived at the standard of the half-log. [...] Those who said that they <b>calculated</b> it <b>by</b> increasing the quantity of oil said that the Torah has consideration for the Israelites' resources and to <b>calculate</b> <b>by</b> using the larger quantity of oil in the first instance wasted the oil that was still in the lamp in the morning. [...] And those who said that they <b>calculated</b> it <b>by</b> reducing it said that there was no stinting in the place of wealth, the Sanctuary..|$|R
