500|$|... "The Edge of Glory" [...] was {{nominated}} {{in the category}} for Song of the Year at the 38th People's Choice Awards. At the end of 2011, Slant Magazine listed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] as the eighth best song of the year, with Ed Gonzalez from the website commenting that the song is [...] "a study in radical contrast that, once you sift aside its deliberately dated effects {{and the legacy of}} the late Clarence Clemons, is deep down an incredibly delicate ballad. Yes, everyone expects Gaga to make her confessions on the dance floor, but who knew she <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> shouts whisper?" [...] It was placed at the same rank by Billboard, and at position seven by Rolling Stone. In September 2013, the saxophone solo ranked number two on VH1's list of the 15 Greatest Guest Solos in Rock History.|$|E

500|$|Belldandy is {{exceptionally}} kind-hearted, {{even for}} a goddess. She can easily sense other people's emotions and tries her best to be empathetic to all those around her, displaying a combination of [...] "serene beauty and acceptance". She rarely holds a grudge and is always willing to forgive anyone who does injury to her...unless Keiichi is involved of course. Even though Belldandy tries her best to be as kind as possible, it is revealed that at times she can become very insecure and sad, especially when she is confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi {{in one way or}} another. This aspect of her character provides one of the biggest plot points in the Ah! My Goddess movie: Belldandy's possessiveness of Keiichi <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> an easy target for manipulation or even brainwashing, if the right buttons were pressed; her jealousy of Morgan Le Fay was what allowed Celestin, her teacher, to lure Belldandy into his plans.|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{wrote that}} Sheila {{believed}} the devil {{had given her}} the power to project evil onto others, and that she <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> sons have sex and cause violence with her. She called them the [...] "devil's children", the phrase June had used of Sheila, and said she believed she was capable of murdering them or of getting them to kill others. She spoke about suicide, although the court heard that Ferguson did not regard her as a suicide risk. She was discharged in September 1983. He continued treating her as an outpatient with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug. She was re-admitted to St Andrew's in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a psychotic episode in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her. She was discharged just under four weeks later, and as an outpatient received a monthly injection of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that has a sedative effect. From that point, the twins lived {{all or most of}} the time with Colin in Kilburn. According to Bamber, the family discussed placing the boys in daytime foster care over dinner {{on the night of the}} murders, with little response from Sheila.|$|E
500|$|Babe {{was billed}} as [...] "a no-nonsense, bustling busybody with a big heart", who is also both shrewd and tough under her bubbly personality. Badland {{described}} Babe as [...] "quite a private person" [...] that would [...] "protect her family", who she was [...] "proud" [...] to be in contact with again. She said she that Babe enjoys keeping [...] "control in a social way" [...] and that despite having a [...] "front of being jolly", Babe could also get [...] "very angry" [...] and be [...] "ruthless". She said that Babe {{is the kind of}} person who, when someone crosses her, just does and says the things that other people would not think of doing or saying until it is too late, and though she had tried to find trigger points that influence Babe's vengefulness, had realised that Babe was [...] "wicked" [...] just [...] "for the joy of it". Rebecca Scroggs, who plays Tosh Mackintosh, described Babe as [...] "a lovely woman" [...] with a darker side that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> the [...] "most fearsome Carter of all". Badland also revealed that she never wanted Babe to be [...] "modified into a more ordinary person" [...] because she [...] "relished" [...] the character.|$|E

500|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Joseph {{dropped out}} of University after getting the part of Cassie Barsby in the soap opera Paradise Beach. Like many of the cast, she had no formal acting training, though she turned this to her {{advantage}} with [...] "exuberance and energy". Joseph gained acting experience and friendships with Raelee Hill, Megan Connolly, and Isla Fisher, though the series was cancelled after only 18 months. After Paradise Beach ended, she began appearing in the Nine Network variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday. Joseph had no contract with Nine, and was making the appearances {{as a favor to}} her friend, host Daryl Somers. Nine Network executives wanted to make her a regular on the show and began using her in publicity material. However, rival network Seven offered her a contract to co-host Gladiators before Nine <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> Hey Hey contract permanent. Her defection to Seven in 1995 caused a small scandal. She described hosting Gladiators as [...] "tough and scary" [...] on account of the live audience. She appeared for three seasons and some international specials before taking the role of Joanne Brennan in Home and Away {{in an effort to get}} away from presenting. The character, a secretary who dealt drugs to school children, appeared from 1995 to 1996. She left the soap with the possibility of returning to the character later. Alongside her role in Home and Away, she appeared in a play with Geoffrey Hughes.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Navy had {{not been}} keen to {{sacrifice}} its advantage in steam ships of the line, but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect, particularly speed. A fast ship would {{have the advantage of}} being able to choose a range of engagement which <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> invulnerable to enemy fire. The British specification was more a large, powerful frigate than a ship-of-the-line. The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel, which had to be built from iron. The result was the construction of two s; [...] and [...] The ships had a successful design, though there were necessarily compromises between 'sea-keeping', strategic range and armor protection; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire, and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14.3knots (26.5km/h). Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full iron-armor protection along the waterline and the battery itself. [...] Warrior and Black Prince (but also the smaller Defence and Resistance) were obliged to concentrate their armor in a central [...] "citadel" [...] or [...] "armoured box", leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected. [...] The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{publications}} Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture and Value War: Public Opinion and the Politics of Gay Rights, {{it was the}} controversial lesbian outing of the main character (played by Ellen DeGeneres) in the sitcom Ellen in 1997 that {{paved the way for}} Patty's coming-out in this episode, as well as for many other gay characters on other television shows. In his book Queers in American Popular Culture, Jim Elledge noted that unlike many episodes of The Simpsons that go through a situation and then everything returns to normal during the ending, this one does not. He commented that the staff of the show could have made Patty heterosexual again {{at the end of the}} episode and leave it how it was before by having her marry Leslie. Instead, they ended it in a way that could potentially be experienced as distasteful to the heteronormative audience by having Patty exclaim [...] "Hell no! I like girls!" [...] to Leslie's marriage proposal. The author also noted that it is possible the Simpsons staff chose Patty to come out as gay instead of a male character because lesbians were [...] "traditionally considered more acceptable" [...] on television. She did, however, not [...] "adhere to the eroticized male lesbian fantasy or fit into the loveable, asexual guise of the comedy lesbian" [...] that had previously been seen on shows such as Ellen. Instead, Patty is [...] "rude, crude, and not ashamed of declaring her sexual preferences", and this <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> unpalatable to some viewers according to Elledge.|$|E

500|$|Set {{prior to}} most of the film's action, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is the second proper song in The Little Mermaid, and takes place in Ariel's grotto before she meets Eric. A {{character}} song used to progress the plot, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resembles a monologue in which Ariel expresses her desire {{to become part of the}} human world while reveling in her expansive collection of discarded human items and artifacts. Singing about her interest in exploring the human world and learning as much as she can about it, Ariel performs the ballad while gazing up towards the surface longingly, wishing that she could be human herself and live among other humans. [...] "Part of Your World" [...] reveals that Ariel feels repressed and unhappy in her current environment despite her belongings and royal lineage, [...] "want to be a part of something else." [...] A wind-up toy resembling a woman dancing is used to demonstrate that Ariel would much rather be like her. The character also sings the line [...] "What’s a fire and why does it ... What’s the word? Burn!” to Georges de La Tour's painting Magdalene with the Smoking Flame to indicate a similar sentiment. Offering character development, the song explores and voices the inner goings-on of Ariel's mind. Ariel's craving for adventure makes it difficult for the character to enjoy her current surroundings while knowing there is much left for her to explore, causing her to grow increasingly despondent; [...] "change", a non-physical concept that can not be purchased or stolen, is the only thing that <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> truly happy. In the meantime, Ariel uses material belongings to fill the void of what is missing from her life, attempting to live among humans vicariously via what she has salvaged from sunken ships. Voicing her frustration over being confined to the ocean, Ariel is not shy about what she wants, choosing to belt out her desires instead. The Animated Movie Guide author Jerry Beck wrote that the song [...] "capture's Ariel's yearning so intensely that when she extends her hand toward the surface we long to reach out with her", ending with Ariel gesturing while sighing longingly and descending back down to the ocean floor.|$|E

2500|$|The {{award of}} Silver Fish existed from the {{beginning}} of the Guiding movement. It is mentioned in the November 1909 edition of the Boy Scout Headquarters Gazette in [...] "The Scheme for 'Girl Guides'". Here a girl must pass seventeen specified efficiency badges. However, in Pamphlet A: Baden-Powell Girl Guides, a Suggestion for Character Training for Girls, also published in 1909, twenty efficiency badges were needed to obtain the Silver Fish. This was later reduced to fifteen and, additionally, good all round work was required. The award was considered a sign of a girl 'who <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> way upstream'.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} Woman Disputed (1928) was released, the talking film {{revolution}} had begun, and Talmadge began taking voice lessons in preparation. She worked diligently with voice coaches {{for over a}} year so she <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> sound debut. Her first talkie, New York Nights (1929), showed that she could speak and act acceptably in talkies. [...] While her performance was considered to be good, the film was not. Talmadge next took on the role of Madame du Barry in the 1930 film Du Barry, Woman of Passion. With incompetent direction and Talmadge's inexperience at a role requiring very demanding vocal acting, the film was a failure, in spite of the elaborate sets by William Cameron Menzies.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Vanity Fair {{was found}} liable {{in a lawsuit}} brought in the UK by film {{director}} Roman Polanski, who claimed the magazine had libelled him {{in an article published}} in 2002, and written by A. E. Hotchner. [...] The article recounted a claim by Lewis H. Lapham, editor of Harper's, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was travelling to the funeral of his wife, Sharon Tate, in August 1969, claiming that he <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> [...] "the next Sharon Tate". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited were he to enter the United Kingdom. The trial started on July 18, 2005, and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimonies of Mia Farrow and others, it was proved that the alleged scene at the famous New York restaurant Elaine's could not possibly have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian then-model disputed the accounts that he had claimed {{to be able to make}} her [...] "the next Sharon Tate".|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{revealed}} in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince that young Merope Gaunt made {{efforts to get}} as close to Tom as she could, peering {{at him through the}} windows and bushes at every opportunity. Morfin noticed his sister's affection for Tom, and hexed him as he rode by, covering him in hives. This breach of wizarding law, and the ensuing violent struggle with Ministry of Magic officials, led to Marvolo and Morfin being imprisoned in Azkaban. As surmised by Dumbledore, once Merope was alone and no longer dominated by her father, she <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>her</b> move for Tom. She offered Tom a drink laced with a love potion as he rode by one day without his attractive companion, Cecilia. He became infatuated with Merope and they eloped. Within three months of the marriage, Merope became pregnant. Merope decided to stop giving Tom the love potion, having come to the belief such enchantment of a man was tantamount to slavery. She also revealed her witch status to Tom, believing either that he {{had fallen in love with}} her on his own or he would at least stay for their unborn child. She was wrong, and Tom quickly left his pregnant wife and went home to his parents, claiming to have been [...] "hoodwinked" [...] and tricked into marrying Merope. Tom Marvolo Riddle, their son, was born on 31 December 1926 and was left to grow up in an orphanage, as Merope had died soon after giving birth.|$|E
