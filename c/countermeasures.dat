5|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} throughout the game, two additional ships become available for use. Each of the game's three ships offers a different balance of speed, weapons, and maneuverability. Within the levels, the player may collect power-ups that enhance the ship's weaponry. Weapons are categorized into three different types: primary weapons, secondary weapons, and <b>countermeasures.</b> Primary weapons {{range from a}} variety of laser weapons to the Plasma Cannon and the Napalm Cannon, which projects a stream of burning fuel. Secondary weapons include different types of missiles, while <b>countermeasures</b> range from proximity mines to portable turrets. Most primary weapons consume energy in different rate, but some, such as the Napalm Cannon, use their own type of ammunition. In contrast, all secondary weapons and <b>countermeasures</b> require their own ammunition suppliers.|$|E

5|$|Allied {{planners}} {{proposed that}} small boats, towing large radar reflecting balloons (code named Filbert) and carrying both Moonshine jamming and standard wireless equipment (for transmitting fake traffic), would advance toward the French coast {{under a cloud}} of Window.

A third deceptive force, Operation Big Drum, would use radar <b>countermeasures</b> on the western flank of the true invasion fleet. This operation was intended to lend confusion as to the extent of the landings in Normandy.|$|E

40|$|This paper mainly {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} how to effectively inhibit viral spread by means of dynamic <b>countermeasure.</b> To this end, a controlled node-level model with nonlinear infection and <b>countermeasure</b> rates is established.

Specifically, the existence of an optimal dynamic <b>countermeasure</b> scheme and the corresponding optimality system are shown theoretically. Finally, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results, from which it is found that (1) the proposed optimal strategy can achieve a low level of infections at a low cost and (2) adjusting nonlinear infection and <b>countermeasure</b> rates and tradeoff factor can be conductive to the containment of virus propagation with less cost...|$|R

30|$|In this work, a {{randomly}} {{switching controller}} is proposed as a <b>countermeasure</b> for the Passive System Identification attack [12], {{in case of}} failure of other conventional security mechanisms – such as encryption, network segmentation and firewall policies. The simulations demonstrate that this <b>countermeasure</b> is capable to mitigate the mentioned attack, making the model obtained by the attacker imprecise and ambiguous. At the same time, the simulations demonstrate that {{the performance of the}} proposed <b>countermeasure</b> is satisfactory from the control perspective. Considering the control aspects, in general, the proposed <b>countermeasure</b> presents a performance similar to the performance of a non-switching controller, with an increase in the system’s settling time. Therefore, when deciding for using this <b>countermeasure,</b> it must be considered the existence of a tradeoff between mitigate the identification attack and increase the settling time of the system – which, depending on the plant, is not necessarily a drawback.|$|R
