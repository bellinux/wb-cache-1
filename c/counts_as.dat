5|$|There are {{competing}} claims {{for the title}} of first motorcycle, depending on whether a steam motorcycle, or only one with an internal combustion engine, <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> a true motorcycle, and the uncertainty as to which of the two earliest steam motorcycles, the Roper or the Michaux-Perreaux, was built first.|$|E
5|$|Female Murray cod, upon first {{reaching}} sexual maturity, have egg {{counts of}} no more than 10,000. Very large female Murray cod can have egg <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> high as 80,000–90,000, although a recent, very large 33-kg specimen yielded an egg count of 110,000 viable eggs. Egg counts in female Murray cod of all sizes are relatively low compared to many fish species.|$|E

5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an isogonal arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
5|$|Christian Hedemann (1852–1932) <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> {{among the}} {{earliest}} Danish photographers who emigrated the farthest distance. Though educated in Denmark, he left Copenhagen in 1878 {{and settled in}} Hawaii. Primarily occupied as a mechanical engineer at the Hana Sugar Plantation, Island of Maui, and later as a technical manager at the Honolulu Iron Works, as an avid amateur photographer he helped found the Hawaiian Camera Club (1889–1893). He became an American citizen in 1903 and in 1909 accepted an appointment as Danish Consul. His remarkable photographs of the Hawaiian royal family and native social elites remain {{as some of the}} earliest images available of pre-annexed Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> science, how the process of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E
50|$|Statistically, {{receiving}} an intentional base on balls does not <b>count</b> <b>as</b> {{an official at}} bat for a batter, but does <b>count</b> <b>as</b> a plate appearance and a base on balls. An intentional ball is <b>counted</b> <b>as</b> a ball in the count of the pitcher's balls and strikes thrown.|$|R
50|$|Note: Between 1964-1973, several actresses were {{nominated}} for multiple performances {{in a single}} year, these each <b>count</b> <b>as</b> one nomination.

The two mentions received by Kate Winslet in both 2004 and 2008, <b>count</b> <b>as</b> two separate nominations each time.|$|R

5|$|On February 8, 2013, NBC {{announced}} that the episode would be expanded to fill a one-hour television block, although it still <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> one official episode. The episode received largely positive reviews, although many were critical of the episode's extended length, which they argued felt padded. The episode was viewed by 4.06 million viewers and received a 2/6 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked third in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question of the validity of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what <b>counts</b> <b>as</b> science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
