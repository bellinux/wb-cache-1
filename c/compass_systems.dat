40|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} a three-dimensional (3 D) dose verification <b>system,</b> <b>COMPASS</b> version 3, which has a dedicated beam models and dose calculation engine. It was possible to reconstruct the 3 D dose distributions in patient anatomy based on the measured fluence using the MatriXX 2 D array. The <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system</b> was compared with Monte Carlo simulation (MC), glass rod dosimeter (GRD), and 3 DVH, using an anthropomorphic phantom for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose verification in clinical neck cases. The GRD measurements agreed with the MC within 5 % at most measurement points. In addition, most points for COMPASS and 3 DVH also agreed with the MC within 5 %. The <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system</b> showed better results than 3 DVH for dose profiles due to individual adjustments, such as beam modeling for each linac. Regarding the dose-volume histograms, there were no large differences between MC, analytical anisotropic algorithm (AAA) in Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS), 3 DVH, and the <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system.</b> However, AAA underestimated the dose to the clinical target volume and Rt-Parotid slightly. This is because AAA has some problems with dose calculation accuracy. Our results indicated that the <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system</b> offers highly accurate 3 D dose calculation for clinical IMRT quality assurance.

A [...] "GNSS compass" [...] uses a pair of antennas separated by about 50 cm to detect the phase difference in the carrier signal from a particular GNSS satellite.

We also study the role of various hyperfine interactions on the coherence and compass sensitivity and establish hyperfine anisotropy as an essential quantity for sensitive functioning of the compass.

40|$|Migratory birds use <b>compass</b> <b>systems</b> {{derived from}} the {{geomagnetic}} field, the stars, the sun and polarized light patterns. We tested whether birds use a single underlying reference system for calibration of these compasses and, specifically, whether sunset and sunrise polarized light cues from {{the region of the}} sky near the horizon are used to calibrate the magnetic compass. We carried out orientation experiments with Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, in Alaska during autumn migration 2005, and compared the magnetic orientations of individual birds before and after exposure to conflicting information between magnetic and celestial cues. Birds exposed to an artificially shifted polarization pattern (± 90 ° shift relative to the natural condition) for 1 h at local sunrise or sunset recalibrated their magnetic compass, but only when given access to the artificial polarization pattern near the horizon. Birds exposed to a 90 ° clockwise-shifted magnetic field for 1 h at solar noon did not recalibrate their magnetic compass. These results indicate that migratory birds calibrate their magnetic compass using the skylight polarization pattern vertically intersecting the horizon at sunrise and sunset. In conjunction with earlier work showing that sun and star compass calibrations are secondarily derived from magnetic and polarized light cues, our findings suggest that polarized light cues near the horizon at sunrise and sunset provide the primary calibration reference for the <b>compass</b> <b>systems</b> of migratory songbirds...|$|E

40|$|Flight {{directions}} of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes {{can be used}} to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic <b>compass</b> <b>systems</b> under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic loxodromes (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America. The observations are also consistent with a migration link between Siberia and the Beaufort Sea region by way of sun compass routes across the Arctic Ocean...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Aim of {{this study}} is to {{clinically}} implement the COMPASS 3 D dosimetry system for pretreatment quality assurance of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT-RapidArc) treatment plans. Methods: For this study, 10 head and neck (H&N) and 10 pelvis VMAT plans dose response from Linac was measured using <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system</b> along with MatriXX Evolution and 3 D dose was reconstructed in the patient computed tomography (CT) scan. Dose volume histograms and 3 D gamma were used to evaluate the difference between the measured and calculated values. In order to validate the <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system,</b> dose response for open fields were acquired for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms. Results: The average dose difference between Eclipse treatment planning system (TPS) calculated and COMPASS measured (homogenous medium) in normalization region, inner region, penumbra region and buildup region was less than ± 2 %. In inhomogeneous phantom, there was a maximum difference of - 3. 17 % in lung, whereas the difference other densities was within ± 2 %. The systematic increase in the average 3 D gamma between the TPS calculated and COMPASS measured for VMAT plans with known dose errors and multi-leaf collimator (MLC) offset errors shows that <b>COMPASS</b> <b>system</b> was sensitive enough to find clinical significant errors. The 3 D dose parameters (D 95, D 1, and average dose) of all H&N and pelvis patients were well within the clinically acceptable tolerance level of ± 5 %. The average 3 D gammas for planning target volumes (PTV) and organ at risks (OAR) of the patients were less than 0. 6. Conclusion: The results from this study show that COMPASS along with MatriXX Evolution can be effectively used for pretreatment verification of VMAT plans in the patient anatomy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Migratory birds use {{multiple}} <b>compass</b> <b>systems</b> for orientation, {{including a}} magnetic, star and sun/polarized light compass. To keep these compasses in register, birds have to regularly update them {{with respect to}} a common reference. However, cue-conflict studies have revealed contradictory results on the compass hierarchy, favoring either celestial or magnetic compass cues as the primary calibration reference. Both the geomagnetic field and polarized light cues present at sunrise and sunset have been shown {{to play a role in}} compass cue integration, and evidence suggests that polarized light cues at sunrise and sunset may provide the primary calibration reference for the other <b>compass</b> <b>systems.</b> We tested whether migratory garden warblers recalibrated their compasses when they were exposed to the natural celestial cues at sunset in a shifted magnetic field, which are conditions that have been shown to be necessary for the use of a compass reference based on polarized light cues. We released the birds on the same evening under a starry sky and followed them by radio tracking. We found no evidence of compass recalibration, even though the birds had a full view of polarized light cues near the horizon at sunset during the cue-conflict exposure. Based on a meta-analysis of the available literature, we propose an extended unifying theory on compass cue hierarchy used by migratory birds to calibrate the different compasses. According to this scheme, birds recalibrate their magnetic compass by sunrise/sunset polarized light cues, provided they have access to the vertically aligned band of maximum polarization near the horizon and a view of landmarks. If polarized light information is not available near the horizon at sunrise or sunset, the birds temporarily transfer the previously calibrated magnetic compass information to the available celestial compasses. Once the stars appear in the sky, the birds then recalibrate the star compass with respect of the recalibrated magnetic compass. If sunrise and sunset information can be viewed from the same location, the birds average the information to get a true geographic reference. We conclude that the type of cue-conflict manipulation and the availability of stars can explain the discrepancies between studies...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} {{mechanism for}} magnetic compasses in animals is that systems of radical pairs transduce magnetic field {{information to the}} nervous system. One can show that perfectly ordered arrays of radical pairs {{are sensitive to the}} direction of the external magnetic field and can thus operate, in principle, as a magnetic compass. Here, we investigate how disorder, inherent in biological cells, affects the ability of radical pair systems to provide directional information. We consider biologically inspired geometrical arrangements of ensembles of radical pairs with increasing amounts of disorder and calculate the effect of changing the direction of the external magnetic field on the rate of chemical signal production by radical pair systems. Using a previously established signal transduction model, we estimate the minimum number of receptors necessary to allow for detection of the change in chemical signal owing to changes in magnetic field direction. We quantify the required {{increase in the number of}} receptors to compensate for the signal attenuation through increased disorder. We find radical-pair-based <b>compass</b> <b>systems</b> to be relatively robust against disorder, suggesting several scenarios as to how a compass structure can be realized in a biological cell...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} has focused on the different types of compass cues available to ball-rolling beetles for orientation, but {{little is known about the}} relative precision of each of these cues and how they interact. In this study, we find that the absolute orientation error of the celestial compass of the day-active dung beetle Scarabaeus lamarcki doubles from 16 ° at solar elevations below 60 ° to an error of 29 ° at solar elevations above 75 °. As ball-rolling dung beetles rely solely on celestial compass cues for their orientation, these insects experience a large decrease in orientation precision towards the middle of the day. We also find that in the <b>compass</b> <b>system</b> of dung beetles, the solar cues and the skylight cues are used together and share the control of orientation behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that the relative influence of the azimuthal position of the sun for straight-line orientation decreases as the sun draws closer to the horizon.
