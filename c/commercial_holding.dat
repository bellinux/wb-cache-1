40|$|Cut curcuma stem has a {{reported}} vase life of 7 to 21 days and {{this difference in}} vase life is probably due {{to a combination of}} different factors such as growing conditions and postharvest treatments. However, the cut flower industry needs key postharvest information for new species and cultivars to be able to effectively market the flowers. The objectives {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of commercial hydrator and holding solutions, commercial growth regulator formulation, floral foam, ethylene and silver thiosulfate (STS) on the postharvest handling of C. alismatifolia cultivars. Control treatment (deionized water) had better vase life than the combinations of the commercial hydrator for 4 h and <b>commercial</b> <b>holding</b> solution for 44 h. Floral foam reduced vase life to 17 days from 23 days for the control treatment. The growth regulators gibberellin plus benzyladenine (GA 4 + 7 + BA) had a positive effect on the fresh weight keeping parameter, but further studies are necessary. STS did not improve vase life, nor did ethylene at 1 µL L- 1 reduce it. The curcuma cultivars tested were not positively affected by vase solution composition and had an average vase life in deionized water of 21 days...|$|E
40|$|The scuticociliate Anophryoides haemophila, causes {{bumper car}} disease in American lobster (Homarus americanus) in <b>commercial</b> <b>holding</b> {{facilities}} in Atlantic Canada. While the parasite {{has been recognized}} since the 1970 s and much has been learned about its biology, minimal molecular characterization exists. With genome consortiums turning to model organisms like the ciliates Tetrahymena and Paramecium, the amount of relevant sequence data available has made sequence surveys more attractive for gene discovery in related ciliates. We sequenced 9984 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from a non-normalized A. haemophila cDNA library to characterize gene expression patterns, functional gene distribution and to discover novel genes related to the parasitic life history. The A. haemophila ESTs were grouped into 843 clusters and singletons with 658 EST clusters having identifiable homologs, while 159 ESTs were unique and had no similarity to any sequences in the public databases. Not unexpectedly, about 67 % of the A. haemophila ESTs have similarity to annotated and hypothetical genes from the related oligohymenophorean ciliate, Tetrahymena. Numerous cysteine proteases, hypothetical proteins and novel sequences possess putative secretory signal peptides suggesting that they {{may contribute to the}} pathogenesis of bumper car disease in lobster. Real time RT-qPCR analysis of cathepsin L and two homologs of cathepsin B did not show any changes in gene expression under varying in vitro growth conditions or during a modified-in vivo infection which may be suggestive of the opportunistic life history strategy of this ciliate.

40|$|Background: Currently {{bronchial}} provocation testing (BPT) using mannitol powder {{cannot be}} performed in children under 6 years. A primary reason is it is challenging for children at this age to generate a consistent inspiratory effort to inhale mannitol efficiently from a dry powder inhaler. A prototype system, which does not require any inhalation training from the pediatric subject, is reported here. It uses an external source of compressed air to disperse mannitol powder into a <b>commercial</b> <b>holding</b> chamber. Then the subject uses tidal breathing to inhale the aerosol. Method: The setup consists of a commercially available powder disperser and Volumatic™ holding chamber. Taguchi experimental design was used to identify the effect of dispersion parameters (flow rate of compressed air, time compressed air is applied, mass of powder, and the time between dispersion and inhalation) on the fine particle dose (FPD). The prototype was tested in vitro using a USP throat connected to a next generation impactor. The aerosols from the holding chamber were drawn at 10 L/min. A scaling factor for estimating the provoking dose to induce a 15 % reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) (PD) was calculated using anatomical dimensions of the human respiratory tract at various ages combined with known dosing values from the adult BPT. Results: Consistent and doubling FPDs were successfully generated based on the Taguchi experimental design. The FPD was reliable over a range of 0. 8 (± 0. 09) mg to 14 (± 0. 94) mg. The calculated PD for children aged 1 - 6 years ranged from 7. 1 - 30 mg. The FPDs generated from the proposed set up are lower than the calculated PD and therefore {{are not expected to}} cause sudden bronchoconstriction. Conclusion: A prototype aerosol delivery system has been developed that is consistently able to deliver doubling doses suitable for bronchial provocation testing in young children...|$|E
40|$|Anophryoides haemophila is an {{important}} protistan parasite of American lobster, Homarus americanus, {{as it has been}} found to infect lobsters in the wild as well as causing major losses of lobsters maintained in <b>commercial</b> <b>holding</b> facilities. Expression of over 14, 500 H. americanus hepatopancreatic genes were monitored during an A. haemophila infection challenge in order to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in the lobster immune response. One hundred and forty-five genes were found to be differentially expressed during infection. For many genes, this study is the first to link their expression to an immune response to a known lobster pathogen. Several of the genes have previously been linked to crustacean or invertebrate immune response including: several anti-lipopolysaccharide factor isoforms (ALFHa), acute phase serum amyloid protein A (SAA), a serine protease inhibitor, a toll-like receptor, several haemocyanin subunits, phagocyte signaling-impaired protein, vitelline membrane outer layer protein- 1, trypsin, and a C-type lectin receptor. Microarray results were verified using RT-qPCR and agreement was good between the two methods. The expression of six ALFHa isoforms was monitored via microarray where ALFHa- 1, ALFHa- 2, ALFHa- 4 and ALFHa- 6 were differentially expressed while ALFHa- 3 and ALFHa 7 were not. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that ALFHa- 1, ALFHA- 2 and ALFHa- 4 expression increased during infection with a peak at 5 – 7 weeks for ALFHa- 1 and 10 weeks for ALFHa- 2 and ALFHa- 4. This suggests that different ALFHa isoforms are temporally expressed during A. haemophila infection. Importantly, these results provide evidence that different ALFHa isoforms have more significant roles in responding to A. haemophila infection. Significant increases in SAA gene expression were also found, corroborating previous findings of increased SAA expression during Aerococcus viridans infections; highlighting the importance of SAA as a marker of H. americanus immune activation and potential indicator of H. americanus health...|$|E
