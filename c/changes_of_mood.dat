25|$|Haig {{had long}} thought French petty, jealous, {{unbalanced}} ("like {{a bottle of}} soda water … incapable of thinking … and coming to a reasoned decision"), overly quick to meddle in party politics and easily manipulated by Henry Wilson. Haig was increasingly irritated by French's changes of orders and mercurial <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> as {{to the length of}} the war, which French now expected to last into 1916. Haig still thought Germany might collapse by November, although {{at the same time he}} was sending a memo to the War Office recommending that the BEF, now numbering 25 divisions, be equipped with the maximum number of heavy guns, ready for a huge decisive battle, 36 divisions strong in 1916.|$|E

500|$|In 1912, when Olivier was five, {{his father}} secured a {{permanent}} appointment as assistant priest at St Saviour's, Pimlico. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier {{was devoted to}} his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent. Nevertheless, he {{learned a great deal}} of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew [...] "when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental... The quick <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and manner absorbed me, and I have never forgotten them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lieutenant Colonel Ion Antonescu {{retained}} his visibility in {{the public}} eye during the interwar period. He participated in the political campaign to earn recognition at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 for Romania's gains in Transylvania. His nationalist argument about a future state of the Romanians was published as the essay Românii. Origina, trecutul, sacrificiile și drepturile lor ("The Romanians. Their Origin, Their Past, Their Sacrifices and Their Rights"). The booklet advocated extension of Romanian rule beyond the confines of Greater Romania, and recommended, at the risk of war with the emerging Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the annexation of all Banat areas and the Timok Valley. In March 1920, Antonescu was one of three people nominated by the new Averescu executive to be a military attaché of Romania in France, but a report issued by the French military observer in Romania, General Victor Pétin, was negative enough to make the French side choose a certain Colonel Șuțu instead (the text referred to Antonescu as [...] "extremely vain", [...] "chauvinistic" [...] and [...] "xenophobic", while acknowledging his [...] "great military worth"). Antonescu was known for his frequent and erratic <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> going from being extremely angry to being calm to angry again to being calm again within minutes, something that often disoriented those who had to work with Antonescu. The Israeli historian Jean Ancel wrote that Antonescu's frequent <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> were due to the syphilis he contracted as a young man, and which he suffered from {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|Intelligent lights (now {{commonly}} referred to as automated or moving heads), can be used wherever {{there is a need for}} powerful lighting which must be capable of rapid and extreme <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and effects. [...] Moving heads would, therefore, be inappropriate in a setting which does not require strong lighting (such as a home) or where the “quality” of the light required does not vary excessively (although it may need to be very strong for a venue like a stadium). [...] Naturally, there are exceptions to this rule, most notably the use of large numbers of moving heads for international sporting events, such as the Commonwealth Games or Olympic Games, where many thousands of separate automated fixtures are often used to light the opening and closing ceremonies. The 2008 Summer Olympics, in Beijing, had a rig of around 2,300 intelligent fixtures which is [...] "the largest single automated lighting system ever assembled for a single event" ...|$|E
2500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} four stars and complimented his [...] "ever-cool flow over a self-produced blend of jazzy samples and live instrumentation", stating [...] "Q-Tip {{delivers}} danceable rhymes, mostly about love of self, women and hip-hop. He also touches society and music industry politics with an intelligence often lacking in today's music". Barry Walters of Spin noted [...] "his eloquent flow over liquid arrangements shimmering with rhythmic finesse" [...] and commented that the album [...] "blurs distinctions between accessibility and avant-gardism". The Guardians Angus Batey wrote that the album [...] "cloak its eclecticism with a homogenising sheen [...] frequent <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and direction dazzle". Areif Sless-Kitain of Time Out gave it five out of five stars and viewed it as a return for Q-Tip to lyrical [...] "old-school basics", stating [...] "It’s a reverse renaissance: The suave MC returns to his glory days {{as part of the}} Native Tongues posse, showcasing his nimble rhymes and clever phrasing". In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a one-star honorable mention (...) while picking out its two songs ("Shaka" [...] and [...] "Official"), and quipped, [...] "If jazz lite it must be, by all means, rap on top." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{may also}} be a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> tense or other {{modifications}} to the form of the verb, such as <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood.</b> These <b>changes</b> depend on the grammar of the language in question - some examples {{can be found in the}} following sections.|$|R

60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{she had had}} another of her swift <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> and had once again tucked away hostility into its corner. She had thought it over and {{had come to the}} {{conclusion}} that as she had no logical grievance against Ashe for anything he had done to be distant to him was the behavior of a cat. Consequently she resolved, when they should meet again, to resume her attitude of good-fellowship. That in itself would have been enough to make her smile.|$|E
60|$|During this interval, even Adele {{was seldom}} sent for to his presence, {{and all my}} {{acquaintance}} with him was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability. His <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> did not offend me, because I saw that I {{had nothing to do}} with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.|$|E
60|$|The {{explanation}} <b>of</b> this <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> {{became apparent}} some little time farther on.

60|$|No {{difficulty}} {{was there}} in associating my <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> with her absence. I brooded.

"No, truly; {{but that}} makes nothing," [...] said Herr Klesmer, {{suddenly}} speaking in an odious German fashion with staccato endings, quite unobservable in him before, and apparently depending on a <b>change</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> as Irishmen resume their strongest brogue {{when they are}} fervid or quarrelsome.

I entreat you to let me return to the house alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 35. Then a humor, etc. The tyrant {{goes through}} various <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> in his {{attitude}} toward his enemy.

But in line 44 his mood turns. He perceives that the burden (gravamen) of the whole matter lies in the incredibly petty nature of this unconquerable, baffling opposition to his will. He sees how the situation would awaken the wonder of the great lords who abjectly obey his lightest word, but he concludes that, after all, the small becomes great if it vexes you.|$|E
60|$|The evening {{closed in}} and dusk {{increased}} {{as they made}} way down Southampton Water and through the Solent. Elfride's disturbance of mind was such that her light spirits of the foregoing four and twenty hours had entirely deserted her. The weather too had grown more gloomy, for though the showers of the morning had ceased, the sky was covered more closely than ever with dense leaden clouds. How beautiful was the sunset when they rounded the North Foreland the previous evening! now {{it was impossible to}} tell within half an hour the time of the luminary's going down. Knight led her about, and being by this time accustomed to her sudden <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood,</b> overlooked the necessity of a cause in regarding the conditions--impressionableness and elasticity.|$|E

6000|$|At Mudie's {{corner in}} Oxford Street all {{the red and}} blue beads had run {{together}} on the string. The motor omnibuses were locked. Mr. Spalding going to the city looked at Mr. Charles Budgeon bound for Shepherd's Bush. The proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other's faces. Yet few took advantage of it. Each had his own business to think of. Each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart; and his friends could only read the title, James Spalding, or Charles Budgeon, and the passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all--save [...] "a man with a red moustache," [...] "a young man in grey smoking a pipe." [...] The October sunlight rested upon all {{these men and women}} sitting immobile; and little Johnnie Sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase, carrying his large mysterious parcel, and so dodging a zigzag course between the wheels he reached the pavement, started to whistle a tune and was soon out of sight--for ever. The omnibuses jerked on, and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey's end, though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond--steak and kidney pudding, drink or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant. Oh yes, human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in Holborn, when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back, and {{if there is such a}} thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it, on the banks of the Thames, where the great streets join and St. Paul's Cathedral, like the volute on the top of the snail shell, finishes it off. Jacob, getting off his omnibus, loitered up the steps, consulted his watch, and finally made up his mind to go in.... Does it need an effort? Yes.

6000|$|In {{all these}} higher things Pepys {{was not found}} wanting. The son of a tailor in the City, he yet had {{connections}} of good family, who were of service {{to him when he}} entered public life. Samuel Pepys was born in 1632. He was educated at Magdalene, Cambridge, where he was once common- roomed for being [...] "scandalously overserved with liquor." [...] Through life he retained a friendly admiration of Magdalene strong ale. He married a girl of fifteen when he was but twenty-two; he entered the service of the State shortly afterwards. He was the Chief Secretary for Naval Affairs during many years; he defended his department at the Bar of the House of Commons after De Ruyter's attack in 1668, and he remained true to the Stuart dynasty in heart after James was driven abroad. Yet, though his contemporary biographer calls Pepys the greatest and most useful public servant that ever filled the same situations in England, Pepys would not now be honoured if he had not kept the most amusing diary in the world. Samuel was a highly conscientious, truly pious man, constant in all religious exercises, though he did slumber when the Scot wagged his pow in a pulpit. At the same time, Samuel lived in a very fast age, an age when pleasure was a business, and [...] "old Rowley, the king," [...] led the brawls. He was young when society was most scandalously diverting. He had a pretty wife, [...] "poor wretch," [...] of whom he stood in some awe; and yet this inconsistent naval secretary liked to flit from flower to flower. He was vain, greedy, wanton, fond of the delight of the eye and the pride of life; he was loving and loose in his manners; he was pious, repentant, profligate; and he deliberately told the whole tale of all his many <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> and mistress, of piety and pleasure. One cannot open Pepys at random without finding him at his delightful old games. On the Lord's day he goes to church with Mr. Creed, and hears a good sermon from the red-faced parson. He came home, read divinity, dined, and, he says, [...] "played the fool," [...] and won a quart of sack from Mr. Creed. Then to supper at the Banquet House, and there Mr. Pepys and his wife fell to quarrelling over the beauty of Mrs. Pierce; [...] "she against, and I for," [...] says superfluous Pepys. No one is in the least likely to suspect that Mrs. Pepys was angry with her lord because he did not think Mrs. Pierce a beauty.|$|E
60|$|Sotillo's ideas did not soar {{above the}} {{care for his}} {{personal}} safety and the chance of plundering the town in his charge, but he feared that such a late adhesion would earn but scant gratitude from the victors. He had believed {{just a little too}} long {{in the power of the}} San Tome mine. The seized correspondence had confirmed his previous information of a large amount of silver ingots lying in the Sulaco Custom House. To gain possession of it would be a clear Monterist move; a sort of service that would have to be rewarded. With the silver in his hands he could make terms for himself and his soldiers. He was aware neither of the riots, nor of the President's escape to Sulaco and the close pursuit led by Montero's brother, the guerrillero. The game seemed in his own hands. The initial moves were the seizure of the cable telegraph office and the securing of the Government steamer lying in the narrow creek which is the harbour of Esmeralda. The last was effected without difficulty by a company of soldiers swarming with a rush over the gangways as she lay alongside the quay; but the lieutenant charged with the duty of arresting the telegraphist halted on the way before the only cafe in Esmeralda, where he distributed some brandy to his men, and refreshed himself at the expense of the owner, a known Ribierist. The whole party became intoxicated, and proceeded on their mission up the street yelling and firing random shots at the windows. This little festivity, which might have turned out dangerous to the telegraphist's life, enabled him in the end to send his warning to Sulaco. The lieutenant, staggering upstairs with a drawn sabre, was before long kissing him on both cheeks in one of those swift <b>changes</b> <b>of</b> <b>mood</b> peculiar to a state of drunkenness. He clasped the telegraphist close round the neck, assuring him that all the officers of the Esmeralda garrison were going to be made colonels, while tears of happiness streamed down his sodden face. Thus it came about that the town major, coming along later, found the whole party sleeping on the stairs and in passages, and the telegraphist (who scorned this chance of escape) very busy clicking the key of the transmitter. The major led him away bareheaded, with his hands tied behind his back, but concealed the truth from Sotillo, who remained in ignorance of the warning despatched to Sulaco.|$|E

50|$|The {{motto of}} the country is Joie, hospitalité, lâcheté ("Joy, hospitality, cowardice"). The country {{remained}} neutral during World War I, and was famous for being a haven for soldiers on leave, with its cheap alcohol and prostitutes. During World War II, the country's leadership collaborated with the Nazi occupier; the government engaged in policies of persecution and deportation of Jews and homosexuals.
