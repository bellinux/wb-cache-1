Doctors determined he needed coronary artery bypass surgery; however, no surgeon wanted to perform the operation out of fear of controversy, and Aquino refused to undergo the procedure in the Philippines out of fear of sabotage by Marcos, indicating he would either go to the United States to undergo the procedure or die in his prison cell. On May 8, 1980, First Lady Imelda Marcos arranged for Aquino and his family to leave for the U.S. He underwent the <b>coronary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> in Dallas, Texas and met with Muslim leaders in Damascus, Syria, before settling with his family in Newton, Massachusetts.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundPatients on {{dialysis}} sustain {{at least}} a threefold higher in-hospital mortality rate and markedly higher long-term mortality following <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> than the general population. Smaller {{studies have suggested that}} dialysis patients have superior outcomes with off-pump compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> MethodsFrom the United States Renal Data System database, 13, 085 patients on dialysis having first <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> between 2001 and 2006 were identified. Of these, 2335 (17. 8 %) had off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival of patients having off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> and patients having on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass.</b> A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess effects of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> on mortality with adjustment for baseline patient characteristics. ResultsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> was associated with significantly reduced all-cause mortality compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> (hazard ratio 0. 92, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 0. 99, P = . 02). The observed survival benefit was most notable in the first year after surgery (70. 3 % vs 68. 7 %) and was lost 2 years after surgery (55. 4 % vs 55. 2 %). No difference was noted in the in-hospital mortality rate with off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> versus on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> (9. 7 % vs 11. 0 %, P =. 06). Cardiac mortality during the follow-up period was similar (23. 6 % vs 23. 8 %; adjusted hazard ratio 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval 0. 86 – 1. 04, P =. 26). Use of internal thoracic grafts was independently associated with improved survival after <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> (hazard ratio, 0. 92; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 87 – 0. 98, P =. 0057). ConclusionsPatients on dialysis sustain high in-hospital and 2 -year mortality rates after <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> Off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> is associated with modestly increased survival compared with on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass,</b> a benefit most marked early after off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare neuropsychologic and quality-of-life outcomes of patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> to those undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> using conventional cardiopulmonary bypass. Design: A prospective randomized trial of <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> with and without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Setting: A cardiothoracic surgery unit at a tertiary hospital. Participants: Sixty-six patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> and a control group of 50 participants not undergoing cardiac surgery. Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> with cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> or randomized to <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> graft <b>surgery</b> without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

40|$|ObjectiveCardiopulmonary bypass {{has been}} shown to be {{associated}} with platelet dysfunction, which has a potential for increasing the risk of perioperative bleeding. Off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> is thought to avoid this deleterious effect of pump use on platelets. However, the influence of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> on platelets has not been thoroughly studied. MethodsAccordingly, we evaluated 60 patients undergoing <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting prospectively using cardiopulmonary bypass and warm cardioplegic arrest (n = 30) or an off-pump technique (n = 30). Platelet function was evaluated before and 2 hours after <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting. ResultsAmong patients undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery,</b> all studies of platelet function were significantly abnormal after surgical intervention compared with results before surgical intervention. Similarly, among patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery,</b> evidence of platelet dysfunction after surgical intervention was noted, with a lower platelet count and a higher proportion of P-selectin– and Annexin V–positive platelets. However, compared with the preprocedural value, the postprocedural decrease in platelet count (78, 200 × 103 /μL vs 103, 000 × 103 /μL) and platelet aggregation (0. 8 % vs 10. 9 %) and increase in bleeding time (0 minutes vs + 1. 3 minutes), P-selectin–positive platelets (6. 0 % vs 9. 1 %), and Annexin V–positive platelets (1. 7 % vs 3. 7 %) were significantly lower in the off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> group compared with those in the on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> group, respectively. ConclusionsEarly postoperative decrease in platelet count and increase in platelet activation occurs to a much lesser extent and does not alter bleeding time or adenosine diphosphate–induced platelet aggregation in patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> This lack of significant effects on platelets might in part account for the potential decreased risk in bleeding and for the preserved hemostasis seen in patients undergoing off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> compared with those undergoing on-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> grafting <b>surgery...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The most {{specific}} {{medicine to}} treat angina is nitroglycerin. [...] It {{is a potent}} vasodilator that decreases myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing the heart's workload. [...] Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers act to decrease the heart's workload, and thus its requirement for oxygen. [...] Nitroglycerin should not be given if certain inhibitors such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil have been taken within the previous 12 hours as {{the combination of the}} two could cause a serious drop in blood pressure. Treatments for angina are balloon angioplasty, in which the balloon is inserted {{at the end of a}} catheter and inflated to widen the arterial lumen. [...] Stents to maintain the arterial widening are often used at the same time. [...] <b>Coronary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> involves bypassing constricted arteries with venous grafts.

2500|$|In 1955, Scruggs {{received}} word that his mother, Lula, {{had suffered a}} stroke and heart attack in North Carolina. The only flight available from Nashville involved such a series of connecting cities {{that it was not}} feasible to fly. Scruggs and his wife, with sons Gary and Randy, decided to drive all night from Nashville [...] to see her when they were involved in an automobile accident just east of Knoxville about 3 a.m. October 2. Their car was hit by a drunk driver, a Ft. Campbell soldier who had pulled out from a side road into their path, then fled the scene after the collision. The children were not hurt, but Earl suffered a fractured pelvis and dislocations of both hips which would plague him for years, and Louise had been thrown into the windshield receiving multiple lacerations. They were flown to a Nashville Hospital where Scruggs remained hospitalized for about two months. He received thousands of letters from well-wishers. He returned to music in January 1956, about four months after the injury, but after working [...] a week or so, one of the hips collapsed, and he returned to the hospital for a metal hip to be implanted. Seven years later, the other hip required similar surgery. The first metal hip lasted for some 40 years, but eventually failed, requiring a total hip replacement in October 1996, when he was age 72. [...] While still in the recovery room after this hip operation, Scruggs suffered a heart attack— he was returned to the operating room later the same day for quintuple <b>coronary</b> <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> Despite the dire circumstances, he recovered uneventfully and returned to his musical career.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{value of}} off-pump over {{conventional}} <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> {{in reducing the}} risk of postoperative stroke is controversial. This issue has been evaluated in light of our recent clinical experience. MethodsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> was performed in 557 patients, and conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> was performed in 445 patients. Preoperative stroke risk was calculated according to the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group stroke risk-scoring method. ResultsOff-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> was associated with a lower but not significant rate of postoperative stroke in the overall series (1. 8 % vs 2. 5 %, P =. 45), a difference that slightly increased in the highest tertile of the Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group score (2. 8 % vs 4. 2 %, P =. 75). The postoperative stroke rate was significantly lower when the operation was performed by off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgeons using routinely epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning compared with conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> surgeons not using epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning (0. 4 % vs 3. 9 %, P =. 015). The Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group score (mean, 4. 6 ± 2. 1 vs 4. 9 ± 2. 2; P =. 189) was similar in these groups. Logistic regression showed that when adjusted for Northern New England Cardiovascular Disease Study Group stroke risk score and critical preoperative status, the treatment approach (off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> and routine epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning) was an independent predictor of postoperative stroke (P =. 012; odds ratio, 34. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 2. 2 - 533. 7). ConclusionsThe neuroprotective efficacy of off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> is marginal compared with that of conventional <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery.</b> A decreased risk of postoperative stroke after off-pump <b>coronary</b> artery <b>bypass</b> <b>surgery</b> is expected, mostly in high-risk patients and when epiaortic ultrasonographic examination is routinely used for better planning of operative strategy, aiming to minimize the risk of intraoperative embolism...|$|R
