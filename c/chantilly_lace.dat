500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in secrecy {{and with a}} limited budget three months before it was broadcast. The wedding {{ceremony}} was filmed in the nave of The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster. [...] "Episode 523" [...] {{is one of only}} a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast. A new romantic style wedding dress made from ivory silk, organza and <b>chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> was made for Minogue's character. The ballad [...] "Suddenly", which was written and sung by Angry Anderson, was chosen as the theme to the episode. Prior to its broadcast, Minogue and Donovan promoted the episode by making several appearances at shopping centres around Australia.|$|E
500|$|Charlene's new romantic style {{wedding dress}} was {{designed}} and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and <b>chantilly</b> <b>lace.</b> A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was [...] "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." [...] While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it [...] "perfect for the time". Wakerley described the dress as being [...] "young and cool" [...] for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated [...] "There {{are so many things}} going on that it's hard not to remember it! The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." [...] Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.|$|E

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich deemed the episode {{a tribute to}} Lady Gaga's [...] "genius", explaining that the costumes the characters wear are not exact replicas of Gaga's, giving the impression the glee club members made them themselves. Rachel wears two dresses, the first inspired by Gaga's Kermit the Frog dress and the second based on Gaga's silver mirrored triangle dress. Murphy selected Tina to wear the Hussein Chalayan–inspired bubble dress, which Eyrich adapted into a vest {{to make it easier}} to take on and off. Kurt's costume is inspired by the Alexander McQueen outfit Gaga wears in the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] video, described by Colfer as [...] "George Washington meets an Oceanic whale disco ball type thing". Eyrich strove for authenticity in replicating McQueen's ten-inch 'Armadillo' platforms. She was unable to buy a pair to fit Colfer, as they were not made in large enough sizes. Quinn wears the Armani Privé orbit dress Gaga wore to the 52nd Grammy Awards, fitted around her pregnant stomach. The most complicated costume was the Philip Treacy lobster hat, worn by Brittany (Heather Morris), as to get it to stay in place during the [...] "Bad Romance" [...] dance, Eyrich had to build a Buckram orb which could be safety–pinned on her head, then solder steel tentacles onto the sphere. It took 45 minutes to get the hat on and off Morris each day, and restricted her vision to what was directly in front of her. In solidarity with Kurt, Finn wears a vinyl floor–length red dress, based on the latex Atsuko Kudo dress Gaga wore to meet Elizabeth II. Mercedes wears a glittery bodysuit and a purple hair bow and wig, and Santana wears the Jeffrey Bryant lace bodysuit, and black rose Charlie Le Mindu hat, with lace airbrushed onto her face. As mentioned in the episode, members of Vocal Adrenaline wear red <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> full-body outfits and headpieces (as well as blonde wigs) inspired by the Fall 1998 Alexander McQueen dress Gaga wore whilst accepting her award for Best New Artist at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E

60|$|The bride {{was dressed}} in a brown silk pelisse (as Captain Dobbin has since {{informed}} me), and wore a straw bonnet with a pink ribbon; over the bonnet she had a veil of white <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace,</b> a gift from Mr. Joseph Sedley, her brother. Captain Dobbin himself had asked leave to present her with a gold chain and watch, which she sported on this occasion; and her mother gave her her diamond brooch--almost the only trinket which was left to the old lady. As the service went on, Mrs. Sedley sat and whimpered a great deal in a pew, consoled by the Irish maid-servant and Mrs. Clapp from the lodgings. Old Sedley would not be present. Jos acted for his father, giving away the bride, whilst Captain Dobbin stepped up as groomsman to his friend George.|$|E

Those flaunting carriages, powdered and favoured footmen, were in attendance upon members of the Newcome family and their connexions, who were celebrating what is called a marriage in high life in the temple within. Shall we set down a catalogue of the dukes, marquises, earls, who were present; cousins of the lovely bride? Are they not already in the Morning Herald and Court Journal, {{as well as in the}} Newcome Chronicle and Independent, and the Dorking Intelligencer and Chanticleer Weekly Gazette? There they are, all printed at full length sure enough; the name of the bride, Lady Clara Pulleyn, the lovely and accomplished daughter of the Earl and Countess of Dorking; of the beautiful bridesmaids, the Ladies Henrietta, Belinda, Adelaide Pulleyn, Miss Newcome, Miss Alice Newcome, Miss Maude Newcome, Miss Anna Maria (Hobson) Newcome; and all the other persons engaged in the ceremony. It was performed by the Right Honourable Viscount Gallowglass, Bishop of Ballyshannon, brother-in-law to the bride, assisted by the Honourable and Reverend Hercules O'Grady, his lordship's chaplain, and the Reverend John Bulders, Rector of St. Mary's, Newcome. Then follow the names of all the nobility who were present, and of the noble and distinguished personages who signed the book. Then comes an account of the principal dresses, chefs-d'oeuvre of Madame Crinoline; of the bride's coronal of brilliants, supplied by Messrs. Morr and Stortimer;--of the veil of priceless <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace,</b> the gift of the Dowager Countess of Kew.

Gunter with the most delicious taste and the sweetest hymeneal allusions.|$|E
6000|$|In this delightful, wholesome, ever-novel twopenny game, {{there is}} a danger of excess, as there is in every other pastime or {{occupation}} of life. If you grow too eager for your twopence, the acquisition or the loss of it may affect your peace of mind, and peace of mind is better than any amount of twopences. My friend, the old-clothes'-man, whose agonies over the hat have led to this rambling disquisition, has, I very much fear, by a too eager pursuit of small profits, disturbed the equanimity of a mind that ought to be easy and happy. [...] "Had I stood out," [...] he thinks, [...] "I might have had the hat for threepence," [...] and he doubts whether, having given fourpence for it, he will ever get back his money. My good Shadrach, if you go through life passionately deploring the irrevocable, and allow yesterday's transactions to embitter the cheerfulness of to-day and to-morrow--as lief walk down to the Seine, souse in, hats, body, clothes-bag and all, {{and put an end to}} your sorrow and sordid cares. Before and since Mr. Franklin wrote his pretty apologue of the Whistle have we not all made bargains of which we repented, and coveted and acquired objects for which we have paid too dearly! Who has not purchased his hat in some market or other? There is General M'Clellan's cocked hat for example: I dare say he was eager enough to wear it, and he has learned that it is by no means cheerful wear. There were the military beavers of Messeigneurs of Orleans:* they wore them gallantly in the face of battle; but I suspect they were glad enough to pitch them into the James River and come home in mufti. Ah, mes amis! A chacun son schakot! I was looking at a bishop the other day, and thinking, [...] "My right reverend lord, that broad-brim and rosette must bind your great broad forehead very tightly, and give you many a headache. A good easy wideawake were better for you, and I would like to see that honest face with a cutty-pipe in the middle of it." [...] There is my Lord Mayor. My once dear lord, my kind friend, when your two years' reign was over, did not you jump for joy and fling your chapeau-bras out of window: and hasn't that hat cost you a pretty bit of money? There, in a splendid travelling chariot, in the sweetest bonnet, all trimmed with orange-blossoms and <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace,</b> sits my Lady Rosa, with old Lord Snowden by her side. Ah, Rosa! what a price have you paid for that hat which you wear; and is your ladyship's coronet not purchased too dear! Enough of hats. Sir, or Madam, I take off mine, and salute you with profound respect.|$|E

50|$|Napoleon I {{sponsored}} revivals of <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace,</b> {{most especially}} between the years 1804 and 1815. At this point production was concentrated in Normandy, mainly around the Bayeux area. While {{it was no}} longer being made in Chantilly, all of the old techniques and designs were used. <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> reached the height of its popularity around 1830 and was revived again in the 1860s, at which point it was made at Bayeux as well as at Geraardsbergen, in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> {{is known}} for its fine ground, {{outlined}} pattern, and abundant detail. The pattern is outlined in cordonnet, a flat untwisted strand. The best Chantilly laces were made of silk, and were generally black, which made them suitable for mourning wear. White <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> was also made, both in linen and silk, though most Chantilly laces were made of silk. The black silk <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> became especially popular, and there was a large market for it in Spain and the Americas. Chantilly and the Spanish laces (such as Blonde lace) were the most popular black laces. Little white Chantilly was ever made. Another notable thing about <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> is the use of a half-and-whole stitch as a fill to achieve the effect of light and shadow in the pattern, which was generally of flowers. The background, or réseau, was {{in the form of a}} six pointed star, and was made of the same thread as the pattern, unlike the otherwise similar Blonde lace. The lace was produced in strips approximately four inches wide, and then joined with a stitch that left no visible seam.|$|E

50|$|Blonde lace is a {{continuous}} bobbin lace from France {{that is made}} of silk. The term blonde refers to the natural color of the silk thread. Originally this lace was made with the natural-colored silk, and later in black. Most blonde lace was also made in black. It {{was made in the}} 18th and 19th centuries. The pattern, which is generally of flowers, is made with a soft silk thread, thicker than the thread used for the ground. This causes a big contrast between the flowers and the ground. It uses the same stitches as <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> and Lille lace, and is similarly made in strips 5 inches wide and invisibly joined. Blonde lace is not as good as <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> though, as the ground isn't as firm, nor is the pattern as regular.|$|E

5000|$|Bucks {{point is}} a bobbin lace from the East Midlands in England. [...] "Bucks" [...] is short for Buckinghamshire, which was the main centre of production. The lace was also made in the nearby {{counties}} of Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire. Bucks point {{is very similar to}} the French Lille lace, and thus is often called English Lille. It is also similar to Mechlin lace and <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bobbin lace, as {{the name}} suggests, is made with bobbins and a pillow. The bobbins, turned from wood, bone, or plastic, hold threads which are woven {{together}} and held in place with pins stuck in the pattern on the pillow. The pillow contains straw, preferably oat straw or other materials such as sawdust, insulation styrofoam, or ethafoam. Also known as Bone-lace. <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace</b> {{is a type of}} bobbin lace.|$|E
5000|$|The terms gimp and {{cordonnet}} can, for {{the most}} part, be used interchangeably, as both are defined as the thread that forms {{the outline of the}} design. The term [...] "cordonnet" [...] is used particularly when the outline is padded and when the thread is completely {{on the surface of the}} lace. When the thread is made of more than one strand (as in <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace),</b> it is also called a cordonnet. In machine-made laces the outlining thread is always called a cordonnet.|$|E

The pusher was particularly good at making large shawls or capes in the style of <b>Chantilly</b> <b>lace.</b> It could replicate the grille or half-stitch which defeated the Leavers machine. It could be hand lined using a Cornely machine.|$|E
