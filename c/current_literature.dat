Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock.

25|$|Parischnogaster alternata was {{originally}} named by Shoichi Francisco Sakagami in 1969. P. alternata {{is one of}} ten species in the genus Parischnogaster. In <b>current</b> <b>literature,</b> P. alternata has been classified as potentially synonymous with another species, Parischnogaster timida discovered by Williams in 1928. These two synonymies may result in future renaming of the species. The closest relative is Parischnogaster striatula. In a phylogenetic classification study, P. striatula was misclassified for P. alternata suggesting close genetic relatedness. These two species are both {{a part of the}} striatula-group due to shared descriptive characteristics such as the length and width of the petiole and the separation of the clypeus from the eye.|$|E

There is also some motion picture {{evidence to suggest}} that a belly antenna on their Electra might have snapped on takeoff (the purpose of this antenna has not been identified, however radio communications seemed normal as they climbed away from Lae). One relatively new theory suggests that Noonan may have made a mistake in navigation due to the flight's crossing of the International Date Line. Further recent research has indicated that on July 2, 1937, Earhart's aircraft was not (contrary to <b>current</b> <b>literature)</b> flown over the great circle New Guinea-to-Howland.|$|E
25|$|These models {{state that}} each IR monomer {{possesses}} 2 insulin binding sites; site 1, which binds to the 'classical' binding surface of insulin: consisting of L1 plus αCT domains and site 2, consisting of loops {{at the junction}} of FnIII-1 and FnIII-2 predicted to bind to the 'novel' hexamer face binding site of insulin. As each monomer contributing to the IR ectodomain exhibits 3D 'mirrored' complementarity, N-terminal site 1 of one monomer ultimately faces C-terminal site 2 of the second monomer, where this is also true for each monomers mirrored complement (the {{opposite side of the}} ectodomain structure). <b>Current</b> <b>literature</b> distinguishes the complement binding sites by designating the second monomer's site 1 and site 2 nomenclature as either site 3 and site 4 or as site 1' and site 2' respectively.|$|E

500|$|The overall {{cost-effectiveness}} of neonatal circumcision {{has also}} been studied in the United States, which has a different cost setting from Africa {{in areas such as}} public health infrastructure, availability of medications, and medical technology and the willingness to use it. [...] A study by the CDC suggests that newborn circumcision would be societally cost-effective in the United States based on circumcision's efficacy against the heterosexual transmission of HIV alone, without considering any other cost benefits. [...] The American Academy of Pediatrics (2012) recommends that neonatal circumcision in the United States be covered by third-party payers such as Medicaid and insurance. A 2014 review that considered reported benefits of circumcision such as reduced risks from HIV, HPV, and HSV-2 stated that circumcision is cost-effective in both the United States and Africa and may result in health care savings.

His close friend and editor Robert Holliday wrote that it [...] "is not an unsupported assertion {{to say that he was}} in his time and place the laureate of the Catholic Church." [...] Trees and Other Poems (1914) was published the following year. This collection also introduced the popular poem [...] "The House With Nobody In It". Over the next few years, Kilmer was prolific in his output, managing an intense schedule of lectures, publishing a large number of essays and literary criticism, and writing poetry. [...] In 1915 he became poetry editor of <b>Current</b> <b>Literature</b> and contributing editor of Warner's Library of the World's Best Literature. In 1916 and 1917, before the American entry into World War I, Kilmer would publish four books: The Circus and Other Essays (1916), a series of interviews with literary personages entitled Literature in the Making (1917), Main Street and Other Poems (1917), and Dreams and Images: An Anthology of Catholic Poets (1917).|$|E

Whilst current research has emphasized important theories of corporate governance, little {{attention has been paid to}} the disparity between both sectors. We focus our research on board composition, and specifically on the model it should convey to the employees of the firm. Six aspects of board composition were chosen to conduct this research: non-executive directors (or external members), board size, ethnicity representation, female directors, political connections and staff representation. By means of a qualitative analysis, we collected employees’ perceptions of each of these topics. We then undertook both content and narrative analyses to draw conclusions and compare them to the <b>current</b> <b>literature’s</b> findings. We find that some aspects of board composition may hold different degrees of importance and convey dissimilar models of governance to the employees depending on the sector they belong to. We also find that the <b>current</b> <b>literature’s</b> findings about boards of directors are more relevant to private than to public organizations...|$|R
