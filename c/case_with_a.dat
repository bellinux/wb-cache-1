5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they both worked with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare the}} dead for the afterlife, the mummies were {{surrounded}} with ceramic pots containing food, tunjos and cotton bags and mantles. The guecha warriors were richly venerated with golden arms, crowns, emeralds and cotton. When the caciques and zaque and zipa died, their mummified bodies {{were placed in}} mausoleums and surrounded with golden objects. The highest regarded members of society were accompanied by their many wives, by slaves and their children. The mummy of a baby described from a cave in Gámeza, Boyacá, had a teether around the neck. Other mummies of children were richly decorated with gold and placed in caves, as was the <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> young girl described by Liborio Zerda.|$|E
5|$|When the {{prosecution}} rested, the defence opened its <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{motion to dismiss}} based on the trial itself being illegal. Servatius challenged Eichmann's kidnapping and {{the basis for the}} Israeli law under which he had been indicted. He argued that if the trial were to continue, it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany. The prosecution countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel's actions, and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate. The defence motion was subsequently dismissed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Malignancies occur word {{wide with}} variety of {{patterns}} depending on an individual's environmental situation and life style. Having {{data about the}} distribution and incidence of different malignancies {{is necessary for the}} formulation of an effective prevention plan for any specific area. Methods. In the central part of Iran (Isfahan Province) a retrospective study was designed to describe cancers' epidemiologic factors by collecting patients' data from the Isfahan Oncology center for the period of 1981 - 1996. &# 13; Results. The frequency of malignancies was as follows: Skin cancers 5111 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 20. 9 percent (62. 9 percent males and 37. 3 percent females). Leukemia 3108 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 12. 7 percent (59. 9 percent males and 40. 1 percent females). Breast cancer 2796 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 11. 4 percent (6. 5 percent males and 93. 7 percent females). cancers of the digestive system 2017 cases (60. 5 percent males and 39. 5 percent females). Non Hodgekin lymphoma 1953 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> relative frequency of 8 percent (66. 9 percent male and 33. 1 percent females). cancers of the urinary system 1567 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency 7. 6 percent (82. 5 males and 17. 5 females). Head and neck cancers 1545 cases (6. 3 percent). Cancer of the reproductive system 1313 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 5. 37 percent. Tumors of the central nervous system 1276 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 5. 22 percent. Lung cancers 933 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 3. 7 percent (80. 7 percent males and 19. 3 percent females). Hodgekins 913 <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> frequency of 3. 7 percent. Sarcoma of the soft tissue 801 cases (3. 28 percent) and bone tissue 657 cases (2. 7 percent). Endocrine malignancies 422 cases and 1. 73 percent of all was at the bottom of categories during the period of study. &# 13; Discussion. In the present study, the prevalence of acute leukemia and also lymphatic and hodgekine malignancies were more frequent than the world wide data presented in the literature. The frequency of lung tumors, however, was less than in the developed countries...|$|R

5|$|In October 2012, {{reports of}} a sniper {{shooting}} cars along I-96 in four counties led to a federal investigation and a multi-jurisdictional task force of 100law enforcement officials. As of October 30, 2012, 25shootings had been linked to one suspect. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and Crime Stoppers offered a $102,000 reward {{for information leading to}} the arrest of the perpetrator. The suspect, Raulie Casteel of Wixom, was arrested on November 5, 2012, and ordered to stand trial in 2013 in Oakland County for 60charges in one <b>case,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> second trial on terrorism and murder charges to be brought by the Michigan Attorney General. On October 30, 2013, the suspect pleaded no contest, but mentally ill, in the Oakland County case, and he was sentenced to serve anywhere from six years and eight months to 10 years in prison on multiple assault charges (as well as two concurrent years on weapons charges) for that case on February 4, 2014. The trial for the Livingston County case began on January 14, 2014, and after being convicted on the terrorism charge, Casteel was sentenced to 16 to 40 years in state prison.|$|E

25|$|Most bridges are {{utilitarian}} in appearance, {{but in some}} cases, {{the appearance}} of the bridge can have great importance.

Designers of bridges in parks and along parkways often place more importance to aesthetics, as well. Examples include the stone-faced bridges along the Taconic State Parkway in New York.|$|E

25|$|The United States {{urged the}} National Transitional Council (NTC) {{to review the}} <b>case,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view towards deporting Megrahi {{if he did not}} die in the meantime.

NTC leaders initially said that they would not deport Megrahi or any other Libyan, but also admitted that only the future elected government of Libya could deal with such issues.|$|E
