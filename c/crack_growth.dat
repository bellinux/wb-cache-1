25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
500|$|The RAE also reconstructed {{about two-thirds}} of G-ALYP at Farnborough and found fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> from a rivet hole at the {{low-drag}} fibreglass forward aperture around the Automatic Direction Finder, which had caused a catastrophic break-up of the aircraft in high-altitude flight. [...] The punch rivet construction technique employed in the Comet's design had exacerbated its structural fatigue problems; the aircraft's windows had been engineered to be glued and riveted, but had been punch riveted only. Unlike drill riveting, the imperfect nature of the hole created by punch riveting could cause fatigue cracks to start developing around the rivet. Principal investigator Hall accepted the RAE's conclusion of design and construction flaws as the likely explanation for G-ALYU's structural failure after 3,060 pressurisation cycles. The Cohen inquiry closed on 24 November 1954, and although the inquiry had [...] "found that the basic design of the Comet was sound", de Havilland nonetheless began a refit programme to strengthen the fuselage and wing structure, employing thicker gauge skin and replacing all square windows and panels with rounded versions.|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this diploma thesis is the {{examination}} of the influence of structure directionality on fatigue properties of formed aluminium alloy 6082 /T 6. The main attention is focused on the study of the influence of structure directionality on kinetics of short fatigue <b>cracks</b> <b>growth.</b> The measurement of short fatigue <b>cracks</b> <b>growth</b> was performed on cylindrical samples. The samples were made in two different directions; one parallel with the forming direction and second perpendicular to the forming direction. Servo hydraulic machine MTS 880 was used for the cyclic loading. The samples were cycled at two different constant stress amplitudes. Cyclic loading was systematically interrupted in order to measure the length of short cracks by a light microscope. Tensile tests, measuring of cycling hardening-softening curves, observation of microstructure, observation of surface relief, measuring of microhardness and fractographical analysis of fracture surfaces were used for further examination of the influence of the structure directionality. Some of these measured characteristics did not show any influence of the structure directionality (microhardness, fatigue life curve, Young modulus). In other cases is this influence measurable, however insignificant (yield stress, ultimate stress, cyclic hardening-softening curves and kinetics of short fatigue <b>cracks</b> <b>growth).</b> It can be summarised that the material, though the directionality of its microstructure is apparent, shows relatively isotropic mechanical behaviour...|$|R

The light impulses appear simultaneously in the ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) wave-length ranges.

With the <b>cracks</b> <b>growth</b> the width become wide-ranging and the spectrum of light shifts to the NIR-wavelength range.

50|$|Based on {{an initial}} crack size, ai, the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> curve can vary significantly, causing the crack {{to reach its}} {{critical}} size in different lengths of time. This contributes to the scatter of the cascade chart. Based on the manufacturing of different materials, the example considers a typical minimum flaw in a material as about 0.127 mm (0.005"). Knowing that the new structures are deeply inspected before being put in service, the example considers a maximum undetectable crack size as about 1.27 mm (0.05") for a new structure. To simulate the variation of possible initial crack sizes, the Monte Carlo simulation method was used to randomly generate values between the given limits. In addition, the method randomly generated parameters for the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> curve. Based on typical variation of material properties, the constants C and m in the equation below can be varied to represent different <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> rates. Uncertainties in loads and geometric factors affecting the stress intensity factor can also be incorporated to simulate different <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> curves.|$|E

40|$|The {{shrinkage}} cracking {{processes in}} a cement-based composite, which include crack initiation, propagation and coalescence, {{as well as}} diffusion-damage coupling, are numerically studied using a mesomechanical numerical model {{to better understand the}} shrinkage <b>cracking</b> <b>growth</b> mechanisms and the effects of cracks on moisture diffusion. This study analyzes the shrinkage <b>crack</b> initiation and <b>growth</b> processes in a repair layer of mortar, which is cast on the top of an old concrete substrate and initially saturated with water. The potential shrinkage crack development is driven by the associated drying process. The results illustrate the fracture infilling, saturation and delamination processes in the concrete repair system by decreasing the bond strength between the repair mortar and the substrate from 4 to 1 MPa. Large concrete repair system bond strengths cause cracks to initiate {{on the surface of the}} repaired mortar and propagate to the interface. However, debonding is observed at lower bond strengths.
