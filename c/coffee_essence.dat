50|$|In Australia, iced {{coffee is}} {{occasionally}} served {{with ice cream}} and whipped cream. The drink may also include syrup, cream, cocoa powder or coffee beans. The result is something like an unblended milkshake. Some commercial varieties of iced coffee are made from instant coffee or espresso coffee, while others contain only coffee flavouring. Iced coffee has been sold commercially in Australia since the late 19th century {{in the form of}} a syrup, an example of which is Bushells <b>Coffee</b> And Chicory <b>Essence.</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the trade with coffee. The primary aim of the paper is to analyse the {{international}} coffee trade. Because coffee belongs to the cash crops we have focus on the production. We have analysed {{the structure of the}} trade concerning the green (not roasted) coffee, roasted coffee and <b>coffee</b> extracts, <b>essences</b> or concentrates. The analyses of production show enormous differences between developed and developing countries on the supply side. Dissimilarity appeared in the price system. Our results show that developing countries (especially least developed countries) cannot fully benefit from the international trade because they are placed just on the lowest level of the production vertical line. The results prove that there must exist strong influence of the supply chains. This is connected with the export of roasted coffee and import of the green coffee.

5000|$|The chicory {{plant is}} one of the {{earliest}} cited in recorded literature. Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: [...] "Me pascunt olivae, me cichorea, me malvae" [...] ("As for me, olives, endives, and mallows provide sustenance"). In 1766, Frederick the Great banned the importation of coffee into Prussia leading {{to the development of a}} coffee-substitute by Brunswick innkeeper Christian Gottlieb FÃ¶rster (died 1801), who gained a concession in 1769/70 to manufacture it in Brunswick and Berlin. By 1795 there were 22 to 24 factories of this type in Brunswick. Lord Monboddo describes the plant in 1779 as the [...] "chicoree", which the French cultivated as a pot herb. In Napoleonic Era France, chicory frequently appeared as either an adulterant in coffee, or as a coffee substitute. Chicory was also adopted as a coffee substitute by Confederate soldiers during the American Civil War, and has become common in the United States. It was also used in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, where Camp Coffee, a <b>coffee</b> and chicory <b>essence,</b> has been on sale since 1885.|$|R
