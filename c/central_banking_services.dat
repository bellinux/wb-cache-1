40|$|This {{paper is}} a summary {{case study of}} the efforts {{to build a new}} {{financial}} system in post-conflict Afghanistan. It focuses on IMF technical assistance that was carried out from October 2001 to May 2003 when staff of the Monetary and Financial Systems Department and contracted experts provided comprehensive advice and support in restoring and transforming <b>central</b> <b>banking</b> <b>services</b> as well as setting up emergency payment systems. The paper outlines the operational framework that was used for reforming the payments and banking systems in post-conflict economies, drawing upon critical events and milestones in practical applications from previous IMF technical assistance to Kosovo and East Timor. It emphasizes that the sequencing of actions within a graduated approach is crucial, including early decisions on the choices of a legal tender and exchange rate regime; operation of a rudimentary payment system on an emergency basis; preparation of financial legislation in line with international best practices as adapted to local legal traditions; the licensing, regulation, and supervision of banks and nonbank financial institutions; and eventual restoration of central banking functions in a two-tier banking system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{autonomous}} mobile ad-hoc networks, {{one major}} {{challenge is to}} stimulate cooperation among selfish nodes, especially when some nodes may be malicious. In this paper, we address cooperation stimulation in realistic yet challenging contexts where the environment is noisy and the underlying monitoring is imperfect. We have first explored the underlying reasons why stimulating cooperation under such scenarios is difficult. Instead of trying to enforce all nodes to act fully cooperatively, {{our goal is to}} stimulate cooperation in a hostile environment as much as possible through playing conditional altruism. To formally address the problem, we have modeled the interactions among nodes as secure routing and packet forwarding games under noise and imperfect observation, and devised a set of reputation-based attack-resistant cooperation strategies without requiring any tamper-proof hardware or <b>central</b> <b>banking</b> <b>service.</b> The performance of the devised strategies has also been evaluated analytically. The limitations of the game-theoretic approaches and the practicability of the devised strategies have also been investigated through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation studies. The results have demonstrated that although sometimes a gap may exist between the ideal game model and the reality, game-theoretic analysis can still provide thoughtful insights and useful guidelines when designing cooperation strategies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the main {{causes of the}} acceleration of inflation in Yugoslavia during the 1980 s and Yugoslavia's last attempt at stabilization in 1990. Yugoslav inflation shares common elements with inflation in other highly indebted countries despite appearances otherwise. Like these other countries, Yugoslavia failed to make internal adjustments to match a large transfer to resources abroad, resulting in a large internal redistribution to real resources through inflation. However, in Yugoslavia these internal conditions were not transparent. Instead of an open fiscal deficit, complex interactions took place among enterprises, <b>banks,</b> and the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> involving the <b>central</b> <b>bank's</b> absorption and <b>servicing</b> of a large stock of foreign exchange liabilities.
