40|$|Solid waste {{management}} {{is a key}} component for the natural stone industry. In recent years, multiwire machines have been overtaking stone gang saw cutting technology. The advantages of these new cutting-edge technologies are high efficiency and performance, flexibility of use, high quality of the cut surfaces, very low environmental impact (low energy consumption, lowest concentration of heavy metals in the sludge, less waste) and lowest noise levels. There are many studies on the separation and recovery of sludge from cutting with the gang saw, but very few on diamond <b>cutting</b> <b>sludges.</b> In accordance with the European Commission's Thematic Strategy on the Prevention and Recycling of Waste (EC raw material strategies), {{it is important to}} perform a correct characterization of sludge from cutting with the new technologies, in order to investigate its possible recovery. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of the sludge resulting from different types of silicatic stones with the aim of their valorization. The investigation was conducted on sludge from cutting with diamond wire, diamond saw blades, and mixed sludge resulting from the filter press. The following tests have been performed to characterize the sludge properties: chemical analysis on the solid fraction of sludge, particle size distribution, evaluation of the metals content through image analysis for each particle size, and leaching tests. To assess the possible recovery of the sludge, wet magnetic separation tests with a high gradient magnetic separator were performed in order to obtain two types of secondary materials, namely the mineral fraction and metals fraction. The separation efficiency has been evaluated through DRX and SEM analysis on the two fractions. The results obtained for the different particle size classes have been compared. The magnetic separation of the size class < 0. 038 mm has a low separation efficiency because of the phenomenon of grain capture by metallic granules: for this reason the metallic fraction of this class must be further processed {{if it is to be}} considered as a secondary raw material. On the other hand, the magnetic separation of the other granulometric classes is characterized by good separation efficiency. A good efficiency of the process is a key factor in order to optimize the recovery process and to increase the economic advantages. The study performed is useful for evaluating the possible reuse of both the metal and the mineral parts, through the implementation of a proactive {{waste management}} strategy in order to avoid a subsequent environmental degradation...|$|E
40|$|Precast {{concrete}} industries generate waste during routine hollow-core slab <b>cutting</b> (<b>sludge</b> 1) and mixer tank washing (sludge 2) operations. The wastes {{are typically}} disposed of by landfilling, an unsustainable practice. This study examined various options for better {{management of the}} two sludges: volume reduction for easier handling and transport, and sustainable, long-term beneficial reuse. Dewatering tests were carried out on sludge 1 to reduce the water content and volume of the sludge. Gravity settling yielded about 30...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} adding {{several types of}} {{industrial}} wastes to fly ash based geopolymers has been studied. For that, flexural and compression strengths were evaluated at 7 and 28 days after curing. From the obtained results {{it seems that the}} incorporation of stone <b>cutting</b> <b>sludge</b> has some beneficial effect on the measured mechanical properties. However, the incorporation of ceramic wastes from ferrous foundry operations seems detrimental. These are preliminary results, further works being necessary to confirm these relationships.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the possible utilization of stone <b>cutting</b> <b>sludge</b> waste in terrazzo tiles production, which would reduce both the environmental impact and the production cost. Stone cutting wastes {{in the form of}} sludge is taken from Samara Factory and incorporated in the batch formulations of terrazzo tiles. The physio-chemical and mineralogical characteristics of the sludge were carried out in order to identify the major components. Result indicated that the sludge generated from stone cutting process could be used in producing of terrazzo tiles. Mixtures of aggregates with added amount of sludge were used successfully to produce the tiles. The results indicated that the transverse strength, water absorption and tiles measurements, for all the taken samples, are comply with Jordanian Standards. The transverse strength decreased as the ratio of the added sludge increased while water absorption increased as the sludge ratio increased...|$|R
50|$|This {{technique}} {{has been used}} for years in the management and disposal of drill <b>cuttings,</b> oily <b>sludge</b> and other petroleum refinery wastes. The equipment employed in land farming is typical of that used in agricultural operations. These land farming activities cultivate and enhance microbial degradation of hazardous compounds. As a rule of thumb, the higher the molecular weight (i.e., the more rings within a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), the slower the degradation rate. Also, the more chlorinated or nitrated the compound, the more difficult it is to degrade.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{possible}} use of stone <b>cutting</b> <b>sludge</b> waste in concrete production, which would reduce both the environmental impact and the production cost. Slurry sludge was used a source of water in concrete production, which was obtained from Samara factory/Jordan, The physico-chemical and mineralogical characterization of the sludge was carried out to identify the major components and to compare it with the typical sand used to produce concrete. Samples analysis showed that 96 % of slurry sludge volume is water, so it {{should be considered as}} an important source of water. Results indicated that the use of slurry sludge as water source in concrete production has insignificant effect on compression strength, while it has a sharp effect on the slump values. Using slurry sludge with a percentage of 25 % of the total water content obtained successful concrete samples regarding slump and compression tests. To clarify slurry sludge, settling process can be used to remove the suspended solid. A settling period of 30 min. obtained 99 % removal efficiency. The clarified water is suitable for using in concrete mixes, which reduce water consumption, conserve water recourses, increase the profit, reduce operation cost and save the environment. Additionally, the dry sludge could be used in the mix design instead of the fine materials with sizes < 160 �m. This application could conserve the natural materials and solve the environmental and economical problem caused by sludge accumulation.

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find a feasible way to reuse mud cuttings from ornamental stone, such as trachyte and basalt, normally disposed of in landfills, using it in the production of full and/or aerated bricks for civil purposes. The study examined the characteristics of full bricks produced with mud cuttings from ornamental stone including, resistance to uniaxial compression, water absorption and apparent density of mud alone or when mixed with two types of clay at different firing temperatures. As temperature rose, the strength and density of the samples increased, while absorption decreased. The use of clay improved the sintering process during firing, giving a less porous and mechanically stronger material that normally used to produce full bricks for civil constructions. For the second type of product, aerated bricks, the study investigated porosity, density, resistance to uniaxial compression and the thermal insulation capacity of bricks made by adding lime and aluminium powder to trachyte mud at different sintering temperatures, ranging between 980 and 1040 °C. As temperature increased, it was observed that an increase in the resistance and density of the samples was accompanied by a reduction in the heat-insulating capacity. When compared with commercial aerated bricks, it was found that aerated bricks obtained from trachyte <b>sludge</b> <b>cuttings</b> and fired at temperatures below 1030 °C, have a greater thermal insulation capacity but a lower mechanical resistance, restricting their use to non-load-bearing masonry applications...|$|R
