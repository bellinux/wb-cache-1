The movable lug wheel for Cianjur location was equipped {{with a pair of}} <b>coiled</b> <b>type</b> torsion <b>springs</b> on each lug, while the movable lug wheel for Subang location was equipped with a shaft <b>type</b> torsion <b>spring</b> on each lug. Field performances: theoretical and actual field capacities, wheel slip, and wheel shrinkage, were measured during the test. The test result in Cianjur showed that the movable lug wheel had a better traction performance than the fixed lug wheel. The average wheel slip of the movable lug wheel was 11. 54 %, while the average wheel slip of the fixed lug wheel was 20. 89 %.

5000|$|A cush {{drive is}} a part of a {{motorcycle}} or scooter drive-train that is designed to reduce stress from engine torque damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression <b>type</b> <b>coil</b> <b>springs</b> placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.|$|R

Specific application of steel spring in automotive is ruled by industrial guideline, for example, Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), Daewoo Engineering Standard (EDS) and Daihatsu Technical Standards (DTS). This study attempt to investigate the characteristics of a <b>coil</b> <b>spring</b> <b>type</b> used in automotive i. e. SUP 12 where the analysis approach was done systematically using experimental and numerical methods. The experimental part was intended to verify the SUP 12 springs material properties (spring constant, yield strength and tensile strength) are within standard for spring steels, JIS G 4801 (1984). The SUP 12 spring underwent tensile testing in accordance to JIS Z 2201 (2010). Later, finite element simulation was performed using HYPERWORKS (Ver. 11) software to predict the steel spring under displacement conditions as per specific customer requirement i. e. at full rebound, curb length and full bump. The resulting experimental data indicates that the tested SUP 12 passed the minimum requirement as per standard. On the other hand, finite element results show that the spring meets the customer requirement within small deviation. This suggested that the systematic verification by experiment and numerical analysis approach on such spring is practical by spring maker...|$|R

40|$|Subthreshold {{continuous}} theta burst {{stimulation of}} the visual cortex {{has been reported to}} cause inhibitory effects on phosphene threshold. In contrast, we observed no inhibition in a former study applying higher stimulation intensities. The main discrepancies between our experiments and the former studies were stimulation intensity and <b>coil</b> <b>type.</b> We aimed at investigating the role of these factors on the modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation applied to the visual cortex. In a between-group-design, we used either a figure-of-eight-coil or a round coil, respectively. We measured phosphene thresholds prior and after continuous theta burst stimulation applied at 80 % of individual phosphene threshold. With the figure-of-eight-coil, phosphene thresholds significantly decreased following stimulation. This is in line with the results of our former study but contrary to the increase observed in the other two studies. Using a round coil, no significant effect was observed. A correlation analysis revealed an inhibitory effect in subjects with higher phosphene thresholds only. Furthermore, the slope of the baseline phosphene threshold seems to predict the direction of modulation, independent from <b>coil</b> <b>type.</b> Thus, modulatory effects of continuous theta burst stimulation seem to depend on <b>coil</b> <b>type</b> and psychophysics parameters, probably due to different cortex volumes stimulated. Stochastic resonance phenomena might account for the differences observed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: A subarachnoid {{hemorrhage}} is neurologically devastating, with 50 % of patients becoming disabled or deceased. Advent of Guglielmi detachable coils in 1995 permitted endovascular treatment of cerebral aneurysms. Coiling is efficacious and safe, but durability needs improvement, as nearly 20 % of patients require further invasive intervention secondary to aneurysm recurrence. The {{aim of this}} study is to develop an in vitro model of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and differentiation on four <b>types</b> of platinum-based <b>coils,</b> using gene expression profiling to understand EC biology as they colonize and differentiate on coils. Methods: Human umbilical vein ECs were grown in vitro on platinum coil segments. Growth patterns were assessed as a function of <b>coil</b> <b>type.</b> Gene expression profiles for coil attached versus coil unattached ECs were determined using immunohistochemistry and gene array analysis. Results: ECs showed rapid, robust attachment to all <b>coil</b> <b>types.</b> Some detachment occurred within 24 - 48 hours. Significant growth of remaining attached cells occurred during the next week, creating a confluence on coils and within coil grooves. Similar growth curve results were obtained with human brain ECs on platinum-based coil surfaces. Differentiation markers in attached cells (α 1, α 2, β 1 integrins) were expressed on immunostaining, whereas microarray gene expression revealed 48 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated genes after 24 -hour growth on coils. Major pathways affected as a function of time of colonization on <b>coils</b> and <b>coil</b> <b>type</b> included those involved in regulation of cell cycle and cell signaling.

40|$|We present {{new data}} on {{genotypic}} differences and biogeographic distribution of <b>coiling</b> <b>types</b> {{in the living}} planktonic foraminiferal morphospecies Neogloboquadrina pachyderma. The genetic evidence demonstrates that coiling direction in N. pachyderma is a genetic trait, heritable through time, {{and is not a}} morphological feature reflecting ecophenotypic variation. The two opposite coiling morphotypes appear to have diverged during the late Miocene, and they have distinctly different ecologies. In combination with fossil evidence, biogeography, and ecology the degree of genetic distinction between the two <b>coiling</b> <b>types</b> of N. pachyderma strongly implies that they should be considered different species. We propose the adoption of the widely recognized name N. incompta for the right coiling morphospecies. The genetic evidence also demonstrates a low level (< 3 %) of aberrant coiling associated with both morphotypes. The abundance of these aberrant specimens has no relationship with the environment. These findings have important consequences for the use of N. pachyderma and N. incompta as paleoceanographic signal carriers in polar and subpolar waters.
