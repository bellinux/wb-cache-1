By means of femtosecond pump−probe spectroscopy, coherent acoustic phonons were generated in an ensemble of nanowires and their dynamics was resolved. Specific phonon modes were identified and the detection mechanism was addressed via wavelength dependent experiments. We calculated the exact phonon dispersion relation of the nanowires by fitting the experimentally observed frequencies, thus allowing the extraction of the <b>complete</b> <b>elasticity</b> tensor. The elasticity tensor and the nanowire diameter were determined for zinc blende GaAs nanowires and were found to be in a good agreement with literature data and independent measurements. Finally, we have applied this technique to characterize wurtzite GaAs nanowires, a metastable phase in bulk, for which no experimental values of elastic constants are currently available. Our results agree well with previous first principle calculations. The proposed approach to the complete and nondestructive mechanical characterization of nanowires will allow the efficient mechanical study of new crystal phases emerging in nanostructures, as well as size-dependent properties of nanostructured materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{study on}} the {{fundamental}} mechanics of fiber-reinforced composite laminates with stress singularities is presented. Based on the theory of anisotropic elasticity and Lekhnitskii's complex-variable stress potentials, a system of coupled governing partial differential equations are established. An eigenfunction expansion method is introduced to determine the orders of stress singularities in composite laminates with various geometric configurations and material systems. <b>Complete</b> <b>elasticity</b> solutions are obtained for this class of singular composite laminate mechanics problems. Homogeneous solutions in eigenfunction series and particular solutions in polynomials are presented for several cases of interest. Three examples are given to illustrate the method of approach and the basic nature of the singular laminate elasticity solutions. The first problem is the well-known laminate free-edge stress problem, which has a rather weak stress singularity. The second problem is the important composite delamination problem, which has a strong crack-tip stress singularity.

30|$|The Mexican {{estimates}} (Fig.  2) have smaller magnitudes {{than the}} Brazilian elasticities (Fig.  1). Elasticities in Mexico indicate that relative changes in labor supply (group proportions) {{have been having}} less of a correlation with relative wages than they did {{at the start of}} our sample period. In 1990 among younger Mexicans (15 – 24 and 25 – 34 age groups), the elasticities of those with secondary completed present the strongest negative correlations with earnings. However, these negative associations are less pronounced in 2010. The elasticities of 15 – 24  year-old men with primary completed become much less positive over time. For older groups (35 – 49 and 50 – 64 age groups) with less than primary <b>completed,</b> the negative <b>elasticities</b> may be an indicative of low demand for labor without education. Among all groups in 2010, the only elasticities with negative correlations of at least − 0.05 are for men ages 35 – 49 with less than primary completed (− 0.06), 35 – 49 with secondary completed (− 0.07), and 50 – 64 with less than primary completed (− 0.05).

40|$|Abstract: Laser ultrasonics {{is based}} on the {{generation}} of elastic waves by transient surface heating or ablation with short laser pulses. These waves are traveling through the sample, are reflected and scattered at interfaces and the backside of the sample. To realize an ultrasound measurement device we have used either an interferometer coupled to a continuous wave laser (contact-free) or the sample was coupled to an optical prism for the detection of the elastic waves on the sample surface. In the prism we use the change of optical reflectance (acoustorefractive effect) at the interface between a glass prism and a liquid coupling layer near the critical angle of total internal reflection. The run-time of these waves in various directions of the samples can be measured contactless with a Fabry-Perot interferometer(point-source-point-receiver technique). From these data the 5 independent components of the <b>complete</b> elastic <b>elasticity</b> tensor for the unidirectional fiber reinforced composites can be determined. These results agree with measurements by a resonant beam technique (RBT), acoustic resonance and 4 -point bending tests. The laser pulse technique has several advantages: it is contactless, non-destructive and it can be used for online quality control in production processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A {{large-scale}} {{survey was}} conducted in 2008 in north west England, a region {{with high levels of}} alcohol-related harm, during a regional 'Big Drink Debate' campaign. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore perceptions of how alcohol consumption would change if alcohol prices were to increase or decrease. Methods A convenience survey of residents (≥ 18 years) of north west England measured demographics, income, alcohol consumption in previous week, and opinions on drinking behaviour under two pricing conditions: low prices and discounts and increased alcohol prices (either 'decrease', 'no change' or 'increase'). Multinomial logistic regression used three outcomes: 'completely elastic' (consider that lower prices increase drinking and higher prices decrease drinking); 'lower price elastic' (lower prices increase drinking, higher prices have no effect); and 'price inelastic' (no change for either). Results Of 22, 780 drinkers surveyed, 80. 3 % considered lower alcohol prices and discounts would increase alcohol consumption, while 22. 1 % thought raising prices would decrease consumption, making lower price elasticity only (i. e. lower prices increase drinking, higher prices have no effect) the most common outcome (62 %). Compared to a high income/high drinking category, the lightest drinkers with a low income (adjusted odds ratio AOR = 1. 78, 95 % confidence intervals CI 1. 38 - 2. 30) or medium income (AOR = 1. 88, CI 1. 47 - 2. 41) were most likely to be lower price elastic. Females were more likely than males to be lower price elastic (65 % vs 57 %) while the reverse was true for <b>complete</b> <b>elasticity</b> (20 % vs 26 %, P Conclusions Lower pricing increases alcohol consumption, and the alcohol industry's continued focus on discounting sales encourages higher drinking levels. International evidence suggests increasing the price of alcohol reduces consumption, and one in five of the surveyed population agreed; more work is required to increase this agreement to achieve public support for policy change. Such policy should also recognise that alcohol is an addictive drug, and the population may be prepared to pay more to drink the amount they now feel they need. </p...|$|E

In the case of unidimensional problems the solution is exact, because the number of boundary conditions is equal to the number of parameters involved in the series expansion, whereas in the two-dimensional problems the solution satisfies exactly the differential equation but only approximately the boundary conditions. The approximation of the solution will depend on the number of points selected at the boundary. The method presented here can also be used for developing high-order finite elements of any number of nodes and boundary shapes using complete polynomial expansions that satisfy the differential equation.

Joker uses his gang to stage a reality show in Las Vegas to serve as muscle while the Justice League searches the city for explosives. While King, Ten and Jack are eventually captured, Queen was knocked out during a fight with the Green Lantern and Hawkgirl then was subdued when one of the bombs inside detonated. The bombs are revealed to be a hoax, the point of which was to draw viewership so that Joker could use Ace to drive millions of people insane. The plan fails when Batman pulls a collar from Joker's jacket which Ace's government handlers had used to control her as a child and which Joker had kept as insurance against her. Realizing that Joker was simply using her, Ace turns her powers on Joker to drive the Clown Prince of Crime into catatonia for a time; she then departed the scene and disappeared. Former General Hardcastle reveals in the episode [...] "Fearful Symmetry" [...] to Supergirl, Green Arrow and the Question that the gang of teenagers that Joker freed were part of Project Cadmus. It is worth noting that the voice actors and actresses of the Royal Flush Gang were also the voice actors for the five main characters of Teen Titans.|$|R
40|$|Elastic {{words are}} those whose length can vary between monosyllabic and disyllabic, without {{changing}} the meaning. Though elastic words have {{known to be}} many in Chinese, {{it is still not}} clear how many words are elastic. In addition, there is no consensus on the motivation of creating elastic words. This dissertation offers a complete annotation of elastic words in modern Standard Chinese and sample annotations of Middle Chinese, and investigates why elastic words are created. Specifically, it examines four properties of elastic words focusing on the homophone-avoidance theory and the prosody theory. The former, by far the most popular one, proposes that disyllabic words are created to reduce homophony and avoid ambiguity after massive syllable loss. In contrast, the prosody theory proposes that elastic words are created because disyllabic words are needed in prosodically strong positions, due to the requirement of Foot Binarity. First, a study examines the relation between homophony and elastic words, based on a <b>complete</b> length <b>elasticity</b> annotation of Modern Chinese Dictionary (2005). Results show that there is no correlation between homophony and elastic words. The second study examines the effect of word category on elastic words in modern Standard Chinese. Results show that (i) half of words in Chinese lexicon are elastic; (ii) content words have higher percentage of elastic words than function words. The third study examines the historical development of elastic words, with a focus on Middle Chinese, especially Tang poems. Results show that there are many elastic words in Middle Chinese, similar to that in Modern Chinese. The fourth study examines word length in Chinese dialects, focusing on Mandarin and Cantonese. Results show that they have similar percentages of disyllabic words and that the size of syllable inventory has no effect on word length. Various evidence consistently points {{to the conclusion that the}} prosody theory offers a better explanation of why elastic words are created in Chinese, despite of the fact that the homophone-avoidance theory seems quite intuitive and natural. In other words, elastic words are created to fulfill prosodic requirement rather than to compensate for syllable loss or an increase in homophony...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Current {{research}} {{work on the}} development of a nanohandling robot station for automated characterization of biological cells is presented. The station consists of a sample piezo scanning stage with three degrees of freedom (DoF) and a three-axes nanomanipulator that is equipped with a piezoresistive atomic force microscope (AFM) probe as an endeffector. Thus, the endeffector can be used both to measure mechanical properties of the sample and as a force sensor giving a feedback signal to the underlying control sys-tem. While the endeffector can be positioned coarsely by the nanomanipulator, fine positioning of the sample is performed by the piezo stage. As a visual sensor for the station an inverted optical microscope is utilized. The setup is enhanced by a second nano-manipulator equipped with a pipette for injection/extraction tasks or patch clamp purposes. Alterna-tively, a second piezoresistive AFM probe can be used as an endeffector for the second nanomanipulator. The station pro-vides the opportunity to automatically determine a region-of-interest (i. e. a single cell) by means of object recognition in previously acquired images from the optical microscope. Next, the endeffector is brought into proximity to the sample, and an automated, mechanical characterization of the cell is performed. First experiments cover recordings of single force-distance curves to gain information on elasticity and adhesion of the cell. Using the fast piezo stage, <b>complete</b> adhesion or <b>elasticity</b> maps of the region-of-interest can be obtained. This mechanical characterization delivers valuable information about cell mechanics concerning cell to cell contact or cell motility. It is also of interest in oncology, since tumor cells tend to have a different elasticity than healthy cells. The use of a second nanomanipulator surpasses the capabilities of a standard AFM system, since it enables the station to cover areas as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, measurements of reactions to drug injection or electrophysiological measurements of stress activated ion channels.
