50|$|The Whitehall Branch {{consisted}} of the Pittsburgh and Whitehall, sold by the Oliver interests to the Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railway, predecessor of the PRR Monongahela Branch, on March 27, 1888 (with a certificate of <b>consolidation</b> <b>filed</b> May 14, 1888), including the trackage parallel to the narrow gauge coal line along South 21st St., and additional trackage along Mary St. running east from South 21st St. parallel to the Monongahela Branch until it joined it near 30th St. yard. Later the PRR would lease back the stretch parallel to the P&LE to Oliver Iron's captive Allegheny and South Side Railway. Railway Age mentions a $75,000 purchase price in its September 27, 1905 issue, which seems late for this purchase.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—From specific-purpose storage {{appliances}} to the {{new generation}} of cloud storage services, the industry has different solutions for the data storage needs of home and small office users, whereas for backup, resource <b>consolidation</b> or <b>file</b> sharing purposes. Although dedicated appliances and cloud services offer a different balance between capacity, accessibility, and cost, the two paradigms are complementary, rather than incompatible. This paper proposes an operator-managed hybrid storage service which explores the existing complementarity between the appliance-based and the cloud-based storage service models. By making use of home gateways/routers as storage service appliances, it aims to provide an integrated solution eliminating the need for dedicated storage devices. The proposed approach fully integrates with the prevailing management frameworks already used by broadband access network operators, namely th...|$|R
2500|$|On such SD cards, {{standard}} utility {{programs such}} as Mac OS X's [...] "" [...] or Windows' SCANDISK {{can be used to}} repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. Defragmentation tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting <b>consolidation</b> of <b>files</b> may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file, but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.|$|R

These requests total {{the number of}} page elements required for download. However, a browser is limited to opening only {{a certain number of}} simultaneous connections to a single host. To prevent bottlenecks, the number of individual page elements are reduced using resource <b>consolidation</b> whereby smaller <b>files</b> (such as images) are bundled together into one file.

50|$|Due to {{flooding}} on June 23, 2016, both Richwood High School and Richwood Middle School {{have been}} temporarily relocated. Richwood High is presently housed in trailers {{at the former}} Beaver Elementary School site. On March 7, 2017, the Nicholas County Board of Education approved a plan to permanently close the schools {{so they can be}} consolidated with Nicholas County High School and Summersville Middle School on a new campus. <b>Consolidation</b> opponents <b>filed</b> an unsuccessful lawsuit against the Nicholas County Board of Education alleging open meeting laws were violated prior to the vote. On June 13, 2017, the West Virginia Board of Education rejected the proposed consolidation of the Richwood and Summersville schools. This decision was made citing the lack of alternative plans and that other options were not explored. Alternatives were presented at the meeting including comprehensive Grades 6-12 facilities in both Richwood and Summersville to reduce the overall number of schools and allow each community to maintain its autonomy.|$|R
50|$|Following the Civil War, both {{colleges were}} short on {{students}} and short on funds, {{causing them to}} join together as Washington & Jefferson College in 1865. The charter provided for the college to operate at both Canonsburg and Washington, a position that caused significant difficulty to the administration trying to rescue the college amid ill feelings over the unification. In 1869, the two-campus arrangement was declared a failure and all operations were moved to Washington. However, a lawsuit from Canonsburg residents and Jefferson College partisans seeking to overturn the <b>consolidation</b> was <b>filed</b> and eventually {{made its way to}} the United States Supreme Court. By 1871, the Supreme Court upheld the consolidation, allowing the newly configured college to proceed. Under James D. Moffat, the college experienced a period of growth. The tenure of Simon Strousse Baker between 1922 and 1931 saw a large amount of construction, as well as student unrest that led to his resignation. During World War II, the college opened its doors to the United States Army as a training facility and subsequently admitted a large number of veterans, which swelled the student body to record levels. In 1970, the Board of Trustees voted to admit women {{for the first time in}} the college's history. Under Brian C. Mitchell, who served as president from 1998 to 2004, the college again a growth in construction and an effort to improve relations with the neighboring communities. In 2004, Tori Haring-Smith became the first woman to serve as president of Washington & Jefferson, understanding an effort to improve the science curriculum and to construct the Swanson Science Center.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, Equality California Institute {{launched}} [...] "Let California Ring," [...] {{an educational}} campaign aimed at swaying {{public opinion on}} marriage equality. Let California Ring produced the well-received [...] "Garden Wedding" [...] ad, which aired only in the Santa Barbara media market {{as part of a}} study of the effect of various messages on public opinion. It was credited with a 11-point jump in support for marriage equality in the study area, and, in fact, Santa Barbara was the only county in Southern California to vote against Proposition 8 in 2008. [...] Equality California was an organizational plaintiff in In re Marriage Cases, a <b>consolidation</b> of lawsuits <b>filed</b> by the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Lambda Legal, several law firms and a number of individuals challenging California’s marriage laws that excluded same-sex couples. The California Supreme Court on May 15, 2008 ruled that California same-sex couples had a right to marry under the California Constitution. Same-sex couples were able to marry as of June 17, 2008. Voters amended the state constitution to prohibit same-sex couples from marrying in November of that year with the passage of Proposition 8.|$|R
