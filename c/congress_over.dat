5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} Electoral College by constitutional amendment have been introduced in <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> the decades.

5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776).

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. This group was {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold was someone who had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by his dealings with <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington just missed apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E

The free speech protections of the First Amendment have long been used to shield whistleblowers from retaliation.|$|E

25|$|Several {{bills were}} offered in <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> {{the next few}} years to either ban agency shop {{agreements}} or to adopt various provisions of the 1997 Nickles bill, but all of them died in committee.

25|$|In rapidly {{expanding}} western states, the Federalists had few supporters. Every state had a distinct political geography that shaped party membership. In Pennsylvania, the Republicans were weakest around Philadelphia and strongest in Scots-Irish {{settlements in the}} west. Members came from all social classes, but came predominantly from the poor, subsistence farmers, mechanics and tradesmen. After the War of 1812, partisanship subsided across the young republic—people called it the Era of Good Feelings. James Monroe narrowly won the party's nomination for President in <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> William Crawford in 1816 and defeated Federalist Rufus King in the general election.|$|E

25|$|Although the Animal Bioscience Building was {{the first}} {{building}} constructed during Cruzado's tenure, it was one she {{had little to do}} with. In 1997, the Montana Land Board sued MSU, arguing that the university sold at below-market value or used for non-intended purposes land bequeathed to the university by Bozeman area farmers and ranchers. In 1999, the Land Board reached a settlement with MSU which, in part, required the university to set aside $3 million by 2005 to build a livestock research center. More than $13 million was earmarked by <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> the next few years to build the structure. Additional fundraising also occurred, and more than 141 individuals gave more than $10,000 each to fund construction of the new center. The Wanke family of Rudyard, Montana, gave $2.7 million in honor of Harold Wanke (who {{always wanted to be a}} veterinarian but never got the chance).

25|$|The {{challenge}} to the Court in its analysis and decision was devising a proper course of action that was both coordinate and consonant between the sovereign authorities (the <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> itself and its members, {{the people and the}} states over the Congress) each in their own sphere, over the choosing of members to the Congress. The Court looked at the historical precedent of the House, the history of its candidate members, {{and the role of the}} states and their voters in choosing their representatives. The Court concluded that the US Constitution (the word and will of the people), the weight of history (the record of how the people have used their constitution), and the federal structure of the government (the role of the states in organizing and managing elections within their borders) required the Court to decide that the sovereign will of the people, as expressed in the democratic process, and the coordinate role of their states must be made consonant and held supreme, in the responsibility to create candidate members for the Congress.|$|E
500|$|As an {{enactment}} of the First Congress, the Crimes Act is often regarded as a quasi-constitutional text. The punishment of treason, piracy, counterfeiting, as well as crimes committed {{on the high seas}} or against the law of nations, followed from relatively explicit constitutional authority. The creation of crimes within areas under exclusive federal jurisdiction followed from the plenary power of <b>Congress</b> <b>over</b> the [...] "Seat of the Government," [...] federal enclaves, and federal territories. The creation of crimes involving the integrity of the judicial process derived from Congress's authority to establish such courts.|$|E
