40|$|A key {{aspect of}} a {{wireless}} sensor network {{is its ability to}} self-organize and maintain <b>connectivity.</b> <b>Medium</b> Access Control (MAC) protocol manages network self-configuration, which includes establishing a personal area network (PAN), finding a network to associate or disassociate with, and synchronizing if required. Currently, there is limited research that addresses the network initialization phase. This paper provides a performance evaluation of the 802. 15. 4 MAC during device association and synchronization with the PAN coordinator. Our results show the impact of beacon interval and the number of associating nodes in terms of association time delay and energy consumption in stationary wireless sensor networks. Results illustrate that energy consumption and association time increase with increasing number of nodes associating with a coordinator. Moreover, short beacon intervals consume more energy due to the frequency of beacon frames that nodes have to keep track of to maintain synchronization. However, short beacon intervals reduce the time required for the nodes to associate, in contrast to longer beacon intervals that are undesirable for real time and mobile applications. Furthermore, for longer beacon intervals, BO= 12 to BO= 14, there is an abrupt increase in energy consumption as the number of associating nodes increase, even for as few as as four nodes...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{vehicular}} ad hoc networking (VANET) has attracted significant attention and many fundamental issues have been investigated, such as network <b>connectivity,</b> <b>medium</b> access control (MAC) mechanism, routing protocol, and quality of service (QoS). Nevertheless, most related work {{has been based on}} simplified assumptions on the underlying vehicle traffic dynamics, which has a tight interaction with VANET in practice. In this paper, we try to investigate VANET performance from the vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS) perspective. Specifically, we consider VANET connectivity of platoon-based VCPSs where all vehicles drive in platoon-based patterns, which facilitate better traffic performance as well as information services. We first propose a novel architecture for platoon-based VCPSs, then we derive the vehicle distribution under platoon-based driving patterns on a highway. Based on the results, we further investigate inter-platoon connectivity in a bi-directional highway scenario and evaluate the expected time of safety message delivery among platoons, taking into account the effects of system parameters, such as traffic flow, velocity, platoon size and transmission range. Extensive simulations are conducted which validate the accuracy of our analysis. This study will be helpful to understand the behavior of VCPSs, and will be helpful to improve vehicle platoon design and deployment...|$|E
40|$|A {{large amount}} of world's {{hydrocarbon}} reserves lies in reservoirs {{where one of the}} key features is the presence of a system of fractures spanning different length scales. Fractures may provide ways to drain the matrix, but they also drive gas and water towards wells. Fractures intensity, geometry and conductivity are characterised in conjunction with matrix properties using all possible data, such as production logging, mud-losses, image log, well test, geophysics and outcrops. This may lead to a geometrical characterisation in terms of a discrete fracture network (DFN), with the definition of a set of geometrical 2 D objects embedded in the matrix domain. A DFN is a computational challenge for conventional dual-porosity simulators, where a dual medium formulation is cast in a corner point geometry grid (CPG). In this context small, with respect to CPG grid spacing, fractures can be easily incorporated using some practical recipes, see Dershowitz et al. (2000), in single porosity or in dual-porosity models. On the other hand, long range, interconnected fractures cannot be integrated in the simulation model unless some crude approximation is implemented in order to fit the fracture network geometry into the Warren and Root (1963) dual media framework, at least as it is available in conventional commercial simulators, see e. g, Eclipse (2011). A more accurate solution is the implementation of unstructured gridding where the matrix is discretized by tetrahedral or more general polyhedra and the fractures are discretized using 2 D polygons. These grids can be used with finite volume, connectivity based reservoir simulators (see Karimi-fard et al. (2004)), but the approach is computationally inefficient for most of the commercial simulators, and this motivated the development of the EDFM by Li and Lee (2008). In this approach the intersections between fractures and matrix blocks define the degrees of freedom (DOFs) for the high <b>connectivity</b> <b>medium.</b> Then, 2 D flow between fracture DOFs and 1 D flow between fractures and matrix can be integrated with 3 D flow in the CPG grid representing the matrix. In a nut-shell, an unstructured grid for the fracture network is comined with a structured grid for the matrix. Differently from Li and Lee (2008), our implementation is not based on the customisation of the reservoir simulator. Rather, we exploit the capability of most commercial simulators to define non neighbouring connections across grid cells to implement EDFM in a non-invasive manner. Our results confirm that EDFM can be as effective as fully unstructured gridding but much more computationally efficient...|$|E

40|$|Power saving is {{considered}} a significant issue relating to wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where nodes normally use limited battery power. Transmitting using unnecessary high power introduces excessive interference. It is much better if the network designer would have each node transmit at the lowest possible power while the network connectivity is preserved. This paper introduces the optimal common transmit power, defined as the minimum transmit power used by all nodes necessary to guarantee network connectivity. This is desirable in sensor networks since nodes are relatively simple, while modifying transmit power after deployment is difficult. The optimal transmit power used in this paper has been derived in previous work. It {{is subject to the}} specific routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols considered.

Using chronic social defeat stress, an animal model of mood and anxiety disorders, we investigated whether alterations in synaptic plasticity are responsible for the long-lasting behavioral symptoms induced by this form of stress. We hypothesized that chronic social defeat stress alters synaptic strength or <b>connectivity</b> of <b>medium</b> spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc to induce social avoidance. To test this, we analyzed the synaptic profile of MSNs via confocal imaging of Lucifer-yellow-filled cells, ultrastructural analysis of the postsynaptic density, and electrophysiological recordings of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in mice after social defeat. We found that NAc MSNs have more stubby spine structures with smaller postsynaptic densities and an increase in the frequency of mEPSCs after social defeat. In parallel to these structural changes, we observed significant increases in IÎºB kinase (IKK) in the NAc after social defeat, a molecular pathway that has been shown to regulate neuronal morphology. Indeed, we find using viral-mediated gene transfer of dominant-negative and constitutively active IKK mutants that activation of IKK signaling pathways during social defeat is both necessary and sufficient to induce synaptic alterations and behavioral effects of the stress. These studies establish a causal role for IKK in regulating stress-induced adaptive plasticity and may present a novel target for drug development in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders in humans.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Blake's posthumous reception, focusing {{particularly on}} the 1860 s, 1870 s and 1880 s as decades in which Blake's reputation was both consolidated as a poet and artist, and invigorated as a radical sympathizer. As Blake's texts and life were being formed and re-formed in physically and conceptually elaborate books, such as Alexander Gilchrist's The Life of William Blake and Algernon Charles Swinburne's William Blake: a critical essay, significant and innovative appropriations of Blake's poetry and illustrations were made in Republican and freethinking periodicals and pamphlets. This thesis recovers some of that material. Retrieving the influence of such "low culture" ephemera on the "high" culture of Pre-Raphaelite creativity allows the Victorian Blake to emerge as a multi-faceted, contradictory production: both secular iconoclast and mystical visionary, blasphemous sibyl and poet of social justice. Nineteenth-century readings and reproductions of Blake are a chronicle of freethought and freeform. The multiplicity of Blake in this period, in both reproduction and interpretation, enables a questioning of books and periodicals as mediums of representation. Blake's reproduction {{in the nineteenth century}} coincides with, and yet confounds, Foucauldian configurations of nineteenth-century representation. Although Blake is depicted as a lone, isolated individual - often labouring under the insane tag - this does not simply signify an epistemological nadir of vacuous, disconnected individualism, such as Foucault identifies. On the contrary, this thesis seeks to prove that the enthusiasm for Blake in the 1860 s, 1870 s and 1880 s is facilitated by a deep <b>connectivity</b> of <b>medium</b> and message, and between different mediums and different messages. The political stance of Secularism meets the cultural concerns of Aestheticism, both reproducing Blake through technology that improvises upon and rejuvenates Blake's own unique craft...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs), different motes may transmit packets concurrently, i. e., having overlapping transmission periods. As {{a result}} of this contention, there are no packet reception guarantees and significant bandwidth can be lost. This contention can have a strong impact on the performance together with other kinds of interference sources, e. g., ambient noise. As a result, WSNâ€™s connectivity tends to have a very dynamic nature. In this paper, we devise DecTDMA (Decentralized-TDMA), a fully decentralized medium access controller (MAC) that significantly reduces contention. It is based on a self-stabilizing algorithm for time division multiple access (TDMA). This self-stabilizing TDMA algorithm uses no external assistance or external references, such as wireless access points (WAPs) and globally-synchronized clocks. We present the design and implementation of DecTDMA and report encouraging results: our Cooja simulations and Indriya testbed experiments show stable <b>connectivity</b> and high <b>medium</b> utilization in both single and multi-hop networks.

40|$|A general {{method for}} calculating the {{properties}} of the Residence Time Distribution (RTD) of a fluid flowing though a self-similar network, with or without stagnation (trapping) effects, in the high PÃ©clet number limit is developed. The renormalization procedure adopted yields the Laplace transform of the Residence Time Distribution and allows one to calculate its time moments. The incidence of the <b>connectivity</b> of the <b>medium</b> on dispersion is discussed. The fractal dimension does not appear explicitly in the dispersion properties of the network. Geometrical dispersion is shown to result from the difference of pathlengths offered to the fluid in the generating pattern of the network. The dispersion front is strongly non-Gaussian and presents several maxima (short circuits) in some extreme cases. An approximate expression for the dispersion front is derived when the distribution of pathlengths in naroow. In the latter situation, a dispersion coefficient can be defined, and it is characterised by two parametres, Î³ and (1 -f) tm, which represent respectively the intensity of the disorder (or the ability to mixing) related to geometric dispersion, and the characteristic hold-up time of a tracer particle in the stagnation phase supposed to occupy a fraction (1 -f) of the volume and to be uniformly distributed in the medium.

40|$|Objective. Our {{goal is to}} re-introduce an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the partial correlation to infer structural connections from functional-effective ones in dissociated neuronal cultures coupled to microelectrode arrays. Approach. We first validate our partialization procedure on in silico networks, mimicking different experimental conditions (i. e., different connectivity degrees and number of nodes) and comparing the partial correlation's performance with two gold-standard methods: cross-correlation and transfer entropy. Afterwards, to infer the structural connections in in vitro neuronal networks where the ground truth is unknown, we propose a thresholding heuristic approach. Then, to validate whether the partialization process correctly reconstructs macroscopic features of the network structure, we extract a modularity index from segregated in silico and in vitro models. Finally, as a case study, we apply our partialization procedure to analyze connectivity and topology on spontaneous developing and electrically stimulated in vitro cultures. Main results. In simulated networks, partial correlation outperforms cross-correlation and transfer entropy at low and <b>medium</b> <b>connectivity</b> degrees, not only in relatively small (60 nodes) but also in larger (120 - 240 nodes) assemblies.

Optimizing conservation strategies for these endangered marine top predators requires direct estimates of breeding patterns and connectivity as these are essential to understanding the population dynamics. There have been some attempts to investigate breeding patterns of reef sharks from litter reconstruction using molecular analyses. However, direct fine-scale migrations of female sharks for parturition as well as <b>connectivity</b> at a <b>medium</b> scale like between islands remain mostly unknown. We used microsatellite DNA markers and a likelihood-based parentage analysis to determine breeding patterns of female blacktip reef sharks in Moorea (Society Islands, French Polynesia). Most females gave birth at their home island but some migrated to specific nursery areas outside the area they are attached to, sometimes going to another island 50 km away across deep ocean. Our analysis also revealed that females migrated to the same nursery for every birthing event. Many offspring showed {{a high level of}} inbreeding indicating an overall reduced population size, restricted movements and dispersal, or specific mating behaviour. Females represent the vectors that transport the genes at nursery grounds, and their fidelity should thus define reproductive units.

Such length scales are much greater than can be probed with NMR diffusion studies of water-saturated porous media. We utilized Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo NMR measurements of the time-dependent diffusion coefficient, D(t) of the xenon gas filling the pore space to study further the measurements of both the surface area-pore volume ratio, S/Vp, and the tortuosity (pore <b>connectivity)</b> of the <b>medium.</b> In uniform-size glass bead packs, we observed D(t) decreasing with increasing t, reaching an observed asymptote of ~ 0. 62 - 0. 65 D 0, that could be measured over diffusion distances extending over multiple bead diameters. Measurements of D(t) /D 0 at differing gas pressures showed this tortuosity limit was not affected by changing the characteristic diffusion length of the spins during the diffusion encoding gradient pulse. This {{was not the case}} at the short time limit, where D(t) /D 0 was noticeably affected by the gas pressure in the sample. Increasing the gas pressure, and hence reducing D 0 and the diffusion during the gradient pulse served to reduce the previously observed deviation of D(t) /D 0 from the S/Vp relation. The Pade approximation is used to interpolate between the long and short time limits in D(t). While the short time D(t) point lay above the interpolation line in the case of small beads, due to diffusion during the gradient pulse on the order of the pore size, it was also noted that the experimental D(t) data fell below the Pade line in the case of large beads, most likely due to finite size effects.

The unifying principle of this work is showing how the NMR analyses performed with these techniques can be extended to a multiplicity of porous material and how these methods are able to investigate the structure of the pore space and other features in a non-destructive manner, on the intact sample, from the macroscopic scale to the nanometric one. In particular, NMR relaxometry has been applied to the study of coral skeleton modifications due to Ocean Acidification. Skeletal porosity over length scales spanning from tens of nanometers to tens of micrometers was evaluated, giving precious information about the capability of coral to acclimate under adverse conditions. Another application of relaxometry was about the study of water compartmentalization for monitoring viability and water compartmentalization of cell populations kept under stress conditions. Parallel experiments performed by MRI and NMR single-sided techniques were executed in order to test the efficiency of protectives and consolidants applied for preserving and restore carbonate building materials of interest to Cultural Heritage. The study confirmed that quantitative MRI and NMR profiles are excellent tools for evaluating the performance of protective compounds.

When local patches of a metacommunity are identical in environmental conditions but differ in initial community composition, dispersal among patches may result in homogenization of local communities. In a microcosm experiment with benthic ciliates, we tested the hypothesis that {{the effect of}} connectivity on diversity is time-dependent and only transitory, with the degree of connectivity affecting the time to homogenization but not the final outcome. Six microcosms were connected to a metacommunity with one of three levels of connectivity. The six patches differed in initial community composition but were identical in environmental conditions. We found a time-dependent and transitory effect of connectivity on local and regional richness and on local Shannon diversity, while Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and regional Shannon diversity were persistently affected by connectivity. Local richness increased and regional richness decreased with connectivity during the initial phase of the experiment but soon converged to similar values in all three connectivity treatments. Local Shannon diversity was unimodally related to time, with maximum diversity reached sooner with high than with <b>medium</b> or low <b>connectivity.</b> Eventually, however, local diversity converged to similar values irrespective of connectivity. At the regional scale, Shannon diversity was persistently lower with high than with low connectivity.

40|$|Fault damage {{zones are}} known to be more complex in linkage zones, relays and at fault tips. From a {{reservoir}} perspective, these damage complexities may act as conduits or barriers for fluid flow, hence they need to be understood and quantified. This study quantifies the fracture network properties of three different damage zone types: damage occurring around stage 2 to 4 relay ramps, splay faults and fault tips. Specifically, the connectivity is quantified by the use of topology. Topology uses fracture intersections and endpoints to quantify the relationships between fractures within a fracture network, by the use of nodes and branches. A topological approach is used on 18 damage zones in the study area, Ras ir Raheb, on the west coast of Malta. This area shows excellent outcrops of small-scale (throw less than 1 m) normal faults formed in carbonate rocks. Analysis of the topology and geometry of the studied damage zones show that: the connectivity is lower in stage 2 relay damage zones and fault tips compared to stage 3 relay damage zones and splay fault damage zones. The greatest connectivity is documented in stage 4 relay damage zones, which indicates that connectivity develops with maturity. Circular sub-samples, fracture intensity- and connecting node frequency maps are used to analyse spatial variability within the damage zones. Results show that the higher values are localised in areas of bifurcation and linkage. The topological characteristics of studied damage zones may be used as proxies for different stages of fault and damage zone evolution, with fault tips representing an early stage, and hard-linked relays and splays representing further progressed stages of growth and linkage. Using this as a basis, a model for the development of connectivity in evolving extensional fault networks is presented: 1) fault initiation stage; multiple isolated faults are active, resulting in numerous fault tip damage zones. The fault network is immature at this stage, hence a low connectivity. 2) Interaction and linkage stage; faults start to interact and link, ergo the fault network becomes more connected and show a <b>medium</b> <b>connectivity.</b> 3) Through-going fault zones; deformation continues and becomes localised along a few through-going faults, consequently the fault network shows the highest degree of connectivity. The use of topology increases our understanding of network properties of damage zones and allow us to explore the evolution of connectivity, both spatially and temporally in damage zones and other fracture networks...|$|R

Utilizando tÃ©cnicas de ressonÃ¢ncia MagnÃ©tica Nuclear (RMN) de 29 Si, 7 Li, 23 Na, 13 C e 1 H, foi analisada a estrutura do gel, dos minerais e dos produtos resultantes dos tratamentos e de ataques com soluÃ§Ãµes alcalinas. Os resultados mostram que a estrutura de silicatos no gel Ã© lamelar formada principalmente por silicatos do tipo Q 3 e a aplicaÃ§Ã£o de soluÃ§Ãµes de LiNO 3 provoca uma transformaÃ§Ã£o para um silicato de tipo linear. Esta alteraÃ§Ã£o, eliminado os espaÃ§os interlamelares capazes de absorver Ã¡gua e causar expansÃ£o coletiva da estrutura, explica o efeito observado de reduÃ§Ã£o da expansÃ£o pelos tratamentos com Li. Por outro lado, apÃ³s exposiÃ§Ã£o ao MTMS nÃ£o foi detectada interaÃ§Ã£o dos silicatos pertencentes ao gel com os grupos SiCH 3, indicando autocondensaÃ§ao dos silanos. Com relaÃ§Ã£o ao ataque dos minerais reativos, foram detectadas mudanÃ§as na distribuiÃ§Ã£o de espÃ©cie de silicatos Qn nas trÃªs rochas. No basalto e no granito existe um aumento da fraÃ§Ã£o de espÃ©cies Q 1 e Q 4 com relaÃ§Ã£o ao mineral original. No quartzito as diferenÃ§as sÃ£o maiores em {{magnitude}} e dependem dos parÃ¢metros do ataque: temperatura e tempo de ataque. O aumento da temperatura dissolve os silicatos amorfos de conectividade baixa e mÃ©dia (Q 0, Q 1 e Q 2) e produz um silicato altamente conexo formado por espÃ©cies Q 3 e Q 4. O aumento do tempo de ataque Ã  temperatura ambiente nÃ£o produz transformaÃ§Ãµes apreciÃ¡veis na parte amorfa, mas sim dissoluÃ§Ã£o de silicatos Q 4 pertencentes a grÃ£os de quartzo de maior tamanho. The {{alkali-silica reaction}} (ASR) occurs between structurally distorted or disordered silica and aqueous solutions of alkaline hydroxides, as KOH or NaOH. The {{product of the}} ASR is an alkali-silicate gel, which may expand upon water absorption. When the ASR occurs in mineral aggregate used in concrete, the process of reaction and expansion cause the decrease in the mechanical resistance of the structure. In this work, a structural study was carried out to analyze {{the effect on the}} gel of two processes proposed respectively to mitigate the expansion and prevent the ASR: the treatment with LiNO 3 and the application of methyltrimethoxysilane (MTSM, Si(OCH 3) 3 CH 3). Also, the reactivity of three minerals (basalt, granite and quartzite) commonly used as aggregates was analyzed, simulating the ASR in laboratory conditions. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques of 29 Si, 7 Li, 23 Na, 13 C e 1 H in the solid state were applied to analyze the structure of the gel, the minerals and the products resulting from treatments and the attack with alkaline solutions (KOH). The results show that the silicate network in the gel is a lamellar structure, composed mainly by Q 3 silicates, which is transformed into a linear structure upon the treatment with LiNO 3 solutions. This modification, eliminating the inter-lamellar spaces capable to host water and cause the collective expansion of the structure, explain the reduction in the expansion observed in mortar or concrete structures treated with Li. On the other hand, after exposing gel samples to MTMS aqueous solutions, no interaction of the silicate groups in the gel with SiCH 3 groups were detected, indicating auto-condensation of silane in these samples. With respect to the attack of the reactive minerals, some changes were detected in the distribution of Qn silicate species in the three rocks. In attacked basalt and granite there is an increase in the fraction of Q 1 and Q 4 with respect to the original minerals. In attacked quartzite the differences are mores strong and depend on the reaction parameters: temperature and time of attack. The increment in temperature dissolve the amorphous silicates of low and <b>medium</b> <b>connectivity</b> (Q 0, Q 1 and Q 2) resulting in a highly connected silicate with Q 3 and Q 4. Conversely, no appreciable transformation in the amorphous silicates were observed during longer attack times at room temperature, but the dissolution of bigger silica particles with well defined Q 4 species was observed...|$|R

For instance, health sensors monitor vital human signs and inform their owner; smart meters measure the energy consumption and relay the information in real time to energy providers and consumers; and smart thermostats optimize heating while reducing costs. Though most IoT devices are designed to work alone, collective operation advances their capabilities. In a smart building application, for instance, several devices from temperature and presence sensors to heating and lighting appliances, cooperate to maximize energy efficiency and comfort. From the application perspective, presence sensors feed lighting and heating appliances with information; from the networking perspective, all these sensors and actuators relay each other's traffic for <b>connectivity</b> (if the <b>medium</b> is wireless). Without cooperation context awareness fails and wireless multi-hop networks collapse. Unfortunately, when the altruistic act of cooperation is costly, devices become selfish. For a battery-powered device, forwarding a neighbor's packet increases its energy consumption and consequently, decreases its lifetime. Therefore, that device does not cooperate and refrains from forwarding foreign packets. When all nodes in a wireless network follow the same reasoning, none of the packets are relayed, and consequently the network gets disconnected. In this thesis, first, we investigate the mechanisms and incentives for cooperation and reveal that social relations such as family and friendship are crucial. Then, we automate cooperation mechanism for devices based on social relations. Advancing ``smart'' IoT devices by making them ``social'' is becoming a hot topic in IoT research. It is argued that social devices can share their data and assist each other without requiring human intervention and consequently, improve their management. But, {{what is the meaning}} of a social device? Being a social device does not necessarily mean assisting all others by sharing data and forwarding packets. A social device has its own identity and social profile such that it is aware of its owner. The criterion of assisting others is its owner's preferences, which are embedded in social relations. As we prove in the thesis, consumers desire to know to whom they assist, suggesting that peers should be inside the circle of trusted social relations. Social relations are crucial for cooperation, now the question is: how can we automate cooperation decisions based on social relations? Without automation, consumers cannot manage all their devices' interactions. The reason is that IoT imposes the challenge of scaling up to billions of devices such that each person will be equipped with tens of devices. Our solution is a decentralized architecture where every device is identified by a URI that points to the social profile of that device. Ownership relations are declared in this social profile. When a resource server (e. g., light bulb, temperature sensor) receives a request from a client device (e. g., smartphone), the resource server crawls the client's and its owner's social profile. If the resource server discovers a social relation that grants access, it responds positively to the client's request. Unlike centralized approaches, our decentralized proposal protects privacy, provides end-to-end security, and can operate without an Internet connection. The drawback of our approach is the complexity of searching decentralized social profiles especially for indirect relations such as friend-of-a-friend. For unconstrained devices, we limit the search space based on proximity. In an access point (AP) scenario, the AP overhears WiFi beaconing messages from clients to discover their existence. For constrained devices, the whole search operation is delegated to a more resourceful cloud service. Our solutions for social network integration depend on secured identity information. Unfortunately, highly constrained devices that have less than 20 ~KBs of memory cannot be protected from identity-related attacks. These constrained devices can neither punish their defector neighbors nor reward only cooperators. They either cooperate always and are exploited by free-riders or defect always and disrupt network traffic. In this thesis, we offer adaptability to these devices via meta-strategies that only require local information. Devices overhear the traffic in their neighborhood and practice the best local strategy (defection or cooperation). We show that even if free-riders change their identities, meta-strategies protect them against exploitation while still promoting cooperation throughout the network. All in all, in this thesis we make a few stepts towards the goal of autonomous cooperation in IoT; and in particular we show that 1. social relations are crucial in cooperation decisions, 2. decentralized social-device networks (proposed in this thesis) can automate cooperation and provide secure-by-default IoT systems, 3. constrained devices that are vulnerable to identity-change attacks can protect themselves by observing the traffic in their neighborhood.
