5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes have hit the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history.

According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection.

5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the HP and MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{sideline}} 4...g5, {{the main line}} continues with both players developing their pieces around the e5-pawn with 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+ when White has an important choice between the moves 6.Nc3 and 6.Nbd2, each leading to extremely different play. With 6.Nc3 White acquiesces to the breakup of his queenside pawns {{in return for a}} material advantage of one pawn, the bishop pair and active play in the centre. With 6.Nbd2 White gives back the gambited pawn to keep a healthy pawn structure and acquire the bishop pair. After 6.Nbd2Qe7 White generally plays 7.a3 to force the immediate exchange of bishop for knight, gaining the bishop pair, a spatial advantage and <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> a minority attack on the queenside. White can also try 6.Nbd2Qe7 7.e3 to win a tempo over the 7.a3 variation, though he may end up with the exchange at d2 made in less favourable circumstances, or not at all.

5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him {{to hold on to the}} ball, his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E

Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it to her as a gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many <b>chances</b> <b>for</b> women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
