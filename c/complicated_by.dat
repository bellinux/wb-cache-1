5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the lack of vehicle crossings along the railway line—there were only two, one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E

5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{fell ill}} on September 20, 1929, and checked into Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center for erysipelas.

5|$|Identification of {{the film}} in showings and reviews is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the {{existence}} of Pat Power's The Woman Hater. Though it bears the same name, the film was released on November 26, 1910. It was the Powers film that was rediscovered in New Zealand in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Meredith recovers {{enough to}} start seeing Nathan Riggs, Owen Hunt's former best friend, by season 13, {{although}} their relationship is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Maggie confesses to Meredith that she has feelings for Riggs and Meredith {{is not ready to}} declare their relationship formally or publicly. Eventually she accepts her relationship with Riggs, but it's <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the unexpected return of Owen's sister, Megan Hunt, Riggs' fiancée. Meredith finds herself in another love triangle when Megan rejects Riggs because he is still in love with Meredith, but Meredith pushes them to be together. After her relationship with Riggs ends, Meredith is nominated for a Harper Avery Award for her groundbreaking surgery on Megan. In the penultimate 300th episode, after failing to attend the award ceremony to stay for a medical trauma, post surgery Meredith learns with all her closest friends in the OR room thag she has won the Harper Avery Award.|$|E
5|$|Native (i.e., elemental) {{selenium}} {{is a rare}} mineral, {{which does}} not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals.

5|$|The UK Film Council {{awarded the}} {{production}} £1million in June 2009. Filming began in December 2009, and lasted 39 days. Most {{was shot in}} the three weeks before Christmas because Rush would be performing in a play in January. The schedule was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> Bonham Carter's availability: she worked on Harry Potter during the week, so her scenes had to be filmed during the weekend.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestic}} political environment was further <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> {{the death of}} Paul Eyschen, who had been Prime Minister for 27 years.

5|$|The {{inconclusive}} {{nature of}} the hearings helped to foster continued speculation as to the {{nature of the}} mystery, and the story has repeatedly been <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> false detail and fantasy.

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses is <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> having {{multiple}} infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell {{rather than in the}} nucleus. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses, the most important of which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%.

Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.|$|E
5|$|Treatment is with {{anticoagulants}} (medication that suppresses blood clotting), {{and rarely}} thrombolysis (enzymatic {{destruction of the}} blood clot). Given that there is usually an underlying cause for the disease, tests may be performed to look for these.

5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition. In 2004 the city of Aspen {{and the town of}} Snowmass jointly funded design work for another new bridge. CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was <b>complicated</b> <b>by</b> the fact that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) felt obliged to seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him {{into contact with the}} more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
