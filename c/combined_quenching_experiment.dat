40|$|The {{state of}} {{aggregation}} of potassium channel KcsA was determined {{as a function of}} lipid:protein molar ratio in bilayer membranes of the zwitterionic lipid phosphatidylcholine (PC) and of the anionic lipid phosphatidylglycerol (PG). EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) with spin-labeled phospholipids was used to determine the number of motionally restricted lipids per KcsA tetramer. Unexpectedly, this number decreased with a decreasing lipid:KcsA tetramer molar ratio in the range of 88 : 1 to 30 : 1, consistent with sharing of annular lipid shells and KcsA–KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. Fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> with brominated phospholipids showed a decrease in fluorescence quenching at low lipid:KcsA tetramer mole ratios, also consistent with KcsA–KcsA contact at high mole fractions of protein. The effects of low mole ratios of lipid seen in EPR and fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> were more marked in bilayers of PC than in bilayers of PG, suggesting stronger association of PG than PC with KcsA.

40|$|Steady-state {{fluorescence}} oxygen <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> {{were performed}} on phospholipid vesicles where 2 -dimethylamino- 6 -lauroylnaphthalene (Laurdan) was inserted. The quenching efficiency {{was found to be}} much higher in vesicles in the liquid-crystalline phase with respect to the gel phase, by a factor of about 50. Since the oxygen solubility in the two phospholipid phases can differ at most by a factor of 4 based on literature values, we concluded that oxygen diffusion must be responsible for the great difference in the quenching efficiency. A relatively high quenching efficiency was also found in vesicles composed of equimolar gel and liquid-crystalline phospholipids. Simulations were performed using the linear superposition of the properties of the pure phases to demonstrate that, in the case of vesicles composed of coexisting phases, the diffusional properties of oxygen in each phase are largely modified by the presence of the other. The addition of 10 mol% cholesterol to the gel phase rendered Laurdan fluorescence approximately as quenchable as in the equimolar mixture of the two phases. This result points out that molecules such as cholesterol, which introduce packing defects in the bilayer, favor oxygen diffusion. From the oxygen <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> and using the properties of generalized polarization, the rate of Laurdan dipolar relaxation can be estimated. © 1992 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|R
