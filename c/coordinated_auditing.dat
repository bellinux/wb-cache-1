Building on the technical work of the Health Metrics Network on HIS and starting with a systemic definition of HIS in emergencies, this paper reviews the various data-collection platforms in these contexts, looking at their respective contributions to providing what humanitarian actors {{need to know to}} target their intervention to where the needs really are. Although reporting or sampling errors are unavoidable, it is important to identify them and acknowledge the limitations inherent in generalizing data that were collected in highly heterogeneous environments. To perform well in emergencies, HIS require integration and participation. In spite of notable efforts to coordinate data collection and dissemination practices among humanitarian agencies, it is noted that coordination on the ground depends on the strengths and presence of a lead agency, often WHO, and on the commitment of humanitarian agencies to investing resources in data production.

40|$|Objectives [...] To {{determine}} {{the role of}} medical audit advisory groups in audit activities in general practice. Design [...] Postal questionnaire survey. Subjects [...] All 104 advisory groups in England and Wales in 1994. Main measures [...] Monitoring audit: the methods used to classify audits, the methods used by the advisory group {{to collect data on}} audits from general practices, the proportion of practices undertaking <b>audit.</b> Directing and <b>coordinating</b> audits: topics and number of practices participating in multipractice audits. Results [...] The response rate was 86 - 5 %. In 1993 - 4, 54 % of the advisory groups used the Oxfordshire or Kirklees methods for classifying audits, or modifications of them. 99 % of the advisory groups collected data on audit activities at least once between 1991 - 2 and 1993 - 4. Visits, questionnaires, and other methods were used to collect information from all or samples of practices in each of the advisory group's areas. Some advisory groups used different methods in different years. In 1991 - 2, 57 % of all practices participated in some audit, in 1992 - 3, 78 %, and in 1993 - 4, 86 %. 428 multipractice audits were identified. The most popular topic was diabetes. Conclusions [...] Advisory groups have been active in monitoring audit in general practice. However, the methods used to classify and collect information about audits in general practices varied widely. The number of practices undertaking audit increased between 1991 - 2 and 1993 1.

40|$|In Tanzania, {{there is}} paucity of data for {{monitoring}} laboratory medicine including haematology. This therefore calls for audits of practices in haematology and blood transfusion {{in order to}} provide appraise practice and devise strategies that would result in improved quality of health care services. This descriptive cross-sectional study which audited laboratory practice in haematology and blood transfusion at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) aimed at assessing the pre-analytical stage of laboratory investigations including laboratory request forms and handling specimen processing in the haematology laboratory and assessing the chain from donor selection, blood component processing to administration of blood during transfusion. A national standard checklist was used to audit the laboratory request forms (LRF), phlebotomists' practices on handling and assessing the from donor selection to administration of blood during transfusion. Both interview and observations were used. A total of 195 LRF were audited and 100 % of had incomplete information such as patients' identification numbers, time sample ordered, reason for request, summary of clinical assessment and differential diagnoses. The labelling of specimens was poorly done by phlebotomists/clinicians in 82 % of the specimens. Also 65 % (132 / 202) of the blood samples delivered in the haematology laboratory did not contain the recommended volume of blood. There was no laboratory request form specific for ordering blood and there were no guidelines for indication of blood transfusion in the wards/clinics. The blood transfusion laboratory section was not participating in external quality assessment and the hospital transfusion committee was not in operation.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{conclusions of}} the fourth report of the Joint Cardiology Committee are: 1 Cardiovascular disease remains {{a major cause of}} death and morbidity in the population and of utilisation of medical services. 2 Reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease is feasible, and better co-ordination is required of strategies most likely to be effective. 3 Pre-hospital care of cardiac emergencies, in particular the provision of facilities for defibrillation, should continue to be developed. 4 There remains a large shortfall in provision of cardiological services with almost one in five district hospitals in England and Wales having no physician with the appropriate training. Few of the larger districts have two cardiologists to meet the recommendation for populations of over 250, 000. One hundred and fifty extra consultant posts (in both district and regional centres) together with adequate supporting staff and facilities are urgently needed to provide modest cover for existing requirements. 5 The provision of coronary bypass grafting has expanded since 1985, but few regions have fulfilled the unambitious objectives stated in the Third Joint Cardiology Report. 6 The development of coronary angioplasty has been slow and haphazard. All regional centres should have at least two cardiologists trained in coronary angioplasty and there should be a designated budget. Surgical cover is still required for most procedures and is best provided on site. 7 Advances in the management of arrhythmias, including the use of specialised pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and percutaneous or surgical ablation of parts of the cardiac conducting system have resulted in great benefit to patients. Planned development of the emerging sub-specialty of arrhythmology is required. 8 Strategies must be developed to limit the increased exposure of cardiologists to ionising radiation which will result from the expansion and increasing complexity of interventional procedures. 9 Supra-regional funding for infant cardiac surgery and transplantation has been successful and should be continued. 10 Despite advances in non-invasive diagnosis of congenital heart disease the amount of cardiac catheterisation of children has risen due to the increase in number of interventional procedures. Vacant consultant posts in paediatric cardiology and the need for {{an increase in the number}} of such posts cannot be filled from existing senior registrar posts. All paediatric cardiac units should have a senior registrar and in the meantime it may be necessary to make proleptic appointments to consultant posts with arrangements for the appointees to complete their training. 11 Provision of care for the increasing number of adolescent and adult survivors of complex congenital heart disease is urgently required. The management of these patients is specialised, and the committee recommends that it should ultimately be undertaken by either adult or pediatric cardiologists with appropriate additional training working in supra-regionally funded centers alongside specially trained surgeons. 12 Cardiac rehabilitation should be available to all patients in the United Kingdom. 13 New recommendations for training in cardiology are for a total of at least five years in the specialty after general professional training, plus a year as senior registrar in general medicine. An additional year may be required for those wishing to work in interventional cardiology and adequate provision must be made for those with an academic interest. 14 It is essential that both basic and clinical research is carried out in cardiac centres but these activities are becoming increasingly limited by the lack of properly funded posts in the basic sciences and restriction in the number of honorary posts for clinical research workers. 15 A joint audit committee of the Royal College of Physicians and the British Cardiac Society has been established to <b>coordinate</b> <b>audit</b> in the specialty. All district and regional cardiac centres should cooperate with the work of the committee, in addition to their participation in local audit activities...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, the {{nationwide}} Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit (DSCA) was {{initiated by the}} Association of Surgeons of the Netherlands (ASN) to monitor, evaluate and improve colorectal cancer care. The DSCA is currently widely used as a blueprint for the initiation of other <b>audits,</b> <b>coordinated</b> by the Dutch Institute for Clinical Auditing (DICA). This article illustrates key elements of the DSCA and results of three years of auditing. Key elements include: a leading role of the professional association with integration of the audit in the national quality assurance policy; web-based registration by medical specialists; weekly updated online feedback to participants; annual external data verification with other data sources; improvement projects. In two years, all Dutch hospitals participated in the audit. Case-ascertainment was 92 % in 2010 and 95 % in 2011. External data verification by comparison with the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) showed high concordance of data items. Within three years, guideline compliance for diagnostics, preoperative multidisciplinary meetings and standardised reporting increased; complication-, re-intervention and postoperative mortality rates decreased significantly. The success of the DSCA {{is the result of}} effective surgical collaboration. The leading role of the ASN in conducting the audit resulted in full participation of all colorectal surgeons in the Netherlands. By integrating the audit into the ASNs' quality assurance policy, it could be used to set national quality standards.

40|$|In {{recent years}} Nepal has progressed from a “low HIV prevalence” country to {{one with a}} {{so-called}} concentrated HIV epidemic in certain sub-groups of the population (e. g. sex workers and injecting drug users). Responding to this, national HIV/AIDS prevention efforts have focused on increasing correct and consistent usage of condoms among these groups. To support these efforts, this innovative research project was designed to use GIS to measure condom coverage, quality of coverage and access to condoms among women working in hot-zones, so as to facilitate more targeted marketing and distribution of condoms in these high-risk areas. The study {{was carried out in}} 15 of the 75 districts (defined administrative boundaries) of Nepal to assist evidence-based program-related decisions, and to monitor product and service performance. These 15 districts are combined into four geographically-defined study areas: (1) Kathmandu valley, (2) Dhading-Nabalparasi-Chitwan and Makawanpur district; (3) Rupandehi-Kailali Districts and (4) Kaski districts (see map 1). The study focused on geographic areas where high-risk commercial heterosexual activity was known to take place, as women working in these areas are the largest group infected with HIV. The study uses two sets of tools: GPS units to collect GIS <b>coordinates,</b> and <b>audit</b> administration in retail outlets to collect relevant information on condom products in the 19 sample hot-zones {{in each of the four}} study areas using systematic random sampling as suggested by the Lot Quality Assurance Survey (LQAS) method. This is pioneering work because it has created well defined hot-zones for targeted programmatic interventions. The hot zones can also be used to collect additional information that can be linked to assess program performance as well as monitor market performance over time, particularly the objectively verifiable product/service delivery. This study found that overall condom coverage in Nepal is good, with over 70 percent of hot zones having at least one condom-selling retail outlet per five high-risk meeting places. Donor subsidized condom (subsidized by donor and distributed by the social marketing company of Nepal) coverage ranged from 35 percent to 95 percent, while non-subsidized (condom sold by private marketers) condom brand coverage ranged from 20 percent to 85 percent. Despite this good condom coverage, the quality of condom coverage remains very poor, primarily due to low product and promotional material visibility, as well as few hot zones having the appropriate number of condom-selling outlets open at night. The ‘access to condom’ indicator was moderately strong in Kathmandu, with approximately 60 percent of hot spots having a condom-selling outlet within 100 meters. Outside of the Kathmandu valley, however, the results for this indicator were poor: approximately 15 percent of hot spots had a condom-selling outlet within 100 meters. The study has highlighted the need to focus programmatic efforts to enhance accessibility to condom-selling outlets and quality of coverage. For accessibility, resources should be used to increase the number of condom-selling outlets in hot zones. For quality of coverage, efforts should focus on increasing the number of outlets displaying condoms and promotional materials and the number of outlets open at night, perhaps through an incentive scheme. The research findings are the proof to improve condom provision in practice through public-donor-private partnership...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to show the {{regional}} inequalities and special features of Central and Eastern Europe which is considered a region still in transition. In other words, the purpose is to classify cities and urban regions. Today, we can see a revival of urban research. As focal points of regional and national economic growth, development and competitiveness, cities are the venues of spatial processes taking place in a fairly concentrated form. This study seeks to describe today’s major efforts in the field of city and urban region analyses as well as to highlight the various interpretations and methodologies of the same. Furthermore, the study identifies urban performance indicators and “draws” a map of the urban network of Central and Eastern Europe. Based on numerous literature sources, the study deals with several spatial levels from the “actual” urban level to the research projects completed at a regional level. The study starts by presenting spatial and methodological information on the flagships (the so-called MEGA areas) of polycentric regional development, and arrives at an important conclusion about the primary role played by Berlin and Vienna in the region. Actually, the “new” capitals represent the secondary line, while the weak MEGAs at the bottom of the urban hierarchy act as development hubs in the region. Even the contours of a new integration zone become visible in the region. This zone is forming along Pan-European corridor VI with the involvement of Vienna, Prague, Bratislava, Budapest (and Zagreb). Another major data source for urban-level measurements is the urban <b>audit,</b> <b>coordinated</b> by Eurostat, which has already supplied databases for a multitude of studies. This source represents a substantial innovation in urban research efforts as it includes multi-layer data, contains long statistical data series and allows comparisons in both time and space. Nevertheless, it also has many disadvantages including, in particular, lack of data and national features in the delimitation of urban agglomerations. In my opinion, this fact makes a lot of analytical surveys unreliable. One of the most widespread analyses of the rural/urban issue is the version adapted to NUTS 3 and based on population density. Developed formerly by the OECD, this model has undergone many changes. As a result, its recent versions place greater emphasis on the role of cities. The research results of Bengs and Schmidt-Thomé (ESPON 1. 1. 2) have contributed to the clarification of urban-rural relations at the level of NUTS 3. This survey draws the demarcation lines of urban regions in view of population density as well as other factors (central town status of the region, land use indicators). In my effort to further differentiate the notion of the city as a territorial unit, I have found several publications using the expression of metropolitan regions or metro regions. The special region is defined as the cities and urban agglomerations shown in the urban audit, which are manifested at NUTS 3 level(s). Unique efforts are seen in the ESPON FOCI project, where the units of observation are the city areas and their regional hinterland. Accordingly, a city is “not always a city” because its smaller or bigger agglomeration or hinterland is almost always present in the various social or economic surveys of the given region. Based on a review of the main European documents, I may state that the efforts launched to classify cities and urban agglomerations are fairly wide-ranging. What is more, the associated interpretations and methodologies are also diverse. According to my literature review, the primary and supplementary factors of urban performance are the following: economic output, economic structure, accessibility, demography, innovative performance, infocommunications and land use indicators. Similarly to the varied picture found regarding the categorisation of cities and urban agglomerations, the Central and Eastern European urban network is also very differentiated depending on the spatial level of the actual analysis...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the output}} of a deductive research into the emergence, in OECD's countries, of a performance audit system composed of three somewhat <b>coordinated</b> layers: performance <b>audit,</b> internal audit, and internal control. The objective is to anticipate {{the emergence of a}} debate as to the implementation of such a system in federal Belgium. Two research questions are derived: a theoretical one (how to explain the emergence of the research objects?) and an empirical one (do the research objects actually emerge in OECD countries?). Part one reviews the performance audit and sociology of professions literature in search for an explanatory hypothesis. The will of synthesizing the incommensurable but equally relevant hypotheses of functionalism (public audit fulfils a given policy objective) and monopolism (public audit results from the imperialism of the accounting profession) brought forward in both fields leads to adopt Andrew Abbott's System of Profession theory as main theoretical hypothesis. In order to falsify it empirically, it is translated into the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDeF". This means that a given public administration, in order to obtain a jurisdiction like performance audit, internal audit and internal control, should first, claim it ("A"). This claim should moreover fit in a public policy ("B"). Theoretically, these two conditions are sufficient for a jurisdiction to emerge, provided that no other public administration already performs it ("C"). If this jurisdiction is already occupied ("c"), the claimant group should moreover ambit the jurisdiction ("D"), the incumbent must be perceived as having failed to perform its work on a satisfactory way ("e"), and the local system of professions should allow such shifts occurring ("F"). It is proposed to systematically confront empirical evidence from Canada and the Netherlands with this theoretical hypothesis in order to assess its explanatory value. Part two analyses seven cases in Canada. Performance audit emerges shortly after another jurisdiction related to the scientific establishment of the budget. It carries with it another jurisdiction, related to the organization of the departmental production of effectiveness studies to be reviewed by the performance auditor. The latter even tries to federate both groups in a wider one of comprehensive auditors, but fails. Jurisdictions of internal audit and financial internal control are carved out of a more general management jurisdiction {{in the aftermath of a}} political scandal. Part three analyses nine cases in the Netherlands. Performance audit first fails in the absence of a professional provider. It is the delegation of the financial audit jurisdiction to public accountants that frees up the resources for developing performance audit. Internal audit is a remote consequence of this delegation: when a reform expands departmental reports to financial and management information beyond financial one, the public accountants are upgraded to internal auditors; internal control being the object of their work. In the current case study, departmental internal auditors are merging together. Aimed at sparing on financial audit work to develop consulting activities, this episode could threaten at term the performance audit jurisdiction. Part four bridges the gap between theoretical expectations and empirical evidence. After having re-examined the measurement decisions, it proceeds to the cross-case comparison. This confirms that the equation "Y = ABC + ABcDe" adequately explains the emergence of performance audit, internal audit and internal control in the public sector of OECD countries, with, however, two nuances. On the one hand, the within-case analyses have allowed deleting condition "F": theoretically suspending competition, it requires suppression because competition is an emerging phenomenon. On the other hand, the cross-case analysis indicates that conditions "C" and "c" could be deleted from the equation, with an eye on theoretical parsimony: they are somewhat implied by the relevance or not of conditions "D" and "e". But because conditions "C" and "c" allow observing the transition from a non-competitive to a competitive situation, they are kept in the equation in order to emphasize this transition. This finding that a growing share of public administrations tasks are organized in jurisdictions and that this leads over time to the emergence of a competitive system of professions inside the state is discussed as a conclusion: some further research needs on systems are identified, the insights this approach could deliver in Belgium are previewed, and the role of the discipline of public administration in this context of professionalization is considered.
