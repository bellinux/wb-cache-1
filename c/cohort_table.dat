40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding dentists' {{capacity}} to supply dental services over {{time is a}} key element in the process of planning for the future. The aim was to identify time trends and estimate age, period and cohort effects in patients' visits supplied per dentist per year. METHODS: Mailed questionnaires were collected from a random sample of Australian private general practice dentists. The response rates were 73 %, 75 %, 74 %, 71 %, 76 % and 67 % in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2009, respectively. The time trends in the mean number of patient visits supplied per dentist per year (PPY) was described by using a standard <b>cohort</b> <b>table</b> and age-period-cohort analyses applying a nested general linear regression models approach. RESULTS: The mean number of PPY decreased across most age groups of dentists over the time of study. The age-period model showed that younger dentists (20 - 29 years) and older dentists (65 - 74 and 80 - 84 years) had lower PPY than middle-aged dentists, and the age-cohort model showed higher PPY among earlier cohorts, and lower PPY among more recent cohorts. CONCLUSION: The study found a period effect of declining PPY over the observation period. More recent cohorts of dentists provide lower numbers of PPY than earlier cohorts at similar ages, but the provision of PPY among these younger cohorts appeared to be stable as they moved into middle age.

40|$|Background: The cost {{of dental}} care {{may be a}} barrier to regular dental {{attendance}} with {{the proportion of the}} Australian population avoiding or delaying care due to cost increasing since 1994. This paper explores the extent to which age, period and cohort factors have contributed to the variation in avoiding or delaying visiting a dentist because of cost. Methods: Data were obtained from four national dental telephone interview surveys of Australian residents aged five years and over conducted in 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2010 (response rates 48 % - 72 %). The trend in the percentage of persons avoiding or delaying visiting a dentist because of cost was analysed by means of a standard <b>cohort</b> <b>table</b> and more formal age-period-cohort analyses using a nested models framework. Results: There was an overall increase in the proportion of people avoiding or delaying visiting a dentist indicating the presence of period effects. Financial barriers were also associated with age such that the likelihood of avoiding because of cost was highest for those in their mid-late twenties and lowest in both children and older adults. Cohort effects were also present although the pattern of effects differed between cohorts. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that, in addition to the increase in costs associated with dental care, policies targeting specific age groups and income levels may be contributing to the inequality in access to dental care.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the extent to which age, period and cohort factors have contributed to variation in problem-oriented dental visiting over time. Methods: Data were obtained from four National Dental Telephone Interview Surveys of Australian residents aged 5 years and over conducted in 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2010 (response rates 48 – 72 %). The trend in the percentage of persons usually visiting the dentist for a problem was analysed by means of a standard <b>cohort</b> <b>table</b> and by a nested models framework for age–period–cohort analyses. Results : The percentage of persons usually visiting the dentist for a problem generally decreased over the periods examined (from 42. 5 % in 1994 to 31. 5 % in 2010). Problem visiting tended to be lower for children and adolescents compared with adult age groups at each point in time. Model fit tests revealed that the age–period–cohort model provided the best fit for the data (Hosmer–Lemeshow test statistic = 5. 3; d. f. = 8; P-value = 0. 72), indicating that both period and cohort factors were influential in problem visiting. Conclusion: This study found similar, consistent stories for both the age–period and age–cohort models, with usually visiting for a problem tending to be higher in older age groups and older cohorts. Problem visiting tended to decline over time for most age groups and most age cohorts. Understanding patterns of dental service use over time can be used to help inform service delivery policies that promote and facilitate appropriate use of dental services.

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effects of age, period, and birth cohort on cervical cancer mortality rate trends in Japanese women, by age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Additionally, we analyzed projected mortality rates. Methods: We obtained data on the number of cervical cancer deaths in Japanese women from 1975 ? 2011 from the national vital statistics and census population data. A <b>cohort</b> <b>table</b> of mortality rate data was analyzed on the basis of a Bayesian APC model. We also projected the mortality rates for the 2012 ? 2031 period. Results: The period effect was relatively limited, compared with the age and cohort effects. The age effect increased suddenly from 25 ? 29 to 45 ? 49 years of age and gently increased thereafter. An analysis of the cohort effect on mortality rate trends revealed a steep decreasing slope for birth cohorts born from 1908 ? 1940 and a subsequent sudden increase after 1945. The mortality rate projections indicated increasing trends from 40 to 74 years of age until the year 2031. Conclusions: The age effect increased from 25 ? 29 years of age. This could be attributable to the high human papilloma virus (HPV) infection risk and the low cervical cancer screening rate. The cohort effect changed from decreasing to increasing after the early 1940 s. This might be attributable to the spread of cervical cancer screening and treatment before 1940 and the high HPV infection risk and reduced cervical cancer screening rate after 1945. The projected mortality rate indicated an increasing trend until the year 2031. 資料 出版社版は「J-STAGE」で公...|$|E

40|$|Seeking {{to better}} {{understand}} inter-generational continuity of political orientations, this study investigates the relationships among three archetypes of political orientations (tolerance of nonconformists, confidence in people running institutions {{and the strength of}} party affiliation) and enduring versus contemporaneous forces. Birth cohort membership and education are selected to represent the former and the time of survey and media use the latter. ^ Three fundamentals of the present study differ from most prior research in this tradition: First, instead of focusing on different effect models, this study seeks to establish a conceptual structure among outcome variables. Second, the inter-generational continuity is assumed to be cohort-generational rather than lineage-generational, Third, it employs a year-cohort matrix rather than a standard <b>cohort</b> <b>table</b> as the central analytical scheme. ^ Using the NORC General Social Surveys (1972 - 1993), the study tracks eight birth cohorts across twenty-two years to discern change patterns over time. Overall three archetypes and a sub-type emerged from the data. ^ The two tolerance scales and five individual indicators are overwhelmingly affected by enduring forces of one 2 ̆ 7 s birth cohort membership and education. Once formed, these orientations remain relatively stable through life. The patterns found among two confidence scales and six confidence indicators are those of a sweeping time effect. Cohorts 2 ̆ 7 confidence levels are closely 2 ̆ 2 bunched together 2 ̆ 2 and fluctuate from year to year. The strength of party affiliation represents a third archetype, in that we suspect the basic partisanship is fixed by formative experiences but the specific action of affiliating with either party is incited by environmental cues. The resulting change pattern is one of unsynchronized waves. The researcher found a fourth sub-type in confidence in the Supreme Court where enduring forces dictate the responses in the absence of significant contemporaneous forces. ^ Education is reconfirmed as a quintessential {{force to be reckoned with}} when one studies political orientations. Large effects of education are found among all four types of variables, though the mechanism via which education affects each may differ. ...|$|E
40|$|Received: 29 September 2015 Objective: To examine age, {{period and}} cohort factors of dentists in {{relation}} to diagnostic, preventive and total dental services over time in Australia. Method: The Longitudinal Study of Dentists' Practice Activity (LSDPA) was designed to monitor dental practice activity and service provision in Australia. Participating dentists were sampled randomly from the dental registers in Australia from 1983 to 1984, and dental services provision was collected by mailed questionnaire with a log of dental services provided over one or two typical days. The data collection has been repeated every 5 years until 2009 - 2010. Sample supplementation of newly registered dentists occurred at successive waves. This study focused on diagnostic, preventive and total services. The time trends in the mean rates of the services were described using a standard <b>cohort</b> <b>table,</b> and negative binomial regression was applied to estimate age, period and cohort effects. Results: The response rates were 73 %, 75 %, 74 %, 71 %, 76 % and 67 % in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2009, respectively. The mean rates of diagnostic, preventive and total services increased between 1983 and 2009 across all age groups. The period effect showed {{a higher rate of}} diagnostic (rate ratios [RR]: 1. 21 in 1993 to 1. 80 in 2009), preventive (RR: 1. 19 in 1988 to 1. 85 in 2009) and the total service (RR: 1. 08 in 1988 to 1. 39 in 2009) over time, compared with the reference group of 1983. Older cohorts had a lower rate, and the younger cohorts had a higher rate of diagnostic, preventive and the total number of services over the study period. The highest rate of diagnostic (RR= 2. 53), preventive (RR= 2. 44) and the total service (RR= 1. 52) was in those aged 25 - 29 years in 1983 compared with the reference group of 30 - 34 years in 1983. Conclusions: Trends in dental services provision can be associated with age, period and cohort effects. The study found the rate of diagnostic, preventive and total services increased over time. Meanwhile, an increasing rate of diagnostic, preventive and the total services was observed when moving from older cohorts to younger cohorts among Australian dentists suggesting a sustained shift towards these services into the future.

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the age-, period-, and cohort-specific {{effects on the}} male proportion in Japanese newborns, we performed an age-period-Cohort (APC) analysis in this study. In addition, projections for the male proportion were analyzed. Methods: We obtained data on live births of newborns for Japanese women in 1947 ? 2007 from the National Vital Statistics. <b>Cohort</b> <b>tables</b> containing data on the male proportion were analyzed using aBayesian APC model. Projections of the male proportion (2008 ? 2027) were calculated. Results: The age effect decreased when the mothers were 40 ? 44 years old; however, the effect was relatively limited {{as compared with the}} period and cohort effects. The period effect increased from 1947 to 1969 and decreased thereafter. Analysis of the cohort effect on male proportion trends revealed a decreasing slope for birth cohorts born between 1905 and 1945 and a subsequent increase after 1958. The projections for male proportion indicated that the male proportion in 2027 would be similar to that in the 1970 s. Conclusions: The age of the mother hardly affected the male proportion. The period effect started decreasing from {{the latter half of the}} 1960 s. This may be attributable to the high economic growth since 1965 that promoted industrial development that led to environmental pollution, which in turn may have lead to the deterioration of the intrauterine environment. Cohort effects changed from 1958 and exhibited trends toward increase in male proportion; this may be due to improvements in obstetric care. Our results suggest that the male proportion in Japanese newborns will increase in the future. 原著論文 出版社版は「J-STAGE」で公...|$|R

This {{study examined the}} variability of birth cohort trends in international MS data by means of age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. METHODS: The data from 25 countries {{were taken from the}} WHO mortality database. Data were encoded according to the International Classification of Diseases and covered slightly varying periods between 1951 and 2009. The APC analyses were based on logit models applied to <b>cohort</b> <b>tables</b> with 5 -year age- and period intervals. RESULTS: In most countries, the birth cohort estimates peaked in those born {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century. In countries from Central and Western Europe, the peak concerned those born before and around 1920. A second group of countries (Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Ireland, Scotland) shared a later peak amongst cohorts born in the 1920 s and 1930 s.

Objective : Few existing studies offer evidence for how educational gradient in divorce shift from positive to negative in Asia. This study explores the changing divorce patterns by education for both sexes {{over the past four}} decades in Taiwan. Methods : Vital statistics of divorce since 1975 were used. Divorce rates were calculated and a synthetic <b>cohort</b> life <b>table</b> was also constructed to estimate the proportions of unions that remain intact with the duration-specific divorce rates observed in 2010. A separate life table estimating the actual marriage survivorship for the 1998 marriage cohort was also presented. Results : As Taiwan went through industrialization, the period findings show that a reversal in educational differential in divorce from positive to negative is observed for both sexes. Now the least educated men and women have become more vulnerable to union instability. Finally, synthetic <b>cohort</b> life <b>table</b> estimates indicate substantial educational differences in the proportions of recent marriages ending in divorce. Conclusions : The drastic increase in period divorce rates is accompanied by a reversal of educational gradient and expanding social inequality. Social gap in divorce rates expanded much faster among men than women across years. Given that remarriage rates for the disadvantaged are lower than the better educated, these patterns indicate that the disadvantaged is likely to spend an increasingly large proportion of their lives outside a marital union.

40|$|The momentous {{transition}} from high to low mortality – and thereby to modern society – has been thoroughly studied {{by measuring the}} dynamics of mortality by age and sex and by cause of death {{as well as by}} the ubiquitous summary measure, the life expectancy at birth. In the following, we look at it from a slightly different angle, the years added to different stages of life, particularly to old age. Material and method We have used official life tables issued in various countries and collected to a life table archive at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock. We have used period life <b>tables,</b> not <b>cohort</b> <b>tables,</b> in order to observe the historical process. We have simply observed the changes over time in the life table parameter Lx which indicates the years lived at each age by a number of newborn. The Lx column thus corresponds to the stationary population under given mortality conditions and does not reflect changes in the number of births. Increases in Lx values indicate years added to life while decreases indicate losses. Pronounced losses occur often at times of wars and epidemics but minor transitory losses were also observed in various countries in the 1960 s, particularly among middle-aged men. Years added to life in Finland in the 20 th century The early stages of mortality transition which began in Finland towards the end of the 19 th century, were marked, as elsewhere, by a gradual conquest of epidemic diseases, by an improvement in general hygiene and environmental sanitation which all resulted in sharp reductions in infant and child death rates together with more modest progress in adult age...|$|R
