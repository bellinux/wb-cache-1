40|$|Different {{amounts of}} low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) {{were added to}} a bituminous coal used to produce metallurgical coke. The effect of the plastic waste on the carbonization process and more exactly, on the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> were investigated. A movable wall oven at semi-pilot scale was used for measuring <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> generated. It was found that <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> increases for low LDPE addition levels (1 - 3 wt. %); however higher amounts of LDPE reduce <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> To explain this behavior different blends of the coal and the residue were pyrolysed at three different temperatures (450, 500 and 600 C) in a Gray-King apparatus. The results show that LDPE causes a modification in the pyrolysis process and also influences the swelling process of the plastic stage. The increase of the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> at low LDPE addition rates {{is associated with a}} less permeable coal plastic layer, which prevents the removal of the decomposition products and causes their retention in the semicoke matrix, evolving them in the post-plastic stage. <b>Coking</b> <b>pressure</b> decrease at high LDPE addition rates can be due to the charge shrinkage and the better permeability to the migration of oil components, which suggest a lower interaction between the coal and the LDPE. A delay in the degradation of LDPE is confirmed by the data provided by DRIFT and SEM. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Two high-rank {{bituminous}} coals {{and three}} sawdusts of different origin {{were selected to}} study the effect of biomass on <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> The effect of the biomass on the thermoplastic properties of the coals was assessed {{by means of the}} Gieseler test. In addition, the effect of the biomass on the thermal decomposition of the coals was studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis together with the modification of the permeability of the coal plastic phase. The individual coals and the blends were carbonized in a 17 kg movable wall oven; the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> developed was measured {{and the quality of the}} resulting coke was assessed. It was found that the sawdust reduced <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> especially in the case of the coal that developed the highest <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> This effect was attributed to the modification of the permeability of the plastic phase to gas flow. It was concluded that although the addition of sawdust produces a decrease in <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> additions should be limited to small amounts to avoid excessive deterioration of the quality of the product.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of the composition of mixed plastic wastes on the thermoplastic properties of coal, the generation of <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> {{and the quality of the}} resulting cokes in a movable wall oven at semipilot scale. The mixed plastic wastes were selected to cover a wide spectrum in the relative proportions of high- and low-density polyethylenes (HDPE and LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). From the results it was deduced that the reduction in Gieseler fluidity in the coal blend is linked to the total amount of polyolefins in the waste. It was also found that these thermoplastics increase the pressure exerted against the wall in the course of the coking process and that coke quality is maintained or even improved. However, when the level of aromatic polymers such PS and PET are increased at the expense of polyolefins, the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases. Thus, the amount of aromatic polymers such as PS and PET in the waste is critical, not only for controlling Gieseler fluidity and <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> but also for avoiding deterioration in coke quality (reactivity towards CO CRI and mechanical strength of the partially-gasified coke CSR). An amount of polyolefins in the waste lower than 65 wt. % for a secure <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> is established. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|International audienceModelling the water-flow in the vadose zone {{requires}} accurate hydraulic parameters to {{be obtained}} at the relevant scale. Weighable lysimeters {{enable us to}} monitor hydraulic data at an intermediate scale between lab and field scales {{and they can be}} used to optimise these parameters. Parameter optimisation using inverse methods may be limited by the nonuniqueness of the solution. In this contribution, an estimability method has been used to assess the estimability of the van Genuchten-Mualem parameters, to evaluate the information content of the data collected from a bare field lysimeter and to optimise the estimable model parameters. Daily data were monitored from a 2 m 3 lysimeter, filled with the soil of a former <b>coking</b> plant: <b>pressure</b> heads and water contents were measured at three depths (50, 100, 150 cm), cumulative boundary water fluxes. Water-flow was represented using the onedimensional single-porosity model implemented in HYDRUS- 1 D code. The estimability ofthe 5 van Genuchten-Mualem hydraulic parameters and the information content of different data were evaluated by sequentially calculating a sensitivity coefficient matrix. Optimisation was achieved by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The estimability analysis revealed that estimability of the soil hydraulic parameters, based on the combination of daily pressure heads and water contents, was higher than those based on these data separately. In case of 2. 4 being considered as a cut-off criterion for this study, all the parameters were considered estimable from daily data in the decreasing order: θs, n, Ks, α, θr. Hydraulic parameters were optimised in four scenarios: θs and n were estimated with reliability while α, Ks and θr were uncertain. However, the narrow variations in measured data restricted parameter optimisation...|$|R

40|$|Two {{lubricating}} oils, {{a plastic}} waste composed mainly of polyolefins (95 %) and their mixtures (1 : 1 w/w) were assessed for possible use as minor components of coal blends for metallurgical coke production. The addition of 2 wt% plastic waste causes {{a decrease in}} the maximum fluidity of the coal developed during thermal heating between 400 and 500 °C. At the same addition rate, the two oils are good additives for mixing with coal/plastic blends in order to partially restore the caking ability of the co-carbonizing systems. Co-carbonizations of the coking blend with the different wastes were carried out in a movable wall oven of 15 kg capacity. Although the bulk density remained unchanged, the addition of the plastic waste produced an increase in <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> to values that were too high for it to be considered as a safe blend. At the same time the mechanical strength of the partially gasified coke was improved as reflected by the CSR index. The oils, however, had the effect of reducing bulk density and the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> generated during the process. When blended with the coal and the plastics, the oils appeared to act as good solvents of the polyolefins and also proved to be effective in decreasing <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> without negatively affecting coke quality...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} coal blends and pitch/coal blends were {{evaluated}} using rheometry, thermogravimetric analysis and microscopy to confirm and further elucidate the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> mechanism previously proposed by Duffy et al. (2007) [1]. We confirm that blending a low rank, high fluidity, low <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> coal, {{with a high}} rank, low fluidity, high <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> coal can significantly reduce the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> associated with the latter. Interestingly, blending does not necessarily result in a fluidity that is midway between that of the two coals; sometimes the fluidity of the blend is {{less than that of}} the low fluidity coal, especially when the coals are significantly different in rank. This occurs because the increase in complex viscosity (η*) through resolidification of the low rank, high fluidity coal counteracts the reduction in η* resulting from softening of the high rank, low fluidity coal. It has also been confirmed that the η* of the resultant blend can be estimated from the η* of each component coal using a logarithmic additivity rule commonly employed for polymer blends. Polarised light microscopy has indicated that the degree of mixing between coals of different rank is minimal, with fusion restricted to the particle surface. It is therefore inappropriate to think of such a coal blend {{in the same way as}} a single coal, since each component coal behaves relatively independently. This limited fusion is important for understanding the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> mechanism for blends. It is proposed here that the lower rank coal, which softens at lower temperature, is able to expand into the interparticle voids between the high rank coal that is yet to soften, and these voids can create channels for volatiles to traverse. Then, and importantly, when the high rank coal begins to expand, the pore structure developed in the resolidified structures of the low rank coal can facilitate removal of volatiles, while the resolidified material may also act as a suitable sorbent for volatile matter. This is considered to be the primary mechanism by which coal blending is able to alleviate <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> and applies to addition of inert material also. Addition of a coal tar pitch was found to increase fluidity but also to extend the thermoplastic range to lower temperatures. This caused an increase in the swelling range, which was accompanied by a long plateau in η*, a feature which has previously been observed for certain high fluidity, high pressure coals. Elasticity and η* at the onset of expansion were also higher for both the pitch impregnated coals and the high pressure blends, which supports previous findings for singly charged high pressure coals, and confirms the potential use of such criteria for identifying potentially dangerous coals/blends. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|During {{carbonisation}} coal undergoes {{both physical}} and chemical changes that result in the generation of gas and tar {{and the formation of}} an intermediate plastic state. This transformation is known to generate high internal gas pressures for some coals during carbonisation that translate to high pressures at the oven wall. In this study, three low volatile coals A, B and C with oven wall pressures of 100 kPa, 60 kPa and 20 kPa respectively were investigated using high-temperature rheometry, H- 1 NMR, thermogravimetric analysis and SEM, with the primary aim to better understand the mechanisms behind the <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> phenomenon. Rheometer plate displacement measurements (Delta L) have shown differences in the expansion and contraction behaviour of the three coals, which seem to correlate with changes in rheological properties; while SEM images have shown that the expansion process coincides with development of pore structure. It is considered that the point of maximum plate height (Delta L-max) prior to contraction may be indicative of a cell opening or pore network forming process, based on analogies with other foam systems. Such a process may be considered important for <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> since it provides a potential mechanism for volatile escape, relieving internal gas pressure and inducing charge contraction. For coal C, which has the highest fluidity Delta L-max occurs quite early in the softening process and consequently a large degree of contraction is observed; while for the lower fluidity coal B, the process is delayed since pore development and consequently wall thinning progress at a slower rate. When Delta L-max is attained, a lower degree of contraction is observed because the event occurs closer to resolidification where the increasing viscosity/elasticity can stabilise the expanded pore structure. For coal A which is relatively high fluidity, but also high <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> a greater degree of swelling is observed prior to cell rupture, which may be due to greater fluid elasticity during the expansion process. This excessive expansion {{is considered to be a}} potential reason for its high <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This work follows on {{from two}} papers which {{presented}} a hypothesis for the mechanism behind oven wall pressure. It was proposed that oven wall pressure results when {{the period of}} pore growth is lengthy prior to coalescence and/or the period of coalescence is minor ahead of resolidification. When this occurs a thick swollen band of closed pores in the viscoelastic medium results which exerts pressure on the oven walls. The band is a resistance to volatile transfer and the largely closed pore network remains throughout resolidification further exacerbating pressure on oven walls. This hypothesis has resulted from a mapping of the viscoelastic properties obtained from a rheometer against the plate behaviour of the rheometer where pore nucleation and growth has been characterised {{by an increase in}} plate gap (ΔL) when the plate is held under constant axial force (AF) or an increase AF when the plates are held at constant gap. Pore coalescence has been characterised by a peak in AF or a decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL. Because the behaviour of either ΔL or AF has brought about our understanding of <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> this paper attempts to prove that pore coalescence can be monitored from plate behaviour. As such this paper attempts to track pore growth and coalescence using mercury porosimetry, permeability, scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy, all of which have been carried out on quenched coke samples. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that the ΔL profile provides an accurate account of the onset of bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence. Porosity measurements indicate that the proportion of open pores in the 1 - 100 μm range increases significantly after the peak in AF or decrease in the rate of expansion of ΔL, indicating that these points coincide with a bubble coalescence phenomena. Optical microscopy showed a distinct difference in pore structure between the image corresponding to the peak in axial force and images after, whereby the number of isolated cells decreased and pore walls became thinner. Permeability measurements on quenched samples throughout the softening process show an initial drop in permeability due to the loss of interparticle voidage and the onset of swelling followed by a steady increase coinciding with the peak in axial force and decrease in the rate of ΔL expansion. This work has helped to reinforce the proposed mechanism for <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> Furthermore, permeability measurements of quenched samples at 550 °C show that the high pressure coals tend to have the lower permeabilities at this temperature. The finding that pore growth and coalescence behaviour is what impacts on <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> has opened the door for finding novel ways to manipulate pore behaviour and therefore manipulate <b>coking</b> <b>pressure.</b> Understanding and manipulating pore growth behaviour has other implications, largely the understanding for coke strength development, which is currently being explored by the authors...|$|E
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that <b>coking</b> <b>pressure</b> originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized vapours trapped within the plastic layer of the carbonizing coal charge. Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the porous structure of coke is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of <b>coking</b> <b>pressure,</b> coke porous structure and coke carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall oven charges. These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|E
