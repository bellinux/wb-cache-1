5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his <b>characterisation</b> of Bond: his taste for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his <b>characterisation</b> had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} (in Eucaryota ~33%) contain large unstructured but biologically functional segments and can {{be classified}} as intrinsically disordered proteins. Predicting and analysing protein disorder is, therefore, {{an important part of}} protein structure <b>characterisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tacitus' {{narrative}} emphasizes {{both political}} and psychological motivation. The <b>characterisation</b> of Tiberius throughout the first six books is mostly negative, and gradually worsens as his rule declines, identifying a clear breaking point {{with the death of}} his son Drusus in 23 AD.|$|E
40|$|Evolutionary {{techniques}} {{driven by}} behavioural diversity, such as novelty search, have shown significant potential in evo-lutionary robotics. These techniques rely on priorly speci-fied behaviour <b>characterisations</b> {{to estimate the}} similarity be-tween individuals. <b>Characterisations</b> are typically defined in an ad hoc manner based on the experimenter’s intuition and knowledge about the task. Alternatively, generic characteri-sations based on the sensor-effector values of the agents are used. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that al-lows for systematic derivation of behaviour <b>characterisations</b> for evolutionary robotics, based on a formal description of the agents and their environment. Systematically derived be-haviour <b>characterisations</b> (SDBCs) go beyond generic char-acterisations in that they can contain task-specific features re-lated to the internal state of the agents, environmental fea-tures, and relations between them. We evaluate SDBCs with novelty search in three simulated collective robotics tasks. Our results show that SDBCs yield a performance compa-rable to the task-specific <b>characterisations,</b> {{in terms of both}} solution quality and behaviour space exploration...|$|R

These <b>characterisations</b> {{are applied to}} establish new (and recover existing) <b>characterisations</b> of Pfister forms. We establish "going-up" results for group and anisotropic round forms with respect to iterated Laurent series fields, which contrast with the established results with respect to rational function field extensions. For forms of two-power dimension, we determine when there exists a field extension over which the form becomes an anisotropic group form that is not round. Comment: 12 page...|$|R
5|$|Another {{difference}} in Troilus' <b>characterisation</b> from the Filostrato {{is that he}} is no longer misogynistic in the beginning. Instead of mocking lovers because of their putting trust in women, he mocks them because of how love affects them. Troilus' vision of love is stark: total commitment offers total fulfilment; any form of failure means total rejection. He is unable to comprehend the subtleties and complexities that underlie Criseyde's vacillations and Pandarus' manoeuvrings.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on <b>characterisation.</b> He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his <b>characterisation</b> on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female <b>characterisation</b> undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and tough, too.|$|E

In a continuing story arc for the third series, Nicola Walker was cast {{in the role of}} Helen Bartlett, a character driven to emotional instability by past events unearthed by the Manchester Metropolitan Police. In preparation for the role Walker visited a psychologist in order to build upon her <b>characterisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her <b>characterisation</b> and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers have {{generally}} responded positively {{to the complexity}} of Gwen's character and Eve Myles' portrayal, though critics found fault with her more prosaic <b>characterisation</b> earlier on. Eve Myles' portrayal of Gwen has been cited as effective in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent. Myles received a Welsh BAFTA for the first series of the show and was nominated for several other acting awards across each of Torchwoods four series'.|$|E

5|$|Ernst Stavro Blofeld's name {{partially}} {{comes from}} Tom Blofeld, a Norfolk farmer {{and a fellow}} member of Fleming's club Boodle's, who was a contemporary of Fleming's at Eton. Tom Blofeld's son is Henry Blofeld, a sports journalist, {{best known as a}} cricket commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio. For Blofeld's pseudonym in the novel, Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, Fleming uses the name of an old café he had seen in Hamburg in 1959 ("Old Shatterhand", a fictional character penned in a series of Western stories along with Winnetou by German writer Karl May) The <b>characterisation</b> of him dressed as a Samurai was taken from the sketch Fleming had come up with thirty five years earlier for a character called Graf Schlick.|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's <b>characterisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Havins was {{influenced}} in {{her decision to}} accept the part by her husband's appreciation of the series. Like Rex, Esther is used by executive producer Russell T Davies {{as a means of}} introducing new American audiences to the established mythos of Torchwood. Havins stated the character to have an unrequited love for Rex, but explained that he does not appear to notice. Response to the character varied; some critics praised her <b>characterisation</b> and portrayal whilst others felt her to display incompetency and to not have been taken to by the audience. The nature of her exit from the show was generally praised, though some reviewers felt it lacked the desired emotional impact.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} obtaining logical <b>characterisations</b> of oracle complexity classes. In particular, we {{consider the}} complexity classes LOGSPACE NP and PTIME NP. For these classes, <b>characterisations</b> are known in terms of NP computable Lindstrom quantifiers which hold on ordered structures. We show that these <b>characterisations</b> are unlikely to extend to arbitrary (unordered) structures, since this would imply the collapse of certain exponential complexity hierarchies. We also observe, however, that PTIME NP can be characterised in terms of Lindstrom quantifers (not necessarily NP computable), though it remains open whether {{this can be done}} for LOGSPACE NP. 1 Introduction Since Fagin showed that existential second order logic captures the class NP [7], and Immerman and Vardi characterised PTIME in terms of least fixed point logic [14, 25], a large number of complexity classes have been given logical <b>characterisations,</b> and a tight correspondence has been established betwe [...] ...|$|R

The quick process machine {{is a type}} of process machine first considered in work of Levin and Zvonkin. A new technique for building process machines and quick process machines is presented. This technique is similar to the KC theorem for prefix-free machines. Using this technique, a method of translating computable martingales to quick process machines is given. This translation forms the basis for these new randomness <b>characterisations.</b> Quick process machines are also used to provide <b>characterisations</b> of computable randomness, Schnorr randomness, and weak randomness in terms of truth-table reducibility...|$|R
5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on <b>characterisation</b> to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 620s or early 630s, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, the British (Welsh) king of Gwynedd, became {{involved}} in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who {{is thought to have}} been the lesser partner in their alliance, to defeat the Northumbrians in October 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. Penda was probably not yet king of the Mercians, but he is thought to have become king soon afterwards, based on Bede's <b>characterisation</b> of his position. Edwin was killed in the battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda's hands.|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of <b>characterisation</b> and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the <b>characterisation</b> of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories about it that differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of <b>characterisation</b> have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|Within the APOA5 gene, {{a couple}} of {{important}} SNPs with a widely confirmed effect on plasma TG levels as well as rare mutations have been described. In Caucasians, the common variants are inherited mostly in three haplotypes, which are characterised by two SNPs, namely rs662799 (T-1131˃C; in almost complete LD with A-3˃G, where the minor allele is associated with about 50% lower gene expression) and rs3135506 (Ser19˃Trp; C56˃G; alters the signal peptide and influences APOA5 secretion into plasma). There are also a further three common variants (A-3˃G, IVS+476 G˃A and T1259˃C) which are not necessary for haplotype <b>characterisation.</b>|$|E
