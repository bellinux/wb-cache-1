50|$|Early {{engine oil}} filters were of {{cartridge}} (or replaceable element) construction, {{in which a}} permanent housing contains a replaceable filter element or cartridge. The housing is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and return pipes connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the spin-on oil filter design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of oil filter installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with <b>cartridge-type</b> filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to <b>cartridge-type</b> filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available automotive oil filters vary in their design, materials, and construction details. Ones that are made from completely synthetic material excepting the metal drain cylinders contained within are far superior and longer lasting than the traditional cardboard/cellulose/paper type that still predominate. These variables affect the efficacy, durability, and cost of the filter.|$|E

We developed an airborne microorganism detection chip to realize the detection of microorganisms, ensuring compactness, sensitivity, cost-efficiency, and portability, using three key components: an inertial impaction system, a <b>cartridge-type</b> impaction plate, and a mini-fluorescent microscope. The inertial impaction system was used to separate microorganisms in terms of their aerodynamic particle size, and was fabricated with three impaction stages. Numerical analysis was performed to design the system; the calculated cutoff diameter at each impaction stage was 2. 02 (first stage), 0. 88 (second stage), and 0. 54 μm (third stage). The measured cutoff diameters were 2. 24, 0. 91, and 0. 49 μm, respectively. A <b>cartridge-type</b> impaction plate was used, composed of molded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and an actual impaction region made of a SYBR green I dye-stained agar plate. A mini-fluorescent microscope was used to distinguish microbes from non-biological particles.

40|$|Background: The {{immediate}} impact of blood gas test results on patient care favors {{the use of}} blood gas analyzers as point-of-care-testing (POCT) devices. We performed an analytical performance evaluation of four <b>cartridge-type</b> blood gas analyzers for the determination of pH, partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO(2)), partial oxygen pressure (pO(2)), ionized calcium (iCa(2 +)), potassium (K+), glucose, lactate and total hemoglobin (tHb), in comparison with a traditional blood gas analyzer. Methods: The analyzers {{included in the study}} are: RP 405, GEM Premier 4000, ABL 90 FLEX and Cobas b 123. The ABL 700 served as comparator. For each instrument the imprecision was estimated according to the CLSI EP 5 -A 2. Based on the CLSI EP 9 -A 2 evaluation protocol, a method comparison was performed using patient samples. Obtained data were compared against preset quality specifications, based on ABL 700 performance and biological variation. Results: The precision of the RP 405 and ABL 90 FLEX was remarkably better than the preset criteria based on ABL 700 performance. The GEM appears to have the worst precision. The RP 405 yielded the best overall performance, with exception for tHb and iCa(2 +). Noteworthy is the very good performance of the glucose determination on RP 405. The ABL 90 FLEX showed the best performance for pH, K+ and iCa(2 +) measurements. For tHb determination the Cobas b 123 revealed the best results. Regarding practicability, all instruments were found to be user friendly. Conclusions: Globally, all four <b>cartridge-type</b> blood gas analyzers produced clinically acceptable results. The analytical performance, together with the ease of use and low maintenance time of the instruments, demonstrate that these analyzers are perfectly suitable for both POCT and laboratory use...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} 67 minimally invasive surgical procedures covering 11 different procedure types to determine patterns of tool use. A new graph-theoretic approach was taken to organize and analyze the data. Through grouping surgeries by type, trends of common tool changes were identified.

The tool-use trends were used to generate tool placement patterns for modular (multi-tool, <b>cartridge-type)</b> surgical tool systems, and the same 67 surgeries were numerically simulated to determine the optimality of these tool arrangements. The results indicate that aggregated tool-use data (by procedure type) can be employed to predict tool-use sequences with good accuracy, and also indicate the potential for artificial intelligence as a means of preoperative and/or intraoperative planning. Furthermore, this suggests that the use of multifunction surgical tools can be optimized to streamline surgical workflow...|$|E

40|$|Electric swing {{adsorption}} (ESA) is an adsorption cycle with electrothermal desorption step [1] (the adsorbent {{material is}} heated directly, by passing electric current). Recently, a new ESA system, based on assemblies {{of one or}} more annular, radial-flow, <b>cartridge-type</b> fixed-beds, with in-vessel condensation, has been developed [2]. The systems with one, two and four cartridges are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Mathematical modeling of these systems is very difficult, owing to their great complexity, both from the aspect of geometry, and the number of interacting phenomena and processes (fluid flow, mass and heat transfer, heat generation and condensation). For that reason, the modeling was performed using Comsol Multiphysics TM. The models for separate steps and for the complete ESA cycles have been built and used for simulations and analysis of the systems’ performance. References: 1. Petkovska, M. et al, Sep. Sci.

40|$|Lecturepg. 51 High {{pressure}} hydrocracker {{charge is}} one of the most arduous services for multistage centrifugal pumps in the refining industry. Future plant capacity requirements of the hydrocracker unit at a United Kingdom site required a 25 percent increase in capacity and a three to 10 percent increase in differential pressure of the charge pump duty. After preliminary investigations, the decision was made to rerate and upgrade the existing pumps, as opposed to purchasing new equipment. In addition to the performance rerate, there was a requirement to resolve a long term vibration problem and to improve the performance of the mechanical seals. The final scope of work included major modifications to the pumps including one new barrel casing, <b>cartridge-type</b> double mechanical seals, new gearboxes, and new motors. In addition, extensive modifications of the baseplates were required, which included new support pedestals for both pumps and motors.

40|$|As part of {{our studies}} on the ecology of human enteric viruses, an {{improved}} method for detection of rotaviruses in water was developed, and their presence in Galveston Bay was monitored. Samples (378 liters) of estuarine water adjusted to pH 3. 5 and a final AlCl 3 molarity of 0. 001 were filtered through 25 -cm pleated <b>cartridge-type</b> filters (Filterite Corp., Timonium, Md.) of 3. 0 - and 0. 45 -micron porosity. Adsorbed virus was eluted with 1 liter of 10 % tryptose phosphate broth, pH 9. 5. Primary eluates were reconcentrated to a final volume of 10 to 20 ml by a simple and rapid magnetic iron oxide adsorption and elution procedure. Two percent casein at pH 8. 5 effectively eluted rotavirus from iron oxide. A total of 21 of 72 samples of water, suspended solids, fluffy sediments, and compact sediments collected in different seasons in Galveston Bay yielded rotaviruses.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a {{biological}} micro-electromechanical system and its application to the chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Actuated by an electromagnetic force, the micro cell exciter was designed to deliver a cyclic compressive load (CCL) with various magnitudes. Two major parts in the system are an actuator and a <b>cartridge-type</b> chamber. The former has a permanent magnet and coil, and the latter is equipped with 7 sample dishes and 7 metal caps. Mixed with a 2. 4 % alginate solution, the alginate/MSC layers were positioned in the sample dishes; the caps contained chondrogenic defined medium without transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b). Once powered, the actuator coil-derived electromagnetic force pulled the metal caps down, compressing the samples. The cyclic load was given at 1 -Hz frequency for 10 min twice a day. Samples in the dishes without a cap served as a control. The samples were analyzed at 3, 5, and 7 days after stimulation for cell viability, biochemical assays, histologic features, immunohistochemistry, and gene expression of the chondrogenic markers. Applied to the alginate/MSC layer, the CCL system enhanced the synthesis of cartilage-specific matrix proteins and the chondrogenic markers, such as aggrecan, type II collagen, and Sox 9.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a <b>cartridge-type</b> 800 GHz receiver for the ASTE telescope in Atacama, Chile. The receiver has been assembled with a cooled receiver optics, a Nb-based SIS mixer, a local oscillator (LO) optics, and IF components in a 170 mm diameter column-type cartridge. The cooled optics is composed of a single ellipsoidal mirror to couple between the feed horn and the subreflector of the antenna, and an LO coupler with 10 % efficiency. Owing to its cartridge and cryostat structure, the mechanical vibrations of the GM cryocooler are significantly reduced, and therefore the receiver is highly stable on the telescope. The receiver noise temperature, using a Nb-based SIS mixer and a 4 – 8 GHz HEMT amplifier, was attained to 1300 K in DSB at an LO frequency of 815 GHz. The system noise temperature, Tsys, was typically 4000 – 8000 K in DSB at an LO frequency of 812 GHz during operations, which depended on the atmospheric opacity. The typical zenith opacity at an LO frequency of 812 GHz was ∼ 1.

40|$|We {{describe}} a low-field NMR relaxometry study {{of water and}} aviation turbine fuel (jet fuel) in contact with samples of fibrous media removed from an unused aviation fuel filter cartridge. This media was studied both in its as-received state and after modifying its wettability. The interaction of liquid droplets with fibers {{is the basis for}} fibrous coalescence widely used industrially to separate different types of liquid-liquid dispersion. Here, we are specifically concerned with interactions that potentially occur during the removal of entrained water from jet fuels, an application that is of particular importance on safety grounds, primarily to prevent ice formation in aircraft fuel tanks which could otherwise lead to fuel-line filter blockage and fuel starvation to the engines. Jet fuel is treated using various filtration systems, including <b>cartridge-type</b> microfilters and filter-coalescers, at different points between refinery and aircraft fuel tank in order to remove dirt (particulates) and water and ensure that contamination levels always meet the required specifications. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to apply proton NMR relaxometry to provide insight into the water coalescence process, specifically by probing water environments on fibrous media. On the basis of T 2 (spin-spin) relaxation distributions, it has been confirmed that the water environments depend on the media wettability, with three environments being identified: fiber surface adsorbed water; inter-fiber absorbed water; and unassociated (largely bulk) water.

Each participant was asked to examine the Viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method with <b>cartridge-type</b> Filterite filters for virus adsorption and organic flocculation and aluminum hydroxide-hydroextraction for reconcentration. Virus was adsorbed to filter media at pH 3. 5 and eluted with either glycine buffer (pH 10. 5) or beef extract-glycine (pHG 9. 0). Considerable variation was noted in the quantity of virus recovered from four 100 -liter samples of dechlorinated tapwater seeded with low (350 to 860 PFU) and high (1, 837 to 4, 689 PFU) doses of poliovirus type 1. To have a more uniform standard of comparison, all the test samples were reassayed in one laboratory, where titers were also determined for the virus seed. Test results of the Viradel-organic flocculation method indicated that the average percentage of virus recovery for low-input experiments was 66 %, with a range of 8 to 20 % in two laboratories, 49 to 63 % in three laboratories, and 198 % in one laboratory. For the high-input experiments, two laboratories reported recoveries of 6 to 12 %, and four laboratories reported recoveries of 26 to 46 %. For the Viradel aluminum hydroxide-hydroextraction procedure, two laboratories recovered 9 to 11 %, whereas four obtained 17 to 34 % for low-input experiments.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{development}} of the optics and the cryogenics for the 1. 1 THz Heterodyne Array Receiver to be mounted in the Nasmyth A cabin of the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope. The THz range is a still largely unexplored area in astrophysics because of the technological challenge for the receiver and telescope as well as the difficult atmospheric conditions. The APEX telescope, a modified Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) prototype antenna, with its 12 m dish is the largest submillimeter single-dish telescope in the world for THz frequencies, allowing a spatial resolution of few arcseconds, due to its location on the Chajnantor plateau, at 5100 m altitude in the chilean Andes, and its surface accuracy of 17 micro meter r. m. s. Observations in the 1. 1 THz atmospheric window (1000 - 1080 GHz) from the ground have difficulties, but are still possible and productively usable if done with APEX. These difficulties, in addition to the fact that single pixel sensitivity is constrained by the quantum limit, make even more important the development of array receivers in this frequency band. Several important molecular transitions are located in this frequency range, observing them with high spectral resolution (> 10 ^ 6) will improve our understanding of the chemical and physical conditions in hot cores in the galactic Interstellar Medium (ISM) and, especially, in starburst galaxies and active galactic nuclei of external galaxies. The CO 9 - 8 line at 1036. 9 GHz is a tracer for the warm and dense gas. OH+ at 1033 GHz and NH+ at 1012. 6 GHz are important for the study of chemical networks in the ISM. These observations will contribute decisively to answer questions such as "How do galaxies form and evolve?" and "How do stars form?". The 1. 1 THz Array Receiver is a <b>cartridge-type</b> receiver because of the several benefits that this concept provides which was first introduced for the ALMA receivers. It mainly means that several individual receivers, or cartridges, share one main cryostat. Among the benefits that this modularity provides is the fact that each cartridge can be assembled and maintained independently to the cryostat, reducing observing downtime at the telescope. The receiver could optionally be upgraded, in the future, with different mixer technology, operation frequency and number of pixels. Two easily removable cartridges were designed and built, each containing one sub-array of 9 pixels, organized in a 3 x 3 arrangement, observing the same frequency in orthogonal polarizations. The detecting elements will be Superconductor-Isolator-Superconductor (SIS) balance mixers which required an operation temperature below 4. 5 K for their optimum performance. They are being developed in our institute and are not part of this thesis. However, their requirements are important inputs for the design of the cryogenics and the optics of the receiver. A cryostat that can house both cartridge modules and that provides the infrastructure together with the necessary low cryogenic temperature to the mixers was developed. To connect the cartridges to the cryostat thermally and mechanically we developed a new all-metal Thermal Link (TL). It consists of a crown-like ring made of aluminum and an Invar ring. All the receiver optics is fully reflective, thus avoiding the absorption and reflection losses of dielectric lenses and reducing standing waves in the receiver. To guarantee internal optics alignment, we employ, where possible, a monolithic integrated optics approach. The optics that is installed inside the cryostat and the cryogenics were built, mostly in our workshop, and assembled to be tested in the laboratory. Beam measurements of the optics were performed, in direct-detection mode, with our in house available single-ended Superconducting Hot Electron Bolometer (HEB) mixers. The provided temperature to both focal plane arrays was 4. 4 K, in the latest tests, largely sufficient for the HEB mixers which operation temperature was around 6. 5 K. The results of the optics tests have shown some misalignment inside of the cryostat. The source of the problem is most probably due to the cartridges positioning and not to the optics itself, but additional tests are needed. One of the two optics assemblies involved was tested individually and shows good results...|$|E
