For the first time, this paper systematically analyzes and models the worst-case <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> and SNR in folded-torus-based ONoCs. Formal analytical models for the worst-case <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> and SNR are presented. The <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> analysis is hierarchically performed at the basic photonic device level, then at the optical router level, and finally at the network level. We consider a general 5 x 5 optical router model to enable <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> and SNR analyses in folded-torus-based ONoCs using an arbitrary 5 x 5 optical router. Using the general optical router model, the worst-case SNR link candidates, which restrict the network scalability, are found. Also, we present a novel <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> and loss analysis platform, called CLAP, which can analyze the <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noise</b> and SNR of arbitrary ONoCs.

Various timing issues related to signal waveform such as, delay time, overshoot and undershoot occurrence time etc., that in effect help to ensure in prior the desired signal integrity (SI) and performance reliability of the SoCs, can be estimated analytically using the reduced order crosstalk model. It has been observed that the <b>crosstalk</b> coupling <b>noise</b> introduces the delay in the victim‘s far end signal which can be significant enough or even unacceptable if many aggressors simultaneously couple energy to the victim line, or the line spacing between the aggressor and victim is reduced due to manufacturing defect such as under-etching or even, length of the victim interconnect is increased due to improper layouts of / routings between cores and devices on chips. Influences of other interconnect parasitics on the victim´s far end signal can also be analyzed using the same model.

40|$|Abstract – Recently, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that embedded cores in a high-speed SoC circuit have the problem of broken scan chains that cannot shift properly. Also, scan chain intermittent faults caused by hold-time violations and <b>crosstalk</b> <b>noises</b> are pervasive. In this research, an efficient method is proposed to identify the faulty scan chain(s) at the core level. That is, the core where the scan chain is defective can be identified, even if the scan chain is broken. The result can be used to tune up the fabrication process or to guide the fine-grained scan cell identification process. Here, weight-based m-out-of-n codes, which can generate a large number of codewords, with small hardware overhead and high fault detection capability are used to generate the scan chain diagnostic patterns for permanent (and possibly intermittent) faults. An efficient codeword generation method is proposed to maximize the number of codewords, minimize the aliasing probabilities and test application cost. The idea of multiple m-out-of-n codes is also proposed to guarantee that sufficient number of codewords are generated to perturb the scan chains and the associated combinational circuits. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. I...|$|R
