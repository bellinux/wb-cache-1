One of the main projects the World Bank is working on to reduce food insecurity in Burkina Faso is the Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project. According to the World Bank, {{the objective of this}} project is to [...] "improve the capacity of poor producers to increase food production and to ensure improved availability of food products in rural markets." [...] The Agricultural Productivity and Food Security Project has three main parts.

50|$|Colfax {{was laid}} out on March 22, 1880 by James E. Wood (22 October 1818 - October 1908). Anderson was born in Indiana and had come to McLean County about 1855 as State Missionary for the Christian Church. He stayed and became a farmer, a banker, and a lifelong {{promoter}} of Colfax. To locals, Anderson was affectionately known as “Uncle Billy.” The northeastern townships of the county were among the last to be served by railroads. After many false starts the Clinton, Bloomington, and Northwestern Railroad began making its way westward from Kankakee, Illinois. It was aided by <b>contributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and land for the right-of-way by many local farmers. Cropsey, Anchor, and Cooksville were all laid {{out at the same}} time as Colfax. The first train arrived in Colfax on 4 July 1880. For two years the track extended only from Kankakee to Colfax and a turntable was installed to send the trains back eastwards. Eventually the tracks ware completed to Bloomington. The Railroad soon became part of the Illinois Central system. Colfax is one of several communities in the United States named for Grant's Vice President Schuyler Colfax. Others include Colfax, California; Colfax, Indiana; Colfax, Louisiana; Colfax, North Carolina and Colfax, Washington.|$|R

40|$|Financial {{researchers}} {{agree that}} allocating money to employer stock in a 401 (k) {{plan is a}} poor strategy, yet many employees do so. Not only does this investment strategy bear unrewarded idiosyncratic risk, but it also correlates employees' retirement portfolios with their human capital. I find evidence that this selection {{is influenced by the}} investment preferences of peers, which includes both management at the firm and employees at other firms headquartered in the same city. Specifically, the percentage allocated to company stock by employees in the 401 (k) plan is positively related to both the net open-market purchases of company stock by management and the average allocation to company stock in 401 (k) plans by employees at other firms headquartered in the same city. Surprisingly, the allocation to company stock in 401 (k) plans increases with investment in employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), which are a dominant substitute since they often offer stock at a discount. To identify the cause of this relationship between employees and management, I provide additional support for the peer effects hypothesis through interaction tests. The relationship between employees and management is influenced by distance between peers and trust within the firm - two factors that alter group cohesion and, in turn, the effect of peer influence. These results are robust to size of the firm and also exist for the subsample of firms that have only made matching <b>contributions</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> Consistent with our understanding of the inertia that exists in employee investment decisions, employee allocations to company stock are influenced for many years by management's initial investment choices made near the time of going public. Lastly, alternative methodologies, including propensity score matched samples and panel regressions, yield the same conclusions...|$|R
25|$|The {{expansion}} of rapid transit was greatly {{facilitated by the}} signing of the Dual Contracts on March 19, 1913. Contract 3 was signed between the IRT and the City; the contract between the BRT and the City was Contract 4.

The Astoria Line and Flushing Lines were built at this time, and were for some time operated by both companies. Under the terms of Contracts 3 and 4, the city would build new subway and elevated lines, rehabilitate and expand certain existing elevated lines, and lease them to the private companies for operation.
