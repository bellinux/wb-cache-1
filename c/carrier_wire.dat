The input transducer launches an acoustic wave that travels through the chemical film and is detected by the output transducer. The Sandia-made device runs {{at a very}} high frequency (approximately 525 MHz), and the velocity and attenuation of the signal are sensitive to the viscoelasticity and mass of the thin film [...] SAWS have been able to distinguish organophosphates, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ketones, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, saturated hydrocarbons, and water [...] The SAW used in these tests have four channels—each channel consists of a transmitter and a receiver, separated by a small distance. Three of the four channels have a polymer deposited on the substrate between the transmitter and receiver. The purpose of the polymers is to adsorb chemicals of interest, with different polymers having different affinities to various chemicals. When a chemical is adsorbed, the mass of the polymer increases, causing a slight change in phase of the acoustic signal relative to the reference (fourth) channel, which does not contain a polymer. The SAW device also contains three Application Specific Integrated Circuit chips (ASICs), which contain the electronics to analyze the signals and provide a DC voltage signal proportional to the phase shift.

Integration of such nano-needles onto batch fabricated micro-grippers can potentially {{lead to the}} development of nano-grippers for nano-manipulation of materials, measurement of electrical properties of nanostructures and finally measurement of electrochemical properties of cells. We explored the growth process of nano-needles on batch fabricated microgrippers. Micro-grippers were first batch fabricated using carbon nanotube/SU 8 process at the University of Louisville 2 ̆ 7 s clean room facility. Following the gripper fabrication, 20 nm chromium and 100 nm silver were selectively deposited onto the arms of the grippers using shadow masking techniques. Each silver coated arm was selectively dipped onto liquid gallium and retracted for the formation of Ag 2 Ga eutectic nano-needles at room temperature in ambient environment. The length and diameter of nano-needles can be controlled by the thickness of silver and volume of gallium liquid. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) characterization revealed nano-needles of 100 - 120 nm in diameter and 7 - 15 µm long on each gripper. Following the nano-needle growth on the grippers, the grippers were packaged onto a ceramic chip <b>carrier</b> and <b>wire</b> bonded.

40|$|The room temperature, {{visible light}} {{emission}} from porous silicon is an unexpected and poorly understood phenomenon. The models presently proposed {{to explain this}} photoluminescence (PL) are vastly different. Analyses of the surface chemistry and morphology of as-prepared and oxidized porous silicon were performed in this study {{in order to determine}} the actual PL mechanism. ^ Results from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) establish that the as-prepared surfaces are H-passivated. The morphological results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) established the presence of nanoscale wires with nodules in the size range of 1 - 7 nm, after tip correction. These feature sizes and corresponding PL wavelengths are consistent with theoretical predictions of the associated energy band gaps. In situ STM images were taken before and during UV excitation. There is a decrease in feature width and an increase in feature height between the non-luminescing and luminescing porous silicon images corresponding to an increase in the tunneling current and, therefore, an increase in the number of available charge <b>carriers</b> in the <b>wires.</b> The PL from as-prepared porous silicon, therefore, originates from the wires. ^ Porous silicon samples were examined as a function of exposure time in air. XPS data revealed that after 18 hours in air, SiO 2 was present on the surface thereby eliminating the possibility that the PL is due to siloxene. However, the PL intensity increased and shifted toward the red wavelength region upon air exposure. The morphology consisted of nanoscale wires, but with widths too large to be a quantum effect. The PL from oxidized porous silicon is not due to a size effect but rather an oxygen-related chemical model. ^ In conclusion, the PL of porous silicon is dependent upon the post-etching environment. The PL of oxidized porous silicon is associated with an oxygen-related chemical effect and the PL of as-prepared porous silicon is due to quantum confinement. ...|$|R
