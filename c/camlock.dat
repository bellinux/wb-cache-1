2500|$|NEMA L21 are four-pole {{and ground}} {{connectors}} rated for 120/208V. [...] Intended for wye three-phase circuits with both neutral and ground. The pin {{in the middle}} is ground, and the blade with a right angle on the tab is neutral. [...] These connectors are common in live event power distribution. Many event production companies use power distributors with <b>camlock</b> connectors for feeder cable, and 12 or more L21-30 connectors which can each be broken out to three individual 120v circuits via {{the use of a}} stringer box.|$|E
5000|$|Type [...] "C", has {{a female}} <b>camlock</b> end and a male hose tail on the other.|$|E
5000|$|Type [...] "B", has {{a female}} <b>camlock</b> end and a male pipe thread {{of the same}} size.|$|E
5000|$|The UK {{system uses}} the {{following}} colour codes: (as {{the use of}} <b>Camlocks</b> has been declining, it is very unlikely to find any matching the new colour codes) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Camlocks</b> {{also called}} cam and groove {{coupling}}s, are {{a kind of}} hose coupling used to rapidly connect and disconnect fittings on piping or hose, they {{come in a variety of}} materials to be used with different media and a variety of sizes to accommodate hose or piping diameter.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the main}} entrance, a paired Dutch door with {{original}} hardware, {{is a large}} main room with a smaller kitchen and dining room. The main room has beaded chair rail and baseboard and windows with original <b>camlocks.</b> Two original paneled doors with thumb latches lead into the other rooms. All are finished with the original 7 to 9 in tongue and groove pine flooring and wall and ceiling plaster. The dining room floor has a tin strip patch.|$|R
5000|$|Type [...] "A", has a male <b>camlock</b> end and {{a female}} pipe thread (BSP or NPT thread) of the same size.|$|E
50|$|<b>Camlock</b> {{connectors}} {{are capable}} of carrying liquids, powders and granules and are interchangeable with all other cam and groove couplings made to the same standard (A-A-59326A - formally MIL-C-27487), ensuring compatibility with couplings made to the same specification.|$|E
50|$|For stage {{lighting}} use, {{a common}} plug is the 32-A 5-pin connector with a neutral pin. Motor loads that don't need the neutral use a four-pin connector. Larger requirements may use powerlock or <b>camlock</b> connectors. In the IT industry, the IEC 60309 system is sometimes used.|$|E
5000|$|The pipes {{following}} the trails {{are equipped with}} shelters containing hydrants, electrical power and, optionally, communication lines mounted.Whereas shelters for fan guns require only water, power and maybe communication, lance-shelters usually need air hydrants as well. Hybrid shelters allow maximum flexibility to connect each snow machine type as they have all supplies available. The typical distance for lance shelters is 100 - 150 ft, for fan guns 250 - 300 ft. From these hydrants [...] "-2" [...] pressure resistant hoses are connected similar to fire hoses with <b>camlocks</b> to the snow machine.|$|R
50|$|Powerlock is a {{range of}} single pole {{electrical}} connectors used for high current, low voltage (up to 1000 V AC) applications, similar to but considered safer than <b>camlock</b> connectors. Originally developed by Litton Veam in the mid-1990s, VEAM Powerlock is now a brand of ITT Cannon. Compatible versions are also available from other manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|The {{faceplate}} may {{be attached}} to the lathe in several ways: the two most common are a thread and a precision cone arrangement or threaded studs and a circular recess fitting a flange {{on the end of the}} spindle. Increasingly common is the <b>camlock</b> arrangement where shaped studs and cams replace threaded studs for rapid exchanging of the faceplate with other accessories, such as three or four jaw chucks.|$|E
50|$|A {{harmonica}} gun or slide gun {{is a form}} of firearm {{which was}} breech loaded with a steel slide, containing a number of chambers bored in it and which were filled with projectiles. Most harmonica guns are percussion cap guns, although some designs exist for compressed air guns. In percussion cap guns, each chamber contains a separate primer, powder charge, and projectile. The slide was inserted in an opening in the breech action and could be advanced by releasing the <b>camlock,</b> moving the slide by hand. The gun comes in both pistol and rifle models, as well as single-action and double-action.|$|E
50|$|Many theatres {{also use}} Edison plugs, {{which are the}} {{standard}} connector used in homes and businesses in North America, because of their availability {{and the ability to}} connect household fixtures to a theatrical control system. Twist-lock connectors are used in many theatres because of their locking feature, which will not allow fixtures to become accidentally disconnected. Connectors used to power lighting fixtures must be rated at 20 amperes or higher, depending on local electrical codes. Temporary high-power distribution wiring often employs <b>camlock</b> connectors to connect dimming equipment, power distribution units, controllers for motorized chain hoists, and other high-power equipment to a company switch, generator, or other tie-in point.|$|E
50|$|A <b>camlock</b> is an {{interchangeable}} {{electrical connector}} {{often used in}} temporary electrical power production and distribution. The most common form is the 16 series, rated at 400 amperes with 105 Â°C terminations. Also in common use is the 15 series (mini-cam), rated at 150 amperes. A larger version is made denoted as the 17 series with ratings up to 760 A. A ball nose version and a longer nose standard version exist-the latter is the most common. Another version is the Posi-lok which has controlled interconnection sequencing to a panel and a shrouded connector body.The early version original connector was hot-vulcanized to the cable body;later versions use dimensional pressure to exclude foreign material from the connector pin area;the tail of the connector insulator body is trimmable to fit the cable outer diameter.|$|E
50|$|Engine-generators {{are used}} to provide {{electrical}} power in areas where utility (central station) electricity is unavailable, or where electricity is only needed temporarily. Small generators are sometimes used to provide electricity to power tools at construction sites. Trailer-mounted generators supply temporary installations of lighting, sound amplification systems, amusement rides etc. You can use a wattage chart to calculate the estimated power usage for different types of equipment {{to determine how many}} watts are necessary in a portable generator. Trailer-mounted generators or mobile generators, diesel generators are also used for emergencies or backup where either a redundant system is required or no generator is on site. To make the hookup faster and safer, a tie-in panel is frequently installed near the building switchgear that contains connectors such as camlocks. The tie-in panel may also contain a phase rotation indicator (for 3-phase systems) and a circuit breaker. <b>Camlock</b> connectors are rated for 400 amps up to 480-volt systems and used with 4/0 type W cable connecting to the generator. Tie-in panel designs are common between 200- and 3000-amp applications.|$|E
