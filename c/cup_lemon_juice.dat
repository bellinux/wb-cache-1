40|$|Chronic {{excessive}} {{alcohol consumption}} (more than 40 – 80 [*]g/day {{for males and}} more than 20 – 40 [*]g/day for females) could induce serious liver injury. In this study, effects of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> on chronic alcohol-induced liver injury in mice were evaluated. The serum biochemical profiles and hepatic lipid peroxidation levels, triacylglycerol (TG) contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, and histopathological changes were examined for evaluating the hepatoprotective effects of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in mice. In addition, the in vitro antioxidant capacities of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> were determined. The results showed that <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> significantly inhibited alcohol-induced increase of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), hepatic TG, and lipid peroxidation levels in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological changes induced by alcohol were also remarkably improved by <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> treatment. These findings suggest that <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> has protective effects on alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. The protective effects {{might be related to}} the antioxidant capacity of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> because <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> showed in vitro antioxidant capacity...|$|R

5000|$|... per Slade LJ: Reckitt, sold <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> {{under the}} name [...] "Jif Lemon" [...] which came in plastic yellow {{container}} that was shaped like a lemon. Borden, a competitor, started to produce <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in a similar lemon-shaped plastic container that was only slightly larger with a flattened side. Reckitt sued Borden for passing off their product as Jif <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving the <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> in plastic <b>lemon</b> containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|R
5000|$|Inverted {{sugar syrup}} {{can be easily}} made by adding water and roughly one gram of citric acid per {{kilogram}} of sugar. Cream of tartar (one gram per kilogram) or fresh <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> (10 milliliters per kilogram) may also be used. (<b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> is 5% to 6% citric acid, with a negligible amount of ascorbic acid, so this would correspond to about 20 grams of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> per kilogram of sugar.) ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Women, {{especially}} in developing countries, most often {{bear the brunt}} of HIV infections. Thecontinued lack of viable vaccines and microbicides has made some women resort to using natural products such as <b>lemon</b> or lime <b>juice</b> to avoid infection. Few in vitro studies have been done on the effect of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> on vaginal cells and lactobacilli that constitute the major microbiota in healthy women. Objective: The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate in vitro the effect of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> on the viability of vaginal cells (VK 2 /E 6 E 7) and vaginal Lactobacillus species. Methods: Vaginal cells were exposed to different concentrations (0 – 30 %) of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> at pH 2. 3 and 4. 5 for 10 min. Viability was determined by staining the cells with propidium iodide and analysing them by flow cytometry. Lactobacillusorganisms were dispensed into microplates with vaginally defined medium + peptone (VDMP) containing different concentrations of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> ranging from 0 to 100 %. Results: <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> at pH 2. 3 had a significant (P = 0. 03) toxic effect on the vaginal cell line used. At 30 % concentration, the vaginal cells were practically non-viable, typified by a 95 % loss of viability, whereas at pH 4. 5 there was only 5 % cell loss. <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> had varying growth inhibitory effects on the Lactobacillus species tested. At pH 4. 5 and using 10 – 30 % <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> there was a stimulatory growth effect on certain Lactobacillus species. Conclusions: <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> (20 – 30 %) at pH 2. 3 was highly toxic to VK 2 /E 6 E 7 cells, and at pH 4. 5 there was no significant effect on the viability of the cells within 10 min. <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> above 10 % at pH 2. 3 was found to be detrimental to the growth of vaginal lactobacilli. Although <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> may be useful in other applications, its use in the vaginal region should be discouraged...|$|R

50|$|<b>Lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> rind, and zest {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of foods and drinks. <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is used in {{marinades}} for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts, and meat, where the acid partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing the meat, but the low pH denatures the proteins, causing them to dry out when cooked. <b>Lemon</b> <b>juice</b> is frequently used in the United Kingdom to add to pancakes, especially on Shrove Tuesday.|$|R
40|$|Safety {{assessments}} of branded <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> are currently evaluated with parameters {{such as the}} formalin index, acidity, Brix, pH and dry content. In this study, other parameters such as vitamin C, antioxidant and phenolic compounds were evaluated to introduce some new and reliable indexes for safety {{assessments of}} <b>lemon</b> <b>juice.</b> Two groups of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> were evaluated in the study. The two groups consisted of branded and natural products and were tested for total phenolic compounds (Folin-Ciocalteu), antioxidant capacity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) and ascorbic acid content (2 - 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine). Results demonstrated that total phenolic contents in both groups showed non-significant difference but the group of natural <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> samples had the better antioxidant capacity (795. 61 mg VEE L - 1) and higher ascorbic acid content (187. 52 mg L - 1). Levels of antioxidant capacity ranged from 476. 60 to 1378. 12 and from 235. 47 to 888. 59 (mg VEE L - 1) in branded and natural sample groups, respectively. Amounts of ascorbic acid in branded <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> samples ranged from 23. 53 to 492. 91 and in the natural <b>lemon</b> <b>juice</b> samples amounts ranged from 99. 32 to 196. 49 mg L - 1. Analysis of interrelations between these three measured parameters indicated that phenolic compound and ascorbic acid content both had significant correlations with antioxidant capacity. In summary, ascorbic acid content and antioxidant capacity are parameters suitable for safety assessments of <b>lemon</b> <b>juice,</b> but further investigation such as flavonoid profile may also be helpful...|$|R
