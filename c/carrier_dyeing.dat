40|$|Highly-purified {{bidirectional}} hydrogenase (hydrogenase 1) of Clostridium pasteur-ianum could rapidly reduce several 2 -, 4 - and 5 -nitroimidazole compounds via {{an electron}} carrier-coupled mechanism. Hydrogenase 1 was also shown to reduce a 2 -nitroimidazole (misonidazole) and a 4 -nitroimidazole {{in the presence}} of its required electron carriers including ferredoxin, the flavin coenzymes FAD and FMN, and the low potential electron <b>carrier</b> <b>dyes</b> methyl- and benzyl-viologen. No drug reduction by hydrogenase 1 occurred when any one of these electron carriers was replaced by nicotinamide electron carriers (NAD and NADP), or was omitted from the reaction mixture. The rates of reduction of the nitroimidazole compounds correlated with their one electron reduction potentials at pH 7 (E}); the higher the drug's E}, the faster its rate of reduction by the enzyme. Reduction rates for the drugs did not correlate with the antibacterial activity of these compounds against C. pasteurianum, suggesting that other factors are also important in determining the antimicrobial potencies of nitroimidazoles...|$|R

However, using nanoparticles as a <b>carrier</b> for <b>dye</b> molecules to absorb light hinders the electron transport to anode electrode, due to the loss of electrons by either recombination between electrons and the oxidized dye molecules or electron-accepting species in the electrolyte or back reaction during the transport processes [12 – 14].|$|R
40|$|Fiber-optics {{confocal}} microscopy (FCM) is {{an emerging}} imaging technology with various applications in basic research and clinical diagnosis. FCM allows for real-time in situ microscopy of tissue at sub-cellular scale. Recently FCM {{has been investigated}} for cardiac imaging, in particular, for discrimination of cardiac tissue during pediatric open-heart surgery. FCM relies on fluorescent dyes. The current clinical approach of dye delivery is based on systemic injection, which is associated with high dye consumption and adverse clinical events. In this study, we investigated approaches for local dye delivery during FCM imaging based on <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> attached to the imaging probe. Using three-dimensional confocal microscopy, automated bench tests, and FCM imaging we quantitatively characterized <b>dye</b> release of <b>carriers</b> composed of open-pore foam only and foam loaded with agarose hydrogel. In addition, we compared local dye delivery with a model of systemic dye delivery in the isolated perfused rodent heart. We measured the signal-to-noise ratio of images acquired in various regions of the heart. Our evaluations showed that foam-agarose <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> exhibited a prolonged dye release versus foam-only <b>carriers.</b> Foam-agarose <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> allowed reliable imaging of 5 - 9 lines, which is comparable to 4 - 8 min of continuous dye release. Our study in the living heart revealed that the SNR of FCM images using local and systemic dye delivery is not different. However, we observed differences in the imaged tissue microstructure with the two approaches. Structural features characteristic of microvasculature were solely observed for systemic dye delivery. Our findings suggest that local dye delivery approach for FCM imaging constitutes an important alternative to systemic dye delivery. We suggest that the approach for local dye delivery will facilitate clinical translation of FCM, for instance, for FCM imaging during pediatric heart surgery...|$|R

40|$|Exposing murine macrophages {{infected}} th the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii to micromolar {{concentrations of}} some cationic electron <b>carriers</b> (<b>dyes),</b> resulted in complete {{killing of the}} intracellular parasites at concentrations at which these compounds did not seem toxic for the macrophages. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (with 95 % confidence limits) were calculated as 0 · 26 (0 · 18 - 0 · 37), 1 · 35 (1 - 2 · 25), 0 · 45 (0 · 13 - 1 · 50), and 1 · 52 (0 · 91 - 2 · 53) μM for crystal violet, phenazine methosulphate, methylene blue and brilliant cresyl blue, respectively. The effects of these electron carriers {{did not appear to}} be the result of an enhancement of the natural antitoxoplasmic activity of the macrophages. None of the tested compounds was active against extracellular Tox. gondii as measured by ability to reinfect murine macrophages; thus, these dyes seem to act primarily on actively metabolizing, intracellular, Tox. gondii. Our data also suggest that the killing effect of the electron carriers was not related to the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates as judged by the inability of scavengers of these intermediates to block the activity against intracellular Tox. gondii. Further studies with related redox compounds would have an interesting chemotherapeutic perspective for treating toxoplasma infection...|$|R

40|$|The use of Nile Red {{for rapid}} {{monitoring}} of the neutral lipid content in microalgae has gained interest over the last decade, since neutral lipids are feedstock for renewable transportation fuel. In this review, we discuss the main considerations needed to make an NR protocol reliable for staining neutral lipids in microalgae. Cell wall permeability must be enhanced by using stain carriers: DMSO (5 % v/v to 25 % v/v), glycerol (0. 1 to 0. 125 mg/mL), or EDTA (3. 0 to 3. 8 mg/mL). Temperatures between 30 and 40 °C facilitate the diffusion of NR through the cell wall without incurring excess quenching. Good NR-lipid interaction requires using a low NR/cell ratio; the NR concentration must be between 0. 25 μg/mL and 2. 0 μg/mL, and the cell concentration > 5 × 10 4 cells/mL. In order to have the maximum and stable NR fluorescence, {{it is necessary to}} scan the excitation/emission wavelengths for up to a 40 -min of incubation time. We outline a five-step method to customize the Nile Red protocol to a specific strain: 1) Evaluate the strain's suitability by checking for the presence of neutral lipid, 2) Select of the best excitation/emission wavelength, 3) Optimization of incubation time, stain <b>carrier,</b> <b>dye</b> concentration, and temperature, 4) Prepare single-strain algal cultures with different lipid contents to calibrate NR fluorescence with neutral-lipid content, and 5) Correlate NR fluorescence intensity to neutral lipid content for the same strain. Once the protocol is customized, the NR method allows for rapid and reliable monitoring of neutral lipid content of a microalgae strain. </p...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances of {{the cardiac}} {{conduction}} system constitute a major risk after surgical repair of complex cases of congenital heart disease. Intraoperative {{identification of the}} conduction system may {{reduce the incidence of}} these disturbances. We previously developed an approach to identify cardiac tissue types using fiber-optics confocal microscopy and extracellular fluorophores. Here, we applied this approach to investigate sensitivity and specificity of human and automated classification in discriminating images of atrial working myocardium and specialized tissue of the conduction system. Two-dimensional image sequences from atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue of isolated perfused rodent hearts were acquired using a fiber-optics confocal microscope (Leica FCM 1000). We compared two methods for local application of extracellular fluorophores: topical via pipette and with a <b>dye</b> <b>carrier.</b> Eight blinded examiners evaluated 162 randomly selected images of atrial working myocardium (n = 81) and nodal tissue (n = 81). In addition, we evaluated the images using automated classification. Blinded examiners achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 98. 0 ± 0. 7 %, respectively, with the <b>dye</b> <b>carrier</b> method of <b>dye</b> application. Sensitivity and specificity was similar for dye application via a pipette (99. 2 ± 0. 3 % and 94. 0 ± 2. 4 %, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for automated methods of tissue discrimination were similarly high. Human and automated classification achieved high sensitivity and specificity in discriminating atrial working myocardium and nodal tissue. We suggest that our findings facilitate clinical translation of fiber-optics confocal microscopy as an intraoperative imaging modality to reduce the incidence of conduction disturbances during surgical correction of congenital heart disease...|$|R
40|$|The most energy {{intensive}} operation in textile processing, accounting for almost {{sixty percent of}} the industry wide consumption, is drying. Drying is prevalent because water is the <b>carrier</b> for <b>dye,</b> size, and other finishes. Water has been preferred because it is abundant, low cost, and an almost universal solvent. However, tightened water and energy supplies and increased regulation of water and air pollution has caused the utility of many wet-processing operations to be questioned. One feasible alternative to wet-processing is the use of supercritical fluids, such as carbon dioxide, as the carrier. This option would eliminate water discharge and convective drying and could achieve improved energy efficiency. A description of textile processing using supercritical fluid and a cost comparison with conventional wet-processing and convective drying is presented...|$|R

The fluorescein loading capacity and CpG ODN capping amount were 37. 7 and 39. 6 μg mg, respectively at the weight ratio of 10 Dye/HMS-NH 2 /CpG ODN. Importantly, fluorescein release can be triggered by the addition of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) for CpG ODN degradation, and the release rate can also be controlled by changing the DNase I concentration. Therefore, it might be a promising controlled drug delivery system for application in the field of biomedicine and cancer therapy...|$|R

A series of blends were prepared using either polypropylene or polyethylene (HDPE) as the matrix. The content of the polyester as disperse phase was varied between 0. 05 and 20 wt %. The blends with polyester contents up to 5 % were prepared for colorization of polyolefins using the polyester as a <b>dye</b> <b>carrier.</b> The blends with higher polyester contents were prepared in order to investigate {{the influence of the}} hyperbranched material on the material properties. The blends exhibited a heterogeneous morphology with very small particle sizes even at high polyester concentrations. The melt rheology measurements resulted in a reduced complex viscosity for both polyolefins when the hyperbranched polyester was added. The observed melt viscosity of the i-PP blends deviated from the linear mixing rule, whereas the HDPE blends followed it. The use of amphiphilic hyperbranched polyesters as <b>dye</b> <b>carriers</b> allowed a homogeneous distribution of an organic dye in a polyolefin matrix with similar dynamic-mechanical behavior of the blends compared to the case of pure polyolefins.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the charge}} <b>carrier</b> recombination in <b>dye</b> molecule-doped multilayer organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) was quantified by transient electroluminescence (EL). Three sets of dye molecules, such as derivatives of naphthalimide and stilbene, were used as dopants in light-emission layer. Although the devices show almost the same EL spectra for each set of molecules, they show very different EL efficiency. The difference in EL efficiency was attributed to the difference in charge carrier recombination, as revealed by transient EL. The recombination coefficient (γ) was determined from the long-time component of the temporal decay of the EL intensity after a rectangular voltage pulse was turned off. It was found that γ and EL efficiency were both strongly dependent on the molecular structures of the dopants, and the donor groups and π-conjugated structure guaranteed high γ and EL efficiency in OLEDs.

Thanks {{to the earth}} abundance and environmental friendliness, Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 has been widely utilized as adsorbents for heavy metal ions and organic <b>dyes,</b> <b>carriers</b> for drug release, molecular sieves, and catalyst supports [10 – 14]. However, its application as electroactive materials is quite limited because of its intrinsic poor electronic conductivity [10]. Despite this drawback, the layered structure of Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 still endows it with an appealing feature for electrochemical applications, since such structure could provide numerous well-defined multichannels for fast mass transfer, which is a critical factor during electrochemical reactions [10]. To improve the conductivity of Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 -based materials, hybridization of Ni 3 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4 with a conductive matrix including reduced graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes has been recently achieved, and the resulting composites were successfully used in electrocatalytic water oxidation and lithium-ion batteries [10, 15 – 17].

40|$|The paper industry's {{experiences}} with PCBs were chronologically reviewed {{at a recent}} "PCB Workshop " sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers of America, Inc. (1). This history goes back somewhat over a year, at which time two paperboard manufacturers were apprised {{of the presence of}} PCBs in folding cartons for packaging dried fruit. These two manufacturers immediately began searching for the source of the PCB contamination, screening all converting materials used in making cartons from the paperboard. These materials, including printing inks, varnishes and adhesives, proved not to be the source of the contamination. Examination of the fibrous materials used in the paperboard showed the source of PCB contamination to be some of the paperstocks used in manufacturing the paperboard. Certain high quality white and colored paperstock grades, such as ledger papers, were found to contain carbonless carbon papers which were the source of the PCBs. PCBs at that time were used as one component of the <b>dye</b> <b>carrier</b> in the carbonless carbon paper system. The American Paper Institute, the industry association, alerted the paper industry to this source of PCB contamination. Combination paperboard manufacturers, those who use recycled fibers in paperboard manufacture, immediately adopted operating procedures to eliminate the use of carbonless carbon papers and thus to minimize the PCBs in the paperboard. This action unquestionably was essential. Yet, in one respect, it does run counter to the national interest and the goals of the solid waste progra...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Grape juice {{contains}} high {{amounts of}} anthocyanins, with {{great potential for}} substituting synthetic food <b>dyes.</b> <b>Carrier</b> agents used in spray drying entraps anthocyanins, allowing their preservation. This work appraised whey protein/ maltodextrin (WM) and soy protein/maltodextrin (SM) blends as alternative carriers for spray drying of grape juice and encapsulation of anthocyanins. The effects of carrier agent concentration (CAC) and ratio protein/carrier agent (R) on grape juice powder properties were evaluated. The grape juice powders presented good solubility, low water content and high anthocyanin retention. WM blends resulted in higher yields and higher anthocyanin retention (from 77. 9 to 94 %) than SM blends, whereas SM blends leaded to higher encapsulation efficiency (> 97 %). Increasing CAC and R resulted in brighter powders, but reconstituted juices presented color parameters {{similar to those of}} fresh juice. WM and SM were suitable for encapsulating anthocyanins of grape juice, resulting in powders with potential applications in food industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS The grape cultivar BRS violeta contains high levels of anthocyanins and is an alternative to produce antioxidant-rich and highly colored grape juice. Spray drying is applied for producing powdered grape juice with high anthocyanin content. In this technique, the addition of whey and soy proteins blended with maltodextrin as carrier agents avoid problems such as stickiness, which is negative to process yield and product quality. Moreover, the use of carrier agents in spray drying promotes the microencapsulation of bioactive compounds, allowing their protection and preservation during processing and storage. The grape juice powder from cv.
