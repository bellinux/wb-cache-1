In 2008, Gilchrist {{supported}} debate on whether Australia Day should be moved to a new date because the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> marks European settlement and is offensive to many Aboriginal Australians. Gilchrist is considered to have left-wing views; Australian captain Ricky Ponting commented in his annual Captain's Diary that his deputy had a penchant for reading Karl Marx while on tour.|$|E

5|$|No {{further action}} was taken until the summer of 1834, when {{officials}} suggested that proof coin sets be prepared as gifts for Asian dignitaries. After examining Mint records, personnel incorrectly concluded that the last Draped Bust dollars minted were dated 1804, so they chose that date for the coins. It is unknown why the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> was not used, but numismatic historian R.W. Julian suggests the coins were predated to prevent coin collectors from becoming angered when they {{would be unable to}} obtain the newly dated coins, which were struck in very small numbers. It is unknown precisely how many 1804 dollars were struck, though eight are known to be extant.|$|E

40|$|Levels of <b>current</b> <b>dating</b> {{involvement}} did {{not differ}} across diagnostic groups (Table 1). However, collapsing across diagnostic groups, symptoms of bulimia were associated with current involvement in a serious dating relationship (Figure 1).   Contrary to expectations, negative qualities of <b>current</b> <b>dating</b> relationships were not associated with eating disorder symptoms. However, greater positive qualities (i. e., intimacy and support) were associated with increased symptoms of bulimia and/or drive for thinness (Tables 2 and 3).   These results suggest that qualities of dating relationships that are generally considered positive (e. g., commitment, intimacy) may actually be detrimental to {{the mental health of}} teens. Future longitudinal research is needed to confirm this conclusion...|$|R

5|$|Although {{best known}} as Night of January 16th, the play's title changed {{multiple}} times and several alternative titles were considered. Rand's working title was Penthouse Legend. When Clive picked up the play, he thought Rand's title suggested a fantasy story that would discourage potential patrons. The play was called The Verdict during the Hollywood Playhouse rehearsals, but opened there with the title Woman on Trial. When Woods took the play to Broadway, he insisted on a new title. He offered Rand a choice between The Black Sedan and Night of January 16th. Rand liked neither, but picked the latter. Woods later suggested two more name changes, but did not implement them. Prior to the opening, he considered renaming the play The Night is Young. After the play opened, he considered changing its name each day to match the <b>current</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both {{before the}} {{establishment}} of Australia Day as the national day of Australia, and {{in the years after}} its creation, several dates have been proposed for its celebration and, at various times, the possibility of moving Australia Day to an alternative date has been mooted. Some reasons put forward are that the <b>current</b> <b>date,</b> celebrating the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales, lacks national significance; that the day falls on school holidays which limits the engagement of schoolchildren in the event; and that it fails to encompass members of the indigenous community and some others who perceive the day as commemorating the date of an invasion of their land. Connected to this is the suggestion that moving the date would be seen as a significant symbolic act.|$|E
5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries {{to pull the plug}} on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that {{he was the one who}} put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not sure why he is laughing.|$|E

25|$|In the 2016 {{video game}} , the {{character}} Sorin Sprocket is eventually revealed to have anterograde amnesia, which he developed after unintentionally causing {{a car accident}} which killed his sister. This causes his memories to completely reset every time he wakes up from sleeping, {{to the day after}} this accident. This depiction is notable for demonstrating the relationship issues that arise between Sorin and his fiancee, Ellen Wyatt, {{as a result of this}} disorder, most noticeably with how Sorin's feelings towards her to coming across as distant and cold. As the storyline continues, however, the player comes to uncover that Sorin in fact deeply loves his fiancee, and is able to maintain this love despite his disorder, but in fact feels a sense of guilt over the fact that he has to constantly remind himself of the fact that this love exists inside of him every day, due to his disorder. It is also noticeable in that it depicts how Sorin deals with his disorder, by keeping a journal where he writes down every minuet detail of every day after his sister's death. He carries this journal around everywhere he goes as a substitution to his memories, and uses what is written in the notebook to become aware each time he wakes up of the fact that he he his condition, what the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> apparently is, and everything important that have apparently occurred on every day since he first developed the condition. The episode also deals with legal issues concerning the disorder, when it is debated during Ellen Wyatt's trial as to whether Sorin's journal can be considered a proper substitution to his memories for the sake of viable witness testimony. Danger's imposed by this also come into play when it is revealed that a page in Sorin's journal had been altered by someone, which causes him to go into mental collapse that any of his other memories and thoughts could also have arisen from someone else's manipulation.|$|E

500|$|Such a {{move would}} have to be made by a {{combination}} of the Australian Federal and State Governments, and has lacked sufficient political and public support. In 2001 Prime Minister John Howard stated that he acknowledged Aboriginal concerns with the date, but that it was nevertheless a significant day in Australia's history, and thus he was in favour of retaining the <b>current</b> <b>date.</b> He also noted that 1 January, which was being discussed in light of the Centenary of Federation, was inappropriate as it coincided with New Year's Day. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd gave a [...] "straightforward no" [...] to a change of date, speaking in response to Mick Dodson's suggestion to reopen the debate. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, echoed Rudd's support of 26 January, but, along with Rudd, supported the right of Australians to raise the issue. At the State level, New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees stated that he was yet to hear a [...] "compelling argument" [...] to support change; and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh expressed her opposition to a change.|$|E

500|$|In 1831, Mint Director Samuel Moore filed {{a request}} through the Treasury asking {{president}} Andrew Jackson {{to once again}} allow the coinage of silver dollars; the request was approved on April 18. In 1834, Edmund Roberts was selected as an American commercial representative to Asia, including the kingdoms of Muscat and Siam. Roberts recommended that the dignitaries be given a set of proof coins. The State Department ordered two sets of [...] "specimens of each kind [...] now in use, whether of gold, silver, or copper". Though the minting of dollars had been approved in 1831, none had been struck since 1804. After consulting with Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt (who had worked at the Mint since its opening in 1792), Moore determined that the last silver dollars struck were dated 1804. Unknown to either of them, the last production in March 1804 was actually dated 1803. Since {{they believed that the}} last striking was dated 1804, it was decided to strike the presentation pieces with that date as well. It is unknown why the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> was not used, but R.W. Julian suggests that this was done to prevent coin collectors from being angered over the fact that they would be unable to obtain the newly dated coins.|$|E
500|$|Juliet is in bed after {{sleeping}} with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, {{and when she}} determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses {{to let her go}} home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the <b>current</b> <b>date,</b> September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of [...] "Left Behind". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's [...] "implant" [...] has been [...] "activated" [...] and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the drop point to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. While setting up her shelter, Juliet looks around the camp and ties a final double knot as Jack smiles at her.|$|E
500|$|Municipalities {{suffered}} most, {{being forced}} to implement taxes, including the alcaba del viento (lit. [...] "wind tax"), which was imposed on foreign suppliers. However, these taxes barely helped, this was because each one had to receive a Royal certification, a bureaucratic procedure which usually lasted several years. Once they reached an established deadline, the process {{would have to be}} repeated, taking an extended amount of time. From January 1, 1636, to December 15, 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed an obligatory payment to the treasuries in Puerto Rico. The debt was to be paid with currency symbolized by legalized papers bearing a Royal seal. Researchers believe that the use of these documents had an impact in the production of banknotes in Puerto Rico. In due time, these documents would be short in supply upon their arrival, in such cases the government officials would stamp the <b>current</b> <b>date</b> into old papers. Pedro Tomás de Cordova and Humberto Burzio claim in their research that Puerto Rico was the first place in America to print 8-real, establishing 1766 as the date for this achievement. Thus, putting Puerto Rico ahead by two decades before Cuba (1781), Hispaniola (1782) and even Spain (1783). Both researchers divided the first two types of banknotes issued, the two varieties were classified as [...] "issued" [...] and [...] "printed". Although both were manufactured using the same method, those referred to as [...] "printed" [...] bore stamps listing numbers and letters. In 1767, the Spanish Crown approved subsequent issues, conditioning that they should be collected once situado shipped. When this was lacking, paper money was used in a widespread manner throughout the main island. These requirements were met when possible, an example of this was in 1769, when 88,000 banknotes were reclaimed by the authorities.|$|E
