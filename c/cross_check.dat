5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed about his past actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. The {{cause of death was}} determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a <b>cross</b> <b>check</b> on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match with that of a relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E
2500|$|This {{single force}} {{measurement}} could not resolve the drag and lift components. [...] This {{was done by}} making two force measurements on different flights and with slightly different support structure geometries, one with the parallel V-struts leaning a little forwards, a second with them leaning back; {{a knowledge of the}} two net forces and of the precise geometry allowed the desired resolution. [...] Rather than fix the rectangular frame directly to the lower longerons and provide alternative locations to change the geometry, Parnall made its readjustment simple by hanging the frame on hinged, near vertical struts from the upper longerons and fixing it in place with four further locating struts from frame to lower longerons. [...] The angle could then be changed by using locating struts of different lengths. [...] Though two angles were sufficient to get the lift and drag, a third measurement at another angle was often made as a <b>cross</b> <b>check.</b> [...] The locating struts lengths were designed so that the wing stayed in the same place and at the same angle of incidence throughout. [...] However, other choices of location strut lengths allowed the wing to be flown at different angles of incidence, for example the high angle experienced by slotted wings. The lift struts entered the fuselage via short horizontal slots to allow from the geometry changes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{buddy system}} is {{expected}} to provide a level of redundancy within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment {{can be seen as}} part of a combined [...] "redundant system": two tanks, two depth gauges/ dive computers, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, – even two brains. During the dive the measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass etc.) are available to <b>cross</b> <b>check</b> one another, a second set of life support equipment (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems. [...] Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single deployable surface marker buoy on which to ascend and mark the team’s position or a single underwater metal detector. [...] The one key thing however, that a buddy team always shares together is a dive plan - and the responsibilities of executing it. [...] A key principle drummed into scuba divers is “plan the dive and dive the plan”. [...] Before a dive a buddy team agree on a plan, which aside from the basic parameters of the dive itself – e.g. [...] depth, course, time, who leads and who follows, - [...] also includes the objectives of the dive: is it general sightseeing, is it the way the divers intend to view a wreck, is it photography, is it hunting a type of game. In technical diving these objectives often become much more complex and very specific – penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities. [...] For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into the assigned roles of hunter and game-catcher, and stower and catchbag-carrier, and the overall dive success is highly dependent on the teamwork of the buddies carrying out their assigned roles.|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} of proposed solution is simply described as below. The source node (SN) sends RREQ to each node, and sends packets to the node which replies the RREP packet.
