40|$|When a {{consumer}} pays in cash or by check and the seller performs improperly, the consumer must initiate {{a lawsuit in}} order to recover his payments, and he cannot recover them or damages until the suit is concluded. Courts and commentators seem untroubled by these disadvantages which attend cash purchases, apparently for two reasons: First, people who pay cash present unsympathetic cases; they have money, and its presence is usually associated with an ability {{to take care of}} oneself. Second, cash sales are cheaper than credit sales because the investment income forgone {{as the result of a}} cash payment will usually be less than the cost of credit. Buyers who purchase on credit are, of course, disadvantaged by having to pay credit costs, but in the event of improper seller performance they can withhold further installment payments; they therefore have a 2 ̆ 2 weapon 2 ̆ 2 to induce performance, they need not initiate law suits, and they can retain at least part of the price during the duration of an action. When, however, a <b>credit</b> <b>purchaser</b> has his note transferred to a finance company, or he waives sales defenses he may have against the seller as against a third party who has financed the sale, or he uses a bank credit card to make the purchase, state law often provides that if the seller breaches, the buyer must continue to make payments to the finance company or bank, and must proceed against the seller. The intervention of a third party, called here the financer, thus visits on the credit buyer the same disadvantages which attend cash purchases and it does this for those consumers who lack the resources to pay cash and who must nevertheless continue to bear the higher costs associated with credit buying...|$|E

25|$|After {{purchasing}} the card, the cardholder loads the account with {{any amount of}} money, up to the predetermined card limit and then uses the card to make purchases {{the same way as}} a typical credit card. Prepaid cards can be issued to minors (above 13) since there is no credit line involved. The main advantage over secured credit cards (see above section) is that the cardholder is not required to come up with $500 or more to open an account. With prepaid <b>credit</b> cards <b>purchasers</b> are not charged any interest but are often charged a purchasing fee plus monthly fees after an arbitrary time period. Many other fees also usually apply to a prepaid card.|$|R

Discount factors are proposed for (i) additionality, (ii) leakage, (iii) permanence, and (iv) uncertainty. Additionality arise when the region where an AO project is being proposed would have substantial adoption of the AO practice in the absence of GHG programs (business as usual GHGE offset). Leakage arises when the effect of a program is offset by an induced increase in economic activity and accompanying emissions elsewhere. The leakage effect depends on demand and supply elasticities. Permanence reflects the saturation and volatility characteristics of carbon sequestration. Carbon is stored in a volatile form and can be released quickly to the atmosphere when an AO practice is discontinued. The permanence discount depends on the project design including practice continuation after the program and the dynamic rate of offset. Also, consideration of multiple offsets is important. Uncertainty arises due to the stochastic nature of project quantity. The uncertainty discount tends to be smaller the larger the size of the offset contract due to aggregation over space and time. The magnitude of these discounts is investigated in Southeast Texas rice discontinuation study. The additionality and the leakage discounts are found {{to play an important role}} in case of rice lands conversion to other crops but less so for pasture conversions and yet less for forest conversions. The permanence discount is important when converting to other crops and short rotation forestry. When all discounts are considered, rice lands conversion to forest yields claimable credits amounting to 52. 8 % ~ 77. 5 % of the total offset. When converting rice lands to pasture, the claimable credits 45. 1 % ~ 64. 2 %, while a conversion of rice lands to other crops yields claimable credits 38. 9 % ~ 40. 4 %...|$|R
60|$|It takes {{money to}} raise a modern revolution, and always the Junta was pressed. The members starved and toiled, and the longest day was none too long, and yet {{there were times when}} it {{appeared}} as if the Revolution stood or fell on no more than the matter of a few dollars. Once, the first time, when the rent of the house was two months behind and the landlord was threatening dispossession, it was Felipe Rivera, the scrub-boy in the poor, cheap clothes, worn and threadbare, who laid sixty dollars in gold on May Sethby's desk. There were other times. Three hundred letters, clicked out on the busy typewriters (appeals for assistance, for sanctions from the organized labor groups, requests for square news deals to the editors of newspapers, protests against the high-handed treatment of revolutionists by the United States courts), lay unmailed, awaiting postage. Vera's watch had disappeared--the old-fashioned gold repeater that had been his father's. Likewise had gone the plain gold band from May Setbby's third finger. Things were desperate. Ramos and Arrellano pulled their long mustaches in despair. The letters must go off, and the Post Office allowed no <b>credit</b> to <b>purchasers</b> of stamps. Then it was that Rivera put on his hat and went out. When he came back he laid a thousand two-cent stamps on May Sethby's desk.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 84 - 88) The {{investment tax}} credit introduced by the Revenue Act of 196 caused {{a great deal of}} furor within the accounting profession in that there was not initially, or even today, any general consensus as to its proper accounting treatment. Basically, the investment tax <b>credit</b> provisions allow <b>purchasers</b> of equipment for business use, a direct credit against federal income taxes. The amount of the credit depends primarily on the cost of the equipment and it s estimated useful life. This paper discusses the proper accounting treatment to be rendered the {{investment tax credit}} and the controversies which it provoked in the accounting profession. The legislative history of the investment tax credit is reviewed in an at tempt to determine the intent of its creator and the Congress which enacted it. The paper then evaluates the various suggested treatments and their effect on income and financial condition. It goes on to investigate methods used in practice and indicates which methods were supported by various informed individuals. Finally, the paper relates the proposed methods to basic accounting theory and concludes that the " 100 percent flow through" method is the treatment which is in accordance with acceptable and sound accounting principles...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy has}} become mainstream. The weird and wacky {{appliances}} of the seventies now mean {{big business and}} big opportunities for small farmers and small processors. Whatever next? At {{the mouth of the}} port of Dakar in Senegal, a kilometre or two off the coast, stands one of Africa s new landmarks: a navigation light. Standing nobly above the waves, on a firm concrete mast, it guides ships around a rocky bank on their port side, and on past the island of Gorée, an old African landmark of the former slave trade, on their starboard. Both landmarks have etched their place in history, one chillingly and shamefully, the light for being powered by batteries fed by the sloping solar panels {{at the top of the}} mast. Even the marks left by seagulls in transit, themselves a form of biomass, cannot long hinder the sun s rays from being caught by the panels. Similar new landmarks are in place in more than half of Africa s 400, 000 villages, and in most of those of the Pacific and the Caribbean. They are now at the forefront of what, two decades ago, was just another dream in the complex area of rural electrification. Then, they lay like discarded toys in a pile of broken dreams that came to be known as a technology graveyard, solar panels alongside ill-sited windmills. Now, times have changed, and while the sun and the wind were patiently waiting, the engineers have climbed their learning curve and simplified maintenance, and costs have fallen. Solar panels and well-sited wind pumps stand as a symbol of appropriate renewable energies, pointing, like those coastal navigation lights, a relatively sure way towards affordable energy supply in rural areas. Energy is the key Energy. It is in energy that we can find the key to development, according to many of those who search for the way to heave a society onto a virtuous spiral of progress. Others will say it is in education and the book. Or in health and nutrition, to tend and feed the body and mind. Or transport and trade, to get closer to markets and better income. Or digital technology, to get the right information. None of these options, and they each have their impassioned proponents, can work without energy. Energy is the light for extended learning and training time; the healthier heat for cooking; the cooling for perishable crops, food and medicine; the pumping for irrigation. It is in the processing and storage of products that reliable energy supply can add the most value to agricultural production. Of course, this is not to belittle the need for energy in the field. In water pumping, more use can be made of wind and solar energy. In mechanised cultivation, the need is for dependable access to fuel and, if possible, to shift away from fossil fuels. Yet in most ACP countries the localised production of alternatives to petrol and diesel, such as ethanol distilled from sugar cane, is still even farther away from the drawing board than the planner is from the field. Applications of renewable energy in agricultural processing come in two forms: direct, and through generated electricity. The use of solar dryers for processing fruit and vegetables is now standard practice in most villages; the ubiquitous towers of trays of produce are ventilated by the convection of warm air, which can be boosted by small solar-powered fans. Similarly, panels of water-filled collectors absorb solar radiation, even on cloudy days, to warm up water for cooking and cleaning, reducing the need for wood or charcoal use in stoves. And, of course, there are the infamous improved small stoves, known as jikos in eastern Africa, or ban uk suf in Senegal, which have noticeably reduced both wood consumption and unhealthy smoke for millions of households and small food processors. Grappling with the grid There is, though, no real alternative to the use of electricity, and here there are many mountains to climb, perhaps literally, before rural supply is a common feature in most villages. In Uganda, for example, less than 1 % of the rural population is connected to the national grid, reflecting the fact that extensive rural grid connection is hindered by high, uneconomical cost. This barrier, says a recent government report, has led to increased self-electrification in rural areas, with people using diesel-powered generators and, increasingly, solar photovoltaic collectors. Such scenarios are known in most ACP countries more than 40 use traditional fuels (mainly wood) for more than three-quarters of their fuel consumption, according to extensive data provided by UNDP s Human Development Report 2002. In recent years, many technical advances have been made in the extension of national electricity grids, in particular on overcoming the tremendous losses of power over transmission lines several hundred kilometres long. Grids are also being linked, one to another, so that they can share electricity. A massive project is currently underway to share power from the Manantali hydro-electricity dam in Mali with Senegal and Mauritania. Using national grids is not, frankly, an option in most rural electrification programmes. They need to be based mainly on the generation of electricity at the local level, in stand-alone systems or isolated grid mini-systems serving a locality. In these, power can be generated from such sources as sugar mills; bagasse is heavily used in, for example, Jamaica, Mauritius and South Africa. Other agricultural wastes, such as rice husks or coffee shells, can also be used. In Uganda, isolated systems will serve relatively concentrated areas with a potential for use by rural enterprises, providing a model for better serving market towns. Their source of power will be mainly from micro-hydro plants, a growing sector in the field of renewables. Creating demand In those dispersed areas where isolated grid systems are not viable, many countries are starting to opt for individual and institutional solar photovoltaic systems. Clinics, schools, guesthouses and small workshops, as well as better-endowed individuals, are shifting towards solar-powered buildings and homes. To really achieve a critical mass of demand, these steps require several support mechanisms: <b>credit</b> to help <b>purchasers,</b> and loans or grants to subsidise the initial cost for local manufacturers. These are exactly the same mechanisms as were used 20 years in Europe to get solar energy off the ground, as it were. And exactly the same as were used to ensure the widespread dissemination of improved wood-burning stoves. Third time lucky, they must be thinking in the ACP solar sector. And, yes, these steps are now being taken in a positive way. The recent launch of the African Rural Energy Enterprise Development (see Links,) is an example of how public-private partnerships are being developed to yank up the production of equipment for affordable energy generation or efficient consumption. It is this business-like approach which will ultimately determine whether the slogan power to the people also works for rural communities. If the new Global Environment Facility of the UN system, due to emerge in early September 2002 from the World Summit on Sustainable Development, is looking for a priority area to work in, alongside changes in consumption in the industrial world, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars, cows, rice paddies and factories, then it is in rural electrification. Maybe the future that only visionaries can see, 30 years from now, is full of new forms of electricity generation, such as covering massive desert areas in ACP countries and elsewhere with vast arrays of solar collectors. In the meantime, if the world cannot bring power to the rural people, then at least help them make it themselves. Sustainably.
