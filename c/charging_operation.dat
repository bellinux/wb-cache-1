When the work was nearly completed, an air raid warning was given and Captain Imai decided to sail immediately. I-202 had reached the open sea when bombing of the base began, but as it was unable to dive it was hit on the aft deck by strafing aircraft.|$|E

First, result are presented form computations to study the effect of load and valve timings on top dead center (TDC) stratification of natural gas introduced through a peripheral valved intake located close to the major axis. It is shown that, consistent with results from earlier work, good stratification may be obtained with this arrangement. Results are then presented from a set of comparisons of measured and computed chamber pressures in a homogeneous charge engine. The set reflects variations in RPM, equivalence ratio, and volumetric efficiency. The measured and computed pressures agree within 15 %. Finally, results are presented from a limited study comparing stratified charge and homogeneous <b>charge</b> <b>operations,</b> to determine the gains in efficiency possible with stratified <b>charge</b> <b>operation.</b> Stratifed <b>charge</b> <b>operation</b> is found to give improvements in indicated efficiency of about 10 %...|$|R

40|$|Industrial mining is an {{area where}} {{automation}} have been researched the last couple of years, with the intentions to increase workplace safety. This Master Thesis Secure the mine is aimed to develop a concept for a remote control station used with a ABB robot in industrial mining, to minimize manual high-risk tasks and hence increase operators’ safety. The project was performed by Hanna Gustafsson and Caroline Henricson, Industrial design engineering students at Luleå University of technology, in collaboration with ABB Corporate Research in Västerås, where the project was initiated to secure hazardous production sites by using automation and the help of a robotic system. The project focused on two operations in mining; charging and media installatio. It was identified through observations of field study-material, occupational injury statistics, expert’s knowledge and previous automation projects that the <b>charging</b> <b>operation</b> was a suitable operation of automation. It is based on a tripartite level of human-robot interaction: autonomous, master-slave and teacher-learner mode. Through theories of usability, accident prevention and automation together with analysis of the charging process and operators’ needs, two remote control station concepts were developed throughout an extensive creative process. One is to be used through remote interaction above ground and one used through proximity interaction underground. The result includes interaction between a supervising operator remotely located, assisting underground operators working with a IRB 2600 industrial robot. The remote control stations include visual simplistic information and navigation systems together with a haptic controller used for manual control of the robot to facilitate and secure the <b>charging</b> <b>operation.</b> Validerat; 20140908 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Plug-in hybrid {{electric}} vehicles (PHEVs) potentially {{have the capability}} to fulfill the energy storage needs of the electric grid by supplying ancillary services such as reactive power compensation, voltage regulation, and peak shaving.
