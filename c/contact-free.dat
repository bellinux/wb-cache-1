50|$|The Optical Stretcher is a dual-beam {{optical trap}} {{that is used}} for {{trapping}} and deforming ("stretching") micrometer-sized soft matter particles, such as biological cells in suspension.The forces used for trapping and deforming objects arise from photon momentum transfer {{on the surface of}} the objects, making the Optical Stretcher - unlike atomic force microscopy or micropipette aspiration - a tool for <b>contact-free</b> rheology measurements.|$|E
50|$|Air {{bearings}} operate <b>contact-free</b> and {{so without}} abrasion. The only friction results from airflow {{air in the}} gap. Thus, the durability of air bearings is unlimited if they are designed and calculated correctly.

50|$|Air {{bearings}} (also {{known as}} aerostatical or aerodynamical bearings) are bearings that use {{a thin film}} of pressurized air to provide an exceedingly low friction load-bearing interface between surfaces. The two surfaces do not touch.

The holding force of an air bearing for one solar panel averages 600 N. This force is achieved by an equal distribution of the load on 16 single air bearing elements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Scanning ion {{conductance}} microscopy (SICM) {{offers the}} ability to obtain very high-resolution topographical images of living cells. One of the great advantages of SICM lies {{in its ability to}} perform <b>contact-free</b> scanning. However, it is not yet clear when the requirements for this scan mode are met.

In view of the existing problems in <b>contact-free</b> palm-vein imaging, including projection transformation, uneven illumination and difficulty in extracting exact ROIs, this paper presents a novel recognition approach for <b>contact-free</b> palm-vein recognition that performs feature extraction and matching on all vein textures distributed over the palm surface, including finger veins and palm veins, to minimize the loss of feature information. First, a hierarchical enhancement algorithm, which combines a DOG filter and histogram equalization, is adopted to alleviate uneven illumination and to highlight vein textures. Second, RootSIFT, a more stable local invariant feature extraction method in comparison to SIFT, is adopted to overcome the projection transformation in <b>contact-free</b> mode. Subsequently, a novel hierarchical mismatching removal algorithm based on neighborhood searching and LBP histograms is adopted to improve the accuracy of feature matching.

40|$|Abstract. We present {{evolutionary}} calculations for 74 close binaries {{systems with}} initial primary masses {{in the range}} 12 [...] . 25 M⊙, and initial secondary masses between 6 and 24 M⊙. The initial periods were chosen such that mass overflow starts during the core hydrogen burning phase of the primary (Case A), or shortly thereafter (Case B). We use a newly developed binary code with up-to-date physics input. Of particular relevance {{is the use of}} OPAL opacities, and the time-dependent treatment of semiconvective and thermohaline mixing. We assume conservative evolution for <b>contact-free</b> systems, i. e., no mass or angular momentum loss from those system except due to stellar winds. We investigate the borderline between <b>contact-free</b> evolution and contact, {{as a function of the}} initial system parameters. The fraction of the parameter space where binaries may evolve while avoiding contact — which we found already small for the least massive systems considered — becomes even smaller for larger initial primary masses. At the upper end of the considered mass range, no <b>contact-free</b> Case B systems exist. While for primary masses of 16 M ⊙ and higher the Case A systems dominate the <b>contact-free</b> range, at primary masses of 12 M ⊙ <b>contact-free</b> systems are more frequent for Case B. We identify the drop of the exponent x in the main sequence mass-luminosity relation of the form L ∝ M x as the main cause for this behaviour. For systems which evolve into contact, we find that this can occur for distinctively different reasons. While Case A systems are prone to contact due to reverse mass transfer during or after the primary’s main sequence phase, all systems obtain contact for initial mass ratios below ∼ 0. 65, with a merger as the likely outcome. We also investigate the effect of the treatment o...|$|E
40|$|The {{equipment}} {{described in}} this paper is being used in an introductory research program at the Department Of Agricultural Engineering, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). A measuring method had to be developed since there was nothing directly available that satisfied our needs. New and better techniques were gradually developed as the research program progressed. An improved equipment design was normally used directly after it had been tested in the laboratory. Two principally dissimilar measurement techniques were used, a Doppler device and a orifice measuring device. The Doppler device is described in sections 5. 1, 5. 2 and 5. 3. Three different versions were developed. Firstly a Doppler device directly attached to the cow’s teat, Secondly a <b>contact-free</b> Doppler device and thirdly a shunted <b>contact-free</b> Doppler device. In sections 5. 4, 5. 5, 5. 6, 5. 7 and 5. 8 the various versions of the orifice measurement system are described. Three different experimental teat cups are listed in this paper. One {{was used in the}} non <b>contact-free</b> measuring system, i. e. the Doppler device was directly attached to the teat. The other two teat cups made it possible to apply a <b>contact-free</b> measuring method. The two latter cups were basically equivalent to one another.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for {{the recovery of}} <b>contact-free</b> levitation of a rotor supported by active magnetic bearings (AMB) is assessed through control strategy design, system modelling and experimental verification. The rotor is considered {{to make contact with}} a touchdown bearing (TDB), which may lead to entrapment in a bi-stable nonlinear response. A linear matrix inequality (LMI) based gain-scheduling H control technique is introduced to recover the rotor to a <b>contact-free</b> state. The controller formulation involves a time-varying effective stiffness parameter, which can be evaluated in terms of forces transmitted through the TDB. Rather than measuring these forces directly, an observer is introduced with a model of the base structure to transform base acceleration signals using polytopic coordinates for controller adjustment. Force transmission to the supporting base structure will occur either through an AMB alone without contact, or through the AMB and TDB with contact and this must be accounted for in the observer design. The controller is verified experimentally in terms of (a) non-contact robust stability and vibration suppression performance; (b) control action for <b>contact-free</b> recovery at typical running speeds with various unbalance and TDB misalignment conditions; and (c) coast-down experimental tests. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AMB control action whenever it operates within its dynamic load capacity...|$|E

40|$|The study {{objective}} was to correlate wear between an in vitro method for simulating wear and in vivo wear of a posterior dental composite. Ten subjects (12 restorations) were selected from a five‐year clinical study (University of North Carolina, School of Dentistry) that assessed wear of SureFil composite (Caulk, Dentsply). Subject casts were digitized and changes in volume and mean depth with time were calculated from the 3 D digital models for contact and <b>contact‐free</b> wear. SureFil composite disks were mounted in the University of Minnesota's Artificial Oral Environment, opposed by natural enamel, subjected to mandibular‐like movements for 150 K, 300 K, 600 K, 1. 2 M, and 1. 5 M cycles, and loaded with peak forces of 13 N (n = 7) or 30 N (n = 3). Wear rates were calculated as {{the slope of the}} linear regressions fitting the wear data. Data were analyzed using one‐way ANOVAs and post hoc t ‐tests where appropriate (p = 0. 05). Clinical restorations included contact wear on seven restorations and <b>contact‐free</b> wear on all restorations. <b>Contact‐free</b> wear was less than contact wear (p < 0. 01). SureFil clinical wear rates were 0. 012 mm/year (mean depth) and 0. 023 mm 3 /year (volume). Clinical restorations expanded slightly during the first year.

The magnetization of ME materials is linked to their mechanical properties, that is, remote (<b>contact-free)</b> magnetic measurements can reveal information on the internal state of the material. Such ME MetGlas alloy stripes are attached to polymer epoxy resin slabs, and the resulting smart systems are dynamically loaded at time–related, growing oscillation amplitudes in a TA Instruments Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer. Both “healthy ” and “damaged ” (faulty) systems are tested, with the inflicted damage being a number of sequentially drilled holes of given diameter (at each test run an extra hole is created). The system’s response to the DMA excitation is remotely collected (<b>contact-free)</b> via a coil located over the slab.
