Refurbished armored personnel carriers were added to the 'A' vehicle fleet of the 1st Reconnaissance Regiment, Sri Lanka Armoured Corps.

40|$|AbstractMuch of what {{is known}} about child abuse in Canada has come from {{reported}} cases of child abuse and at-risk samples, which likely represent the most severe cases of child abuse in the country. The objective of the current study is to examine the prevalence of a broad range of child abuse experiences (physical abuse, sexual abuse, and exposure to IPV) and investigate how such experiences and sociodemographic variables are related to <b>contact</b> with child <b>protection</b> organizations in Canada using a representative general population sample. Data were drawn from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey: Mental Health collected from the 10 provinces using a multistage stratified cluster design (n= 23, 395; household response rate= 79. 8 %; aged 18 years and older). Physical abuse only (16. 8 %) was the most prevalent child abuse experience reported with the exposure to specific combinations of two or more types of child abuse ranging from 0. 4 % to 3. 7 %. Only 7. 6 % of the adult population with a history of child abuse reported having had <b>contact</b> with child <b>protection</b> organizations. Experiencing all three types of child abuse was associated with the greatest odds of <b>contact</b> with child <b>protection</b> organizations (AOR= 15. 8; 95 % CI= 10. 1 to 24. 6). Physical abuse only was associated with one of the lowest odds of <b>contact</b> with child <b>protection</b> organizations.

5000|$|Without {{adequate}} <b>contact</b> <b>protection,</b> {{the occurrence}} of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant and visible damage. Every time a relay transitions either from a closed to an open state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc & bounce arc), under load, an electrical arc can occur between the two contact points (electrodes) of the relay. In many situations, the break arc is more energetic and thus more destructive, in particular with resistive-type loads. However, inductive loads can cause more destructive make arcs. For example, with standard electric motors, the start-up (inrush) current tends to be {{much greater than the}} running current. This translates into enormous make arcs. [...] During an arc event, the heat energy contained in the electrical arc is very high (tens of thousands of degrees Fahrenheit), causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool and migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc cracks the surrounding gas molecules creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. The arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This action causes the material in the contacts to degrade quickly, resulting in device failure. This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10,000 to 100,000 operations, a level far below the mechanical life of the same device, which can be in excess of 20 million operations.|$|E

40|$|A new hybrid {{diverter}} {{design for}} an On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) is presented and experimentally validated. The design differs from existing semiconductor-assisted OLTC systems {{in that the}} part of the system containing semiconductor devices is connected in a purely shunt con guration to the main current path, resulting in a system that is electrically robust and very low loss. The new design provides zero-current, zero-voltage operation of both diverter switches at all times, eff ectively eliminating arc-induced contact wear. Contact lifetime of over twenty-five million operations is demonstrated. Contact wear rates under the new design are compared experimentally with those under alternative <b>contact</b> <b>protection</b> schemes and are shown to be dramatically reduced. A fast electromechanical switch intended for use under the new hybrid diverter is presented. The low-wear conditions created by the new diverter allows a dramatic reduction in the switch moving mass when compared to that of the standard OLTC, allowing sub-half-cycle actuation times to be achieved. A study of switch topology is made in order to guide the design process. An analysis of a magnetic actuator providing both high actuation and static contact forces is also presented. In a second strand of this thesis, a general method of formulating optimal modulation problems for thin power electronic systems incorporating a buck converter is presented. The method is employs a frequency domain representation of the buck converter where the describing equations are formed into a square matrix relating a set of input harmonics to sets of output harmonics. This allows the interaction between the buck converter and a set of linear filters to be modelled in a systematic way. Two example circuits, the Inverter-Less Active Filter and the Controllable Network Transformer, are used as example problems. The use of general-purpose optimisation software for finding optimal modulation waveforms for these circuits is demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Emotion {{regulation}} {{is important for}} daily well-being and health. Emotions are regulated through intrapersonal (i. e., regulating one's own emotions) and interpersonal (i. e., regulating emotions in interaction with others) processes. The current study examines the interplay of an unfavorable intrapersonal emotion regulation strategy “thought suppression” with a favorable interpersonal emotion regulation strategy “responsive touch,” in daily life. Both partners of 102 dating heterosexual couples simultaneously completed an electronic diary assessing their mood and how they dealt with their own and their partner's emotions {{four times a day}} during one week. Multilevel analysis revealed that thought suppression was associated with more negative mood not only in the suppressor but also in the romantic partner. Conversely, responsive touch was associated with more positive mood in both the receiver and the provider of this touch. Importantly, the negative effect of thought suppression was dampened by simultaneous responsive touch from the partner, which suggests a buffering effect of positive partner <b>contact.</b> This <b>protection</b> from the negative effects of maladaptive emotion regulation may point to a pathway through which close relationships contribute to better mental health...|$|R

40|$|A four-layer solid {{oxide fuel}} cell stack with planar anode-supported cells was {{operated}} galvanostatically at 700 °C and 0. 5 Acm− 2 for nearly 35, 000 h. One of the four planes started to degrade more rapidly after ∼ 28, 000 h and finally more progressively after ∼ 33, 000 h. The stack was then shut down and a post-test analysis was carefully performed. The cell was characterized with respect to cathodic impurities and clarification of the reason(s) for failure. Wet chemical analysis revealed very low chromium incorporation into the cathode. However, SEM and TEM observations on polished and fractured surfaces showed catastrophic failure in the degraded layer. The cathode–barrier–electrolyte cell layer system delaminated from the entire cell over large areas. The source of delamination was {{the formation of a}} porous, sponge-like secondary phase consisting of zirconia, yttria and manganese (oxide). Large secondary phase islands grew from the electrolyte–anode interface towards the anode and cracked the bonding between both layers.

40|$|Although CD 8 + T cells play an {{important}} role in controlling viral infections, boosting specific CD 8 + T cells by prophylactic vaccination with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) epitopes fails to provide sterilizing immunity. Viral replication rates and viral contraction rates after the peak viremia hardly depend on the presence of memory CD 8 + T cells. To study these paradoxical findings, we parameterize novel mathematical models for acute SIV and human immunodeficiency virus infection. These models explain that failure of vaccination is due to the fact that effector/target ratios are too low during the viral expansion phase. Because CD 8 + T cells require cell-to-cell <b>contacts,</b> immune <b>protection</b> requires high effector/target ratios at the primary site of infection. Effector/target ratios become favorable for immune control at the time of the peak in the viral load when the virus becomes limited by other factors, such as the availability of uninfected target cells. At the viral set point, effector/target ratios are much higher, and perturbations of the number of CD 8 + effector cells have a large impact on the viral load. Such protective effector/target ratios are difficult to achieve with nucleic acid- or protein-based vaccines...|$|R
