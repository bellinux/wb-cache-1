5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as <b>computer</b> <b>tomography</b> (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Butler {{and colleagues}} {{conducted}} <b>computer</b> <b>tomography</b> scans {{of the juvenile}} skull SAM-PK-K10487. To the surprise of these researchers, replacement teeth yet to erupt were present even in this early ontogenetic stage. Despite these findings, the authors argued that tooth replacement must have occurred since the juvenile displayed the same tooth morphology as adult individuals – this morphology would have changed if the tooth simply grew continuously. In conclusion, Butler and colleagues suggested that tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus must have been more sporadic than in related dinosaurs. Unerupted replacement teeth in Heterodontosaurus were not discovered until 2011, when Norman and colleagues described the upper jaw of specimen SAM-PK-K1334. Another juvenile skull (AMNH 24000) described by Sereno in 2012 also yielded unerupted replacement teeth. As shown by these discoveries, tooth replacement in Heterodontosaurus was episodical and not continuous as in other heterodontosaurids. The unerupted teeth are triangular in lateral view, which is the typical tooth morphology in basal ornithischians. The characteristic chisel-like shape of the fully erupted teeth therefore resulted from tooth-to-tooth contact between the dentition of {{the upper and lower}} jaws.|$|E

The algorithm is well suited to cases in which contours overlap and ambiguities may arise about which regions to fill.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades several liver {{segmentation}} methods have been proposed. The proposed methods go from region growing to the more complex statistical shape models. Despite the robustness of those algorithms, liver segmentation is still a challenging task especially in areas in which its neighboring organs have similar intensities, e. g., heart and ribcage. In addition to this, pathological organs that contain tumors near their surface present additional difficulties. This paper presents a solution to increase the accuracy of those algorithms in the aforementioned areas. The effect of the improvement using the generated heart and ribcage walls (7 % and 1 % respectively) is evaluated on 9 clinical <b>computer</b> <b>tomographies</b> (CT). The improvement (12 %) when tumors are near the surface, on the contrary, is tested on 7 clinical CT images...|$|R
25|$|Barium X-ray {{examinations}} {{are useful}} tools {{for the study}} of appearance and function of the parts of the gastrointestinal tract. They are used to diagnose and monitor esophageal reflux, dysphagia, hiatus hernia, strictures, diverticula, pyloric stenosis, gastritis, enteritis, volvulus, varices, ulcers, tumors, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, as well as to detect foreign bodies. Historically barium X-ray examinations are the standard approach used to assess and diagnose diseases of the gut, but they are increasingly being replaced by more modern techniques such as <b>computer</b> <b>tomography,</b> magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound imaging, endoscopy and capsule endoscopy. However, barium contrast imaging remains a common diagnostic test, which has the advantage of lower costs and being more widely available as compared to newer techniques.

Due to the existence of central slider, the stress state of hollow cylindrical sample will be kept even after unloading and the mixture sample would not have recovery when it is moved for scanning with ICT. The test results show that the combination of the developed ICT with IDT will help obtain more useful information on understanding the nature of asphalt concrete with different tensile damage stages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} fast and {{accurate}} tool for semiautomatic segmentation of volumetric medical images {{based on the}} live wire algorithm, shape-based interpolation and a new optimization method. While the user-steered live wire algorithm represents an efficient, precise and reproducible method for interactive segmentation of selected twodimensional images, the shape-based interpolation allows the automatic approximation of contours on slices between user-defined boundaries. The combination of both methods leads to accurate segmentations with significantly reduced user interaction time. Moreover, the subsequent automated optimization of the interpolated object contours results in a better segmentation quality or {{can be used to}} extend the distances between user-segmented images and for a further reduction of interaction time. Experiments were carried out on hepatic <b>computer</b> <b>tomographies</b> from three different clinics.

The aim of this study was to develop a geographical information system (GIS) -based vertebral canal (VC) map useful for spatial evaluation of extruded disc herniation (EDH) in dogs.
