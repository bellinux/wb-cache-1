50|$|First {{generation}} cephalosporins {{were the}} first cephalosporins on the market. They have good antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria but limited activity against gram-negative species. The chemical structures {{of the first generation}} cephalosporins are fairly simple. As an example three drugs from this class (Cephalexin, Cephradine and Cefadroxil) all have a single methyl group at position C-3. The common side groups at C-3 for first class cephalosporins are small uncharged groups like methyl. The methyl group at position C-3 gives low affinity for common PBP which can in part explain the relatively low activity of these first drugs. <b>Cefaclor</b> however has a Cl group at position C-3 which gives it better binding to PBP and thus better antimicrobial activity. There is not an agreement on classifying <b>Cefaclor</b> as a first generation cephalosporin because of the Cl group at the C-3 position and therefore its improved activity, but it is often classified as such because of its C-7 side chain which is more related to the first generation than the second. All of the first generation cephalosporins have an α-amino group at position C-7. This structure makes them vulnerable to hydrolysis by β-lactamases.|$|E
50|$|Early second {{generation}} cephalosporins {{are very similar}} in basic structure to the first generation. Loracarbef however {{does not have the}} normal dihydrothiazin ring but is a carbacephem that has a carbon atom in the ring instead of a sulfur atom making it a tetrahydropyridine ring. This chemical property gives Loracarbef better stability in plasma while retaining oral absorption characteristics and affinity for binding to PBP. The 7-phenyl-glycine makes it orally available and the chlorine at position C-3 makes it as active as <b>Cefaclor.</b> An important structural change in the development of {{second generation}} cephalosporins was the introduction of an α-iminomethoxy group to the C-7 side chain. This gave an increased resistance to β-lactamases due to stereochemical blocking of the beta-lactam ring. Cefuroxime was the first cephalosporin to incorporate this side chain. Another very important group in the second generation is the aminothiazole ring to the C-3 side chain. This development drastically increased binding affinity to PBP and increased antimicrobial activity. The aminothiazole ring {{can be seen in the}} structure of Cefotiam.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{virulence}} {{factors of}} P. penneri can make infections from this invasive pathogen more pronounced, persistent, {{and harder to}} eradicate. [...] These include adherence due {{to the presence of}} fimbriae or afimbrial adhesins, invasiveness, swarming phenomenon, hemolytic activity, urea hydrolysis, proteolysis, and endotoxicity. Swarming motility is the coordinated translocation of a bacterial population driven by flagellar rotation in film or on fluid surfaces. An emerging concept in microbiology, the fundamental role of swarming motility remains unknown. However, it has been observed to be correlated with an elevated resistance to certain antibiotics. Production of IgA proteolytic enzymes has also been reported in P. penneri. Secretory immunoglobulins of the IgA class are produced by mucous tissue and are particularly resistant to enzymatic breakdown by proteases. The ability to degrade a host’s secretory IgA may provide P. penneri with an advantage by permitting it to evade the host immune response, therefore gaining valuable time for the bacterium to establish a foothold for infection. However, the major mechanism of antimicrobial resistance is caused by hyperproduction of the chromosomally encoded β-lactamase, sometimes by plasmids. These inducible β-lactamases hydrolyze primary and extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins, thus making P. penneri strains naturally resistant to penicillin G, amoxicillin, cephalosporins (i.e. <b>cefaclor,</b> cefazoline, cefuroxime, and cefdinir), oxacillin, and most macrolides.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{in vitro}} suggest that {{cephalosporin}} antibiotics release the gut hormone cholecystokinin. Cholecystokinin {{is known to}} inhibit gastric emptying. Here we {{examine the effects of}} <b>cefaclor</b> on gastric emptying and intestinal motility. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fitted with gastric cannulas. Following a 3 -week recovery, the rate of gastric emptying of saline, peptone (4. 5 %) or <b>cefaclor</b> was determined after instillation into the gastric cannula, while intestinal transit was measured by using the propagation of arabic gum + charcoal mixture given intraduodenally. Gastric emptying of saline was significantly delayed by the addition of <b>cefaclor</b> (3, 10, 30 or 100 [*]mM). The CCK-A antagonist SR- 27897 B (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) reversed the delay induced by 10 [*]mM <b>cefaclor,</b> whereas the CCK-B antagonist CI- 988 (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) had no significant effect. In capsaicin-treated rats, 10 [*]mM <b>cefaclor</b> emptied more rapidly than in vehicle-treated animals. Thirty-minute intestinal transit was increased at 30 and 100 [*]mM of <b>cefaclor,</b> while the gastric acid secretion following <b>cefaclor</b> instillation was no different than the group which received saline. The cephalosporin antibiotic <b>cefaclor</b> appears to be a potent stimulant of CCK release from gut endocrine cells, resembling the effects of peptone. <b>Cefaclor</b> delays gastric emptying via capsaicin-sensitive afferent pathways, which involve CCK-A receptor interaction...|$|E
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{fate of the}} orally effective cephalosporin antibiotic <b>cefaclor</b> (Lilly 99638) has been studied in rats, mice, and dogs. <b>Cefaclor</b> is efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract as the intact antibiotic.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{of single}} doses of <b>cefaclor</b> at 250 and 375 mg and cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg administered under optimal conditions (i. e., cefuroxime axetil after food and <b>cefaclor</b> in the fasted state) were studied in 24 healthy male volunteers. Drug concentrations in serum {{were related to}} MICs for common respiratory tract pathogens by using data generated from a recently completed national survey. The time the concentrations in serum exceeded the MICs for Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella (formerly Branhamella) catarrhalis were significantly greater (P less than 0. 05) for cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg than for <b>cefaclor</b> at 250 or 375 mg. With the recommended dosing regimens (cefuroxime axetil at 250 mg and <b>cefaclor</b> at 375 mg twice daily or <b>cefaclor</b> at 250 mg three times daily), cefuroxime concentrations exceed the MIC for 90 % of the strains tested for a greater time period than <b>cefaclor</b> concentrations with either regimen.

40|$|The {{chemical}} instability of <b>cefaclor</b> handicaps the in-vitro evaluation of its antimicrobial effect {{when compared to}} cephalexin. The continuous turbidimetric study of 8 Escherichia coli cultures subjected to cephalexin and <b>cefaclor</b> showed that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antibiotics, after 20 hours of incubation, were similar (14 μg/ml). Lysis occurred at 16 μg/ml for <b>cefaclor</b> and at 250 μg/ml for cephalexin. The MIC measured after 8 hours of incubation was 2 μg/ml for <b>cefaclor</b> as opposed to 6 μg/ml for cephalexin. The minimum antibiotic concentration (MAC), estimated by the divergence of the growth curve {{in relation to the}} control curve within the first 8 hours of antibiotic-culture contact, was 1 / 3 of the MIC for cephalexin and 1 / 40 for <b>cefaclor.</b> In conclusion, continuous turbidimetric study of cultures of Escherichia coli showed that <b>cefaclor</b> has an antimicrobial effect at lower concentrations than cephalexin.

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} {{and tissue}} penetration, as judged by skin blister fluid, of cefprozil and <b>cefaclor</b> {{were examined in}} 12 healthy male volunteers. Doses of 250 and 500 mg of each drug were given to fasting subjects in a crossover fashion. Serially obtained plasma, skin blister fluid, and urine samples were analyzed for cefprozil or <b>cefaclor</b> by validated high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods. After oral administration of 250 and 500 mg of cefprozil, mean concentrations in plasma rose to peak levels (Cmax) of 6. 1 and 11. 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, and those of <b>cefaclor</b> were 10. 6 and 17. 3 micrograms/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life of cefprozil (1. 3 h) was significantly longer than that of <b>cefaclor</b> (0. 6 h), and as a result, the area under the curve for cefprozil was about two times greater than that for <b>cefaclor.</b> Both cephalosporins were primarily excreted unchanged in urine. The mean skin blister Cmax values were 3. 0 and 5. 8 micrograms/ml for cefprozil and 3. 6 and 6. 5 micrograms/ml for <b>cefaclor</b> after the 250 - and 500 -mg oral doses, respectively. The mean Cmax values in skin blister fluid for both cephalosporins were comparable and were {{significantly lower than the}} corresponding Cmax values in plasma. However, the levels of cefprozil and <b>cefaclor</b> in skin blister fluid declined more slowly than they did in plasma. The skin blister fluid half-life estimates for cefprozil were significantly longer than they were for <b>cefaclor.</b> Parallel to the observation in plasma, the mean skin blister fluid areas under the curve for cefprozil were significantly higher than they were for <b>cefaclor.</b> The plasma and skin blister fluid pharmacokinetic analyses suggest that the exposure of humans to cefprozil is significantly greater than that to <b>cefaclor</b> at the same dose...|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>cefaclor</b> {{were characterized}} in 15 functionally anephric patients on hemodialysis. Each patient received a 500 -mg oral dose of <b>cefaclor</b> every 8 h for 10 days. Multiple serum drug levels were measured by bioassay on day 0 (no hemodialysis), day 10 during hemodialysis, and as single determinations 1 h after administration on days 1, 3, and 5. Analysis of <b>cefaclor</b> kinetics in these 15 patients along with kinetics from 24 previously studied patients showed that weight {{was the best}} single predictor of volume of distribution.
