50|$|Most small model Rocket motors are {{single-use}} engines, with cardboard {{bodies and}} lightweight molded clay nozzles, ranging in impulse class from fractional A to G. Model rockets generally use commercially manufactured black-powder motors. These motors are tested and {{certified by the}} National Association of Rocketry, the Tripoli Rocketry Association (TRA) or the Canadian Association of Rocketry (CAR). Black-powder motors come in impulse ranges from 1/8A to E, although a few F black-powder motors have been made.The physically largest black-powder model rocket motors are typically E-class, as black powder is very brittle. If a large black-powder motor is dropped or exposed to many heating/cooling cycles (e.g., in a <b>closed</b> <b>vehicle</b> exposed to high heat), the propellant charge may develop hairline fractures. These fractures increase the surface area of the propellant, {{so that when the}} motor is ignited, the propellant burns much faster and produces greater than normal internal chamber pressure inside the engine. This pressure may exceed the strength of the paper case and cause the motor to burst. A bursting motor can cause damage to the model rocket ranging from a simple ruptured motor tube or body tube to the violent ejection (and occasionally ignition) of the recovery system.|$|E

5000|$|The {{category}} {{was introduced by}} the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport to take effect from January 1960. Prior {{to the introduction of}} Appendix J, there had been no national regulations for touring car racing in Australia with individual race promoters applying differing rules regarding eligibility and modification of the cars being raced. Under Appendix J, eligibility was restricted to closed cars with seating for four persons and at least one hundred examples of the model had to have been produced. [...] Bodywork and interior trim had to remain virtually standard; however, engines and suspensions could be modified to improve performance and handling. Modifications were permitted in the areas of carburettors, valves, pistons, camshafts, inlet systems, exhaust systems, springs and shock absorbers. Cars competed in numerous classes based on engine capacity with the regulations allowing an increase in capacity up to the limit of the relevant class.

50|$|This {{provision}} {{is both an}} objective emission control, a subjective emission control, and a subjective immission for vehicles on a public right-of-way. The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the plainly audible definition for limiting the sound output. The third part uses the noise disturbance definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants. There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle. Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle. Oregon prohibits sound systems being plainly audible at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be heard at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level. In Lakewood, CO it must not be plainly audible beyond 25 feet. In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet. In Seattle, WA, it must not be plainly audible at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than clearly audible at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts plainly audible to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits. Cincinnati, OH restricts plainly audible to 50 feet. Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations. Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet. Hammond, IN restricts plainly audible to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be plainly audible at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not plainly audible at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am. Florida states the sound must not be plainly audible at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems. Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be plainly audible beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a <b>closed</b> <b>vehicle</b> or 100 feet otherwise. Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is plainly audible on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.|$|E

The proposed algorithm adopts the extinction of population size. BRKGA-PD is coded using Matlab programming with the best parameter setting. The resulting solution is a subrute with a minimum of distribution fee. This algorithm is compared with two other methods, namely BRKGA general and heuristic methods. The results of this study can be concluded that the BRKGA-PD method is able to improve the general BRKGA because with a time difference that is not significant can provide cost savings of Rp. 6. 857,- and BRKGA-PD is better than heuristic method because it can save more cost Rp. 87. 000,-...|$|E

40|$|This paper models {{response}} times and delays for highway incidents, accounting for spacing between interchanges {{and the time}} penalty for changing directions, enabling a response vehicle to reach an incident {{on the opposite side}} of the highway. A fundamental question in dispatching incident crews is whether to send the <b>closest</b> <b>vehicle</b> that is currently available or to wait for another vehicle to become available that is even closer. Waiting for a <b>closer</b> <b>vehicle</b> is advantageous because service time is effectively reduced, adding to capacity and providing stability at higher levels of utilization. But waiting for a vehicle to become available adds uncertainty, which contributes to expected traffic delay. As a consequence, any reasonably robust dispatch strategy must provide for a hybridization of the two objectives, trading-off greater certainty in response time against stability at higher utilization levels. ...|$|R

Do you appreciate the moments of your drive {{in which you can}} listen to or sing along with whatever you like? This book shows how we created auditory privacy in cars, making them feel sound and safe, even though automobiles were highly noisy things {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. It explains how engineers in the automotive industry found pride in making car engines quieter once they realized that noise stood for inefficiency. It follows them as they struggle against sounds audible within the car after the automobile had become a <b>closed</b> <b>vehicle.</b> It tells how noise-induced fatigue became an issue once the car became a mass means for touring across the country. It unravels the initial societal concerns about the dangers of car radio and what it did to drivers' attention span. It explores how car drivers listened to their cars' engines to diagnose car problems, and appreciated radio traffic information for avoiding traffic jams. And it suggests that their disdain for the ever-expanding number of roadside noise barriers made them long for new forms of in-car audio entertainment. This book also allows you to peep behind the scenes of international standardization committees and automotive test benches. What did and does the automotive industry to secure the sounds characteristic for their makes? Drawing on archives, interviews, beautiful automotive ads, and literature from the fields of cultural history, science and technology studies, sound and sensory studies, this book unveils the history of an everyday phenomenon. It is about the sounds of car engines, tires, wipers, blinkers, warning signals, in-car audio systems and, ultimately, about how we became used to listen while driving...|$|E
40|$|Three {{dominant}} Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) class architectures were studied: Series Burn (SB), Parallel Bum with crossfeed (PBw/cf), and Parallel Burn, no-crossfeed (PBncf). The study {{goal was}} to determine what factors uniquely affect PBncf architectures, how each of these factors interact, and to determine from a performance perspective whether a PBncf vehicle could be competitive with a PBw/cf or a SB vehicle using equivalent technology and assumptions. In all cases, performance was evaluated on a relative basis for a fixed payload and mission by comparing gross and dry vehicle masses of a <b>closed</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Propellant combinations studied were LOX: LH 2 propelled booster and orbiter (HH) and LOX: Kerosene booster with LOX: LH 2 orbiter (KH). The study observations were: 1) A PBncf orbiter should be throttled {{as deeply as possible}} after launch until the staging point. 2) A PBncf TSTO architecture is feasible for systems that stage at mach 7. 2 a) HH architectures can achieve a mass growth relative to PBw/cf of < 20 %. 2 b) KH architectures can achieve a mass growth relative to Series Burn of < 20 %. 3) Center of gravity (CG) control will be a major issue for a PBncf vehicle, due to the low orbiter specific thrust to weight ratio and to the position of the orbiter required to align the nozzle heights at liftoff. 4) Thrust to weight ratios of 1. 3 at liftoff and between 1. 0 and 0. 9 when staging at mach 7 appear to be close to ideal for PBncf vehicles. 5) Performance for HH vehicles was better when staged at mach 7 instead of mach 5.

The study showed that a Series Burn architecture has the lowest gross mass for HH cases, and has the lowest dry mass for KH cases. The potential disadvantages of SB are the required use of an air-start for the orbiter engines and potential CG control issues. A Parallel Burn with crossfeed architecture solves both these problems, but the mechanics of a large bipropellant crossfeed system pose significant technical difficulties. Parallel Burn without crossfeed vehicles start both booster and orbiter engines on the ground and thus avoid both the risk of orbiter air-start and the complexity of a crossfeed system. The drawback is that the orbiter must use 20 % to 35 % of its propellant before reaching the staging point. This induces a weight penalty in the orbiter in order to carry additional propellant, which causes a further weight penalty in the booster to achieve the same staging point. One way to reduce the orbiter propellant consumption during the first stage is to throttle down the orbiter engines as much as possible. Another possibility is to use smaller or fewer engines. Throttling the orbiter engines soon after liftoff minimizes CG control problems due to a low orbiter liftoff thrust, but may result in an unnecessarily high orbiter thrust after staging. Reducing the number or size of engines size may cause CG control problems and drift at launch. The study suggested possible methods to maximize performance of PBncf vehicle architectures in order to meet mission design requirements...|$|E
