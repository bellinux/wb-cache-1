40|$|The {{influence}} of heteroblasty on morphological and histocytological characteristics of Acacia mangium shoot apical meristems (SAMs) was assessed comparing materials with mature and juvenile leaf morphology in natural and in vitro conditions. SAM dome height (H), basal diameter (D) and shape (S) varied significantly {{according to the}} four origins of plant material investigated. H and D were highly correlated, with bigger values for the mature source from outdoors “Mat ” than for the other origins. Mat SAMs scored also the higher values for the size {{and the number of}} cells of the two tunica layers (L 1 and L 2), the <b>central</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> (CMC), the peripheral zone (PZ) and the combination of these four SAM hal- 00699815, version 1 - 12 Aug 2013 zones (4 CZ). Overall, cells were noticeably more vacuolized in SAMs from Mat and also from the mature (“IVM”) and juvenile-like “IVJ ” in vitro origins than in those from the outdoor juvenile source “Juv”. These latter were characterized by larger cells and nuclei for L 1 and L 2 tunica layers, whereas Mat SAMs showed smaller nuclei and nucleoplasmic ratios for L 1, L 2, CMC and PZ zones. Some Mat SAM nuclei looked densely stained by NBB while others exhibited numerous chromocenters disseminated in the nucleoplasm where nucleolei could hardly be distinguished. By contrast Juv as well as IVJ and IVM SAM nuclei appeared more evenly and lightly stained and could show clearly distinguishable darker nucleolei possibly surrounded by less abundant chromocenters. ...|$|R
40|$|Histocytological {{characteristics}} of Eucalyptus urophylla 9 Eucalyptus grandis shoot apical meristems (SAMs) were described, comparing five outdoor and in vitro sources of akin genotypes differing in their physiological age. The {{size and the}} number of cells of the five zones identified within each SAM, i. e. the two tunica layers (L 1 and L 2), the <b>central</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> (CMC), the peripheral zone (PZ) and the combination of these four zones (4 CZ) varied according to physiological age and plastochron phase. These five zones were significantly larger with higher numbers of cells for SAMs from mature and juvenile trees than for those from physiologically rejuvenated, in vitro mature and in vitro juvenile plants. However, these origin-related differences were not significant for SAMs in their early plastochron phase, to become obvious in a more advanced plastochron stage. Individual cell and nuclear measurements confirmed the rationale of distinguishing within SAM zones, characterized by specific cell and nuclear sizes liable to vary according to physiological age. The various histocytological investigations carried out established that SAM cell characteristics appeared to be the more reliable indicators of phase change. This was particularly true for the nucleoplasmic ratio and for more qualitative differences observed also at the nuclear level. SAM nuclei of the two in vitro origins were more evenly stained by naphtol blue-black, uniformly light for the juvenile source, whereas the mature source showed also darker nuclei. In contrast, SAM nuclei from outdoor origins had more chromocenters, darker and diffusely spread for the mature source than for the rejuvenated and the juvenile origins, where they were more peripherally distributed and where the nucleoli appeared more clearly. These results were discussed with respect to physiological ageing and in vitro culture influence, and suggest a determining influence of SAM cell nuclei on phase change phenomenon of arborescent species.

40|$|Most {{dicotyledonous}} {{species with}} secondary growth possess a single cylindrical vascular cambium. However, anomalous types are not uncommon. The various classification systems for anomalous patterns of secondary thickening are compared {{and the distribution}} of successive cambria in about 20 families of 13 orders is summarized. The distribution of this feature within the Phytolaccaceae is detailed including new observations showing successive cambia in Stegnosperma. Serial sections of different developmental stages of plant axes permitted precise three-dimensional reconstruction of the vascular system. Macerations of increments adjacent to the plant of transverse sectioning allowed comparison of xylem-cell dimensions between successive increments, different parts of individual plants, and all three species. Comparisons between species reveal that S. cubense has secondary xylem with the largest diameter pores, longest vessel elements, longest fiber-tracheids, and largest diameter fiber-tracheid pits. S. watsonii has the greatest number of pores per square mm, smallest fiber-tracheid diameter, and the largest ratio of fiber-tracheid to vessel-element length. Pore diameter, fiber-tracheid length, and the ratio of fiber tracheid to vessel-element length were less in small stems than in large stems and less in large stems than in roots. Pores per square mm, fiber-tracheid diameter, and vessel-element length were more or less constant between small stems and roots. Most xylary cell dimensions remain constant between successive increments of wood at a given level. The anomalous cambia arise in the conjunctive tissue and function bidirectionally. They are first evident as dedifferentiated parenchyma and then as small fascicular areas. Tangential expansion of existing regions produces larger arcs and rings of vascular tissue. Radial and tangential interconnections between vascular bundles are common in Stegnosperma. Dye movement traced through the axis confirms the presence of a complex network. At the upper and lower limits of a given ring or arc of anomalous vascular tissue, a radial connection occurs with the adjacent inner increment. The resulting pattern is a series of concentric cylinders of cambial zones, which anastomose with inner layers at their top and bottom. The normal increment of secondary thickening is the innermost cylinder and each successive layer forms a shorter but wider sheath around the previous layers. The apical organization of Stegnosperma consists of four zones: tunica, <b>central</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells,</b> peripheral, and pith-rib meristem. A cambium-like or transition zone was not observed. The primary shoot vasculature is described as open, lacking direct vascular connections between sympodia, and followed a 2 / 5 phyllotaxy. Patterns of differentiation in shoot apices are detailed. The organization of the root apex as determined from seedling studies is analyzed by the constituent histogens. The vasculature of seedlings was found to follow the common dicotyledonous pattern. The initiation of secondary growth in the hypocotyl and its acropetal development is also typical of other dicotyledons. Secondary growth ascends the shoot helically according to phyllotaxy. The vascular cambium descends in the root, first appearing opposite the phloem and then in the pericycle. These observations are discussed in light of their differences with earlier studies, compared with other Phytolaccaceae, and examined with regard to the physiological function of the anomaly. Systematic implications are summarized and a tentative phyllogeny of the Phytolaccaceae is given...|$|R

This unusual form of reproduction is an apparent modification of a developmental program used by some Firmicutes to produce an endospore. At the onset of offspring formation, the Epulopiscium cell divides at both poles. The polar cells are engulfed by the larger <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> and grow within the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> At the final stages of development, the Epulopiscium <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> lyses. Here we describe changes in Epulopiscium cell structure, focusing on <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> DNA replication and cell death.

40|$|During {{formation}} of spores by Bacillus subtilis the RNA polymerase factor σG ordinarily becomes active during spore formation {{exclusively in the}} prespore upon completion of engulfment of the prespore by the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Formation and activation of σG ordinarily requires prior activity of σF in the prespore and σE in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Here we report that in spoIIA mutants lacking both σF and the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB and in which σE is not active, σG nevertheless becomes active. Further, its activity is largely confined to the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Thus, there is a switch in the location of σG activity from prespore to <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Factors contributing to the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> location are inferred to be read-through of spoIIIG, the structural gene for σG, from the upstream spoIIG locus {{and the absence of}} SpoIIAB, which can act in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> as an anti-sigma factor to σG. When the spoIIIG locus was moved away from spoIIG to the distal amyE locus, σG became active earlier in sporulation in spoIIA deletion mutants, and the sporulation septum was not formed, suggesting that premature σG activation can block septum formation. We report a previously unrecognized control in which SpoIIGA can prevent the appearance of σG activity, and pro-σE (but not σE) can counteract this effect of SpoIIGA.

Information gained from this yeast model is relevant to many organisms, including humans, since DNA repair and DNA damage response factors are well conserved across diverse species. However, S. cerevisiae {{has not yet been}} used to fully address whether the rate of accumulating mutations changes with increasing replicative (mitotic) age due to technical constraints.

In the coat, the two proteins interact to form a coat component of 23 kDa. The CotU-CotC interaction was not detected in two heterologous hosts, suggesting that it occurs only in B. subtilis. Monomeric forms of both CotU and CotC failed to be assembled at the surface of the developing spore and accumulated in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> compartment of cells mutant for cotE. In contrast, neither CotU nor CotC accumulated in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> compartment of cells mutant for cotH. These results suggest that CotH is required to protect both CotU and CotC in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> compartment of the sporangium and that CotE is needed to allow their assembly and subsequent interaction at the spore surface...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWe {{investigated}} developmental commitment during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Sporulation is {{initiated by}} nutrient limitation and involves {{division of the}} developing cell into two progeny, the forespore and the <b>mother</b> <b>cell,</b> with different fates. Differentiation becomes irreversible following division when neither the forespore nor the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> can resume growth when provided with nutrients. We show that commitment is governed by the transcription factors σF and σE, which are activated in the forespore and the <b>mother</b> <b>cell,</b> respectively. We further show that commitment involves spoIIQ, which is {{under the control of}} σF, and spoIIP, which is under the control of both σF and σE. In the presence of nutrients, the forespore can exhibit rodlike, longitudinal growth when SpoIIQ and SpoIIP are absent, whereas the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> can do so when SpoIIP alone is absent. Thus, developmental commitment of this single-celled organism, like that of the cells of complex, multicellular organisms, ensures that differentiation is maintained despite changes in the extracellular milieu...|$|R
