The 2007–2008 Kenyan crisis followed the presidential election that was held on 27 December 2007. The Electoral Commission of Kenya officially declared that the incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was re-elected; supporters of the opposition candidate Raila Odinga accused the government of electoral fraud and rejected the results. A series of protests and demonstrations followed, and fighting—mainly along tribal lines—led to many deaths, injuries and displacements.|$|E

5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty.

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{argument of}} this thesis is that, contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have, to varying degrees, exerted significant impacts on judicial, legislative, and executive, thoughts, processes, and actions within conflict, post-conflict and non-conflict {{states in the}} Commonwealth. This thesis analyzes evidence of these impacts by examining states in the Commonwealth, where contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have operational and jurisdictional relevance. It does this by categorizing such states into four groups of states, conflict, post-conflict, non-conflict states and states where contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have made marginal impacts. The thesis evaluates the impacts of contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals in these states by analyzing evidence, garnered from a study of judicial, legislative and executive actions and processes influenced directly or indirectly by contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals with operational and jurisdictional relevance in the Commonwealth. The thesis also undertakes {{an assessment of the}} overall impact of contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals in the Commonwealth on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, actions and processes. In assessing the impact, the thesis is framed by two overarching arguments which {{set the tone for the}} discussions and analysis undertaken here. The first is that, certain factors such as engagement by the different courts and tribunals with states, the role of states actors and institutions; have helped contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals exert marginal to major influences on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. The second overarching argument made in the thesis in assessing the impact of these contemporary international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals is that, certain factors such as the poor visibility of international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals within Commonwealth States, conflicting visions of justice that these courts and tribunals ought to dispense by relevant stakeholders and the non-transposition of the norms of international criminal law and international humanitarian law within Commonwealth States; have inhibited the impact of these courts and tribunals on judicial, legislative and executive thoughts, processes and actions within the Commonwealth. It concludes by noting that international <b>criminal</b> <b>courts</b> and tribunals have had different levels of impacts on states across the Commonwealth due to the coalescence of the foregoing factors...|$|R

5|$|During {{protracted}} enquiries {{before the}} case {{went to court}} in 1871, details emerged suggesting that the Claimant might be Arthur Orton, a butcher's son from Wapping in London, {{who had gone to}} sea as a boy and had last been heard of in Australia. After a civil court had rejected the Claimant's case, he was charged with perjury; while awaiting trial he campaigned throughout the country to gain popular support. In 1874, a <b>criminal</b> <b>court</b> jury decided that he was not Roger Tichborne and declared him to be Arthur Orton. Before passing a sentence of 14 years, the judge condemned the behaviour of the Claimant's counsel, Edward Kenealy, who was subsequently disbarred because of his conduct.|$|E
