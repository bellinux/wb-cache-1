25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a <b>cringle</b> in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the <b>cringle.</b> From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|E

These can be led back to the cockpit to allow crew members to reef without going on deck in heavy weather. Intermediate reef <b>cringles</b> are not used.|$|R

5000|$|Corners - The {{names of}} corners of sails vary, {{depending}} on shape and symmetry. In a triangular sail, {{the corner where}} the luff and the leech connect is called the head. On a square sail, the top corners are head <b>cringles,</b> where there are grommets, called <b>cringles.</b> On a quadrilateral sail, the peak is the upper aft corner of the sail, at the top end of a gaff or other spar. The throat is the upper forward corner of the sail, at the bottom end of a gaff or other spar. Gaff-rigged sails, and certain similar rigs, employ two halyards to raise the sails: the throat halyard raises the forward, throat end of the gaff, while the peak halyard raises the aft, peak end.|$|R

6000|$|This musical passion follow'd my {{theatrical}} one.

60|$|Under cool porticoes {{and through}} tall doorways are seen dark 'stores,' filled with {{all manner of}} good things from Britain or from the United States. These older-fashioned houses, built, I presume, on the Spanish model, are not without a certain stateliness, from the depth and breadth of their chiaroscuro. Their doors and windows reach almost to the ceiling, {{and ought to be}} plain proofs, in the eyes of certain discoverers of the 'giant cities of Bashan,' that the old Spanish and French colonists were nine or ten feet high apiece. On the doorsteps sit Negresses in gaudy print dresses, with stiff turbans (which are, {{according}} to this year's fashion, of chocolate and yellow silk plaid, painted with thick yellow paint, and cost in all some four dollars), all aiding in the general work of doing nothing: save where here and there a hugely fat Negress, possibly with her 'head tied across' in a white turban (sign of mourning), sells, or tries to sell, abominable sweetmeats, strange fruits, and junks of sugar-cane, to be gnawed by the dawdlers in mid-street, while they carry on their heads everything and anything, from half a barrow-load of yams to a saucer or a beer-bottle. We never, however, saw, as Tom <b>Cringle</b> did, a Negro carrying a burden on his chin.|$|E
25|$|Bowlines {{run from}} the leech (outer {{vertical}} edges) of a sail forward (towards the bow) and are used to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus preventing it from curling back on itself. To extend its spread it was often attached to a bridle and thence {{to three or four}} bowline <b>cringles</b> set upon the leech.|$|R
5000|$|The bowline knot {{is thought}} to have been first {{mentioned}} in John Smith's 1691 work A Sea Grammar under the name Boling knot. Smith considered the knot to be strong and secure, saying, [...] "The Boling knot is also so firmly made and fastened by the bridles into the <b>cringles</b> of the sails, they will break, or the sail split before it will slip." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1822 he left Jamaica {{and settled}} in Glasgow, where he engaged in business. Tom <b>Cringles</b> Log began to appear {{serially}} in Blackwoods Magazine in 1829. Scott’s second story, The Cruise of the Midge, was also first published serially in Blackwoods in 1834-1835. The first appearance in book-form of each story was in Paris in 1834. Both stories - [...] "interesting autobiographical portraits of jamaica in the 1820s, written by a perceptive and sympathetic, but transient observer" [...] - were originally published anonymously, and their authorship was not known till after Scotts death at Glasgow.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} that caught our eye on board the negro boats which were {{alongside}} was, of course, the baskets of fruits and vegetables, of which one of us at least had been hearing all his life. At St. Thomas's we had been introduced to bananas (figs, as they are miscalled in the West Indies); to the great green oranges, thick- skinned and fragrant; to those junks of sugar-cane, some two feet long, which Cuffy and Cuffy's ladies delight to gnaw, walking, sitting, and standing; increasing thereby {{the size of their}} lips, and breaking out, often enough, their upper front teeth. We had seen, and eaten too, the sweet sop {25a}--a passable fruit, or rather congeries of fruits, looking like a green and purple strawberry, of the bigness of an orange. It is the cousin of the prickly sour-sop; {25b} of the really delicious, but to me unknown, Chirimoya; {25c} and of the custard apple, {25d} containing a pulp which (as those who remember the delectable pages of Tom <b>Cringle</b> know) bears a startling likeness to brains. Bunches of grapes, at St. Kitts, lay among these: and at St. Lucia we saw with them, for the first time, Avocado, or Alligator pears, alias midshipman's butter; {26a} large round brown fruits, to be eaten with pepper and salt by those who list. With these, in open baskets, lay bright scarlet capsicums, green coconuts tinged with orange, great roots of yam {26b} and cush-cush, {26c} with strange pulse of various kinds and hues. The contents of these vegetable baskets were often as gay-coloured as the gaudy gowns, and still gaudier turbans, of the women who offered them for sale.|$|E
50|$|Slab reefing, which {{involves}} lowering the sail by about one-quarter to {{one-third of its}} full length and tightening {{the lower part of}} the sail using an outhaul or a pre-loaded reef line through a <b>cringle</b> at the new clew, and hook through a <b>cringle</b> at the new tack.|$|E
5000|$|Lash the tack reef <b>cringle</b> to the boom, or secure on reefing hook if present.Pull the leech reef <b>cringle</b> {{away from}} the mast, {{stretching}} the sail taut along the boom. Lash the leech <b>cringle</b> to the boom, {{and then to the}} end of the boom. Then tie the remaining reefs with sail ties. With lighter gauge sails or reef points reef the sail to itself rather than around the boom to prevent the reefing cringles from being torn out. Secure the sail ties with a reef (square) knot.|$|E
5000|$|After {{preliminary}} {{education at}} Glasgow, {{he was placed}} in 1801 as a pupil with the Rev. Dr. Home, Chiswick, and some months later with the Rev. Dr. Scott, Hounslow. For several months in 1803, he was with Dr. Sommers at Mid Calder, Midlothian, preparatory to entering Glasgow University, where he matriculated the following November. He studied there three winters, proving himself an able if not very diligent student. His close college companion, of whom he saw little in after life, was Michael Scott, the author of 'Tom <b>Cringle's</b> Log.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Sails {{may have}} {{built-in}} alternative attachment points that allow their {{area to be}} reduced. In a mainsail, pairs of grommets, called reefing tacks, reefing clews, or reefing <b>cringles</b> may be installed in the sail; a cruising boat will typically have two to three pairs. Pulling these points down to the boom forms a new tack and clew, reducing the sail's area. Using the pair of grommets closest to the boom is called a single reef, using the next pair is called a double reef, and so on. A sail may have reef points, small holes in the sail between the grommets. These are used to secure the excess fabric of the sail after reefing to minimize flogging and improve visibility from the cockpit. To reef the sail of a Bermuda rigged sloop: ...|$|R
50|$|Sails feature {{reinforcements}} {{of fabric}} layers where lines attach at grommets or <b>cringles.</b> A bolt rope may be sewn onto {{the edges of}} a sail to reinforce it, or to fix the sail into a groove in the boom, in the mast, or in the luff foil of a roller-furling jib. They may have stiffening features, called battens, that help shape the sail, when full length, or just the roach, when present. They may {{have a variety of}} means of reefing them (reducing sail area), including rows of short lines affixed to the sail to wrap up unused sail, as on square and gaff rigs, or simply grommets through which a line or a hook may pass, as on Bermuda mainsails. Fore-and-aft sails may have tell-tales—pieces of yarn, thread or tape that are affixed to sails—to help visualize airflow over their surfaces.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>cringle</b> is an eye {{through which}} to pass a rope. In {{nautical}} settings, the word refers to a small hole anywhere along the edge or {{in the corner of}} a sail, rimmed with stranded cordage and worked into the boltrope. [...] Typically it encloses a metal grommet for reinforcement and to reduce wear. In this context, <b>cringle</b> and grommet coincide enough that the two are sometimes used interchangeably.|$|E

5000|$|Grommets {{are used}} to {{reinforce}} holes in leather, cloth, shoes, canvas and other fabrics. They can be made of metal, rubber, or plastic, and are easily used in common projects, requiring only the grommet itself and a means of setting it with a punch, a metal rod with a [...] tip. A simple punch, often sold with the grommets, can be struck with a hammer to set the grommet. It can also be set with an electronic, pneumatic, or gas-powered machine. There are also dedicated grommet presses with punch and anvil, {{as shown in the}} picture, ranging from inexpensive to better-quality tools, which are somewhat faster to use. They {{are used to}} strengthen holes; in footwear for boot and shoe laces, in laced clothing such as corsets, and in curtains and other household items that require hanging from hooks, as when they are used in conjunction with tensioner rods for shower curtains. The grommet prevents the cord from tearing through the hole, thereby providing structural integrity. Small grommets are also called eyelets, especially when used in clothing or crafting. Eyelets may be used purely decoratively for crafting. When used in sailing and various other applications they are called <b>cringles.</b> Sometimes field workers may refer to them as grunyons.|$|R
