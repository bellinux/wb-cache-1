This article reports {{the results of an}} accelerated aging test aimed at studying the physical deterioration of azulejos caused by cycles of dissolution and re-crystallization of sodium chloride (NaCl). Experiments were carried out on 26 Portuguese azulejos from the 17 th– 19 th century, some of which with original manufacturing defects or with varying degrees of previous decay. The results of 75 cycles over 18 months did not verify that the action of NaCl could trigger an accelerated loss of glaze in a healthy azulejo.

This method differs from the one which we have just examined in turning our attention directly to the causes or agents, instead of turning it to the effect, recovery from the disease. And since, as a general rule, the effects of causes are far more accessible to our study than the causes of effects, it is natural {{to think that this}} method has a much better chance of proving successful than the former.|$|R
40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} {{is relatively}} common {{among the elderly}} population, contributing substantially to the high prevalence of anemia observed in the last decades of life, {{which in turn has}} important implications both on quality of life and on survival. In elderly subjects, iron deficiency is often multifactorial, i. e. due to multiple <b>concurring</b> <b>causes,</b> including inadequate dietary intake or absorption, occult bleeding, medications. Moreover, because of the typical multimorbidity of aged people, other conditions leading to anemia frequently coexist and make diagnosis of iron deficiency particularly challenging. Treatment of iron deficiency is also problematic in elderly, since response to oral iron is often slow, with a substantial fraction of patients showing refractoriness and requiring cumbersome intravenous administration. In the last decade, the discovery of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin has revolutionized our understanding of iron pathophysiology.

40|$|Almost {{two thirds}} of major {{coronary}} events take place in subjects over 65 years of age. Old (65 – 75 years), very old (75 – 85 years), and oldest old (85 + years) individuals should be considered separately when addressing cardiovascular (CV) risk. Several observational investigations {{have shown that the}} relationship between plasma cholesterol and CV events is less stringent with advancing age, especially in the very old and oldest old subject. In this context, both a decrease in total cholesterol and low HDL-C levels may be linked to coronary morbidity and total mortality through an independent association with disability and frailty. On the other hand, although elevated plasma LDL-C might still represent a CV risk factor in older people, the potential benefits originating from its reduction may exceed those obtained in younger ages, given the higher prevalence of CV disease in late life. At present statins, which represent the most effective hypocholesterolemic drugs, have been shown to significantly reduce CV events up to 82 years of age in randomized controlled trials and epidemiological surveys. The occurrence of multiple chronic conditions (comorbidity), decreased life expectancy and polypharmacotherapy suggest the need for a careful assessment of indications for aggressive hypolipidemic treatment.

40|$|Guidelines on the {{diagnosis}} and management of urinary tract infections in childhood do not {{address the issue of}} abnormalities in Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and acid-base balance. We have conducted a narrative review of the literature with the aim to describe the underlying mechanisms of these abnormalities and to suggest therapeutic maneuvers. Abnormalities in Na(+), K(+), Cl(-) and acid-base balance are common in newborns and infants and uncommon in children of more than 3  years of age. Such abnormalities may result from factitious laboratory results, from signs and symptoms (such as excessive sweating, poor fluid intake, vomiting and passage of loose stools) of the infection itself, from a renal dysfunction, from improper parenteral fluid management or from the prescribed antimicrobials. In addition, two transient renal tubular dysfunctions may occur in infants with infectious renal parenchymal involvement: a reduced capacity to concentrate urine and pseudohypoaldosteronism secondary to renal tubular unresponsiveness to aldosterone that presents with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia and acidosis. In addition to antimicrobials, volume resuscitation with an isotonic solution is required in these children. In secondary pseudohypoaldosteronism, isotonic solutions (such as 0. 9  % saline or lactated Ringer) correct not only the volume depletion but also the hyperkalemia and acidosis. In conclusion, our review suggests that in infants with infectious renal parenchymal involvement, non-renal and renal <b>causes</b> <b>concur</b> to <b>cause</b> fluid volume depletion and abnormalities in electrolyte and acid-base balance, most frequently hyponatremia...|$|R

60|$|These simple or {{elementary}} Laws of Mind {{have been}} ascertained by the ordinary methods of experimental inquiry; nor {{could they have}} been ascertained in any other manner. But {{a certain number of}} elementary laws having thus been obtained, it is a fair subject of scientific inquiry how far those laws can be made to go in explaining the actual phenomena. It is obvious that complex laws of thought and feeling not only may, but must, be generated from these simple laws. And it is to be remarked, that the case is not always one of Composition of Causes: the effect of <b>concurring</b> <b>causes</b> is not always precisely the sum of the effects of those causes when separate, nor even always an effect of the same kind with them. Reverting to the distinction which occupies so prominent a place in the theory of induction, the laws of the phenomena of mind are sometimes analogous to mechanical, but sometimes also to chemical laws. When many impressions or ideas are operating in the mind together, there sometimes takes place a process of a similar kind to chemical combination. When impressions have been so often experienced in conjunction, that each of them calls up readily and instantaneously the ideas of the whole group, those ideas sometimes melt and coalesce into one another, and appear not several ideas, but one; in the same manner as, when the seven prismatic colors are presented to the eye in rapid succession, the sensation produced is that of white. But as in this last case it is correct to say that the seven colors when they rapidly follow one another generate white, but not that they actually are white; so it appears to me that the Complex Idea, formed by the blending together of several simpler ones, should, when it really appears simple (that is, when the separate elements are not consciously distinguishable in it), be said to result from, or be generated by, the simple ideas, not to consist of them. Our idea of an orange really consists of the simple ideas of a certain color, a certain form, a certain taste and smell, etc., because we can, by interrogating our consciousness, perceive all these elements in the idea. But we can not perceive, in so apparently simple a feeling as our perception of the shape of an object by the eye, all that multitude of ideas derived from other senses, without which it is well ascertained that no such visual perception would ever have had existence; nor, in our idea of Extension, can we discover those elementary ideas of resistance, derived from our muscular frame, in which it has been conclusively shown that the idea originates. These, therefore, are cases of mental chemistry; in which it is proper to say that the simple ideas generate, rather than that they compose, the complex ones.|$|R

Two groups of H. pylori-infected and H. pylori-treated patients were retrospectively identified: 45 not eradicated and 57 eradicated. Treatment failure was significantly correlated with Cla(R) (all resistant strains in non-eradicated patients); with TNF-alpha- 238, IL 10 - 819, IL 10 - 592, IL- 12 B+ 15485 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); with IL 10 ATA/ATA haplotype; and with antral inflammatory grade. On considering Cla(S) -infected patients only, logistic regression analysis (eradication = dependent; TNF-alpha- 238, IL- 12 B+ 15485 genotypes, IL 10 ATA/ATA as present or absent, antral gastritis grade = covariates) confirmed as significantly correlated with eradication antral gastritis grade only (Exp(B) = 6. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 2 - 35. 01). In conclusion, the bacterial determinant causing triple therapy failure is clarithromycin resistant, being virulence genes not involved. The host related factors that favor eradication are those linked to inflammation: a higher inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa, possibly favored by genotypes able to down regulate the anti-inflammatory cytokine response, enhance the chance of eradication success...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{hypoglycemia}} {{is known}} to be associated with levofloxacin, patients are continually being hospitalized because of this adverse event. Here we have reported two further cases of severe hypoglycemia and discussed the possibility that the hypoglycemia is the result of interactions between levofloxacin and certain drugs, in order to alert physicians to be aware that geriatric patients, particularly those with Type 2 diabetes and in polytherapy, are at risk of showing this adverse reaction. CASES SUMMARY: A 91 -year-old woman with Type 2 diabetes on metformin and glibenclamide, also under treatment with oral antihypertensive drugs, platelet antiaggregant, low-molecular- weight heparin and buprenorphine, was prescribed levofloxacin for a bacterial infection. Liver function and renal function parameters were within normal limits. After repeated administration of levofloxacin, her serum glycemic levels had decreased to 47 mg/dl and the patient was in a coma. After stopping levofloxacin her glycemia level returned to the normal value. A 61 year-old male, affected by tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, with Type 2 diabetes on metformin and glibenclamide, under treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin for deep venous thrombosis, hydromorphone and undergoing nutritional support, was treated with levofloxacin for a bacterial infection. After 72 h the patient was unresponsive and his blood glucose levels were 38 mg/dl. After discontinuation of levofloxacin administration the patient was treated with glucose infusion and his glycemic values gradually returned to the normal range. DISCUSSION: The causality relationship between the levofloxacin and the hypoglycemia was established using Naranjo's ADR probability scale. These case reports confirm the literature data that serious hypoglycemia may develop due to the use of levofloxacin and appears to occur most frequently in elderly patients with Type 2 diabetes who are receiving oral hypoglycemic agents. We described the possible pharmacokinetic and pharmacodinamic mechanisms of the interaction between levofloxacin and the other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesized that the concomitant use of several drugs and particularly levofloxacin in association with oral antidiabetic drugs, opioid analgesics and low-molecular-weight heparin could <b>concur</b> to <b>cause</b> this side effect. The safety and tolerability of this anti-infective agent should be revised urgently...|$|R
40|$|Optical phase {{synchronization}} {{is an important}} issue in coherent optical beamforming systems. In this kind of architectures, the optical carrier produced by a common laser is split and then modulated by the RF signals coming from different antenna elements, delayed as desired, and combined in couplers. At the combining points it is fundamental that the optical carriers on the two branches are in phase, so that constructive interference can occur at the detector, resulting in maximized optical power and, as a consequence, maximized RF signal power. The issue of optical {{phase synchronization}} becomes particularly sensitive when dealing with hybrid setups, where the integrated optical chips are connected by means of optical fibers. In this case, a number of <b>causes</b> <b>concur</b> to de-synchronize the optical phases, originating destructive interference and dramatically reducing the output signal-to-noise ratio of the system. In this thesis, several solutions to this problem are proposed and analyzed. The total power feedback loop technique is then chosen as the most suitable approach, and shown to be a valid solution to synchronize the optical phases. Several feedback algorithms are analyzed and simulated in their pros and cons, and then an optimum hybrid algorithm is chosen to allow, at the same time, local maxima avoidance and fast tracking against phase drifts. The performance of this solution was first simulated, optimized in its parameters and nally implemented and tested in the real system. This work proved that, by means of the designed feedback loop, the optical output power is successfully stabilized at the maximum value despite the drifting in the hybrid setup parameters.

Acute necrotizing pancreatitis infection occurs for gastrointestinal bacterial translocation due to structural and functional modifications of intestinal mucosa. These modifications are results of mucosa ischemic-reperfusion system caused by systemic emodynamic instability in micro- and macro-circulation of splanchnic district. Emodynamic systemic instability has {{a central role}} in different multiple physiopathologic phenomena (ipovolemic shock; pancreatic shock, SIRS), which is caused by acute pancreatic necrosis and carries to common way established by severe systemics emodinamics modifications; these changes promote growth of adverse events which conduce by means of process previously described to bacterial translocation and infection of acute pancreatic necrosis. Indeed, emodynamic systemic instability of any etiology, can determine for one way bacterial translocation and on the other acute ischemic pancreatitis; both phenomena <b>concur</b> lead to <b>cause</b> beginning of acute necrotizing pancreatitis complicated by infection. The authors confirm that improved knowledge of acute pancreatic necrosis complicated by infection and own pathogenetic correlations with bacterial translocation, allows the realization of therapeutic measures aimed to prophylaxis of infection of acute pancreatic necrosis.

5000|$|Like Grattan, Flood and Charlemont favoured Parliamentary reform, but, unlike him, {{they were}} opposed to Catholic concessions. As for Foster and Fitzgibbon, who led the forces of {{corruption}} and bigotry, they opposed every attempt at reform, and consented to the Act of 1793 only under strong pressure from Pitt and Dundas. These English ministers, alarmed at the progress of French revolutionary principles in Ireland, fearing a foreign invasion, wished to have the Catholics contented. In 1795 further concessions seemed imminent. In that year an illiberal viceroy, Lord Westmoreland, {{was replaced by the}} liberal-minded Lord Fitzwilliam, who came understanding it to be the wish of Pitt that the Catholic claims were to be conceded. He at once dismissed from office a rapacious office-holder named Beresford, so powerful that he was called the [...] "King of Ireland"; he refused to consult Lord Chancellor Fitzgibbon or Foster, the Speaker; he took Grattan and Ponsonby into his confidence, and declared his intention to support Grattan's bill admitting Catholics to Parliament. The high hopes raised by these events were dashed to the earth when Fitzwilliam was suddenly recalled, after having been allowed to go so far without any protest from Portland, the home secretary, or from the premier, Pitt. The latter, disliking the Irish Parliament because it had rejected his commercial propositions in 1785, and disagreed with him on the regency in 1789, already mediated a legislative union, and felt that the admission of Catholics to Parliament would thwart his plans.

Possibly, other <b>causes</b> <b>concurred</b> with these to bring about the sudden and disastrous change which filled Catholic Ireland with grief, and the whole nation with dismay.|$|R
60|$|The {{preceding}} discussions have rendered us {{familiar with}} the case in which several agents, or <b>causes,</b> <b>concur</b> as conditions to the production of an effect; a case, in truth, almost universal, there being very few effects to the production of which no more than one agent contributes. Suppose, then, that two different agents, operating jointly, are followed, under a certain set of collateral conditions, by a given effect. If either of these agents, instead of being joined with the other, had operated alone, under the same set of conditions in all other respects, some effect would probably have followed, which would have been different from the joint effect of the two, and more or less dissimilar to it. Now, if we happen to know what would be the effect of each cause when acting separately from the other, we are often able to arrive deductively, or a priori, at a correct prediction of what will arise from their conjunct agency. To render this possible, it is only necessary that the same law which expresses the effect of each cause acting by itself, shall also correctly express the part due to that cause of the effect which follows from the two together. This condition is realized in the extensive and important class of phenomena commonly called mechanical, namely the phenomena of the communication of motion (or of pressure, which is tendency to motion) from one body to another. In this important class of cases of causation, one cause never, properly speaking, defeats or frustrates another; both have their full effect. If a body is propelled in two directions by two forces, one tending to drive it to the north and the other to the east, it is caused to move in a given time exactly as far in both directions as the two forces would separately have carried it; and is left precisely where it would have arrived if it had been acted upon first by one of the two forces, and afterward by the other. This law of nature is called, in dynamics, the principle of the Composition of Forces; and in imitation of that well-chosen expression, I shall give the name of the Composition of Causes to the principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum of their separate effects.|$|R
40|$|Descartes, Gassendi, Galileo, Boyle, Spinoza, and Hobbes, {{among many}} others, were adherents of what Boyle called 2 ̆ 2 the {{mechanical}} philosophy 2 ̆ 2. According to the mechanical philosophy, {{the explanation for}} all natural phenomena {{is found in the}} various motions and collisions of insensible particles of matter. The first half of the 17 th Century saw a number of efforts to systematize the mechanical philosophy by providing it with a solid metaphysical foundation. In his Principles of Philosophy Descartes put forth perhaps the most successful and influential of these early efforts. Spinoza, like many of his contemporaries, was impressed with Descartes 2 ̆ 7 system; nevertheless, he was convinced of the inadequacy of the underlying metaphysics. The basic tools of mechanistic explanation are matter and motion, and any attempt to systematize the mechanical philosophy must offer accounts of each of these tools. It was with Descartes 2 ̆ 7 account of precisely these tools that Spinoza took issue. In my dissertation I argue that much of what is distinctive about Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s metaphysics arose, at least partially, as the result of Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to replace Descartes 2 ̆ 7 suspect metaphysics of matter and the relation between matter and motion, with philosophically adequate accounts. ^ I begin in chapter one by offering a characterization of 17 th Century mechanism in general. I then turn to Descartes 2 ̆ 7 specific interpretation of mechanism and metaphysics which underlie it by taking {{a close look at the}} first two books of Descartes 2 ̆ 7 Principles of Philosophy. Last, I show Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s commitment to Descartes 2 ̆ 7 account of mechanism. In chapter two I present and critically evaluate Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s criticisms of Descartes 2 ̆ 7 account of matter. I show that Spinoza offers two arguments for the conclusion that Descartes 2 ̆ 7 account can 2 ̆ 7 t be right, and that the lesson he draws is that no corporeal substance is (i) composed of really distinct parts, (ii) a body, despite the fact that it is extended and (iii) as such, Descartes is wrong to think that the essence of body is extension. In chapter three I argue that these considerations lead Spinoza to maintain that regions of extension, as opposed to bodies, are the subjects of motion and that the essence of body is extension in motion. I make this case by offering a novel interpretation of what Spinoza refers to as 2 ̆ 2 the immediate infinite mode of extension 2 ̆ 2. ^ Perhaps the chief obstacle to understanding Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s substance monism is accounting for the relation between bodies and the one extended substance. I argue in chapter four that Spinoza avoids the problems with Descartes 2 ̆ 7 account of matter by adopting the Scholastic-Aristotelian idea of a posterior part to account for the relation between bodies and extension. In the final chapter I turn to Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s resolution of the tension between mechanical and theological explanation. The explanations the mechanical philosophy seeks to offer take the form of showing that any particular observable phenomenon is the effect of a series of causal relations obtaining between particles of matter. However, on its face, this view conflicts with the traditional theological commitment that God is the sole cause and author of all things, a view to which Spinoza adheres. In chapter five, I argue that Spinoza is a concurrentist, and as a result resolves this problem by maintaining that instances of secondary causation are instances in which God and finite modes <b>concur</b> in <b>causing</b> an effect. In making this case I outline Spinoza 2 ̆ 7 s unique account of force and show how, according to Spinoza, it grounds the laws of nature. ...|$|R
60|$|Whiteness, if {{most intense}} and luminous, {{is that of}} the first Order, if less strong and luminous, a Mixture of the Colours of several Orders. Of this last kind is the Whiteness of Froth, Paper, Linnen, and most white Substances; of the former I reckon that of white Metals to be. For whilst the densest of Metals, Gold, if foliated, is {{transparent}}, and all Metals become transparent if dissolved in Menstruums or vitrified, the Opacity of white Metals ariseth not from their Density alone. They being less dense than Gold would be more transparent than it, did not some other <b>Cause</b> <b>concur</b> with their Density to make them opake. And this Cause I take to be such a Bigness of their Particles as fits them to reflect the white of the first order. For, if they be of other Thicknesses they may reflect other Colours, as is manifest by the Colours which appear upon hot Steel in tempering it, and sometimes upon the Surface of melted Metals in the Skin or Scoria which arises upon them in their cooling. And as the white of the first order is the strongest which can be made by Plates of transparent Substances, so it ought to be stronger in the denser Substances of Metals than in the rarer of Air, Water, and Glass. Nor do I see but that metallick Substances of such a Thickness as may fit them to reflect the white of the first order, may, by reason of their great Density (according to the Tenor of the first of these Propositions) reflect all the Light incident upon them, and so be as opake and splendent as it's possible for any Body to be. Gold, or Copper mix'd with less than half their Weight of Silver, or Tin, or Regulus of Antimony, in fusion, or amalgamed with a very little Mercury, become white; which shews both that the Particles of white Metals have much more Superficies, and so are smaller, than those of Gold and Copper, and also that they are so opake as not to suffer the Particles of Gold or Copper to shine through them. Now it is scarce to be doubted but that the Colours of Gold and Copper are of the second and third order, and therefore the Particles of white Metals cannot be much bigger than is requisite to make them reflect the white of the first order. The Volatility of Mercury argues that they are not much bigger, nor may they be much less, lest they lose their Opacity, and become either transparent as they do when attenuated by Vitrification, or by Solution in Menstruums, or black as they do when ground smaller, by rubbing Silver, or Tin, or Lead, upon other Substances to draw black Lines. The first and only Colour which white Metals take by grinding their Particles smaller, is black, and therefore their white ought to be that which borders upon the black Spot in the Center of the Rings of Colours, that is, the white of the first order. But, if you would hence gather the Bigness of metallick Particles, you must allow for their Density. For were Mercury transparent, its Density is such that the Sine of Incidence upon it (by my Computation) would be to the Sine of its Refraction, as 71 to 20, or 7 to 2. And therefore the Thickness of its Particles, that they may exhibit the same Colours with those of Bubbles of Water, ought to be less than the Thickness of the Skin of those Bubbles in the Proportion of 2 to 7. Whence it's possible, that the Particles of Mercury may be as little as the Particles of some transparent and volatile Fluids, and yet reflect the white of the first order.|$|R
60|$|This {{propriety of}} bodies, as I think {{it the most}} worthy, and next {{in order to be}} consider'd after the contemplation of the Globular Figure, so have I long had a desire as wel as a {{determination}} to have prosecuted it if I had had an opportunity, having long since propos'd to my self the method of my enquiry therein, it containing all the allurements that I think any enquiry is capable of: For, first I take it to proceed from the most simple principle that any kind of form can come from, next the Globular, which was therefore the first I set upon, and what I have therein perform'd, I leave the Judicious Reader to determine. For as that form proceeded from a propiety of fluid bodies, which I have call'd Congruity, or Incongruity; so I think, had I time and opportunity, I could make probable, that all these regular Figures that are so conspicuously various and curious, and do so adorn and beautifie such multitudes of bodies, as I have above hinted, arise onely from three or four several positions or postures of Globular particles, and those the most plain, obvious, and necessary conjunctions of such figur'd particles that are possible, so that supposing such and such plain and obvious <b>causes</b> <b>concurring</b> the coagulating particles must necessarily compose a body of such a determinate regular Figure, and no other, and this with as much necessity and obviousness as a fluid body encompast with a Heterogeneous fluid must be protruded into a Spherule or Globe. And this I have ad oculum demonstrated with a company of bullets, and some few other very simple bodies; so that there was not any regular Figure, which I have hitherto met withall, of any of those bodies that I have above named, that I could not with the composition of bullets or globules, and one or two other bodies, imitate, even almost by shaking them together. And thus for instance may we find that the Globular bullets will of themselves, if put on an inclining plain, so that they may run together, naturally run into a triangular order, composing all the variety of figures that can be imagin'd to be made out of æquilateral triangles; and such will you find, upon trial, all the Surfaces of Alum to be compos'd of: For three bullets lying on a plain, as close to one another as they can compose an æquilatero-triangular form, as in A in the 7. Scheme. If a fourth be joyn'd to them on either side as closely as it can, they four compose the most regular Rhombus consisting of two æquilateral triangles, as B. If a fifth be joyn'd to them on either side in as close a position as it can, which is the propriety of the Texture, it makes a Trapezium, or four-sided Figure, two of whole angles are 120. and two 60. degrees, as C. If a sixth be added, as before, either it makes an æquilateral triangle, as D, or a Rhomboeid, as E, or an Hex-angular Figure, as F, which is compos'd of two primary Rhombes. If a seventh be added, it makes either an æquilatero-hexagonal Figure, as G, or some kind of six-sided Figure, as H, or I. And though there be never so many placed together, they may be rang'd into some of these lately mentioned Figures, all the angles of which will be either 60. degrees, or 120. as the figure K. which is an æquiangular hexagonal Figure is compounded of 12. Globules, or may be of 25, or 27, or 36, or 42, &c. and by these kinds of texture, or position of globular bodies, may you find out all the variety of regular shapes, into which the smooth surfaces of Alum are form'd, as upon examination any one may easily find; nor does it hold only in superficies, but in solidity also, for it's obvious that a fourth Globule laid upon the third in this texture, composes a regular Tetrahedron, which is a very usual Figure of the Crystals of Alum. And (to hasten) there is no one Figure into which Alum is observ'd to be crystallized, but may by this texture of Globules be imitated, and by no other.|$|R
