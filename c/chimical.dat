60|$|Let us suppose {{therefore}} ABC in {{the second}} Figure to represent a large <b>Chimical</b> Glass-body about two foot long, filled with very fair Water as high as AB, and inclin'd in a convenient posture with B towards the Sun: Let us further suppose {{the top of it}} to be cover'd with an opacous body, all but the hole ab, through which the Sun-beams are suffer'd to pass into the Water, and are thereby refracted to cdef, against which part, if a Paper be expanded on the outside, there will appear all the colours of the Rain-bow, that is, there will be generated the two principal colours, Scarlet and Blue, and all the intermediate ones which arise from the composition and dilutings of these two, that is, cd shall exhibit a Scarlet, which toward d is diluted into a Yellow; this is the refraction of the Ray, ik, which comes from the underside of the Sun; and the Ray ef shall appear of a deep Blue, which is gradually towards e diluted into a pale Watchet-blue. Between d and e the two diluted colours. Blue and Yellow are mixt and compounded into a Green; and this I imagine to be the reason why Green is so acceptable a colour to the eye, and that either of the two extremes are, if intense, rather a little offensive, namely, the being plac'd in the middle between the two extremes, and compounded out of both those, diluted also, or somewhat qualifi'd, for the composition, arising from the mixture of the two extremes undiluted, makes a Purple, which though it be a lovely colour, and pretty acceptable to the eye, yet is it nothing comparable to the ravishing pleasure with which a curious and well tempered Green affects the eye. If removing the Paper, the eye be plac'd against cd, it will perceive the lower side of the Sun (or a Candle at night which is much better, because it offends not the eye, and is more easily manageable) to be of a deep Red, and if against ef it will perceive {{the upper part of the}} luminous body to be of a deep Blue; and these colours will appear deeper and deeper, according as the Rays from the luminous body fall more obliquely on the surface of the Water, and thereby suffer a greater refraction, and the more distinct, the further cdef is removed from the trajecting hole.|$|E

It is well established that a large amount of natural and man-made chemicals are present in the enviroment and both humans and animals are exposed to them. Dioxin and dioxin-like compounds have long biological half-life, can accumulate within organism and could negatively affect several physiological processes.

5000|$|In 16th, 17th {{and early}} 18th century English the {{spelling}}s — both {{with and without}} the [...] "al" [...] — were usually with an i or y as in chimic / chymic / alchimic / alchymic. During the later 18th century the spelling was re-fashioned to use a letter e, as in chemic in English. In English after the spelling shifted from <b>chimical</b> to chemical, there was corresponding shift from alchimical to alchemical, which occurred in the early 19th century. In French, Italian, Spanish and Russian today {{it continues to be}} spelled with an i as in for example Italian chimica [...] "chemistry".|$|E

The physical and structural properties of the composite allowed a durability of the buildings during millenia.

The layers of Si 3 N 4, ALN, SiO 2 were obtained of plasma <b>chimical</b> precipitation {{on the surface}} of polyimide films. The results of XPS investigations showed that the polymer support takes an active part {{in the formation of the}} inorganic film. The data of electron microscopy in the initial stages of film growth indicate that in the first stage nuclei are formed. They are uniformly distributed {{on the surface of}} the polymer support and exhibit a pronounced dendrite structure.

40|$|The {{comparison}} between unquenched SU(3) Lattice QCD and random matrix theory can {{provide information on}} the pion decay constant Fπ. We calculated eigenvalue distributions of Dirac operator on 8 (3) × 4 lattice using Nf = 2 Kogut-Susskind fermions. We performed fits between these lattice data and the spectral density of random matrix theory at coupling β = 5. 30 and iso-vector chemical potential μa = 0. 0, 0. 004773, 0. 1 and 0. 2, and then find good agreement. Especially our data indicates that Fπ decreases as the iso-vector <b>chimical</b> potential increases. For more precise fit of α parameter, we also compare the first eigenvalue distribution of random matrix theory to unquenched lattice data...|$|E

CH_ 3 OH/H_ 2 and C_ 2 H_ 5 OH/H_ 2 mixture. The films {{were evaluated by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Diamond films composed of well-faceted particles have been formed with CH_ 3 OH/H_ 2 mixture, at substrate temperature 800 ℃, at filament temperature 200 ℃, under gas pressures ranging from 10 Torr to 30 Torr and at concentrations of CH_ 3 OH ranging from 29 vol. % to 38 vol. %. Nucreation density and growth rate of diamond films increased in at high filament temperature and in using organic compounds which have lower dissociation energy.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} and validate the target(s) of 4 -[5 -(4 -phenoxyphenyl) - 2 H-pyrazol- 3 -yl]-morpholine (compound 1, IC ₅₀ of 1 µM on "Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense") {{by the use of}} a <b>chimical</b> proteomics approach. Out of the total parasite cell lysate, "T. b. rhodesiense" adenosine kinase (TbrAK) was isolated and identified based on the interaction with an immobilized derivative of compound 1. The "ak" gene was cloned and recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity for chemical validation. TbrAK was confirmed to be the intracellular target of compound 1 by thermal protein stability assays and isothermal titration calorimetry. Activity measurements revealed that compound 1 was a strong concentration dependent activator of TbrAK enzymatic activity. The subsequent kinetic analysis provided strong evidence that the observed hyperactivation of TbrAK was due to the abolishment of the intrinsic substrate inhibition. X-Ray crystallographic studies resulted in the resolution of the first 3 D-structures of TbrAK-compound 1 and TbrAK-diadenosine pentaphosphate...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of soil water retention vs. soil water matric potential {{is used to}} study irrigation and drainage schedules, soil water storage capacity (plant available water), solute movement, plant growth and water stress. The hydraulic soil properties measuring is expensive, laborious and takes too long time, so, frequently, matemathic models, called pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) are utilized to estimate hydraulic soil properties through soil <b>chimical</b> and phisical characteristics. Six pedo-transfer functions have been evaluated (Gupta & Larson, 1979; Rawls et al., 1982; De Jong et al., 1983; Rawls & Brakensiek, 1985; Saxton et al., 1986; Vereecken et al., 1989) by comparing estimated with measured soil moisture values at soil water matric potential of – 33 and – 1500 kPa of 361 soil samples collected from 185 pedons of Apulia Region (South Italy), having various combinations of particle-size distribution, soil organic matter content and bulk density. Accuracy of the soil moisture predictions have been evaluated by statistic indexes such as Weighted stantard error (WSEE), Mean Deviation (MD), Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) and the determination coefficient (R 2) between estimated and measured water retention values. The Rawls PTF model demostrated to have the lowest values of WSEE, MD and RMSD indexes (0. 044, - 0. 007 and 0. 059 m 3 H 2 O m- 3 soil, respectively) at – 33 Kpa soil water matric potential (Field Capacity), while for estimating soil moisture at the Wilting Point (- 1500 kPa) Rawls & Brakensiek model is adequate (WSEE, MD and RMSD of 0. 034, - 0. 016 and 0. 046 m 3 H 2 O m- 3 soil). De Jong, Saxton and Rawls & Brakensiek models, at – 33 kPa soil water matric potential and Gupta & Larson and De Jong models at – 1500 kPa soil water matric potential, showed the highest statistic errors...|$|E
