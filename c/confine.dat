40|$|The <b>confining</b> {{stress in}} FRP (fiber {{reinforced}} polymer) <b>confined</b> concrete {{is dependent on}} the lateral strain of the concrete but the lateral strain of the concrete {{is dependent on the}} <b>confining</b> stress. Hence, the <b>confining</b> stress and lateral strain are inter-related and have to be evaluated at the same time. However, up to now, such evaluation has remained a difficult task. Consequently, the variation of the <b>confining</b> stress during loading and the effectiveness of the FRP confinement at various stages of loading are still not fully understood. Herein, a theoretical model for evaluating the lateral strain, <b>confining</b> stress and axial stress in FRP <b>confined</b> concrete is developed. The theoretical model is first applied to analyze the FRP <b>confined</b> concrete specimens tested by others to verify its accuracy and then used to perform a parametric study on the effects of <b>confining</b> stiffness.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a lateral strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete, which makes no assumptions on {{the properties of}} <b>confining</b> materials and is therefore generally applicable regardless {{of the type of}} confinement. It can be applied to concrete members or columns <b>confined</b> by fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), steel tubes or steel tubes wrapped with FRP or steel rings/spirals, provided the appropriate stress-strain models of the <b>confining</b> materials are incorporated in the analysis. The lateral strain model {{can also be used to}} directly evaluate the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete with non-cylindrical section or under eccentric loading where the lateral strain and <b>confining</b> stress could vary across the section using finite element analysis. The first part of the thesis presents the details of the derivations of the lateral strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete. A total of 95 actively <b>confined</b> concrete specimens and 34 passively <b>confined</b> concrete specimens covering a wide range of concrete strength from 25 to 120 MPa and <b>confining</b> stress from 0 to 0. 99 times the concrete strength tested by other researchers in the published literature have been investigated for the influence of concrete strength, <b>confining</b> stress and axial strain on the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete. Based on the regression analysis, the influence of concrete strength, <b>confining</b> stress and axial strain is accurately and consistently captured and a constitutive model for predicting the lateral strain of <b>confined</b> concrete under different levels of confinement from pre-crack and elastic state to post-crack and inelastic state is proposed. In the second part of the thesis, theoretical models integrating the proposed lateral strain model, axial stress-strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete, stress-strain model of steel tube, FRP, steel rings/spirals have been proposed to analyze the axial stress-strain curves of a total of 174 FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, 138 concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) without external confinement, 89 CFST with FRP jackets and 98 CFST with external steel rings/spirals. The lateral strain, <b>confining</b> stress can be obtained by an iterative procedure and the axial stress/load can be evaluated by substituting the so obtained <b>confining</b> stress into the axial stress-strain model of <b>confined</b> concrete. It is observed that the theoretical models can predict the axial and lateral stress-strain behaviour of FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, CFST, and CFST with external confinement accurately and consistently. Finally, a parametric study has been carried out by varying a series of structural parameters such as concrete strength, steel tube yield strength and thickness-to-diameter ratios, FRP <b>confining</b> stiffness and rupture strain, and steel rings/spirals <b>confining</b> stiffness to study the effects on strength and ductility. From the data generated by the parametric study, design formulas for predicting the yield and ultimate strength of FRP <b>confined</b> concrete, CFST with or without external confinements are proposed and compared with existing codes and design charts for evaluating the minimum FRP <b>confining</b> stiffness or steel rings/spirals thickness-to-diameter ratio to achieve different levels of ductility for CFST with various concrete strength are presented. Moreover, the minimum <b>confining</b> stiffness of external confinement to avoid delamination is evaluated for design guidance. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} <b>confine</b> liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, but rather than gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
