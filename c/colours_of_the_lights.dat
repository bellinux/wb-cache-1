40|$|Master's thesis in Computer scienceThis report {{presents}} how traffic {{network of}} signalized intersection in a chosen urban area called Tema is synchronized. Using a modular approach, {{two different types}} of traffic intersection commonly found in an urban area were modelled i. e. a simple intersection and a complex intersection. A direct road, even though not an intersection, was also included in the modelling because it’s commonly found in an urban area plus it connects any two intersections. Each of these scenarios was modelled using a Petri Net modelling tool called GPenSIM. In real life, every traffic network has a control system, in order to emulate this real-world environment; a GUI was developed in JAVA with methods which are called in GPenSIM to enable user’s control each of the traffic models using buttons. The GUI also shows a graphical representation of a traffic light for all three scenarios. Outputs from the simulation are displayed on the GUI through change in <b>colours</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> Results show that Petri Net is a simple and easy tool to use in modelling real world environment. It also shows that the traffic network for any given area can be simulated in real-time making it easier and possible to test and analyse any given intersection before a traffic light system is built or already existing traffic light system can be improved upon to optimize traffic control...|$|E

30|$|It {{seems likely}} {{that much of what}} has been said in this section about {{lightness}} constancy would also apply to colour constancy: the way we see <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> an object to be fixed, despite wide variations in <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident <b>light</b> and corresponding variations in <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> that is reflected from the object.|$|R
50|$|Recording a Tape <b>the</b> <b>Colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> {{was finally}} {{released}} in 2005. In March 2006, Bell Orchestre launched a tour <b>of</b> Europe and <b>the</b> US {{to promote the}} album.|$|R
50|$|To enable {{trains to}} run at night, one or more lights are usually {{provided}} at each signal. Typically this comprises a permanently lit oil lamp with movable coloured spectacles in front that alter <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light.</b> <b>The</b> driver therefore had to learn one set of indications for daytime viewing and another for nighttime viewing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> {{emitted by}} <b>the</b> lamp changes as its {{electrical}} characteristics change with temperature and time. Lightning {{is a similar}} principle where the atmosphere is ionized by the high potential difference (voltage) between earth and storm clouds.|$|R

By varying the material being excited, <b>the</b> <b>colour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> emitted can be changed.The actual ELD is constructed using flat, opaque electrode strips running parallel to each other, covered by a layer of electroluminescent material, followed by another layer of electrodes, running perpendicular to the bottom layer.

5|$|Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong {{positive}} phototactic behaviour (attraction to light) {{and will}} move readily {{within a certain}} distance of a light source.
