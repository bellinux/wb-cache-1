40|$|This article {{explores the}} process of seeking {{compensation}} for occupational illness under a no-fault accident insurance scheme. The author uses two case studies—firefighters who attended a fire at a chemical storage depot and timbermill workers who worked with pentachlorophenol—to illustrate how science {{can be used to}} deny compensation to sick and dying workers. The results of the studies suggest that a no-fault accident compensation scheme, considered to be a victory for workers, offers no guarantee of just outcomes for working people. And science can be co-opted and used to support business and state interests against workers; this ideological support is increasingly hidden behind the development of “objective ” systems of assessing com-pensation claims. New Zealand has two main types of accident insurance: the government’s Acci-dent Compensation Corporation scheme and private insurance. Since 1974, the country has had a no-fault response to adverse events associated with injuries. <b>Civil</b> <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> arising from personal injury due to accidents were abolished, so employers could no longer be sued for workplace accidents. This type of system is aimed at providing “for those in need rather than an acknowl-edgement of their individual rights to redress. While it deals with the economic needs of the patients, it does so on a basis of social goodwill rather than entitle-ment. The victim of an injury would, of course, still have to satisfy the eligibility criteria: the existence of the scheme, however, would represent the beneficence of medicine and state welfare. The tort system, on the other hand, is the social insurance of a market society ” (1, p. 60).

40|$|This {{essay is}} {{focussed}} on {{the scope of}} State {{immunity from civil jurisdiction}} in actions <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> alleging the violation of human rights. The attention of the Author is drawn to investigate the question of the limits of State immunity having specific regard to official torture, in order to provide a safeguarding approach for the victims. This crime is the object of one of the UN Convention of 10 December 1984 against torture, which has enjoyed a particular success within the international contest, being rapidly ratified by a lot of States. The reason lies perhaps in the fact that governmental torture is a particularly hateful crime. It is then extremely important to allow the courts of other States to assume jurisdiction in civil proceedings brought against the State and its agents or servants, personally liable for the torture acts. Only in this way, it is possible to give relief to the victims and to provide an effective deterrent against the spread of governmental torture. In order to achieve these results, it is necessary to overcome the bar to the exercise of civil jurisdiction represented by the immunity. The Author after having offered a preliminary inquiry {{on the grounds of the}} customary rule of immunity and on the different ways in which it can be implemented in internal law, ask himself whether the exercise of civil jurisdiction in torture cases can actually represent an effective means against the spread of this crime. The answer of the Author is positive. He points out that such an exercise will lead to a judgment awarding damages against both the functionaries liable for the crime and their State. The judgment will have not only an important symbolic effect, but will also be enforceable, either in the State where it was entered into, or in a third State in which there are sufficient assets of the State or of the officials concerned. Therefore the victim can obtain a concrete restore for the pains suffered. Moreover that will determine an internalization of the economic cost of official torture, which should represent a good deterrent for the future. The analysis then goes on examining in detail the judgements given in the case Jones and Mitchell v. Saudi Arabia, dealing with the question of the limits of immunity in respect to <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> <b>for</b> alleged torture. At this regard, the possible solutions are three, each of them taken into consideration in the decisions. The first is based on the acceptance of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, representing then a rule from which no derogation is permitted. That should entail that a State, allegedly violating it, could not invoke hierarchically lower rules to bar the exercise of civil jurisdiction. The second position is the most conservative. It denies that the prohibition of torture has generated an ancillary procedural rule which, by way of exception to state immunity, entitles or even requires States to assume civil jurisdiction over other States in cases in which torture is alleged. The third solution distinguishes between the action against the State and that against its officials. In the former, the rule of immunity could be successfully invoked; while in the latter it could not, since it would not be possible to define the State functionaries inflicting torture as people acting in their official capacity. The Author considers each of these three solutions unsatisfactory and proposes a different one in order to avoid the applicability of the rule on immunity in civil suits, in which official torture is alleged. This result can be achieved taking in due consideration the UN Convention against torture of 10 December 1984. The success that it has enjoyed in terms of ratifications witnesses that the practice of official torture was totally disqualified and “banished” by the community of States, which “has expressed a will” to partially repeal the customary rule on immunity as regards civil proceedings brought by the victims of official torture. There is then an argument to hold that the customary rule on State immunity has been modified and limited in relation to this crime. That is confirmed also by Article 14. 1 Convention under which «each State party shall ensure in its legal system that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and adequate compensation». All these considerations lead the Author to the conclusion that the UN Convention against torture has had the same effect both in civil and criminal proceedings concerning governmental torture: the inapplicability of State immunity. So it is for the national rules of each State to determine whether its courts are competent to adjudicate tort claims alleging torture...|$|R
5000|$|Lambdin Purdy Milligan (March 24, 1812 [...] - [...] December 21, 1899) was {{a lawyer}} and farmer who {{was known for his}} extreme {{opinions}} on states' rights and his opposition to the Abraham Lincoln administration's conduct of the American Civil War. Believing that the Confederate states of the South had the power under the U.S. Constitution to secede from the Union, he opposed the war to reunite the nation. Milligan became a leader of the secret Order of American Knights (formerly the Knights of the Golden Circle, and later the Sons of Liberty, and advocated violent revolution against the U.S. government. U.S. Army forces arrested him at his home and tried him and other conspirators by military commission for disloyalty and conspiracy. Found guilty, he was sentenced to death. A habeas corpus appeal made its way from the federal circuit court in Indianapolis to the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1866 ruled that the application of military tribunals to citizens when civil courts are open and operating was unconstitutional.

Darbe buvo atskleidžiamos ir aptariamos problemos, kylančios nagrinėjant baudžiamąsias bylas kartu su civiliniais ieškiniais, remiantis Lietuvos bei užsienio teisės aktais, moksliniais straipsniais, knygomis, teismų praktika. Darbo tikslas – išsiaiškinti ar pagal esamą teisinį reguliavimą Lietuvoje yra užtikrinamas visapusiškas civilinio ieškinio, pareikšto baudžiamojoje byloje išnagrinėjimas. Iškelta hipotezė, kad pagal esamą teisinį reguliavimą yra galimas visapusiškas civilinio ieškinio išnagrinėjimas. Darbe buvo išskirtos dvi pagrindinės struktūrinės dėstymo dalys – „Civilinio ieškinio baudžiamojoje byloje teisinio instituto samprata“ ir „Civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimo baudžiamojoje byloje probleminiai aspektai“. Pirmoji dalis buvo skirta detaliai atskleisti civilinio ieškinio baudžiamojoje byloje institutą - suprasti ir išaiškinti žalos atlyginimo sampratą, civilinio ieškinio pareiškimo teisinį reglamentavimą, civilinio ieškovo ir civilinio atsakovo teisinę sampratą, civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimą teisme, jo išsprendimą ir užtikrinimą reglamentuojančias teisės normas. Antroji darbo dalis pagrindinė, didesnės apimties, į kurią įėjo visa išskirta problematika ir jos analizė, reikalinga darbo tikslui pasiekti ir suformuluotai hipotezei patvirtinti arba paneigti.

This Master Degree‘s final thesis {{presents}} a research that {{was conducted with}} the aim {{to determine whether the}} current regulatory framework of Lithuania ensures a comprehensive consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings. In this respect, the research dealt with the issues arising from a trial of criminal cases that involved the examination of <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> <b>for</b> <b>damages</b> filed by victims of crimes against the accused person or the person bearing financial liability for the actions of the accused. The relevance of the subject {{stems from the fact that}} the examination of case-law has revealed a number of issues related to the absence of or flawed legal regulation in the provisions on <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Lithuania (CCP). A hypothesis formulated at the beginning of the thesis – that a comprehensive consideration of <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> is ensured under the current regulatory framework of Lithuania, was sought to be confirmed or rejected. The main objective of the thesis was to determine whether Lithuania‘s current regulatory framework allows a comprehensive consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> filed in criminal proceedings. To attain this objective, the following tasks were identified: 1. 	Present a notion of the institute of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings; 2. 	Analyse the relevant works by foreign and Lithuanian researchers; 3. 	Analyse and compare international and national legal acts that govern the consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings; 4. 	Find and analyse criminal cases in which <b>civil</b> <b>claims</b> were considered; 5. 	Assess the legal framework of Lithuania and identify issues arising from the consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> along with a criminal case; 6. 	Propose ways for resolving the issues identified by establishing new legal provisions or by improving the existing ones. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania establishes the person‘s right to apply to court in the event of infringement of the person‘s constitutional rights. A person that has suffered material or non-material damage caused by a criminal act is entitled to request indemnification in criminal proceedings in order to avoid two separate judicial proceedings (civil and criminal). However, a number of issues arise in such cases due to the current legal regulation. Identification, description and analysis of the issues have helped to attain the objective of the thesis and to resolve the hypothesis. The thesis has been divided into two structural parts: ‘Notion of the Legal Institute of a <b>Civil</b> <b>Claim</b> in Criminal Proceedings’ and ‘Issues Arising from Consideration of <b>Civil</b> <b>Claim</b> in Criminal Proceedings’. The first part is aimed at a detailed description of the institute of <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings including the understanding and clarification of the notion of damage caused by criminal acts; legal regulation of the filing of a civil claim; a legal notion of a civil claimant and a civil defendant; and legal provisions governing the consideration, deciding and securing of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in court. This part of the thesis clarifies the understanding of the legal institute and defined its main provisions under the current legal framework. The second part of the thesis is the main part, therefore, it is larger in scope and incorporates all the issues identified as well their analysis required for the attainment of the objective of the thesis and for the confirmation/rejection of the hypothesis. The following issues have been analysed and described in individual sections of this part of the thesis: 1. 	Absence of imperative requirements for the content of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in the CCP; 2. 	Involvement of third parties in the criminal proceedings as participants, whereas the CCP does not contain legal provisions on the ways to do this; 3. 	Absence of legal provisions on the changing of the subject of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in the CCP; 4. 	Absence of legal provisions on the replacement of an unsuitable civil claimant and/or defendant in the CCP; 5. 	The accused person‘s agreement to the <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in order to avoid or to mitigate a penalty; 6. 	Consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> involving legal persons; 7. 	Consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> when a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been instituted is involved in the criminal proceedings in the capacity of a civil defendant; 8. 	Settlement of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> where criminal proceedings are terminated due to application of prescription provisions to criminal liability; 9. 	Absence of procedural capability of the civil claimant; 10. 	Awarding payment of lost income as requested in the civil claim; 11. 	Lack of proper argumentation of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in the descriptive part of the judgment; 12. 	Application of the exceptional case of referral of a civil case for consideration by way of a civil procedure when this right is being abused. It has been concluded that the objective of the thesis was attained upon fulfilment of all the tasks, and the hypothesis advanced at the beginning of the thesis was confirmed in part. While consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings can be appropriate and right according to the current legal framework, the regulation of this institute is insufficient and not detailed enough in some cases. Therefore, a number of potential solutions of the issues have been proposed in order to ensure a comprehensive, fair and complete consideration of a <b>civil</b> <b>claim</b> in criminal proceedings...|$|R
