500|$|The {{expedition}} {{started in}} late May 1859 at St. Louis, Missouri, then was transported by two steamboats up the Missouri River to New Fort Pierre, South Dakota. In late June the expedition left New Fort Pierre and headed overland to Fort Sarpy where they encountered the Crow Indians. Raynolds {{stated that the}} Crow were a [...] "small band compared to their neighbors, but are famous warriors, and, according to <b>common</b> <b>report,</b> seldom fail to hold their own {{with any of the}} tribes unless greatly outnumbered." [...] Raynolds was impressed with the Crow chief Red Bear, and after assuring him that the expedition meant only to pass through Crow Indian territory and not linger, traded with the Crows for seven horses.|$|E
2500|$|Through the {{intervention}} of the six major European powers, the Armenians of Zeitun ended the resistance. The Hunchak activists were allowed to go into exile, the tax burden was eased, and a Christian sub-governor was appointed. Due to the freezing temperatures, thousands of Turks perished and many others died in hospitals from wounds sustained in battle. The figures on casualties are heavily conflicting but all agree that the Ottoman forces suffered greatly. The British Consulate reported on January 6, 1896, that [...] "at least 5,000 have been killed though <b>common</b> <b>report</b> swells the number to 10,000." [...] The Austrian Consulate based in Aleppo stated that the Armenians killed 1,300 Turks in the final battle alone. The British consul estimated that combat and non-combat fatalities among all Armenians neared the figure of 6,000. Pierre Quillard, a French writer, estimated that Ottoman losses totaled no less than 20,000 men.|$|E
2500|$|Forrest was {{an early}} member of the Ku Klux Klan ("KKK" [...] or [...] "the Klan") which was formed by {{veterans}} of the Confederate Army in Pulaski, Tennessee in 1866 and soon expanded throughout the state and beyond. Forrest became involved sometime in late 1866 or early 1867. A <b>common</b> <b>report</b> is that Forrest arrived in Nashville in April 1867 while the Klan was meeting at the Maxwell House Hotel, probably at the encouragement of a state Klan leader, former Confederate general George Gordon. The organization had grown {{to the point where}} an experienced commander was needed, and Forrest fit the bill. In Room 10 of the Maxwell, Forrest was sworn in as a member by John W. Morton. The title Grand Wizard was chosen because general Forrest was known as The Wizard of the Saddle during the civil war. Historian and Forrest biographer Brian Steel Wills writes, [...] "While {{there is no doubt that}} Forrest joined the Klan, there is some question as to whether he actually was the Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan".|$|E
