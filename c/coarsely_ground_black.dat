40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that adding liquid feed (LF; source of rapidly available sugar) would maintain or improve measures of dairy cattle performance {{to a greater}} degree when corn grain is more <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> as compared to finely ground.

The study was conducted on 60 Holstein cows milked twice a day.

50|$|Small {{pieces of}} meat (usually pork, {{sometimes}} chicken) and pork liver, are thinly sliced then sauteed with garlic and shallots. It is then cooked until tender. Next, salt, finely <b>ground</b> <b>black</b> pepper and other seasonings are added at this point. Then soup stock {{is added to}} prepare the broth. Next the lomi noodle and chopped cabbage is added. While waiting for the noodles to cook, a mixture of cornstarch flour blended {{with a small amount}} of water is added to thicken the soup. Finally, just before the whole mixture is transferred to individual bowls, a beaten egg is added as the cook continuously stirs to complete the basic dish. Toppings include slices of kikiam (que-kiam), fish balls, sliced chives, cooked shrimp, and some meatballs.

40|$|The {{common feed}} {{contaminant}} deoxynivalenol (DON) {{was reported to}} influence the morphology of the pars nonglandularis (PN) of porcine stomach. Moreover, finely ground feed is known to trigger the development of ulcers and other pathologies of PN while <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> feed protects from such lesions. The interactions between grinding fineness and DON contamination of feed were not examined so far. Therefore, both finely and <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> feeds were tested either in the absence or presence of a DON contaminated wheat on growth performance and health of rearing piglets, including stomach integrity. DON contamination significantly reduced feed intake and serum albumin concentration with this effect being more pronounced after feeding the <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> feed. Albeit at a higher level, albumin concentration was also reduced after feeding the finely ground and uncontaminated feed. Finely ground and DON-contaminated feed caused a significantly more pronounced lymphoplasmacytic infiltration both of PN and pars glandularis, partly paralleled by lymph follicle formation and detritus filled foveolae and tubes suggesting a local immune response probably triggered by epithelial lesions. It is concluded that DON contamination of feed exacerbates the adverse effects of finely ground feed on stomach mucosal integrity...|$|R

Introduction: Within a {{few years}} various cereal products, which are called Breakfast Foods have {{been placed on the}} market. These are {{manufactured}} from wheat, corn, oats and rice and in the making are said to undergo various secret processes. The first breakfast food was “porridge” which was made by boiling <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> wheat or oats. This was used chiefly by the people of the British Isles. These people subjected this oat or wheat meal to prolonged cooking, it being a historical fact that the porridge pot was always on the stove. It constituted their main article of food and with milk it formed a balanced dietary. When some of these people immigrated to this country, they introduced their food here. Finding little wheat of oats and learning to use corn, they substituted <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> corn for the basis of their porridge. They knew by experience that these <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> cereals were more palatable after prolonged cooking and this unintentionally increased their digestibility. Manufacture. With improved methods along all lines, the attention of the manufacturers has been called to the possibilities of cereal preparations. With the desire for shorter methods and quicker results, which everywhere permeates American life, the production of prepared...|$|R

40|$|Microstructure, texture, colour and sensory {{properties}} of precooked restructured beef made with different proportions of walnut (0, 5, 10, 15 %) were studied {{in relation to}} meat particle size (grinder plate hole: 0. 6 and 1. 4 cm). In general, increasing amounts of walnut were matched by decreasing Kramer shear force (KSF), bind strength and elongation values. When walnut (5 and 15 %) was added, products made with <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> meat presented higher KSF values than those made with finely ground meat. Walnut decreased lightness and increased redness and yellowness. Morphology characteristics suggest that walnut interferes {{with the formation of}} a gel protein network.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} feed form and grinding intensity of the pig diet and the interaction between both on the particulate matter (PM) concentrations inside a pig nursery and the growth performances of weanling pigs. Four diets were compared: finely <b>ground</b> meal, <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> meal, finely <b>ground</b> pellets, and <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> pellets. Four weaning rounds with 144 pigs per weaning round, divided over 4 identical compartments, were monitored. Within each weaning round, each compartment was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments. A hammer mill with a screen of 1. 5 or 6 mm was used to grind the ingredients of the finely <b>ground</b> and <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> feeds, respectively. Indoor concentrations of the following PM fractions were measured: PM that passes through a size-selective inlet with a 50 % efficiency cutoff at 10 (PM 10), 2. 5 (PM 2. 5), or 1 (PM 1) μm aerodynamic diameter, respectively (USEPA, 2004). Feeding pelleted diets instead of meal diets gave rise to higher PM 10 (P < 0. 001), PM 2. 5 (P < 0. 001), and PM 1 (P < 0. 001) concentrations. Grinding intensity had an effect only on PM 10 (P < 0. 05) concentrations. No interaction between feed form and grinding intensity was found {{for any of the}} PM fractions. Interactions (P < 0. 05) between feed form and grinding intensity on ADFI and ADG were found. Grinding intensity had an effect only on the meal diets with higher ADFI for the <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> meal. Pigs fed the finely ground meal had a lower (P < 0. 001) ADG than the other 3 diets. Feed efficiency was influenced only by the feed form (P < 0. 001) and not by the grinding intensity. Pelleting the feed gave rise to a higher G:F. In conclusion, a contradiction between environmental concerns and performance results was found. Feeding pelleted diets to the piglets improved growth performance but also increased indoor PM concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} meal feed and coarser {{grinding}} of pelleted {{feed on the}} gastro-intestinal health and productivity of finishers were studied. The study comprised a total of 1. 044 pigs and {{was designed as a}} randomised block test with six test groups and 17 replicates. Several tests have shown that meal feed may reduce Salmonella prevalence in infected herds. This test shows that very <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> pellets and a diet in which the grain part consisted of barley and very <b>coarsely</b> <b>ground</b> wheat (I: I) and added formic acid resulted in the same changes in the physico-chemical properties as did meal feed. In particular the feed added formic acid affected the microbial composition in the gastro-intestinal tract as did meal feed.
