40|$|The 3 C-like proteinase (3 CLpro) {{of severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) {{is one of}} the most promising targets for anti-SARS-CoV drugs due to its crucial role in the viral life cycle. In this study, a database containing structural information of more than 8, 000 existing drugs was virtually screened by a docking approach to identify potential binding molecules of SARS-CoV 3 CLpro. As a target for screening, both a homology model and the crystallographic structure of the binding pocket of the enzyme were used. <b>Cinanserin</b> (SQ 10, 643), a well-characterized serotonin antagonist that has undergone preliminary clinical testing in humans in the 1960 s, showed a high score in the screening and was chosen for further experimental evaluation. Binding of both <b>cinanserin</b> and its hydrochloride to bacterially expressed 3 CLpro of SARS-CoV and the related human coronavirus 229 E (HCoV- 229 E) was demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance technology. The catalytic activity of both enzymes was inhibited with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of 5 μM, as tested with a fluorogenic substrate. The antiviral activity of <b>cinanserin</b> was further evaluated in tissue culture assays, namely, a replicon system based on HCoV- 229 E and quantitative test assays with infectious SARS-CoV and HCoV- 229 E. All assays revealed a strong inhibition of coronavirus replication at nontoxic drug concentrations. The level of virus RNA and infectious particles was reduced by up to 4 log units, with IC 50 values ranging from 19 to 34 μM. These findings demonstrate that the old drug <b>cinanserin</b> is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV replication, acting most likely via inhibition of the 3 CL proteinase...|$|E
40|$|The gastropyloric {{receptor}} (GPR) {{cells are}} {{a set of}} cholinergic/serotonergic mechanosensory neurons that modulate the activity of neural networks in the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG). Stimulation of these cells evokes a variety of slow modulatory responses in different STG neurons that are mimicked by exogenously applied serotonin (5 -HT); these responses include tonic inhibition, tonic excitation and induction of rhythmic bursting. We used pharmacological agonists and antagonists to show that these three classes of modulatory response in the STG neurons are mediated by distinct 5 -HT receptor subtypes. GPR stimulation or application of 5 -HT or 2 -me- 5 HT (a vertebrate 5 -HT 3 agonist) inhibited the pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons; these actions were selectively antagonized by gramine. GPR stimulation or application of 5 -HT induced rhythmic bursting in the electrically coupled anterior burster (AB) and pyloric dilator (PD) neurons; these effects were antagonized by the 5 -HT 1 c/ 2 antagonist <b>cinanserin</b> and by atropine at concentrations that do not block muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the crab STG. The 5 -HT agonists 5 -CT (5 -HT 1) and a-me- 5 HT (5 -HT 2) also induced AB/PD bursting, which was blocked by <b>cinanserin,</b> but not by atropine. GPR stimulation or application of 5 -HT and 5 -CT evoked tonic excitation of the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron. These effects were blocked by <b>cinanserin.</b> Several other 5 -HT agonists and nearly all the vertebrate 5 -HT antagonists we tested {{had little or no}} effect on the crab pyloric 5 -HT receptors. These results provide further evidence that the modulatory sensory GPR neuron uses serotonin to evoke multiple modulatory responses via multiple 5 -HT receptors. However, the 5 -HT receptors in the crab STG neurons are not pharmacologically similar to vertebrate 5 -HT receptors...|$|E
40|$|This study {{utilised}} {{the pond}} snail, Lymnaea {{to examine the}} contribution that alterations in serotonergic signalling make to age-related changes in feeding. Age-related decreases in 5 -HIAA levels in feeding ganglia were positively correlated with {{a decrease in the}} number of sucrose-evoked bites and negatively correlated with an increase in inter-bite interval, implicating alterations in serotonergic signalling in the aged phenotype. Analysis of the serotonergic cerebral giant cell (CGC) input to the protraction motor neurone (B 1) demonstrated that fluoxetine (10 – 100 nM) increased the amplitude/duration of the evoked EPSP in both young and middle aged but not in old neurones, suggesting an age-related attenuation of the serotonin transporter. 5 -HT evoked a concentration-dependent increase in the amplitude/duration of B 1 EPSP, which was greater in old neurones compared to both young and middle aged. Conversely, the 5 -HT-evoked depolarisation and conditional bursting of the swallow motor neurone (B 4) were attenuated in old neurones, functions critical for a full feeding rhythm. The CGCs' ability to excite B 1 was blocked by <b>cinanserin</b> but not by methysergide. Conversely, the CGC to B 4 connection was completely blocked by methysergide and only partially by <b>cinanserin</b> suggesting that age-related changes may be receptor-specific. In summary, synapse-specific attenuation of the CGC-B 4 connection and enhancement of the CGC-B 1 connection would slow the swallow phase and maintain protraction, consistent with behavioural observation...|$|E

Inhibition of the tritium release by 5 -HT was not suppressed {{in the presence of}} tetrodotoxin (TTX) (10 (- 6) M). These results suggest that 5 -HT tonically inhibits acetylcholine (ACh) release from striatal cholinergic neurons by acting on a presynaptic receptor localized on cholinergic terminals.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the in vitro {{activities of the}} ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of Houttuynia cordata (H.  cordata) Thunb. (Saururaceae) and three of its constituent flavonoids (quercetin, quercitrin and rutin) against murine coronavirus and dengue virus (DENV). MethodsThe antiviral activities of various concentrations of the EA fraction of H.  cordata and flavonoids were assessed using virus neutralization tests against mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and DENV type 2 (DENV- 2). <b>Cinanserin</b> hydrochloride was also tested against MHV. The EA fraction of H.  cordata was tested for acute oral toxicity in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. ResultsThe EA fraction of H.  cordata inhibited viral infectivity up to 6  d. <b>Cinanserin</b> hydrochloride was able to inhibit MHV for only 2  d. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) of the EA fraction of H.  cordata added before the viral adsorption stage were 0. 98  μg/mL for MHV and 7. 50  μg/mL for DENV- 2 with absence of cytotoxicity. The mice fed with the EA fraction up to 2000  mg/kg did not induce any signs of acute toxicity, with normal histological features of major organs. Certain flavonoids exhibited comparatively weaker antiviral activity, notably quercetin which could inhibit both MHV and DENV- 2. This was followed by quercitrin which could inhibit DENV- 2 but not MHV, whereas rutin did not exert any inhibitory effect on either virus. When quercetin was combined with quercitrin, enhancement of anti-DENV- 2 activity and reduced cytotoxicity were observed. However, the synergistic efficacy of the flavonoid combination was still {{less than that of}} the EA fraction. ConclusionsThe compounds in H.  cordata contribute to the superior antiviral efficacy of the EA fraction which lacked cytotoxicity in vitro and acute toxicity in vivo. H.  cordata has much potential for the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus and dengue infections...|$|E

40|$|Inappropriate {{platelet}} aggregation creates a cardiovascular risk {{that is largely}} managed with thienopyridines and aspirin. Although effective, these drugs carry risks of increased bleeding and drug ‘resistance’, underpinning a drive for new antiplatelet agents. To discover such drugs, one strategy is to identify a suitable druggable target and then find small molecules that modulate it. A good and unexploited target is the platelet collagen receptor, GPVI, which promotes thrombus formation. To identify inhibitors of GPVI that are safe and bioavailable, we docked a FDA-approved drug library into the GPVI collagen-binding site in silico. We now report that losartan and <b>cinanserin</b> inhibit GPVI-mediated platelet activation in a selective, competitive and dose-dependent manner. This mechanism of action likely underpins the cardioprotective effects of losartan {{that could not be}} ascribed to its antihypertensive effects. We have, therefore, identified small molecule inhibitors of GPVI-mediated platelet activation, and also demonstrated the utility of structure-based repurposing...|$|E
40|$|The {{receptor}} specificity for synaptically mediated {{lateral inhibition}} in Limulus lateral eye retina was studied by structure-activity correlations {{of the action}} of the putative indoleaminergic neurotransmitter, serotonin (5 -HT), and its isomers and structural analogs, tryptamine (TRYP), 6 -hydroxytryptamine (6 HT), 5, 6 - dihydroxytryptamine (5, 6 -DHT), 5 -hydroxydimethyltryptamine (5 -HDMT), and 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP). The 5 -HT blockers, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), bromo-LSD (BOL), and <b>cinanserin,</b> were also tested. The inhibitory action of the indoleaminergic agonists is highly structure-specific. An hydroxyl group in the 5 position of the indole nucleus, sterically unencumbered by hydroxyls in neighboing positions, is essential. In order of decreasing potency, 5 -HT, 5 -HDMT, and 5 -HTP are active agonists; TRYP, 6 -HT, and 5, 6 -DHT are inactive. Configuration and mobility of the side chains of the active agonists also affect the interaction, and these side-chain characteristics correlate with agonist potency. The receptors for inhibitory action and for transmembranal transport in reuptake are different. Both active agonists and inactive analogs appear to be taken up (Adolph and Ehinger, 1975.

An additional population of sites has been observed in crude membrane preparations or fractions enriched with synaptosomal membranes obtained from rat brain cortex. This population was observed as a single class of sites in a synaptosomal fraction (L fraction [...] according to Laduron (1977)). It corresponded to a dissociation constant Kd = 13 - 15 nM, and Bmax = 0. 80 +/- 0. 15 pmol/mg protein.

Simultaneous determinations of the binding characteristics of 3 H-labeled 2 -amino- 6, 7 -dihydroxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalene (ADTN), a dopaminergic agonist, and [3 H]spiroperidol, a dopaminergic antagonist, {{were examined}}. Among the 11 strains, the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for agonist binding did not vary in either the striatum or the olfactory tubercle. Similarly, no strain differences were observed in the Kd for spiroperidol in either region, although the Kd for spiroperidol in the olfactory tubercle was uniformly higher than that in the striatum. Measurement of receptor concentrations revealed strain differences of up to 2 -fold for both [3 H]ADTN and [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites. Within each brain region, the densities of agonist and antagonist binding sites correlated significantly. However, between brain regions there was no correlation in the density of agonist or antagonist binding sites, which suggests that mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine neurons may be under independent genetic control. Analysis of [3 H]spiroperidol displacement by clofluperol, aceperone, <b>cinanserin,</b> and mianserin in four inbred mouse strains revealed that 88 - 90 % of the striatal spiroperidol sites are dopaminergic, with the remainder being serotonergic. In contrast, 53 - 66 % of the olfactory tubercle [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites are dopaminergic and 34 - 47 % are serotonergic.

40|$|Contractile {{responses}} to vasoconstrictor agents were compared in helical strips of dog and monkey epicardial coronary arteries of different sizes. Contractions of large, medium and small arteries induced by KCl (30 mM) were virtually identical. Contractions induced by 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) (10 (- 9) - 2 X 10 (- 6) M) {{were in the}} order of large greater than medium greater than small arteries in dogs, and large = medium greater than small arteries in monkeys. <b>Cinanserin</b> suppressed these responses. In contrast, contractions produced by angiotensin II (AII) (10 (- 7) M) {{were in the order}} of small greater than medium greater than large arteries in dogs, and small greater than medium = large arteries in monkeys. Sar 1 -Ala 8 -angiotensin II markedly attenuated the peptide-induced contractions. Contractions induced by prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) were significantly greater in large and medium sized arteries than in small arteries in dogs, while those of the arteries of different sizes isolated from monkeys did not differ. Contractions induced by carbocyclic thromboxane A 2 (c-TXA 2), in arteries of different sizes in dogs and monkeys, did not differ. These results suggest that the sensitivity and/or the population of 5 -HT receptors are greater in proximal coronary arteries than in distal arteries, while, in contrast, the sensitivity and/or population of AII receptors are greater in distal coronary arteries. Receptors for PGF 2 alpha and c-TXA 2 appear to react to a similar degree in monkey arteries of different sizes, although receptors for PGF 2 alpha appear to be fewer in distal coronary arteries in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Although opioid {{peptides}} {{have been}} demonstrated immunohistochemically in the feline intestine, the action of these peptides is unknown. The aims of this study were: (a) to determine the distal ileal and ileocecal sphincter (ICS) responses to morphine sulfate (MS), methionine enkephalin (ME) and leucine enkephalin (LE); (b) to determine the mechanism by which exogenous opiates mediate these responses; (c) to determine the type of receptor involved in mediating these responses and (d) to ascertain whether endogenous opiate-mediated responses may be vagally induced. The ICS responded to all three opiate agonists with tonic and phasic contractions, the latter being associated with increased spike activity. The EDmax for ICS pressure response was 1 μg/kg for ME, 5 μg/kg for LE, and 150 μg/kg for MS. The distal ileum responded with increased spike activity and phasic contractions. The EDmax for the ileal motility index response was 1. 0 × 10 − 1 μg/kg for ME, 1 μg/kg for LE, and 150 μg/kg for MS. Thus, both sites demonstrated similar dose-response relationships, both responding to at least 100 times lower doses of enkephalins than MS. The ICS contraction preceded ileal contractions. The ileal and ICS response was not antagonized by atropine, hexamethonium, phentolamine, propranolol, <b>cinanserin,</b> or tetrodotoxin. Naloxone, 600 μg/kg, antagonized {{the response to the}} enkephalins while 10 μg/kg antagonized the response to MS. Higher doses of the specific-receptor agonist SKF 10047 and κ-receptor agonist ketocyclazocine were required before a contractile response was elicited. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus induced ICS contraction and a fall in blood pressure. The ICS contractile response but not the blood pressure response was inhibited by naloxone 1 mg/kg. These data indicate: (a) tonic and phasic ICS contraction followed by ileal contraction may be mediated through δ-type opiate receptors located in the muscle membrane and (b) opiate-mediated ICS contraction may be induced during vagal stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine whether binding sites corresponding to the 5 -HT 7 receptor could be detected in smooth muscle of the rat jejunum. Binding studies in rat brain (whole brain minus cerebellum) and guinea-pig ileal longitudinal muscle were also undertaken in order to compare the binding characteristics of these tissues. Studies were performed using [3 H]-mesulergine, as it has a high affinity for 5 -HT 7 receptors. In the rat brain and guinea-pig ileum, pKD values for [3 H]-mesulergine of 8. 0 ± 0. 04 and 7. 9 ± 0. 11 (n= 3) and Bmax values of 9. 9 ± 0. 3 and 21. 5 ± 4. 9 [*]fmol[*]mg− 1 protein were obtained respectively, but no binding was detected in the rat jejunum.

Despite the lack of [3 H]-mesulergine binding in the rat jejunum, functional studies undertaken revealed a biphasic contractile response to 5 -HT which was partly blocked by ondansetron (1 [*]μM).

These effects of quipazine were completely blocked by pretreatment with <b>cinanserin</b> (a 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist) and attenuated by spiperone (a 5 -HT 2 A receptor antagonist). However, pretreatment with SB 200646 A (a 5 -HT 2 B/ 2 C receptor antagonist) only blocked the sympathoinhibition, while pretreatment with SB 204741 (a 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist) reversed the sympathoinhibition to excitation as it also did for DOI. Quipazine also caused renal sympathoexcitation in the presence (i. v.) of a vasopressin V 1 receptor antagonist. Injection (i. v.) of the V 1 receptor antagonist at the peak pressor response evoked by quipazine alone and in the presence of SB 204741 caused an immediate fall in MAP. For quipazine alone the renal sympathoinhibition was slowly reversed to an excitation, while the renal sympathoexcitation observed in the presence of SB 204741 was potentiated. In both, the quipazine-evoked tachycardia was unaffected. The data indicate that cardiovascular responses caused by i. c. v. quipazine and DOI are primarily due to activation of central 5 -HT 2 A receptors, which causes the release of vasopressin and a tachycardia. This released vasopressin appears to suppress a 5 -HT 2 A receptor-evoked central increase in sympathetic outflow, which involves the activation of central 5 -HT 2 B receptors indirectly by the released vasopressin...|$|E

The anorectic effect of amphetamine was reduced by p-chloroamphetamine or lesion in the raphé, but not by 5, 6 -dihydroxytryptamine. The decrease in food consumption produced by 1. 5 mg/kg of MK- 212 was antagonized by prior treatment with p-chloroamphetamine, but not by 5, 6 -dihydroxytryptamine. 5 Haloperidol, which blocks receptors for dopamine, antagonized the anorexigenic effect of amphetamine, but was ineffective in offsetting the action of MK- 212, 3 mg/kg. 6 Pretreatment with chlorimipramine to inhibit the 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic uptake mechanism did not affect the anorectic response to 3 mg/kg of MK- 212, whereas the response to fenfluramine was diminished. 7 The results indicate that the anorectic action of MK- 212 involves a 5 -HT-like component which is more evident at the higher dose level of the compound. The anorexigenic property of MK- 212 may depend, at least partly, upon the integrity of 5 -HT-containing neurones in the central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} on anaesthetized, paralysed and artificially ventilated cats {{in order to determine}} if the altered discharge pattern of phrenic motoneurones recorded during stimulation of medullary raphe nuclei (raphe magnus (r. magnus), raphe obscurus (r. obscurus), raphe pallidus (r. pallidus] are related to release of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) at synapses on respiratory neurones. Effects of 5 -HT released by the neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) on spontaneous activity of phrenic motoneurones were also examined. In addition, responses of phrenic motoneurones to 5 -HT applied by micro-electrophoresis were recorded. Stimulation (100 Hz) of r. magnus or r. obscurus depressed the spontaneous inspiratory discharges of phrenic motoneurones. Administration of the 5 -HT receptor antagonists <b>cinanserin,</b> methysergide or methergoline reduced, but did not abolish, the inhibition. Inhibition of the neuronal reuptake of 5 -HT with fluoxetine enhanced the inhibition and reduced the peak inspiratory action potential frequency of spontaneous discharges. Stimulation (100 Hz) of r. pallidus produced increased firing of phrenic motoneurones. Firing of phrenic motoneurones was evoked even during the normally quiescent expiratory phase of spontaneous respiratory activity. Antagonists at 5 -HT receptors reduced the degree of tonic firing, resulting in partial restoration of expiratory pauses during r. pallidus stimulation. Inhibition of 5 -HT reuptake, on the other hand, resulted in increased tonic firing. Release of 5 -HT by PCA produced a rapid and severe reduction of phrenic nerve activity. Activity was restored by 5 -HT receptor antagonists. In reserpine-treated cats, effects of stimulating medullary raphe nuclei were still pronounced, however 5 -HT receptor antagonists had no effect on the responses. These results, along with the observation that 5 -HT receptor antagonists are only partially effective in non-reserpinized cats, indicate that non-serotoninergic influences contribute as well to the responses evoked by raphe stimulation. Micro-electrophoretic application of 5 -HT by large ejecting currents (100 - 200 nA) had weak stimulatory effects on twenty of forty-five phrenic motoneurones, which exhibited small increases in peak inspiratory discharge frequency during 5 -HT application. Ejecting currents less than 100 nA were without effect. It is concluded that 5 -HT analogues and agents which release endogenous 5 -HT after parenteral administration do not act directly at synapses on the soma membranes of phrenic motoneurones.

40|$|Although {{conscious}} {{dogs have}} often been used for colonic motility studies with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT), the effects of 5 -HT on the isolated colon have not been thoroughly characterized yet. The current study was undertaken to characterize the response to 5 -HT of the canine isolated colon longitudinal muscle. Longitudinal strips of canine midcolon deprived of (sub) mucosa were prepared for isotonic measurement. 5 -HT induced contractions from 3 [*]nM onwards, which were not affected by selective inhibition of 5 -HT re-uptake, monoamine oxidase or blockade of α-adrenoceptors. Tetrodotoxin (0. 3 [*]μM) {{did not affect the}} responses to 5 -HT, suggesting that smooth muscle 5 -HT receptors are involved. The selective 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonist SB 204070 (10 [*]nM) slightly enhanced contractions to 5 -HT and therefore it was included in the organ bath solution in all further experiments. The 5 -HT 1 and 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist methysergide (0. 1 [*]μM) depressed the curve to 5 -HT, but the selective 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist granisetron (0. 3 [*]μM) had no effect. Besides 5 -HT, α-methyl- 5 -HT (α-Me- 5 -HT), 5 -methoxytryptamine (5 -MeOT), 2 -methyl- 5 -HT (2 -Me- 5 -HT) and 5 -carboxamidotryptamine (5 -CT) also induced contractions, with the following rank order of potency (pEC 50 values in parentheses) : 5 -HT (6. 9) =α-methyl- 5 -HT (6. 9) > 2 -Me- 5 -HT (5. 8) = 5 -MeOT (5. 7) = 5 -CT (5. 6), indicative of 5 -HT 2 receptor involvement. α-Me- 5 -HT produced a bell-shaped curve, which was not affected by α-adrenoceptor blockade. 5 -HT, 5 -MeOT, 2 -Me- 5 -HT and 5 -CT produced a monophasic concentration-response curve, consistent with an interaction with a single receptor site. 8 -Hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) and tryptamine only induced contractions at a concentration exceeding 1 [*]μM. The selective 5 -HT 2 B receptor antagonist SB 204741 (0. 3 [*]μM) did not affect the curve to 5 -HT. Ketanserin, cisapride and spiroxatrine behaved as competitive antagonists with pKb values of, respectively, 8. 4, 8. 1 and 6. 7. Spiroxatrine (1 [*]μM) shifted the curve to 5 -MeOT rightward yielding an apparent pA 2 of 7. 1. Other antagonists at 5 -HT 2 A receptors also surmountably inhibited the contractions to 5 -HT (apparent pA 2 value in parentheses) : mesulergine (8. 2), <b>cinanserin</b> (8. 2), yohimbine (6. 2) and mianserin (8. 6). However, as well as a rightward shift, methiothepin (8. 3), pizotifen (8. 6) and spiperone (8. 8) also caused a depression of the curve, indicative of ‘pseudo-irreversible' antagonism. Taken together, the above mentioned affinity estimates most closely corresponded to literature affinity values for 5 -HT 2 A receptors. It was concluded that 5 -HT induces contractions of the canine midcolon longitudinal muscle primarily by stimulation of smooth muscle 5 -HT 2 A receptors. The presence of inhibitory 5 -HT 4 receptors cannot be ruled out...|$|E
