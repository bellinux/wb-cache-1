5|$|On August10, the National Hurricane Center (NHC), {{based in}} Miami, Florida, issued a {{tropical}} storm watch for the entire island of Jamaica as Tropical Storm <b>Charley</b> intensified over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm quickly approached the island. Early on August11, a hurricane watch was declared for the island as <b>Charley</b> neared hurricane intensity. Late on August11, all watches and warnings for Jamaica were changed to hurricane warnings as <b>Charley</b> attained Category 1 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The warning was later discontinued on August12 as Hurricane <b>Charley</b> tracked towards Cuba, no longer a threat to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|One of the lynchers {{may have}} been <b>Charley</b> Guthrie (died 1956), father of the folk singer Woody Guthrie, {{who was born in}} Okemah 14 months after the lynching. <b>Charley</b> was an Okemah {{real-estate}} agent, district court clerk, Democratic politician, Freemason and owner of the town's first automobile. According to Joe Klein, he was {{also a member of the}} Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s. There is no documentary evidence that <b>Charley</b> was a Klansman.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, <b>Charley</b> turned eastward {{and then}} east-northeastward while {{tracking}} over decreasing sea surface temperatures (SST's). Early on September 27, <b>Charley</b> was downgraded to a tropical storm. Later that day, <b>Charley</b> crossed over Terceira Island in the Azores with winds of 65mph (100km/h). <b>Charley</b> gradually lost tropical characteristics, and by 1800UTC on September 27, it had transitioned into an extratropical storm. The remnant system accelerated northeastward toward the British Isles, where it merged with another extratropical low on September 29. While {{passing through the}} Azores, <b>Charley</b> produced tropical storm force winds, with the Lajes AFB reporting sustained winds of 53mph (85km/h) and gusts reaching 82mph (132km/h). No other effects from <b>Charley</b> were reported in the Azores.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, <b>Charley</b> re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, <b>Charley</b> attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of <b>Charley</b> accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of <b>Charley</b> dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E

Throughout the United States, <b>Charley</b> caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). <b>Charley</b> was a compact, fast-moving storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane <b>Charley</b> {{affected}} {{at least}} ten U.S. states, resulting in five total deaths and $15 million in damage (1986 USD). The precursor disturbance to <b>Charley</b> brought rainfall to much of Florida, including a total of 8.61 inches (219 millimetres) in Steinhatchee; that rainfall maxima was the greatest total associated with <b>Charley</b> within the United States. The system also produced light to moderate rainfall across Georgia and South Carolina, which proved beneficial as the region was in a major drought. However, its heaviest rainfall remained over open waters.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Charley</b> {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa in early August 2004. Tracking westward, the system gradually organized and was declared a tropical depression on August9 while located roughly 115mi (185km) south-southeast of Barbados. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name <b>Charley</b> after entering the eastern Caribbean Sea. Quickly tracking northwest, the small storm intensified.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Charley</b> did not weaken while {{moving over}} land; instead, it intensified, {{attaining}} peak winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) after emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near the North Carolina–Virginia border. Within 12 hours of reaching peak intensity, however, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status. The approaching trough, which had previously caused <b>Charley</b> to turn northward, forced the hurricane to accelerate northeastward and later eastward, bringing the storm about 80 mi (130 km) southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts on August 19. As the trough {{was not very}} strong, <b>Charley</b> slowly underwent the process of extratropical transition, unlike other tropical cyclones that complete the transition much quicker with a stronger trough. As a result, the storm maintained hybrid, or subtropical characteristics for several days. By August 21, <b>Charley</b> completed the transition south of Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|Late on August11, as <b>Charley</b> {{traveled}} {{south of}} Jamaica, it attained hurricane intensity, with winds reaching 75mph (120km/h). Over the following days, the storm curved northeast and impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 hurricane before striking Florida as an intense Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 150mph (240km/h) on August13. The weakened <b>Charley</b> rapidly tracked northeast before dissipating on August15 near Long Island, New York.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane <b>Charley</b> in Jamaica {{included}} one fatality {{and at least}} $1million in damages. Forming out of a tropical wave on August9, 2004, <b>Charley</b> quickly tracked through the eastern Caribbean Sea and attained tropical storm status on August10. While passing south of Jamaica on August11, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. During its passage of Jamaica, <b>Charley</b> had maximum winds of 75mph (120km/h), a low-end Category 1 hurricane. Turning north, the storm impacted western Cuba as a Category 3 storm before making landfall in Florida as a strong Category 4. The storm eventually dissipated on August15. As <b>Charley</b> approached Jamaica, officials issued tropical storm watches and warnings before issuing a hurricane watch. Two cruise ships were diverted from docking in Jamaica, affecting 5,700 passengers. Numerous shelters were set up across the island; however, relatively few people sought refuge in them.|$|E
