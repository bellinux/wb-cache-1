40|$|Abstract. The {{applications}} of digital chaotic maps in discrete-time <b>chaotic</b> cryptography <b>and</b> pseudo-random coding are widely studied recently. However, the statistical properties of digital chaotic maps are rather {{different from the}} continuous ones, which impedes the theoretical analyses of the digital <b>chaotic</b> ciphers <b>and</b> pseudo-random coding. This paper detailedly investigates the statistical properties of a class of digital piecewise linear <b>chaotic</b> map (PLCM), <b>and</b> rigorously proves some useful results. Based on the proved results, we further discuss some notable problems in <b>chaotic</b> cryptography <b>and</b> pseudo-random coding employing digital PLCM-s. Since the analytic methods proposed in this paper can essentially extended to {{a large number of}} PLCM-s, they will be valuable for the research on the performance of such maps in <b>chaotic</b> cryptography <b>and</b> pseudo-random coding. ...|$|R

5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially <b>chaotic</b> <b>and</b> incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} career, Caesar had seen how <b>chaotic</b> <b>and</b> {{dysfunctional}} the Roman Republic had become. The republican machinery {{had broken down}} {{under the weight of}} imperialism, the central government had become powerless, the provinces had been transformed into independent principalities under the absolute control of their governors, and the army had replaced the constitution as the means of accomplishing political goals. Between his crossing of the Rubicon river in 49 BC, and his assassination in 44 BC, Caesar established a new constitution, which was intended to accomplish three separate goals. First, he wanted to suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, he wanted to create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, he wanted to knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E

Using different correlation characteristic of harmonic <b>and</b> <b>chaotic</b> signal,we can transform the sample signal to a new data sequence which has new harmonic. The new harmonic frequency is m times of the original harmonic and beyond the center bandwidth of noise. Then use wavelet packet decomposition to analysis the energy distribution of harmonic <b>and</b> <b>chaotic</b> signals <b>and</b> extract the component which the harmonic energy concentrated on, In the end, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm is employed to estimate harmonic frequencies.

Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on Rio Grande do Sul. The situation in Rio Grande do Sul was <b>chaotic,</b> <b>and</b> the local military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the Paraguayan army. The Baron of Porto Alegre offered to return to active duty, and on 21 July 1865, the government gave him command of the Brazilian land forces in Rio Grande do Sul. He set out for Uruguaiana, a small town in the province's west, where the Paraguayan army was besieged by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units.|$|E
5|$|Members of Clann Somairle seem to {{have been}} attacking parts of the Crovan dynasty's island-kingdom, {{possibly}} taking advantage of the warring between Rögnvaldr and Óláfr. It may have been that they were also lending support to Alan's destabilising incursions into the Isles. Whatever the case, {{it is clear that the}} state of affairs in the Isles was <b>chaotic</b> <b>and,</b> because of Óláfr's inability to control of the situation, the formidable Hákon decided to pacify the region using Óspakr-Hákon. In fact, the saga notes that Óspakr-Hákon was also a son of Dubgall, and it is likely that his family connections would have made him a palatable over-king of the unruly Clann Somairle. Óspakr-Hákon's kingdom was likely meant to encompass the territories of Clann Somairle, and control of the Crovan dynasty's domain may have been retained by the dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Bruce and Hughes clashed in both {{style and}} ideology. Bruce found Hughes' {{management}} of the government capricious and <b>chaotic,</b> <b>and</b> felt little was accomplished in Cabinet or in party meetings so long as Hughes headed them. But {{he served as a}} strong counterweight to the domineering Hughes, resisting several of his more expensive proposals or acting as the voice of reason to talk Hughes down from several of his more outlandish ideas. His tenure would ultimately be short, presiding over just one budget in 1922, which was conservative and tax-cutting. The Opposition criticised the budget for its failure to limit rising government spending and indebtedness. The budget included many concessions to rural interests and the recently formed Country Party, which appeared as a major threat to Nationalist Party dominance going into the 1922 elections in December. Yet Bruce endeared himself to many of his colleagues with his amiable personal style, his forceful voice in Cabinet against Hughes, and his conservative views, which were more in line with the majority of the party.|$|E

In this work, a detailed qualitative analysis of the novel <b>chaotic</b> systems (A) <b>and</b> (B) has been presented, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kaplan-Yorke dimension of these chaotic systems have been obtained. It is found that the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) for the novel <b>chaotic</b> systems (A) <b>and</b> (B) has a large value, viz. for the system (A) and for the system (B). Thus, both the novel <b>chaotic</b> systems (A) <b>and</b> (B) display strong chaotic behaviour.
