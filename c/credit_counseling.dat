40|$|The {{growth of}} Palpalá City (Province of Jujuy, argentina) since the 1940 s, {{is linked to}} altos Hornos Zapla (ahz) the {{state-owned}} steel and iron company whose privatization in the early 1990 s {{as part of the}} external three-sided opening, privatizations and deregulation which characterized convertibility, meant large changes in the local economic structure. In the 1950 s, this city was identified by the town hall as 'mother of Industries' ('madre de Industrias'), whereas today, the municipal slogan is 'City of Tourism' ('Ciudad Turística'). Recovering the recent occupational history of this city meets the need to know the labor and socioeconomic reality of this urban area in the Province of Jujuy, about which information is rare. Although it is included in the Home Survey?s sample, it is shown in blocks, making the information very limited. It is paradigmaticin this city to study the means chosen to try to overcome the traumatic shock that ahz's privatization meant, to analyze the policies developed and evaluate their results, some years after their application. In Palpalá, a local development strategy was applied, with a strong impulse to micro-businesses, following, somehow, the model postulated at national level, what will allow us to know the local reality better, as well as the regional and national realities for its characteristics. The methodology used in this work ('From iron and steel industry to tourist city. Brief occupational history of Palpala city) was the bibliographic research of the rare existing studies, interviews to qualified informers as well as the use of secondary data sources, such as data from different national Censuses. To conclude, {{it can be said that}} due to the crisis of the 1990 s and its state reducing plan, those who suffered its consequences less are, paradoxically, those who are still related to state jobs. In Palpalá, when ahz was privatized and the buyer company failed to fulfill its contract duly, leaving a great number of the local people unemployed, it was the municipal government who had to assume the responsibility of an answer (in this case, through training, <b>credit</b> and/or <b>counseling</b> to micro-businessmen) In the last years, however, the possibility to work in informal activities has become important in Palpalá, with a high percentage of people working in city fairs selling different kinds of goods. although the change in the model in the recent years has allowed the reactivation in different areas, a preliminary evaluation is that the improvement does not seem to have reached the core of excluded and marginalized of the previous decad...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{ascertain}} which, if any, variables would effect how a minister felt about counseling and psychology, and what impact this may have on the possibility that he or she would refer to secular counselors for those in their congregations who are having difficulties beyond the pastor 2 ̆ 7 s expertise. The study investigated this possibility by examining the following variables: age, pastoral experience, educational level, and the amount of psychology class credits that a minister had in training. In addition, it sought to determine what influence a minister 2 ̆ 7 s theological belief and his or her denomination had on their perception of psychology and the decision to refer. A survey instrument was created, submitted to a pilot study, and sent to 250 randomly selected pastors in the State of Virginia. The instrument used a Likert scale to measure minister 2 ̆ 7 s positive or negative beliefs and opinions about counseling and psychology, and if he or she would be inclined to refer a troubled church member to a counseling or psychological professional. The resulting answers were tested with respect to the above named independent variables to determine if these influenced the minister 2 ̆ 7 s belief. Twelve null hypotheses stated that there were no significant differences at the. 05 level in a minister 2 ̆ 7 s perception that members of their congregations can be helped by those who practice psychology and counseling, and whether they would refer a member to a professional counselor with respect to the above variables. Twelve different crosstabulation tables were evaluated using the chi-square test for independence, and five null hypotheses were accepted while seven null hypotheses were rejected. The research indicated that theological belief, the age of the minister, the number of years experience, and the number of college-level credits a minister has earned in counseling, psychology, and/or pastoral counseling does matter for ministers in having a positive or negative influence in their belief that their church members can be helped by those who practice counseling and psychology. At the same time, denomination and the level of education did not appear to influence his or her belief. In determining if the variables affected the pastor 2 ̆ 7 s likelihood to refer a member going through difficulties to a counseling professional, it was found that theological belief, denomination, and the number of <b>counseling</b> <b>credits</b> earned do matter in this decision. On the other hand, the age of the minister, number of years in the ministry, and his or her level of education do not influence a minister 2 ̆ 7 s decision to refer a parishioner to a counselor or psychologist...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{there is}} {{variation}} {{from country to}} country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. <b>Credit</b> <b>counseling</b> includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay. In addition to education, a popular <b>credit</b> <b>counseling</b> option is the ‘‘Debt management plan’’ (‘‘DMP’’, known in the United Kingdom as the Individual voluntary arrangement or [...] "IVA"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer’s unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer’s monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then ‘‘consolidated’’ into a single payment.|$|E
5000|$|DMPs for {{consumers}} are often negotiated by a <b>credit</b> <b>counseling</b> agency {{on behalf of}} the debtor. [...] <b>Credit</b> <b>counseling</b> agencies often address the debt by working with the debtor to set a budget based on their regular income and expenditures that will then include one regular bill payment that is allocated across the creditor(s). Agencies will negotiate {{on behalf of the}} debtor to lower payments and interest rates with creditors. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. The effect on the debtor's overall credit score will vary. In the United Kingdom, as well as DMPs, residents can also apply for a Individual voluntary arrangement (IVAs), which can give the debtor a discount on their debt.|$|E
