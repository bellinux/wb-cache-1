40|$|Abstract. A tanning process {{based on}} a {{preliminary}} stabilization with glucose, followed by a chromium tannage, has been optimized on semi-industrial scale. A higher chromium content in the tanned leather and a better exhaustion of the floats indicate {{that the presence of}} glucose in the hide improves the penetration and fixation of chromium. The stabilization with glucose allows the production of chromium-free waste shavings that may be reutilized through more sustainable routes. The <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> obtained is characterized by mechanical and technical properties comparable to those of the traditionally chromium tanned <b>crust</b> <b>leather.</b> As far as roundness, fullness and hand, the glucose stabilized leather display better performances.

40|$|The use of {{synthetic}} DNA as a marking {{system is a}} new traceability concept in the leather industry, especially for supplier and batch tracing. DNA is outstandingly suited for the usage as a marking system because of its code diversity, invisibility and doubtlessness. However, DNA labeling is a great challenge for products exposed to DNA damaging influences during their production, such as acidic pH, elevated temperatures in combination with high humidity or sunlight radiation. Leather is such a product. We attached single-strand DNA (ssDNA) to hydroxyapatite and enhanced the stability of these DNA particles by encapsulation in polystyrene-codivinylbenzene (PS-DVB) microcapsules. Furthermore, the ssDNA containing microcapsules were improved with functional groups {{on the surface of}} the capsule to irreversibly attach them to the collagen matrix of leather by chrome tanning.

40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of chrome tanned <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> (with {{or without}} fatliquor) and finished leather has been measured in three-point bend, tensile and compression tests. Relations between the experimental {{results and the}} perceived softness of the leather were investigated. The instrumentally assessed softness {{of a set of}} leathers was represented by parameters obtained from these tests and compared with a quantified subjective assessment. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyse the water status in crust leathers. The influence of water content prior to staking on its softening effect was investigated. An orthogonal experiment was applied to investigate the influence of various factors (e. g. amplitude and frequency) on the softening effect of mechanical action to obtain an optimum combination of these factors. The bending force, F, increased in a linear way with increasing sample width, w, in accordance with the standard theory of beam bending. However the change in F with increasing sample thickness, t, departed (markedly in some cases) from the standard theory. The theory of laminated materials offered a quantitative description of the dependency provided that the grain and corium layers were regarded as the laminae. F was approximately proportional to the actual bending length raised to a power between - 2 and - 3. An empirical equation {{based on the results of}} the bend testing was developed. A parameter, Se/tn, can be used to rank the softness of leather, where Se is equivalent to the bending stiffness in standard bending theory, and n is the approximate index in the power function describing the relationship of the bending force F to the sample thickness t for a particular type of leather. A model describing the compression behaviour of <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> is proposed which involves four stages of compression: (i) hair-like fibres being bent flat onto the surface and buckling of vertical fibre bundles, (ii) closing up of voids between fibre bundles, (iii) closing up of voids between fibres, and (iv) compressing of solid fibres. DSC results indicate that water has a stronger interaction with collagen molecules in an unfatliquored leather than in a fatliquored one. Fatliquor appears to function as a shield between water and collagen. The influence of water content prior to staking on the resulting softening effect was clearly reflected in bending and tensile tests, but was not nearly so evident in a compression test. It is shown that a maximum softening effect can be obtained in the staking process when moisture content is about 30 - 40 %...|$|E
40|$|M. Sc. Waste {{generation}} and waste disposal forms {{part of our}} everyday lives, even more so for a tanning facility. This mini dissertation discusses the delisting of waste generated at a tanning facility. This facility produces <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> from partially tanned hides received from other tanneries in the Mpumalanga province. <b>Crust</b> <b>leather</b> is the product in the penultimate process before it attains its desired leather like properties. The <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> is sent to a finishing plant for the final process of painting before it is supplied to the automotive industry for upholstery purposes. Large volumes of raw materials including chemicals, water and hides {{are used in the}} retanning process to produce <b>crust</b> <b>leather.</b> During the production of this leather various waste streams are generated including effluent, solid waste and tanning sludge. The tanning sludge is classified in terms of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry’s Minimum Requirements for Handling, Classification and Disposal of Hazardous waste as a possible or potentially hazardous waste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of to a permitted hazardous waste landfill site which has a significant cost implication for the tanning facility. This mini-dissertation focuses on the attempt to delist the tanning sludge. This mini-dissertation highlights the problems associated with hazardous waste disposal in the form of sludge from the tannery. This disposal is expensive because there is only one permitted hazardous waste landfill site in the Gauteng and Mpumalanga provinces. This site is called Holfontein and is situated approximately 200 km from the tanning facility. The high disposal cost encountered is owing to the specialist management required because of the environmental risks involved in operating this waste disposal site. However, an option to delist the hazardous tanning sludge waste is available to the tanning facility, which could mean that the hazard rating is reduced from extremely hazardous to a lower rating or even to general waste. Delisting the tanning sludge will allow it to be disposed of to a general landfill site. Previous attempts to delist the tanning sludge were not successful as the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge caused it to remain classified as extremely hazardous waste. Due to the increasing waste disposal cost the tanning facility once again engaged in the processes to delist the tanning sludge. The personnel of the tanning facility is of the opinion that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) should not be present in the tanning sludge as these substances are not used generally in the tanning industry. Therefore, the main aim of this mini-dissertation is to delist the tanning sludge to general waste thus allowing it to be disposed of to a general landfill site, which in turn will result in a reduction in the waste disposal costs. Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery In order to achieve the main aim, the study entailed a literature review of the retanning process explaining the generation of the various waste streams, the possible presence of chromium (Cr) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) in the process, and a review of the environmental legislation that will determine the waste disposal options. To delist the tanning sludge the tanning facility followed a defined procedure as determined by the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry. The tanning sludge was assessed using analytical procedures as specified. The objective was to characterise the leachability of the tanning sludge, as well as to verify the presence of any hazardous substances which prevent the tanning sludge from being delisted. Leachability is the potential mobilisation of substances from the sludge under circumstances similar than that of the waste disposal sites. This includes the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge. In an approach to verify the presence of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) in the tanning sludge the composition of the raw materials (chemicals and hides) were evaluated and samples were taken from the various effluent streams. The tanning sludge was sampled separately to determine the leachability characteristics. No hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) were found to be present in the raw materials or in any of the waste effluent streams. However, small quantities of cyanide (CN) and hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were found to be present in the tanning sludge. The reason for the presence of these constituents could not be determined as it was proved that hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) do not enter the process through the raw materials. It was further proved that the process does not support circumstances to oxidise trivalent chromium to hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). Further, the presence of cyanide (CN) cannot be explained since it is not a substance that is generally used in the tanning industry. Part of the study included determining treatment options for the tanning sludge. It was found that treating the tanning sludge with lime reduced the concentration of heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)). However, after analysis and classification of the tanning sludge it was found that it was not the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) and cyanide (CN) that prevented the tanning sludge from being delisted to a lower hazard rating but rather the presence of small quantities of cadmium (Cd). Cadmium (Cd) is classified as extremely hazardous and therefore it is this substance that is responsible for the high hazard rating classification of the sludge. Although the objective to delist the tanning sludge was not achieved, it was determined that the waste can be disposed of to a general waste landfill site permitted to accept a certain amount of waste containing heavy metals (such as chromium and manganese). The reduction in the waste disposal cost will therefore be achieved and the tanning facility will dispose of their waste in a Delisting of hazardous waste produced in a tannery sound and environmentally responsible method ensuring it will not {{have a significant impact on}} the environment...|$|E
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the traditional process based on the use of sulfides, an unhairing process in drum by hydrogen peroxide, named DEPOXO, was developed for the production of high-quality bovine upper leather. A preliminary investigation at laboratory scale has allowed to set out the optimal process conditions, in terms of H 2 O 2 dosage (9 %) and pH (12. 5), in order to achieve an effective unhairing and a compatible swelling of hides. The following pilot-scaled runs have assessed the industrial feasibility of the process that allows the production of a versatile base for different final applications of the leather (either chrome or vegetable tanned), and appear practical to implement. The <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> obtained by the oxidative unhairing process showed good physical-mechanical and technical properties comparable with those obtained by the traditional one, and the leather was technically assessed as satisfactory and suitable according to the market request. The actual reduction of the environmental impact of the novel process, in relation with the traditional one, was evaluated performing a Life Cycle Assesment (LCA) using SimaPro 7. 3, one of the most used software for LCA analysis. The results of the life cycle impact assessment underline that damages on main impact categories are greatly reduced through the adoption or the oxidative unhairing. Therefore, the DEPOXO process appears a feasible process, either from the environmental or from the technical point of view, to produce high quality bovine upper leather...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{chemical}} compounds of vegetable origin in industrial production shows several environmentally beneficial effects (renewability, biodegradability, low toxicity, no impact on CO 2 level) over synthetic products presently being widely used. 22 23 24 In this paper, some pre-industrial studies on the potential of substituting some mineral lubricants (mainly alkylbenzene) widely used in textile (spinning phase of wool) and tannery (both in dry and damp phase) processing in two Tuscan industrial districts with formulations based on High Oleic Sunflower Oil (HOSO) will be discussed. This research {{was carried out by}} private companies that depend on seed production (farmers and their main associations, Seed Company), oil extraction, refining, and formulation. The new, low environmental impact formulations were tested at an industrial level to verify their application potential from technical, environmental, and economical viewpoints. 25 26 27 28 29 30 The results confirmed that HOSO could substitute mineral oils in textile and tannery applications without any technical problem and without any facility modifications. In some cases such as <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> production, the HOSO-based lubricant (BIOVIT) improved the softness of the finished product. The environmental impact evaluation carried out by the Eurostat framework of environmental pressure indicators confirmed how a higher sustainability could be obtained by the utilisation of new oils characterised by a higher biodegradability. Finally, the economic analysis showed a higher production cost and price of vegetable oils, but, at the same time, indicated the possibility of reducing the required amount due to a lower utilisation rate. Anyway, the price difference between the mineral and vegetable-based oils has to be limited to arrive at a commercial application. Based on these results,HOSOcould represen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Leather plays a {{vital role}} in earning the foreign {{currency}} for Bangladesh. Export of finished leather and leather products have an important impact on the economy of Bangladesh. Mainly cow goat sheep and buffalo leathers are produced in this country. Different defects of leather due to numerous numbers of diseases of animals of poor management of people deteriorate the quality of leather which has negative impact in this sector. This paper analyses the magnitude and category of major defects in case of cow goat and buffalo of Bangladesh. We have studied in sixteen tanneries of Hazaribagh Dhaka where 95 tanneries of the whole country are situated. This study found that in case of cow skin hair slip parasitic skin diseases wound and pox are mainly responsible for the defects in leather in raw condition. Again in case of the wet blue leather of cow flay cut pox mark parasitic diseases growth mark wound sun burn scratch dark mole are responsible for the defects. Further for <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> of cow flay cut parasitic diseases pox looseness for bating scratch wrinkle grain damage are found as the reason of defects. In case of goat parasitic diseases pox growth mark mole scratch flay cut hair slip were found responsible mostly for the defects in Bangladesh. Moreover parasite pox wound branding growth mark wrinkle jam wrinkle mole scratch flay cut curing have been detected for the defects of buffalo in this country. Again in this study it is found that average leather grade A-D is 15 E-F is 25 G-H is 30 HH is 12. 5 and again the rejection is 18. 43. It is observed that most of the defects occur during animal life period. The rest of the defects happen during slaughter flaying preservation and processing period of hides and skins into leather. By proper caring of the farm level and at the point of slaughter and flaying desired quality of hides and skins could be obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of drying leather at 30 % {{strain on the}} tensile strength and crack resistance of the grain layer of chromium tanned bovine leather was examined. The effect of drying under different strains was also examined. Bovine wet blue splits were stretched (by 30 %) either along one axis (uniaxial) or two perpendicular axes (biaxial) and dried in this stretched condition. The strength and the fracture toughness of the resulting <b>crust</b> <b>leather,</b> was then evaluated. Drying leather under 30 % uniaxial strain resulted {{in an increase in}} the tensile strength for samples cut along the stretch axis. However the variation of tensile strength with angle of cutting the specimen with respect to the stretch axis can be described by the Tsai-Hill theory that is applicable to fibre composite materials. The essential work of fracture approach was applied {{for the first time to}} leather specimens cut both longitudinally and transversally to the stretch axis. For all the samples examined, a strong anisotropy in the fracture behaviour was observed. The fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the stretch direction in uniaxial samples was lower than in the transverse direction, this fracture anisotropy being enhanced at higher applied strains. Drying under uniaxial strains above 15 %, resulted in an increase in the fracture toughness for cracks running transversally to the strain direction, but at the same time, it seriously reduced the fracture resistance for cracks propagating along the strain direction resulting in global yielding, a phenomenon that rendered the evaluation of fracture resistance by use of essential work of fracture approach unattainable. Drying under biaxial strains above 15 % seriously reduced the fracture resistance of leather both perpendicular to and parallel to the backbone. The application of optical microscopy to observe the propagation of cracks through the grain layer led to the conclusion that drying under biaxial strain can cause a reduction in crack resistance due to changes in the size and nature of a highly orientated fibrous zone close to the crack tip. X-ray diffraction studies were made in order to relate the fracture behaviour to leather structure. The X-ray data was correlated with experimental data in order to investigate the {{influence of}} pre-stretching on the strength and hence quality of leather during manufacture and their relationship to the fibrous collagen microstructure...|$|E
40|$|Most {{countries}} have implemented export-oriented development strategies with {{the objectives of}} improving their economic stability and improving resource allocation efficiency. Export tax, which has been {{an integral part of}} trade policies for centuries, has not been given adequate attention by the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the economic literature. Export taxes on primary commodities serve as indirect subsidies to manufacturing and processing industries by lowering the domestic price of inputs, and also {{have a positive effect on}} government revenue. Conversely, export taxes can have a negative impact on the producers of raw materials and externalities for trade partners. The government of Ethiopia applied a 150 % export tax on raw hides and skins (RHS) and semi-finished leather products in 2008, and another 150 % export tax on <b>crust</b> <b>leather</b> in 2012 in order to encourage the leather manufacturing industry. The aim of this study is to examine the export trends of Ethiopia s raw hides and skins and finished leather products, and to analyse the effect of export tax on Ethiopia s leather industry s export competitiveness. A linear trend analysis model was used to analyse the export trends of raw hides and skins and finished leather products. This study evaluated export volume data from 1997 to 2014 in order to estimate the trend coefficients. The results of the model showed that Ethiopia s RHS and semi-processed leather products export had declined by - 38. 06 % and significant at 1 % significant level; this is due to the heavy export tax imposed by the government to increase the production and export of finished leather products. Meanwhile, finished leather products and footwear have increased by 75. 34 % and 44. 37 % respectively, and significant at 1 % significant level. The comparative advantage analysis was used to examine the revealed comparative advantage (RCA) of Ethiopia by comparing selected countries. The results indicated that Ethiopia was a RCA of raw hides and skins and semi-processed leather products more than one (RCA > 1) before 2008; after the export tax implementation in 2008, the RCA became decreased, conversely, the RCA of Ethiopia s finished product more than one for the period 2006 to 2014 and increased more after 2008. South Africa has comparative advantage only on the export of raw hides skins and semi-processed leather product (RCA> 1). Nigeria was not stable RCA for both raw hides and skins and finished leather products and in most year revealed comparative advantage greater than one (RCA > 1). The RCA indexes of footwear for all three countries were less than one except Ethiopia in (2007, 2008 and 2012). The RCA provides information on advantage to exports, such as product comparisons with other competitive countries. However, the RCA does not show the sources of advantage (growth), therefore the constant market share (CMS) model was used to indicate the source of advantage. The CMS model has been used to evaluate the competitiveness of Ethiopia s leather products. The export value data of 2007 were used as the base year, whereas data in 2013 were considered as the year after the export tax implementation and increase. The results indicate that the implementation of the export tax has reduced the competitiveness of raw hides and skins and semi-processed leather products, but increased the competitiveness of the finished leather products in the world markets. The overall results showed positive export growth (2. 55), which is most likely achieved by an increase in the export competitiveness of the leather industry of 2. 25. The positive competitiveness value indicates that Ethiopian finished leather products are competitive with other exporters in selected markets (Italy, China and Hong Kong). Conversely, Ethiopia s leather products have negative commodity composition effects and market composition effects (- 0. 132 and - 0. 262, respectively). The negative commodity composition effect shows that, because of the export tax, the export of Ethiopian raw hides and skins and semi-processed leather products have decreased, while the imports of these products have grown faster in selected markets. The same is true for negative market composition effects; because of the export tax, the demand for raw hides and skins and semi-finished products decreased in selected markets.
