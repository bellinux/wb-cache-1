5|$|The <b>Cripple</b> Creek {{strike was}} a major victory for the miners' union. The Western Federation of Miners used {{the success of the}} strike to {{organize}} almost every worker in the <b>Cripple</b> Creek region – including waitresses, laundry workers, bartenders and newsboys – into 54 local unions. The WFM flourished in the <b>Cripple</b> Creek area for almost a decade, even helping to elect most county officials (including the new sheriff).|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} <b>Cripple</b> Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at <b>Cripple</b> Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the <b>Cripple</b> Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long before}} this dispute, miners at <b>Cripple</b> Creek had formed the Free Coinage Union. Once the new changes went into effect, they {{affiliated}} with the Western Federation of Miners, and became Local 19.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} on {{the area of the}} behaviour of thin-walled coldformed steel structural members was carried out with an emphasis on the phenomenon of web <b>crippling</b> of beam members. Web <b>crippling</b> is a common mode of failure experienced by web elements of thin-walled beams under concentrated loads or reactions. Most of the studies done on web <b>crippling</b> behaviour are experimental and based on compression testing of beams to determine the ultimate web <b>crippling</b> strength. It has been identified that the theoretical investigation of web <b>crippling</b> behaviour is rather complicated due to localised collapse behaviour. However, some {{attempts have been made to}} develop theoretically based models to predict web <b>crippling</b> behaviour, and to obtain better understanding of the failure modes. Different theoretical studies, especially on elastic and plastic behaviour of plate elements were investigated with the intention of developing an analytical model to describe web <b>crippling</b> behaviour. It was found that almost all of the design codes around the world make design recommendations to predict the load at which web <b>crippling</b> would occur, based on equations obtained from web <b>crippling</b> tests conducted by various researchers...|$|R
40|$|Lipped channel beams (LCBs) are {{commonly}} used as floor joists and bearers in the construction industry. These thin-walled LCBs are subjected to specific local and global failures, one of them being web <b>crippling.</b> Several experimental and numerical {{studies have been conducted}} in the past to study the web <b>crippling</b> behaviour and capacities of different cold-formed steel sections under different concentrated load cases. However, {{due to the nature of}} the web <b>crippling</b> phenomenon and many factors influencing the web <b>crippling</b> capacities, capacity predictions given by most of the cold-formed steel design standards are either unconservative or conservative. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to study the web <b>crippling</b> under End Two-Flange (ETF) and Interior Two-Flange (ITF) load cases based on the new AISI S 909 standard web <b>crippling</b> test method [1]. Finite element models were developed and validated using the test results. These models were then used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the web <b>crippling</b> capacities of a wide range of LCB sections including different sectional geometric parameters such as section depth, inside bent radius, thickness and bearing length. This paper presents the details of the numerical study of LCBs subject to web <b>crippling</b> under ETF and ITF load cases. Using the extensive web <b>crippling</b> capacity data obtained from both numerical and experimental studies, improved unified web <b>crippling</b> design equations were developed. Suitable web <b>crippling</b> design rules were also developed under the direct strength method format...|$|R

40|$|Web <b>crippling</b> is {{a common}} failure mode in cold formed sections. Interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> reduces the load {{carrying}} capacity and may control the design. In this research, numerical study on web <b>crippling</b> and interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> are performed considering the material and geometric nonlinearities. The study is performed on channel sections subjected to web <b>crippling</b> under interior one flange (IOF) loading conditions. Finite element models are verified against experimental tests, and then extended to predict the web <b>crippling</b> strength of the studied channel sections. FE is used to investigate the interaction between bending and web <b>crippling</b> in C-sections. FE results are employed to investigate the effect of different parameters on sections resistance. It was found that, the strengths predicted by design codes are generally inadequate for channels with a practical web slenderness range. Therefore, modifications were proposed to improve the strength predicted by codes...|$|R

40|$|Cold-formed {{steel channel}} {{sections}} are generally used as flexural members in light weight steel construction. Improved channel section profiles such as SupaCee sections with longitudinal web stiffeners and curved lips {{are also used}} instead of the conventional lipped channel sections. Web <b>crippling</b> capacities of these innovative sections can be {{different from those of}} conventional lipped channel sections. However, the web <b>crippling</b> behaviour and strength of these high strength SupaCee sections has not been investigated yet. Current web <b>crippling</b> design methods given in cold-formed steel design standards do not include any design procedures for SupaCee sections. Hence an experimental study involving 36 web <b>crippling</b> tests was first undertaken to investigate the web <b>crippling</b> behaviour and strengths of SupaCee sections under two flange load cases with their flanges unfastened to the supports. Comparison of experimental results showed that the web <b>crippling</b> capacities of SupaCee sections are reduced in comparison to lipped channel sections. Therefore the current web <b>crippling</b> design equations in the American and Australian/New Zealand cold-formed steel design standards were modified by including suitable web <b>crippling</b> coefficients for SupeCee sections. Finite element models of tested SupaCee sections were also developed and validated using the experimental results. This paper presents the details of the experimental and numerical web <b>crippling</b> studies of SupaCee sections under two flange load cases and the results.

40|$|Strengthening of {{aluminium}} {{and stainless steel}} structural tubular sections using adhesive bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) subjected to web <b>crippling</b> has been investigated. Aluminium and stainless steel tubular sections may experience web <b>crippling</b> failure due to local concentrated loads or reactions. The web <b>crippling</b> strength can be enhanced by strengthening the webs of the sections in localized regions. The current international specifications {{of aluminium}} and stainless steel structures do not provide web <b>crippling</b> design rules for strengthening of tubular sections. Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop safe and reliable web <b>crippling</b> design rules for FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel structures. An extensive test program was performed on FRP strengthening of aluminium and cold-formed stainless steel tubular sections subjected to web <b>crippling.</b> The test specimens consisted of 6061 -T 6 heat-treated aluminium alloy, ferritic stainless steel type EN 1. 4003 and lean duplex type EN 1. 4162 square and rectangular hollow sections. A total of 254 web <b>crippling</b> tests was conducted in this study. The tests were performed on eighteen different sizes of tubular sections which covered a wide range of web slenderness (flat portion of web depth-to-thickness) ratio from 6. 2 to 62. 2. The web <b>crippling</b> tests were conducted under the four loading conditions according to the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely End-Two-Flange, Interior-Two-Flange, End-One-Flange and Interior-One-Flange loading conditions. The investigation was mainly focused on the effects of different adhesive, FRP, surface treatment, widths of FRP plate and web slenderness of tubular sections for strengthening against web <b>crippling.</b> Six different adhesives, six different FRPs, two different surface treatments, three different widths of FRP plate were considered. It was found that the web <b>crippling</b> capacity of aluminium tubular sections are significantly increased due to FRP strengthening, especially for those sections with large value of web slenderness. The web <b>crippling</b> strength can be increased up to nearly 3 times using the appropriate adhesive and FRP for aluminium tubular sections, whereas the web <b>crippling</b> strength can be increased up to 51 % and 76 % for ferritic and lean duplex stainless steel tubular sections, respectively. The finite element models for FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel tubular structural members subjected to web <b>crippling</b> were developed and calibrated against the experimental results. The debonding between FRP plate and aluminium or stainless steel tubes was carefully modelled using cohesive element. It is shown that the calibrated model closely predicted the web <b>crippling</b> strengths and failure modes of the tested specimens. An extensive parametric study included 212 web <b>crippling</b> specimens was carried out using the verified finite element models to examine the behaviour of strengthened aluminium and stainless steel tubular sections subjected to web <b>crippling.</b> Design equations are proposed to predict the web <b>crippling</b> strengths of FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel tubular sections based on the experimental and numerical results. The web <b>crippling</b> strengths obtained from the tests and numerical analysis were compared with the design strengths calculated using the proposed equations. The reliability of the proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
