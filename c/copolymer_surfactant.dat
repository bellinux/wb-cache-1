It was shown that the incompatibility between the growing polymer particles of poly(methyl methacrylate) and the hydrophobic segment of the block <b>copolymer</b> <b>surfactant</b> (polystyrene) affects both the kinetics of the emulsion polymerization and the resulting particle morphologies. Because of the incompatibility of the two polymers, phase separation occurs, and the particle morphology changes from roughly spherical core–shell to more irregular with particles containing clusters of block <b>copolymer</b> <b>surfactant</b> {{as the amount of}} block <b>copolymer</b> <b>surfactant</b> increases.

This enables efficient waveguiding in the line-patterned rhodamine 6 G-doped meso-structured domains, which have a higher refractive index than both the mesoporous support and cladding. For the structure-directing block <b>copolymer</b> <b>surfactants</b> used, (EO) 20 (PO) 70 (EO) 20 (P 123) and (EO) 106 (PO) 70 -(EO) 106 (F 127), X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy reveal hexagonal mesophases, whose longitudinal cylinder axes are aligned predominantly parallel to the substrate plane. For samples made by micromolding-in-capillaries (MIMIC), the longitudinal axes are also aligned along the longitudinal waveguide axes. Samples made by micromolding also possess a high mesostructural order, though {{in the absence of}} an aligning flow field, their long-range order (ca. several hundred nanometers) is lower than for samples processed using the MIMIC technique. When optically pumped, the rhodamine 6 G-doped waveguides exhibit amplified spontaneous emission with thresholds as low as 6 kW cm- 2, substantially lower than rhodamine 6 G-doped sol-gel glasses. This is attributed to the ability of the polymeric surfactant to co-assemble with the dye molecules, thereby leading to high dye dispersions and reduced dye dimerization.
