50|$|The biosphere, for its part, and in {{particular}} continental vegetation, which constitutes over 99% of the total biomass, has {{played a critical role}} in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the Earth's atmosphere, especially during the early evolution of the planet (See History of Earth for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of carbon with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of carbon fixation and carbon respiration), thereby playing a critical role in the carbon cycle. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in land cover and land use, contribute to the <b>current</b> <b>increase</b> in atmospheric carbon dioxide.|$|E

50|$|Using smaller plates {{helps to}} consume smaller portion sizes and {{this leads to}} the {{consumption}} of fewer calories. Studies have shown that portion size influences energy intake. People who are presented with larger portions do not report to have a higher level of satiety, which suggests that hunger and satiety signals are ignored when a large portion of food is placed in front of them. In particular, one study showed that participants consumed 31% less calories with the small portion sized of a 6-inch submarine sandwich compared with the large portion size of a 12-inch submarine sandwich.Increased portion sizes have occurred simultaneously with the increase in obesity rates; hence, large portion sizes {{can be one of the}} factors contributing to the <b>current</b> <b>increase</b> in body weight of the US.

50|$|A {{hot wire}} {{mass airflow sensor}} determines the mass of air flowing into the engine’s air intake system. The theory of {{operation}} of the hot wire mass airflow sensor {{is similar to that}} of the hot wire anemometer (which determines air velocity). This is achieved by heating a wire suspended in the engine’s air stream, like a toaster wire, with either a constant voltage over the wire or a constant current through the wire. The wire's electrical resistance increases as the wire’s temperature increases, which varies the electrical current flowing through the circuit, according to Ohm's law. When air flows past the wire, the wire cools, decreasing its resistance, which in turn allows more current to flow through the circuit, since the supply voltage is a constant. As more current flows, the wire’s temperature increases until the resistance reaches equilibrium again. The <b>current</b> <b>increase</b> or decrease is proportional to the mass of air flowing past the wire. The integrated electronic circuit converts the proportional measurement into a calibrated signal which is sent to the ECU.|$|E

30|$|Equation (5) {{shows that}} the ideality factor is {{inversely}} proportional to the temperature. The ideality factor significantly decreases with temperature only at low temperature and changes slowly when the temperature is over 300 [*]K [28, 29]. However, as shown in Table  1, the reverse saturation <b>current</b> <b>increases</b> significantly with the temperature which {{is different from the}} ideality factor. It can be explained by Eq. (2). According to Eq. (2), the reverse saturation <b>current</b> <b>increases</b> with temperature because T 2 and exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increase with temperature. Due to the exponential relationship between exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) and −[*]qΦB/kT, exp (−[*]qΦB/kT) increases significantly with temperature. Based on the research by Zhu et al [30], qΦB of the Au/Si contact in the experiment at 273 [*]K and 295 [*]K are 0.77 [*]eV and 0.79 [*]eV, respectively. The calculated results show that the reverse saturation current at 295 [*]K is six times as much as the reverse saturation current at 273 [*]K, explaining why the reverse saturation <b>current</b> <b>increases</b> significantly with temperature.|$|R
