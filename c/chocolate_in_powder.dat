40|$|The bioaccessible {{fractions}} of Al, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn and P <b>in</b> <b>chocolate</b> drink <b>powder</b> were estimated using an in vitro digestion method and spectrometric techniques. A three-step procedure {{was used as}} an in vitro digestion method, in which the digestive process occurring in the mouth, stomach and intestine are simulated with the preparation of synthetic digestive fluids. Mineralization assisted by microwave radiation was used for the treatment of the sample and the chyme (soluble portion) obtained in the in vitro digestion method, considering their high organic content. Aluminum, Ba, Cu, Mg, Mn and P were quantified by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, whereas Cd and Cr were quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Considering the total content of these elements <b>in</b> <b>chocolate</b> drink <b>powder,</b> the bioaccessible fractions found were 5 +/- 3 % for Al, 9 +/- 2 % for Ba, 13 +/- 3 % for Cd, 5 +/- 2 % for Cr, 29 +/- 4 % for Cu, 54 +/- 3 % for Mg, 11 +/- 3 % for Mn and 31 +/- 6 % for P. In general, elements that perform essential functions in the human organism presented higher bioaccessibility when compared with potentially toxic elements at trace levels...|$|R
50|$|It can be {{observed}} by pouring hot milk into a mug, stirring <b>in</b> <b>chocolate</b> <b>powder,</b> and tapping {{the bottom of the}} mug with a spoon while the milk is still in motion. The pitch of the taps will increase progressively with no relation to the speed or force of tapping. Subsequent stirring of the same solution (without adding more chocolate powder) will gradually decrease the pitch again, followed by another increase. This process can be repeated a number of times, until equilibrium has been reached.Upon initial stirring, entrained gas bubbles reduce the speed of sound in the liquid, lowering the frequency. As the bubbles clear, sound travels faster in the liquid and the frequency increases.|$|R
