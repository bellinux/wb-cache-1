25|$|On December 7, 2011, Blagojevich {{was sentenced}} to 14 years in prison. He was also given two other <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences</b> in {{addition}} to the 168-month sentence. Federal prison does not use parole; he must serve at least 85% of the 168-month sentence before becoming eligible to be given supervised release. On March 15, 2012, Blagojevich reported to a federal prison in Colorado to begin serving his sentence. The Federal Bureau of Prisons currently lists Blagojevich's expected release date from prison May 23, 2024.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1987, Layton {{was sentenced}} to <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences</b> of {{life in prison for}} [...] "aiding and abetting the murder of Congressman Leo Ryan", [...] "conspiracy to murder an internationally {{protected}} person, Richard Dwyer, Deputy Chief of Mission for the United States in the Republic of Guyana", as well as 15 years in prison on other related counts. At that time, he was eligible for parole in five years. On June 3, 1987, Layton's motion to set aside the conviction [...] "on the ground that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel during his second trial" [...] was denied by the United States District Court of the Northern District of California. After spending 18 years in prison, Layton was released from custody in April 2002.|$|E

2500|$|The jury {{rejected}} Gnango's evidence, and on 22 May 2008, he {{was convicted}} of the murder of Pniewska, the attempted murder of [...] "Bandana man" [...] and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. As the jury convicted Gnango of the attempted murder of [...] "Bandana man", they must have been sure that he intended to kill him. He was convicted of Pniewska's murder even though he did not fire the shot that killed her under the doctrine of joint enterprise; a verdict which the Crown Prosecution Service described as [...] "unprecedented". On 23 June 2008, at the Crown Court at St Albans, Mr Justice Cooke sentenced Gnango to detention for life for the murder of Pniewska with a minimum term of twenty years, and imposed <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences</b> of detention for public protection with a minimum term of twelve years for the attempted murder of [...] "Bandana man", and a minimum term of five years for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.|$|E
2500|$|The trial lasted {{two weeks}} and {{despite the efforts of}} his counsel James Chadwin QC, Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all counts and was sentenced to twenty <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences</b> of life imprisonment. The trial judge said Sutcliffe was beyond redemption, and hoped he would never leave prison. He {{recommended}} a minimum term of 30 years to be served before parole could be considered meaning Sutcliffe would have been unlikely to be freed until at least 2011. On 16 July 2010, the High Court issued Sutcliffe with a whole life tariff, meaning [...] he is unlikely ever to be released. The whole life tariff was introduced by the government in 1983, and over the next 20 years it was reported that Sutcliffe was among the small group of prisoners to have been issued with a whole life tariff. Politicians were stripped of their powers to set minimum terms for life sentence prisoners in November 2002, and the final say on how long a life sentence prisoner can serve has since rested with the High Court. When a list of 35 prisoners issued with whole life tariffs was made public by the Home Office in December 2006, Sutcliffe was not on the list.|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 2011, {{sentencing}} {{arguments were}} heard. The defense {{asked for the}} sentencing {{to be based on}} one count of lying {{on the grounds that the}} offenses occurred as part of a single interview with police dealing with the same matter, the disappearance of her daughter, as one continuous lie. The defense also argued for <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences,</b> that is for all four counts to become one count and the sentence to run together as one. The judge disagreed with defense arguments, finding that Anthony's statements consisted of [...] "four distinct, separate lies" [...] ordered the sentences be served consecutively, noting that [...] "Law enforcement expended a great deal of time, energy and manpower looking for Caylee Marie Anthony. This search went on from July through December, over several months, trying to find Caylee Marie Anthony." [...] Judge Perry sentenced Anthony to one year in the county jail and $1,000 in fines for each of the four counts of providing false information to a law enforcement officer, the maximum penalty prescribed by law. She received 1043 days credit for time served plus additional credit for good behavior, resulting in her release on July17, 2011. Anthony filed a notice of appeal on July 15, 2011.|$|E

50|$|Consecutive sentences: {{offences}} arise out of unrelated {{facts or}} incidents; offences {{that are of}} the same or similar kind but where the overall criminality will not sufficiently be reflected by concurrent sentences; one or more offence(s) qualifies for a statutory minimum sentence and <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentences</b> would improperly undermine that minimum.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether listeners keep spatial story representation created by speaker’s cohesive gestures beyond the <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentence.</b> Participants {{were presented with}} three-sentence discourse with two protagonists, {{in the first and}} second sentences, the gestures consistently assigned the two protagonists in either right or left of the gesture space. The third sentence (without gestures) referred to one of the protagonists, and the participants responded with one of the two keys to indicate the relevant protagonist. The response keys were either spatially congruent or incongruent with the gesturally established locations for the two participants. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that the performance in the congruent condition was better than that in the incongruent condition. Thus, listeners make a spatial story representation based on the gestures, and the spatial representation persists beyond the <b>concurrent</b> <b>sentence,</b> and the information is still activated in a subsequent sentence without a gesture...|$|R

50|$|Oregon v. Ice, 555 U.S. 160 (2009), was a {{legal case}} in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not inhibit states from {{assigning}} to judges, rather than juries, the finding of facts necessary to the imposition of consecutive, rather than <b>concurrent,</b> <b>sentences</b> for multiple offenses.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{hard and}} fast rule.

Proper weight must therefore be given to the exercise of the sentencing Judge's discretion.|$|E
