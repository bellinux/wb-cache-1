40|$|Using {{data from}} the Longitudinal Administrative Database (LAD), this paper compares the {{earnings}} replacement rates achieved in retirement by a sample of married and common-law couples in which the husband was aged 55 to 57 in 1991. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} outcomes experienced by couples in which one spouse or both spouses had registered pension plan (RPP) coverage and by <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> RPP coverage. The earnings replacement rates achieved by <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> RPP coverage are more widely dispersed than those of couples with RPP coverage. When compared at the mid-points of the pre-retirement earnings distributions, the median earnings replacement rates of <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> RPP coverage are about three to six percentage points lower than those of couples with RPP coverage. In contrast, the average earnings replacement rates of <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> RPP coverage are generally six to twelve percentage points higher than those of couples with RPP coverage.

5000|$|When {{considered}} {{separately from}} <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children, the United States traditional nuclear families appear {{to constitute a}} minority of households - with a rising prevalence of other family arrangements. In 2000, nuclear families with the original biological parents constituted roughly 24.10% of American households, compared with 40.30% in 1970. Roughly two-thirds of all children in the United States will spend at least some time in a single-parent household. According to some sociologists, [...] "nuclear family no longer seems adequate to cover the wide diversity of household arrangements we see today." [...] (Edwards 1991; Stacey 1996). A new term has been introduced, postmodern family, intended to describe the great variability in family forms, including single-parent families and <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> children." [...] Traditional nuclear family households are now less common compared to household with <b>couples</b> <b>without</b> children, single-parent families, and unmarried couples with children.|$|R
