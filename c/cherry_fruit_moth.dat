40|$|Abstract: The European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly, Rhagoletis cerasi (L.) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is {{a highly}} {{destructive}} pest. The low tolerance for damaged fruit requires preventive insecticide treatments for a marketable crop. The phase-out of old insecticides threatens cherry production throughout the European Union (EU). Consequently, new management techniques and tools are needed. With {{the increasing number of}} dwarf tree orchards covered against rain to avoid fruit splitting, crop netting has become a viable, cost-effective method of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control. Recently, a biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed for organic agriculture. However, for most situations, there is still a lack of efficient and environmentally sound insecticides to control this pest. This review summarizes the literature from over one hundred years of research on R. cerasi with focus on the biology and history of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control as well as on antagonists and potential biocontrol organisms. We will present the situation of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly regulation in different European countries, give recommendations for <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control, show gaps in knowledge and identify future research opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Bird cherry Padus avium Mill, Rosaceae, is {{widespread}} in Ukraine, especially in forests and foreststeppe areas. Bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> {{have long been}} used in medicine and is a valuable medicinal raw materials. They stated to posess astringent, anti-inflammatory, phytoncidal properties. Bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> {{are included in the}} USSR Pharmacopoeia IX ed., The State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation, The State Pharmacopoeia of Republic of Belarus. In Ukraine there are no contemporary normative documents for this medicinal plant material, therefore it is the actual to develop projects in the national monographs "dry bird cherry fruit" and "fresh bird cherry fruit" {{to be included in the}} State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. According to European Pharmacopoeia recommendation method of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is prescribed only for the identification of the herbal drug. The principles of thinlayer chromatography and application of the technique in pharmaceutical analysis are described in State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine. As it is effective and easy to perform, and the equipment required is inexpensive, the technique is frequently used for evaluating medicinal plant materials and their preparations. The TLC is aimed at elucidating the chromatogram of the drug with respect to selected reference compounds that are described for inclusion as reagents. Aim of this study was to develop methods of qualitative analysis of bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> for a monograph in the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine (SPU). Materials and Methods. The object of our study was dried bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> (7 samples) and fresh bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> (7 samples) harvested in 2013 - 2015 in Kharkiv, Poltava, Luhansk, Sumy, Lviv, Mykolaiv regions and the city Mariupol. Samples were registered in the department of SPU State Enterprise "Pharmacopeia center". In accordance with the Ph. Eur. and SPU requirements in "identification C" determination was performed by TLC. TLC was performed on glass-backed silica gel F 254 Merck plates, size 20 x 10 cm. Test solutions from samples of dried raw material were prepared by extraction of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol with ultrasound for 60 minutes at 50 º C. As mobile phase solvent mixture ethyl acetate - anhydrous acetic acid - formic acid - water ratio (100 : 10 : 10 : 25) was selected. For preparation the reference solution 1 mg chrysanthemin was dissolved in 10 mL of 1 % solution of hydrochloric acid in 95 % ethanol. Fresh bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> test solutions of the samples were crushed to mash (free of seeds), 10 mL of methanol was added and treated with ultrasound for 15 minutes. As mobile phase solvent mixture formic acid anhydrous-waterbutanol ratio (16 : 19 : 65) was selected. Two reference solutions were used. First was prepared from 2 mg chrysanthemum dissolved in 5 mL of methanol and second was Pharmacopoeial Reference Standard SPU of bird cherry extract dissolved in 0. 2 mL of methanol with ultrasound bath. Test solutions and the reference solutions were placed onto the chromatographic plates and placed into the chamber. When the chromatograms developed, the plates were taken out, then observed the spots in daylight. Results and discussion. In the chromatogram it was observed for all dry bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> samples two pink-red color zones, one of which coincided for Rf and color of chrysanthemin, and the other one was slightly lower. The chromatogram for all samples of fresh raw material showed two pinkish-violet zones, one of which had Rf and color corresponded chrysanthemin, and the second one was slightly lower. Compared with bird cherry extract, it was observed two pinkish-violet zones, coincided with Rf and color of bird cherry (SPU) extract zones. In accordance with the requirements of Ph. Eur. identification by TLC is obligatory. Division of anthocyanins of plant raw materials was observed sufficiently in our chosen solvent systems and methods of analysis that allows to recommend these systems and methods of analysis for inclusion in the relevant sections of monographs for bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit,</b> dried and fresh for SPU. Conclusion. It was confirmed the opportunity to include in the national monographs "Bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> fresh " and " Bird <b>cherry</b> <b>fruits</b> dry" in section "Identification C" analysis of anthocyanin by TLC in chosen systems and methods...|$|R
40|$|The genus Rhagoletis Loew {{includes}} about 65 known species {{distributed throughout}} Europe, Asia and America. Most species are oligophagous, attacking {{only a few}} closely related host plants. The European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly R. cerasi is the economically most important pest species in Europe. R. batava and R. alternata can also cause economic damage in Europe. In addition to these species, the American <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly species R. cingulata, R. indifferens and R. fausta, {{as well as the}} apple maggot R. pomonella, the blueberry maggot R. mendax, and the walnut infesting species R. completa and R. suavis are pest insects of high economic importance. R. cingulata and R. completa were recently introduced to Europe and are currently spreading in Central Europe. A lot of research was conducted on integrated control of the European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly R. cerasi during the past hundred years. For the monitoring of flight period of R. cerasi yellow sticky traps are used. This method was shown to give reliable results for the timing of application. However, an economic threshold cannot be determined with yellow sticky traps, because fruit infestation is also influenced by crop load and weather conditions during oviposition period of flies. Chemical control (Insecticides) of R. cerasi is currently impeded by the withdrawal of “old” organophoshporus compounds (Dimethoate) and the debate on side-effects of neonicotinoids. Attract-and-kill strategies are available or under development: food baits (based on yeast hydrolysate and sugar) are mixed with the organic insecticides Spinosad or Neem. The baits attract the flies, stimulate feeding and thus increase uptake of the insecticide. However, the efficacy of attract-and-kill strategies strongly depends on the attractiveness of the bait which is influenced by climate conditions. Mass trapping by yellow sticky traps combined with baits is used for <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control in home-gardens. However, due to the high number of traps needed to achieve good control, this strategy is too expensive for commercial production. The use of kaolin as mechanical barrier on the fruit surface to prevent oviposition was shown to be effective against R. indifferens and R. mendax. Because kaolin treatments leave white residues on fruit, this method is not used against <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly. Recently, it was shown that oil products can also prevent oviposition by creating a slippery layer on the fruit surface. A biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed and is currently registered in serveral European countries (product Naturalis-L). This strategy is mainly used in organic production. Another biocontrol strategy could be the use of parasitoids. However, the use of larval parasitoids is hampered by the steadily increasing <b>fruit</b> size of <b>cherries</b> for fresh consumption: parasitoids are no longer able to reach the larvae {{in the center of the}} <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit.</b> The use of crop netting to protect trees is the currently most widely used method of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control. With the increasing number of dwarf tree cherry orchards covered against rain to avoid fruit splitting, it has become a viable, cost-effective method of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly control. However, for high standard trees this method is not suitable. In this situation, the use of nets for soil covering (to avoid hatching of flies from overwintering pupae in the soil) can be used...|$|R
40|$|The <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly, Rhagoletis cerasi L., is {{the major}} pest of sweet {{cherries}} in Europe. Currently, no efficient control method is available {{and there is the}} risk of increasing population densities of this pest. Entomopathogenic nematodes caused high mortality of last instar maggots, when entering the soil for pupation, under laboratory and field conditions. First field applications of these biocontrol agents against pupating larvae in 2005 should test their efficacy to reduce pest densities. Accompanying field observa-tions were made to evaluate the degree of natural mortality of the <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly during the pupation phase in order to decide if the application of nematodes could substan-tially contribute to control this pest. According to the results in this year, natural mortal-ity factors reduced the <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> fly population from the period between larvae leav-ing the fruit until hatching of adults in the following year by 95 %. The emergence rate of adult flies in spring 2006 was low (10 flies/qm) and no significant differences in the densities of emerging flies in untreated and treated areas were detected. Thus, the effect of applying nematodes remained unclear and additional methods are needed to define their impact separately from natural mortality...|$|R
