50|$|The drug {{industry}} has {{made use of}} this discovery to produce medication for diabetes. Similar bacteria {{have been used to}} produce clotting factors to treat haemophilia, and human growth hormone to treat various forms of dwarfism. These recombinant proteins are safer than the products they replaced. Prior to recombinant protein products, several treatments were derived from cadavers or other donated body fluids and could transmit diseases. Indeed, transfusion of blood products had previously led to unintentional infection of haemophiliacs with HIV or hepatitis C; similarly, treatment with human growth hormone derived from <b>cadaver</b> <b>pituitary</b> glands may have led to outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.|$|E
50|$|Gemzell {{developed}} {{methods to}} extract the human growth hormone and human gonadotropins from <b>cadaver</b> <b>pituitary</b> glands. In 1958 Gemzell {{was the first to}} show that extracted gonadotropins containing FSH could be used as fertility medication to stimulate ovulation in women with anovulatory infertility. Ovulation stimulation using FSH medication became the basis of modern infertility therapy such as IVF. First pregnancies were achieved in 1961 and Gemzell recognized early that multiple pregnancy and the ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were major side effect of the therapy. Gemzellâ€™s pituitary gonadotropin preparation was soon replaced by FSH extracts from urine of postmenopausal women by a method that was developed by Piero Donini and later marketed as Pergonal. Decades later pituitary extractions were proven to be unsafe as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could be transmitted.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Iatrogenic {{transmission}} of human prion disease can occur through medical or surgical procedures, including injection of hormones such as gonadotropins extracted from <b>cadaver</b> <b>pituitaries.</b> Annually, more than 300, 000 {{women in the}} United States and Canada are prescribed urine-derived gonadotropins for infertility. Although menopausal urine donors are screened for symptomatic neurological disease, incubation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is impossible to exclude by non-invasive testing. Risk of carrier status of variant CJD (vCJD), a disease associated with decades-long peripheral incubation, {{is estimated to be}} on the order of 100 per million population in the United Kingdom. Studies showing infectious prions in the urine of experimental animals with and without renal disease suggest that prions could be present in asymptomatic urine donors. Several human fertility products are derived from donated urine; recently prion protein has been detected in preparations of human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a classical proteomic approach, 33 and 34 non-gonadotropin proteins were identified in urinary human chorionic gonadotropin (u-hCG) and highly-purified urinary human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG-HP) products, respectively. Prion protein was identified as a major contaminant in u-hCG preparations for the first time. An advanced prion protein targeted proteomic approach was subsequently used to conduct a survey of gonadotropin products; this approach detected human prion protein peptides in urine-derived injectable fertility products containing hCG, hMG and hMG-HP, but not in recombinant products. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of protease-sensitive prion protein in urinary-derived injectable fertility products containing hCG, hMG, and hMG-HP suggests that prions may co-purify in these products. Intramuscular injection is a relatively efficient route of {{transmission of}} human prion disease, and young women exposed to prions can be expected to survive an incubation period associated with a minimal inoculum. The risks of urine-derived fertility products could now outweigh their benefits, particularly considering the availability of recombinant products...|$|R
