It is therefore necessary to study the center of this legal internationalization based on the comparison of macro-principles of a universal type.

"Utilizing Wildlife Health to Conserve Biodiversity in the Appalachians and Beyond", celebrada en Knoxville, Tennessee (USA) del 27 de julio al 2 de agosto de 2013. Life history affects {{pathogen}} virulence, transmissibility {{and specificity}} {{as well as}} host defenses and life strategies, which can determine whether richer assemblages of hosts increases or decreases disease risk. We used the presence of pulmonary TB to measure species and <b>community</b> <b>competence</b> in 45 wild ungulate (1752 wild boar Sus scrofa, 1910 red deer Cervus elaphus, and 329 fallow deer Dama dama) and extensive cattle populations (1309 individuals) in Southern Spain, with species richness ranging from 1 to 4. We found a 49 % increase in <b>community</b> <b>competence</b> for TB in richer assemblages, and this was not attributable {{to changes in the}} abundance of the most competent hosts. While highlighting the benefit of a community-based approach to study infectious diseases, our findings illustrate that increases in biodiversity do not necessarily reduce disease risk. Much of the infection patterns of microparasites such as mycobacteria causing TB are determined by their ability to multiply directly within the host, regardless of the host life history traits, so a possible explanation is that a mass-action mode of transmission would benefit from increased niches offered by higher host diversity, resulting also in increased and more diverse networks of direct and indirect contacts (trophic relationships and host aggregation). These facts may apply specially for multi-host pathogens such as mycobacteria that also persist in the environment. We therefore must consider both natural variations in life histories of pathogens and host communities to characterize the impact of biodiversity conservation on human and animal health.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are to propose and explore a <b>competence</b> model for <b>community</b> interpreting, {{and to discuss}} {{implications}} of the model for accreditation of community interpreters in the UK. The thesis first focuses on selected approaches to translation competence and interpreting competence {{in order to show}} that translation and interpreting studies fail to offer foundations for a model of <b>community</b> interpreter <b>competence.</b> The deficiencies identified in these approaches concern mostly a prevailing tendency to discuss the question of competence in terms of components. This, in turn, seems to result in prescriptive views on competence in translation and interpreting studies. With a view to overcoming those deficiencies, the thesis discusses achievements of intercultural communication studies, arguing that scholarly contributions within this discipline are helpful in seeking theoretical foundations for a new model. Having shown the applicability of the model of intercultural communication competence to the current project, the thesis puts forward a model of <b>community</b> interpreter <b>competence.</b> Drawing on relevant assumptions, the proposed model postulates approaching the question of competence as a matter of subjective impressions governed by fulfilment of individual expectancies. This correspondence between competence impressions and expectancy fulfilment is claimed to constitute the decisive factor in the process of impression formation. For this reason, the assumptions and propositions of the model are used to derive a principle which describes the correspondence concerned. This principle is then tested through analysis of transcripts of interviews conducted with all three participants of interpreter-mediated encounters. The analysis successfully points to the correspondence between competence impressions and expectancy fulfilment. Finally, the thesis explores the conclusions and implications of the analysis by proposing enhancement to the framework of interpreter accreditation in the UK. The proposals aim to enrich the framework by widening the range of individuals, methods and sources used to assess a candidate's competence. This enrichment acknowledges the expectancy-based nature of impressions related to <b>community</b> interpreter <b>competence.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
