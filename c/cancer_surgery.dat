5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung cancer patients develop hoarseness because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery</b> in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of becoming {{a free agent after}} the 2007 season, but he resigned with the Roughriders by February 2008. Adams was challenged by Brent Curvey and Ronald Flemons in training camp, but he won the starting role for the 2008 season. Playing in 14 games, he made 11 tackles and two fumble recoveries. Adams missed a regular season game in July to visit his mother, who was undergoing <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery,</b> and he also spent time on the injured list due to a finger injury and sprained ankle. The Roughriders made the playoffs, but lost to the BC Lions 33–12 in the West Semi-Final.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has {{a higher risk of}} recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy at the margins of wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery.</b> VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hope of increasing cancer awareness, a goal he initially divulged to only his friend Douglas Alward.|$|E

25|$|A widely {{recognised}} {{method of}} estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer based on initial workup is the risk of malignancy index (RMI).

25|$|The {{onset of}} {{secondary}} lymphedema {{in patients who}} have had <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery</b> has also been linked to aircraft flight (likely due to decreased cabin pressure or relative immobility).

50|$|Robotic {{surgery in}} the field of urology has become very popular, {{especially}} in the United States.

40|$|Sepsis and {{septic shock}} are among {{mortality}} causes following major surgeries. The Charlson co-morbidity index consists of 19 weighted categories related to chronic health which measures {{the burden of}} co-morbidity. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence of postoperative sepsis in patients underwent gynecological and gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>surgeries</b> and predictive role of Charlson index for this situation. Two hundred and twenty-two patients who underwent gynecological and gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>surgeries</b> were evaluated. Sixty-four (28. 6 %) patients developed SIRS postoperatively. Forty-four (19. 7 %) patients developed sepsis postoperatively. Mean age, duration of hospitalization and surgery, the Charlson score were significantly higher in patients who developed sepsis than other cases. Blood transfusion and Charlson score were independent predictors of sepsis occurrence. Charlson co-morbidity index is a predictive factor for developing postoperative sepsis. </div...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{identify}} {{the length of}} perioperative fasting among patients submitted to gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>surgeries.</b> METHOD Retrospective cohort study, developed by consulting the medical records of 128 patients submitted to gastrointestinal <b>cancer</b> <b>surgeries.</b> RESULTS The mean of total length of fasting was 107. 6 hours. The total length of fasting {{was significantly associated with}} the number of symptoms presented before (p= 0. 000) and after the surgery (p= 0. 007), the length of hospital stay (p= 0. 000), blood transfusion (p= 0. 013), nasogastric tube (p= 0. 001) and nasojejunal tube (p= 0, 003), postoperative admission at ICU (p= 0. 002), postoperative death (p= 0. 000) and length of preoperative fasting (p= 0. 000). CONCLUSION The length of fasting is associated with complications that affect the quality of the patients’ postoperative recovery and nurses’ work. The nursing team should be alert to this aspect and being responsible for overseeing the patients’ interest, should not permit the unnecessary extension of fasting...|$|R

25|$|Radiation {{treatment}} is mainly {{effective in reducing}} the risk of local relapse in the affected breast. Therefore, it is recommended in most cases of breast conserving surgeries and less frequently after mastectomy. Indications for radiation treatment are constantly evolving. Patients treated in Europe have been more likely in the past to be recommended adjuvant radiation after breast <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery</b> as compared to patients in North America. Radiation therapy is usually recommended for all patients who had lumpectomy, quadrant-resection. Radiation therapy is usually not indicated in patients with advanced (stage IV disease) except for palliation of symptoms like bone pain or fungating lesions.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{surgical}} procedures for cancer include mastectomy for breast cancer, prostatectomy for prostate cancer, and lung <b>cancer</b> <b>surgery</b> for non-small cell lung cancer. The {{goal of the}} surgery can be either the removal of only the tumor, or the entire organ. A single cancer cell is invisible {{to the naked eye}} but can regrow into a new tumor, a process called recurrence. For this reason, the pathologist will examine the surgical specimen to determine if a margin of healthy tissue is present, thus decreasing the chance that microscopic cancer cells are left in the patient.|$|E
