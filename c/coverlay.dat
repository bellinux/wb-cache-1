40|$|Four flex {{circuits}} were tested. They are categorized as: (1) Litchfield narrow; (2) Litchfield wide; (3) Cirexx wide; and (4) Speedy Circuit green. The {{cross sectional}} area of copper was calculated from trace resistance measurements. All the flex circuits had an acceptable amount of copper cross section. about 6 e- 8 m{sup 2 } for all except the Cirexx flex which had 4. 5 e- 8 m{sup 2 }. The thickness of the ribbons was 0. 006 -inch for the Litchfield and about 0. 004 -inch for the Cirexx and Speed circuit. The room temperature resistivity ratio (RRR) {{was measured to be}} 15 for all the circuits. This was expected and means that the trace material resistivity at helium temperatures is 1 / 15 th of what it is at room temperature. This is good from the standpoint of thermal heat load. Purer copper, with an RRR > 30 would result in an unacceptable heat load. The cryogenic cycling and bending tests to liquid nitrogen proved that both the Cirexx wide and Speedy circuit green were made of acceptable materials. Both Litchfield flex circuits had significant cracking of the <b>coverlay</b> when bent at cold temperatures and are not acceptable. The Litchfield narrow was in bad physical condition to start with and got worse through the testing with many more crazing cracks appearing. The crazing is bad enough that the <b>coverlay</b> began to peel and expose the copper beneath. This candidate is unacceptable. The Litchfield wide started out testing in good condition with no cracks. It ended up with much crazing in the <b>coverlay.</b> Within 1 mm of the edge of the <b>coverlay</b> at the cold end. the copper traces were bulged away from the base material. Traces became nadhered and lifted off of the base material at the ends where the <b>coverlay</b> was not present. Numerous electrical opens (7 out of 24 checked) were found {{at the end of the}} testing. Visual inspection of the opens leaves open the possibility that the traces are broken below the <b>coverlay</b> in the cold bend area. Obviously this candidate is unacceptable. The Cirexx wide was a mechanical sample with no promises made about it's electrical integrity, however of the traces checked all were fine after the brutal testing. This flex circuit appears suitable for the intended cryogenic and mechanical environment. The Speedy circuit came out as acceptable in the testing also. The material remained flexible at cryogenic temperatures. 2 out of 24 traces were found open after the testing, but this was a mechanical sample and those traces were not checked beforehand so it is unknown if the testing caused the opens or they were there at the start. This sample was not presented as having final product electrical characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{topics are}} {{presented}} in viewgraph form and include the following: function of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) Flat Collector Circuit (FCC); requirements of the FCC which affect {{the selection of the}} insulation material; data to support the selection of the FCC insulation material; development history; modified design; <b>coverlay</b> testing; effects on modified design on FCC; arc tracking tests performed on FCC; and arc tracking test results...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} microstrip gas counters manufactured on standard {{printed circuit board}} and having the following features: resistive cathode strips, thin (10 micron) metallic anode strips and electrodes protected against surface discharges by a <b>Coverlay</b> layer at their edges. These features allow the detector to operate at gas gains as high as can be achieve with the best microstrip gas counters manufactured on glass substrates. We believe that after further developments this type of detectors can compete in some applications with other micropattern detectors, for example MICROMEGAS.
