5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept <b>costume</b> designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black <b>costume.</b> Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs. To create Spider-Man's <b>costume,</b> Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the <b>costume,</b> was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

30|$|Alexander (2014) {{also studied}} Halloween <b>costumes</b> and {{performed}} a {{content analysis of}} men’s <b>costumes.</b> Although she did not contrast men’s and women’s <b>costumes,</b> she did code men’s <b>costumes</b> according to how sexualized they were. <b>Costumes</b> were classified as sexualized if they were skimpy and revealed muscularity; only 4  % of the <b>costumes</b> were so classified. While specific information was not provided, Alexander may have based her coding {{on the extent to}} which the <b>costumes</b> revealed the body. The existing research demonstrates a gap in the literature on Halloween <b>costumes,</b> namely, the lack of work focusing on gender-differentiated revealing nature of adult <b>costumes.</b> If women’s Halloween <b>costumes</b> are more revealing than men’s and since the presence of revealing dress is a way to assess SO in the media, it follows that women’s Halloween <b>costumes</b> are potentially sexually objectifying.|$|R

50|$|Several {{companies}} {{were involved in}} the merchandising of the film. Rubies <b>Costumes</b> produced both child and adult <b>costumes.</b> Because such <b>costumes</b> are sold to retailers months in advance, the Halloween <b>costumes</b> came out in 2009 since the film being pushed back to 2010 happened after the <b>costumes</b> had been shipped to retailers.|$|R

30|$|In Study 1 {{we found}} {{evidence}} that Halloween <b>costumes</b> are gendered {{in terms of their}} revealing nature, such that women’s <b>costumes</b> are more revealing than men’s <b>costumes.</b> In Study 2, we extend the research on revealing dress in two ways. First, we examine whether a revealing dress manipulation in the context of women’s Halloween <b>costumes</b> causes observers to sexually objectify (i.e., judge the <b>costumed</b> women in terms of their sexual appeal). Second, we examine sex differences in judging the <b>costumed</b> women in terms of their sexual appeal.|$|R

5|$|Rodis's input in {{developing}} the early character and <b>costume</b> designs was significant. Shatner praised his <b>costume</b> designs as being futuristic but plausible and {{in keeping with the}} continuity established in previous Star Trek films. After being disappointed by the <b>costume</b> designers approached to realize Rodis' ideas, Shatner suggested that Rodis become the <b>costume</b> designer as well. Bennett hired Dodie Shepard as the <b>costume</b> supervisor; Shepard's role was to oversee the <b>costume</b> fabrication and keep track of the clothes during filming. To save on costs, Shepard clothed extras with existing items from Western Costume's warehouses. The constrained budget meant Shatner could not completely redesign the Starfleet uniforms, but Rodis created new brown field uniforms for the film's location scenes as well as the leisure clothes the crew wears during shore leave.|$|E

5|$|To promote Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, special retailer-exclusive <b>costume</b> packs were {{available}} as pre-order bonuses.

5|$|An {{anthropomorphic}} cougar named Ozzie was the team's mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie {{came from}} the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team, which had an extra mascot <b>costume.</b> The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, team management decided to make him the permanent mascot. The original Ozzie <b>costume</b> was brown, but a new yellow <b>costume</b> was introduced in 1998. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season.|$|E
30|$|Results of {{the content}} {{analysis}} found that the <b>costumes</b> were gendered in terms of two aspects of their revealing nature (tightness {{and the extent to}} which they uncover the body). Like Nelson’s (2000) research that found gender differences in children’s Halloween <b>costumes,</b> our results found gender differences in adult Halloween <b>costumes.</b> So even though our study and Nelson’s focused on different aspects of gender differences, the results are consistent in finding gender differences in the <b>costumes.</b> Furthermore, in our study raters tended to agree that women’s <b>costumes</b> were revealing and that men’s <b>costumes</b> were non-revealing. This finding is consistent with Alexander’s (2014) research which also found that men’s Halloween <b>costumes</b> tended not to be revealing.|$|R
