5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder <b>clearance</b> <b>rate</b> in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, a woman is found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E

Research testing the effectiveness of focused enforcement upon minor offenses and "uncivil" behaviors, however, has been inconclusive. There has been no study which has addressed broken windows enforcement as an explanatory factor for <b>clearance</b> <b>rates.</b> Most previous research on <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> were completed {{more than two decades}} ago, well before the implementation of structured broken windows enforcement. Utilizing official crime data for the thirty-five largest municipal police agencies in Texas from 1990 through 2004, this research examined the relationship between broken windows enforcement and <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> for UCR Part I offenses. Using hierarchical multivariate linear modeling (HMLM) analysis to capitalize upon the longitudinal characteristics of the data allowed examination of the influence of broken windows enforcement across a wide spectrum of agencies over a long time period. Broken windows enforcement showed inconsistent results across the different crime types. Broken windows enforcement had a positive impact on the <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> for burglaries and a marginal impact on auto theft <b>clearance</b> <b>rates.</b> In the case of larceny clearance, greater levels of broken windows arrests actually had a negative relationship. For all of the offense categories, the number of sworn officers was negatively related to the <b>clearance</b> <b>rates.</b> Crime per officer measures showed negative significant effect on the <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> for the property offense categories. ...|$|R
40|$|Benthic filter feeders are {{important}} organisms in estuaries {{due to their}} ability to remove algal and non-algal particulate matter from the water column. Microcystin (MC) is a cyanotoxin that is known to have adverse effects on diverse consumers, though its effects on benthic filter-feeders are not well-studied. In this study, we examine the effects of microcystin on the filtering activities of Rangia cuneata, a common and often dominant filter-feeder in tidal freshwaters. Clams and seston obtained from the James River were used along with commercially-available microcystin to measure <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> of Rangia across a gradient of dissolved microcystin concentrations. We also compared <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> of James River clams to natural food sources in the presence and absence of microcystin. Our results show that dissolved microcystin inhibited Rangia <b>clearance</b> <b>rates.</b> Even at the lowest concentration tested (0. 40 μg MC L- 1) <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> were significantly lower than controls. Dietary experiments showed that when elevated microcystin was present in the James (September), <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> were lower for clams fed James River seston relative to clams fed seston from another source.

40|$|Embezzlement is {{a highly}} {{disruptive}} crime {{that comes with a}} large negative societal impact. This study was a secondary data analysis of embezzlement data from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for the years 2012 - 2013. <b>Clearance</b> <b>rates</b> were calculated and analyzed for general fraud related calls for service and for embezzlement cases specifically in order to determine what <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> were for the Las Vegas Valley and see if they are comparable to the national average. Data was analyzed within pie and bar charts to determine if the LVMPD is effectively solving embezzlement cases and see if cases with particular characteristics {{are more likely to be}} solved, and theoretically deterred by the police. The main findings were that the police have achieved higher <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> for misdemeanor cases when compared to felony cases. Additionally, the police have achieved the highest <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> for embezzlement cases taking place within the context of a retail business/grocery when compared to cases taking place in offices, monetary establishments, and restaurant/bars. Embezzlement cases taking place within the context of offices had the lowest <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> associated with them, and theoretically had the least deterrent effect. The number of fraud-related calls for service from 2006 - 2013 suggest a link to the economic recession with a peak in 2008.

Among women who did not clear hrHPV, women with HPV 16 persistence displayed an increased detection rate of ⩾CIN 3 (normal P< 0. 0001; BMD, P= 0. 005). The type-specific differences in <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> indicate the potential value of hrHPV genotyping in screening programs. Our data support close surveillance (i. e. referral directly, or within 6 months) of women with HPV 16 and are inconclusive for surveillance of women with HPV 18, HPV 31, and HPV 33. For the other hrHPV-positive women, it seems advisable to adopt a conservative management with a long waiting period, as hrHPV clearance is markedly higher after 18 months than after 6 months and the risk for ⩾CIN 3 is low...|$|R

Understanding the factors influencing the rates of these two processes is essential for maximizing the useful lifespan of drugs and, therefore, effective disease control. For malaria parasites, artemisinin-based drugs are the frontline weapons {{in the fight against}} disease, but reports from the field of slower parasite <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> during drug treatment are generating concern that the useful lifespan of these drugs may be limited. Whether slower <b>clearance</b> <b>rates</b> represent true resistance, and how this provides a selective advantage for parasites is uncertain.
