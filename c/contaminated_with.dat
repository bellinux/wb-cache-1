Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> SV40; {{it has been estimated that}} 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> SV40. Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated; meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives to {{investigate}} the efficacy of levofloxacin {{in the prevention of}} vascular prosthetic graft infection in a rat model. Methods graft infections were established in the subcutaneous tissue of 225 male Wistar rats by implantation of Dacron prostheses followed by topical inoculation with methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistantS. epidermidis. The study included a group without contamination, two contaminated groups without prophylaxis, two <b>contaminated</b> groups <b>with</b> intraperitoneal levofloxacin prophylaxis, two <b>contaminated</b> groups <b>with</b> intraperitoneal cefazolin prophylaxis, two <b>contaminated</b> groups <b>with</b> intraperitoneal teicoplanin prophylaxis and six <b>contaminated</b> groups <b>with</b> rifampin-soaked graft and intraperitoneal levofloxacin, cefazolin or teicoplanin prophylaxis. The grafts were removed after 7 days and evaluated by quantitative culture. Results the efficacy of levofloxacin against the methicillin-susceptible strain was not different to that of cefazolin or teicoplanin. Levofloxacin showed slight less efficacy than teicoplanin against the methicillin-resistant strain. The combination levofloxacin-rifampin demonstrated to be similarly effective to the combination rifampin-teicoplanin and more effective than the combination rifampin-cefazolin against both strains. Conclusions rifampin-levofloxacin combination seems useful for the prevention of late-appearing vascular graft infections caused by S. epidermidis...|$|R

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> lead.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E

Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>with</b> polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food.

50|$|Diets {{that are}} low in vegetables, fruits and whole grains, and high in {{processed}} or red meats are linked {{with a number of}} cancers. A high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer, aflatoxin B1, a frequent food <b>contaminate,</b> <b>with</b> liver cancer, and Betel nut chewing with oral cancer. This may partly explain differences in cancer incidence in different countries. For example, gastric cancer is more common in Japan due to its high-salt diet and colon cancer is more common in the United States. Immigrants develop the risk of their new country, often within one generation, suggesting a substantial link between diet and cancer.|$|R
