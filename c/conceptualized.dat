5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a <b>conceptualized</b> 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized {{could be a}} more direct successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in the visible, ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope. This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.|$|E

5|$|Production of {{the song}} was a {{collaborative}} effort between Jackson, David Foster and Bill Bottrell. Andrae Crouch's Choir and Jackson engage in a back and forth chant as the song reaches its climactic finale. Jackson's intent {{was to create a}} song that was lyrically deep yet melodically simple, so the whole world, particularly non-English-speaking fans, could sing along. He <b>conceptualized</b> a song that had an emotional message.|$|E
5|$|The ocean can be <b>conceptualized</b> {{as being}} divided into various zones, {{depending}} on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into organic carbon, which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce organic carbon.|$|E
5|$|Vaan was <b>conceptualized</b> as {{the main}} {{character}} for Final Fantasy XII in order to contrast the older hero from Square's previous title Vagrant Story {{as a result of}} negative feedback received by fans. Critical reception to Vaan's character has been mixed {{as a result of his}} lack of involvement with the Final Fantasy XIIs plot although various video game publications still found him likable.|$|E

5|$|A {{large portion}} of the field surveys and {{research}} conducted with regards to threatened and endangered species in Michigan is undertaken by the Michigan Natural Features Inventory (MNFI) program. The MNFI program was originally developed in 1980 as part of the state natural heritage programs <b>conceptualized</b> by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), through which it received its first funding. The MNFI program severed relations with TNC in 2000, and became a program of the Michigan State University Extension Services.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was <b>conceptualized</b> after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|David was <b>conceptualized</b> as a {{character}} to provide a non-human perspective for the theme of meeting one's creators in Prometheus, with him representing the next generation {{in a line of}} creators who finds himself disillusioned by his predecessors. Fassbender, who was director Ridley Scott's first choice for the role, helped fashion the character to share traits with T. E. Lawrence, who was a source of inspiration as a control freak caught between two cultures- the cultures being humanity and synthetics, in David's case. As the series progresses, David's behaviors and motivations evolve from a mysterious agent with ambiguous motivations to {{a character}} directly opposing the well-being of humanity.|$|E
40|$|Why {{do people}} gesture when they speak? The reasons {{are not entirely}} clear. This paper tests two {{hypotheses}} {{about the role of}} gesture in speech production: the Lexical Access Hypothesis, which holds that gesturing aids in lexical access, and the Information Packaging Hypothesis, which holds that gesturing aids in conceptualization. Participants were asked to describe dot patterns that were either easy or difficult to <b>conceptualize</b> in terms of geometric shapes. Patterns that were more difficult to <b>conceptualize</b> elicited more gesture than the patterns that were easier to <b>conceptualize.</b> This result supports the Information Packaging Hypothesis...|$|R
50|$|Counterfactual {{thinking}} {{is the ability}} to <b>conceptualize</b> alternative outcomes to the same situation. Studies support that children between 4 and 6 years of age are better capable of <b>conceptualizing</b> alternative outcomes when the situation is unrealistic or is set in a pretend context. Children also perform better when the situation presented is open ended. When the situation already has an outcome, the child finds it difficult to <b>conceptualize</b> an alternative. A similar factor between counterfactual reasoning and pretend play is that they both deal with situations that divert from actual events.|$|R
40|$|Exceptions play an {{important}} role in <b>conceptualizing</b> data, especially when new knowledge is introduced or existing knowledge changes. Furthermore, real-world data often is contradictory and uncertain. Current formalisms for <b>conceptualizing</b> data like Description Logics rely upon first-order logic. As a consequence, they are poor in addressing exceptional, inconsistent and uncertain data, in particular when evolving the knowledge base over time. This paper investigates the use of Probabilistic Description Logics as a formalism for the evolution of ontologies that <b>conceptualize</b> real-world data. Different scenarios are presented for the automatic handling of inconsistencies during ontology evolution...|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2014. The game was {{directed}} by Mark Pacini, written by Joseph Staten and <b>conceptualized</b> by Keiji Inafune. Mega Man and Metroid were significant influences in its creation. The development was divided between Armature Studio and Comcept into their own distinctive proficiencies, while Asobo Studio assisted. ReCore received mixed reviews, the most critical of which noted insufficient design choices, technical issues regarding lengthy and unsuccessful loading screens – later redressed – and repetitive combat. Praise was overall focused on the story, platforming and controls.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always <b>conceptualized</b> video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} fulfill his ambition. Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} crises and global events, We Don't Need to Whisper was <b>conceptualized</b> as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and created {{his own home}} studio. He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of Box Car Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from his relatives and family.|$|E

5|$|Myst was {{originally}} <b>conceptualized</b> by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. The Millers had created fictional worlds and stories as young children, {{influenced by the}} works of authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert A. Heinlein, and Isaac Asimov. They formed a video game company together called Cyan, Inc.; their first game, called The Manhole, won the Software Publishers Association award in 1988 for best use of the digital medium. Cyan produced other games, aimed at children; the Millers eventually decided their next project would be made for adults.|$|E
5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper <b>conceptualized</b> a {{gardening}} {{game for}} the handheld Pocket PC platform in 2002. A three-person team began work on a simple prototype while the company was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving as}} {{director}} of CCMB during the end of 20th century, Singh realized an urgent need for assessment and conservation of the wildlife resources of India. To address that need, he <b>conceptualized</b> the Laboratory for conservation of endangered species (LaCONES) in 1998. The foundation stone of this laboratory was laid by the Minister of Environment and Forests, Government of India on 16September 2001. On 2February 2007, the laboratory was inaugurated and dedicated to the nation by then President of India A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.|$|E

5|$|Executive {{producer}} Hironobu Sakaguchi {{stated that}} {{the idea for the}} game first came up in February 1997. The original idea for Brave Fencer Musashi was having Miyamoto Musashi fighting in an alternate world from where he belonged. While the game <b>conceptualized</b> as an action oriented, Musashi was originally meant to be a wanderer. However, he was later changed to an itinerant Samaritan in order to have him interacting and helping other characters. During development, the team used an action base which was crucial to the game's fighting mechanics. Director Yoichi Yoshimoto was focused on the game's fully polygonal aspects that were a departure from Square's previous works. The development team prioritized the movement of polygons in real time and how light affected their appearance.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should have a minimum number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are <b>conceptualized</b> early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing <b>conceptualized</b> an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the {{introduction}} of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} I {{synthesize}} {{the skills and}} knowledge I gained through a clinical practicum at Touchstone Family Association. I present two metaphors to <b>conceptualize</b> therapeutic change. The first model <b>conceptualizes</b> the therapeutic process as a geography introduced by the client to the counsellor. The second model <b>conceptualizes</b> the relationship between thought, emotion, and behaviour as a framework to help me visualize the client as they move towards change. These reflections are supported by a literature that finds that positive therapeutic outcomes are attributed to context and relationship. [...] Leaf iii.
