5|$|Broaching is {{used when}} {{precision}} machining is required, especially for odd shapes. Commonly machined surfaces include circular and non-circular holes, splines, keyways, and flat surfaces. Typical workpieces include small to medium-sized castings, forgings, screw machine parts, and stampings. Even though broaches <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive,</b> broaching is usually favored over other processes when used for high-quantity production runs.|$|E
5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People must remember {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need {{to keep track of}} multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and records management is common, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive.</b> During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of concurrent use registration is not commonly invoked, even where the applicant might stand {{an excellent chance}} of demonstrating the existence of geographically distinct markets. Proceedings before the TTAB, like proceedings before any court, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> and time-consuming. A contested concurrent use proceeding may last {{for two or three}} years before the resolution of a claim, and the outcome will remain uncertain until the end. The outcome of the proceeding will then be subject to an appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or to a collateral challenge in a United States District Court.|$|E

The prices vary widely; for example, [...] cost only $91,000 to license while Kurau Phantom Memory cost $960,000. Simulcast Internet streaming rights <b>can</b> <b>be</b> less <b>expensive,</b> with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode, but <b>can</b> also <b>be</b> more <b>expensive,</b> with some series costing more than [...] per episode.|$|R

25|$|A {{more fully}} Bayesian {{approach}} to parameters {{is to treat}} parameters as additional unobserved variables and to compute a full posterior distribution over all nodes conditional upon observed data, then to integrate out the parameters. This approach <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> and lead to large dimension models, so in practice classical parameter-setting approaches are more common.|$|E

25|$|The same {{argument}} applies when hardware {{of this type}} uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.|$|E
25|$|Phosphorus removal {{can also}} be {{achieved}} by chemical precipitation, usually with salts of iron (e.g. ferric chloride), aluminum (e.g. alum), or lime. This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive.</b> Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal. Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular laterite.|$|E
25|$|Physically {{powerful}} batsmen often {{attempt to}} strike {{the ball on the}} rise, even though this obstructs their vision of the ball since it is not uncommon that their sheer brute force combined with the speed of the ball will cause it to fly to the boundary. This possibility, combined with the difficulty that the wicketkeeper will have trying to stop a high ball means that bouncers <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> in terms of runs against skilled batsmen.|$|E

The disposal of bricks in these often highly irregular raking patterns can be a challenging task for the bricklayer to correctly maintain while constructing a wall whose courses are partially obscured by scaffold, and interrupted by door or window openings, or other bond-disrupting obstacles. If the bricklayer frequently stops to check that bricks are correctly arranged, then masonry in a raking monk bond <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> to build.|$|E
25|$|By 2003, {{overfishing}} {{had occurred}} on 60 stocks. Another 232 stocks were not overfished. Overfishing had been stopped on 31 stocks, and a gain {{was made of}} 13 stocks that had been fully rebuilt. There were 617 other stocks which have limited data or for which criteria for overfishing had not been defined. These stocks mostly have harvests which are not significant, so they are not allocated research funding. Their assessment <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> {{and there is no}} evidence of overfishing. Rebuilding strategies are operating or are being developed for most stocks which are overfished.|$|E
25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly {{as might be expected}} in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never so much as a Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E

25|$|The third {{step from}} {{political}} economy to economics was {{the introduction of}} marginalism and the proposition that economic actors made decisions based on margins. For example, a person decides to buy a second sandwich based on how full {{he or she is}} after the first one, a firm hires a new employee based on the expected increase in profits the employee will bring. This differs from the aggregate decision making of classical political economy in that it explains how vital goods such as water can be cheap, while luxuries <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pressure ulcers {{can trigger}} other ailments, cause {{considerable}} suffering, and <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> to treat. Some complications include autonomic dysreflexia, bladder distension, bone infection, pyarthroses, sepsis, amyloidosis, anemia, urethral fistula, gangrene and very rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin's ulcer - secondary carcinomas in chronic wounds). Sores may recur if those with pressure ulcers {{do not follow}} recommended treatment or may instead develop seromas, hematomas, infections, or wound dehiscence. Paralyzed individuals {{are the most likely}} to have pressure sores recur. In some cases, complications from pressure sores can be life-threatening. The most common causes of fatality stem from kidney failure and amyloidosis.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a suitable quantity of feedstock, the price spread between the value of alkylate product and alternate feedstock disposition value must {{be large enough to}} justify the installation. Alternative outlets for refinery alklylation feedstocks include sales as LPG, blending of C4 streams directly into gasoline and feedstocks for chemical plants. Local market conditions vary widely between plants. Variation in the RVP specification for gasoline between countries and between seasons dramatically impacts the amount of butane streams that can be blended directly into gasoline. The transportation of specific types of LPG streams <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>expensive</b> so local disparities in economic conditions are often not fully mitigated by cross market movements of alkylation feedstocks.|$|E
