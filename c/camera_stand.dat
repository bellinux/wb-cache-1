40|$|The task of {{assembling}} {{drawings and}} backgrounds together for each frame of an animated sequence {{has always been}} a tedious undertaking using conventional animation <b>camera</b> <b>stands</b> and has contributed to the high cost of animation production. In addition, the physical limitations that these <b>camera</b> <b>stands</b> place on the manipulation of the individual artwork levels restricts the total image-making possibilities afforded by traditional cartoon animation. Documents containing all frame assembly information must also be maintained. This paper presents several production of cartoon animation, overall quality. computer methods for assisting in the both to reduce expense and to improve the Merging is the process of combining levels of artwork into a final composite frame using digital computer graphics. The term "level " refers to a single painted drawing (cel) or background. A method for the simulation of any hypothetical animation camera set-up is introduced. A technique is presented for reducing the total number of merges by retaining merged groups consisting of individual levels which do not change over successive frames. Lastly, a sequence-editing system which controls precise definition of an animated sequence, is described. Also discussed is the actual method for merging any two adjacent levels and several computational and storage optimizations to speed the process...|$|R

[...] In Seven Days (1974), for example, the motion of the camera, which is mounted on a motorized <b>camera</b> <b>stand,</b> followed the rotation of the earth while the in-camera editing responded to cloud cover governed by North Atlantic weather systems.

50|$|With {{the urging}} by actor Sterling Hayden {{who had been}} a master of tall ships in his youth, daSilva {{released}} his critically acclaimed film adaptation of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner in 1975. For the film, he used the technique of photoanimation, a technology that he learned at the Jam Handy Organization’s animation department. This allowed him to inexpensively bring to the screen the efforts of illustrators from the 19th and 20th centuries who sought to breathe life into the timeless epic poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. After some research he discovered that British actor Sir Michael Redgrave had once taught the epic poem as a schoolmaster. After contracting the actor daSilva flew to London to have Redgrave narrate the epic poem. With over two years in production, the film demonstrated the most complex work in existence today on the craft of photoanimation due to the mixed combination of movements and exposures between the vertical camera and the compass rose movements of the <b>camera</b> <b>stand</b> compound or platform where the graphic material is placed. With the craft becoming computer driven the complexity used at that time is no longer possible today, similarly, as stated by Pixar/Disney's creative genius, John Lasseter who has said that the subtle and complex character renderings of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs can not be done using a computer but must be rendered by hand.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} a portable desk and <b>camera</b> <b>stand.</b> Portable desk main function is it can place the biomechanics equipment into it.

For the <b>camera</b> <b>stand,</b> it mainly function is to attach the high speed camera from top view. Tripod camera that have been sell in market can be a <b>camera</b> <b>stand</b> that can take a picture from bottom and front view. The material that have been used to fabricating the portable desk is mild steel while material used to fabricating the <b>camera</b> <b>stand</b> is aluminum. The portable desk have wheel so that the portable desk can be brought anywhere easily. The process that involved to fabricating both portable desk and <b>camera</b> <b>stand</b> is welding, drilling, grinding, cutting and riveting.

An automatic understanding of these videos is not an easy task, and its mobile nature implies important challenges to be faced, such as the changing light conditions and the unrestricted locations recorded. This paper proposes an unsupervised strategy based on global features and manifold learning to endow wearable cameras with contextual information regarding the light conditions and the location captured. Results show that non-linear manifold methods can capture contextual patterns from global features without compromising large computational resources. The proposed strategy is used, as an application case, as a switching mechanism to improve the hand-detection problem in egocentric videos...|$|R
