40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating occurrence rates of rare events for extremely sparse data, using pre-existing hierarchies to perform inference at multiple resolutions. In particular, {{we focus on the}} problem of estimating <b>click</b> <b>rates</b> for (webpage, advertisement) pairs (called impressions) where both the pages and the ads are classified into hierarchies that capture broad contextual information at different levels of granularity. Typically the <b>click</b> <b>rates</b> are low and the coverage of the hierarchies is sparse. To overcome these difficulties we devise a sampling method whereby we analyze a specially chosen sample of pages in the training set, and then estimate <b>click</b> <b>rates</b> using a two-stage model. The first stage imputes the number of (webpage, ad) pairs at all resolutions of the hierarchy to adjust for the sampling bias. The second stage estimates <b>click</b> <b>rates</b> at all resolutions after incorporating correlations among sibling nodes through a tree-structured Markov model. Both models are scalable and suited to large scale data mining applications. On a real-world dataset consisting of 1 / 2 billion impressions, we demonstrate that even with 95 % negative (non-clicked) events in the training set, our method can effectively discriminate extremely rare events in terms of their click propensity...|$|R

40|$|Toothed whales echolocating in {{the wild}} {{generate}} clicks with low repetition rates to locate prey but then produce rapid sequences of clicks, called buzzes, when attempting to capture prey. However, {{little is known about}} the factors that determine <b>clicking</b> <b>rates</b> or how prey type and behaviour influence echolocation-based foraging. Here we study Blainville's beaked whales foraging in deep water using a multi-sensor DTAG that records both outgoing echolocation clicks and echoes returning from mesopelagic prey. We demonstrate that the <b>clicking</b> <b>rate</b> at the beginning of buzzes is related to the distance between whale and prey, supporting the presumption that whales focus on a specific prey target during the buzz. One whale showed a bimodal relationship between target range and <b>clicking</b> <b>rate</b> producing abnormally slow buzz clicks while attempting to capture large echoic targets, probably schooling prey, with echo duration indicating a school diameter of up to 4. 3  m. These targets were only found when the whale performed tight circling manoeuvres spending up to five times longer in water volumes with large targets than with small targets. The result indicates that toothed whales {{in the wild}} can adjust their echolocation behaviour and movement for capture of different prey on the basis of structural echo information...|$|R

This study examines (1) the direct effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance variables (buyer's <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> and seller's click price), and (3) how the effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but {{the opposite is true}} when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential of}} frequency of clicking (the production of velaric ingressive stops) as a possible basis for discriminating among speakers of English by forensic phoneticians. From analyses of clicking behavior among 100 young male speakers of Standard Southern British English (SSBE) recorded in two interactional tasks, it concludes that, contrary to the view of some forensic practitioners, the majority of speakers – of this language variety at least – do not vary sufficiently from one another in their <b>rates</b> of <b>clicking</b> for this feature {{to serve as a}} reliable discriminator. Further, speakers are generally not stable in their clicking behavior, either within or across interactions, and their <b>rates</b> of <b>clicking</b> may vary through accommodation to the <b>click</b> <b>rates</b> of their interlocutors. In view of these findings, it is suggested that the mere comparison of <b>clicking</b> <b>rates</b> across questioned and known recordings is unlikely to be of assistance to forensic phoneticians in the majority of forensic speaker comparison cases...|$|R

We adopted the artificial neural network to recognize a quick-nodding pattern of the disabled person as the gyro-mouse click. The performance of our gyro-mouse was evaluated by three indices that include ‘click recognition rate’, ‘error in cursor position control’, and ‘click rate per minute ’ on a target box appearing at random positions. Although {{it turned out that}} the average error in cursor positioning control was 1. 4 - 1. 5 times larger than that of optical mouse control, and the average <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> per minute was 40 % of the optical mouse, the overall click recognition rate was 93 %. Moreover, the <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> per minute increased from 35. 2 % to 44 % with repetitive trials.

40|$|Male {{and female}} African Clawed Frogs (Xenopus laevis) produce calls {{and engage in}} dueting in both silt-filled ponds and {{laboratory}} aquaria. Previous research has established that males produce different answer calls in response to receptive (11 - 12 Hz <b>click</b> <b>rate)</b> and nonreceptive (<b>click</b> <b>rate</b> of 4 Hz) female calls. In the present study, in addition to male answer calls, male phonotropism behaviors were measured {{for the first time}} during playbacks of natural female rapping and ticking calls as well as synthetic stimuli consisting of ticking calls with 90 -msec interclick intervals (ICIs) and rapping calls with 250 -msec ICIs. Also, the results show that males approach a loudspeaker significantly more often in response to rapping calls and remain longer in the proximity of the speaker. Moreover, males produce answer calls more frequently in response to female rapping calls and produce few answer calls in response to female ticking calls. Synthetic ticking calls with 90 -msec ICIs evoked an intermediate phonotaxis response, whereas synthetic rapping calls with 250 -msec ICIs evoked the same level of phonotaxy as do natural ticking calls. These results show that male phonotaxy is strongly, although not entirely, determined by the rhythmic characteristics of female calls, whereas antiphonotaxy appears to be determined by female call rhythm alone.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of the binaural interaction component (BIC) in a large sample of normal hearing adults, and to measure the absolute latency and amplitude of the BIC as a function of the <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> of the stimulus and the electrode montage. The BIC is obtained by subtracting the auditory evoked potential waveform obtained with binaural stimulation from the waveform obtained by adding the responses from the left and right monaural stimulation. The tested hypothesis was that the recordings of the BIC vary among normal hearing individuals, and BIC latency and amplitude values change as a function of stimulus rate. Studies of the BIC help to explain the neural correlates of some binaural processes, and to develop an electrophysiological index of binaural processes for objective clinical evaluations. Data was completed and analyzed on 47 adults between the ages of 20 and 41 (mean = 25) with hearing in the normal range (thresholds 3 ̆c 20 dB HL at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz in each ear) and no known neurological disorders. The results revealed a great variability in BIC morphology between subjects. The BIC waveforms were categorized into five distinct groups according to the number of positive and negative peaks present. Chi-square analyses revealed a significant relationship between <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> and BIC category; however, the relationship between recording montage and BIC category was insignificant. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVAs) revealed a significant increase in absolute latency and decrease in absolute amplitude of both negative and positive peaks as <b>click</b> <b>rate</b> increased from 7. 7 /s to 57. 7 /s. The results did not reveal a significant change in the type of BIC as an effect of electrode montage. In conclusion, the BIC within the binaural difference waveform may be obtained in the majority of young individuals with normal hearing. Specifically, a slower stimulus rate revealed more components of the waveform, as w ell as an improvement in the morphology of the BIC compared to a faster stimulus rate. As these findings may aid in the development of an electrophysiological index of binaural neural processes in young individuals with normal hearing, more research should be attempted in the study of BIC in other age groups and patients with different audiograms...|$|E
