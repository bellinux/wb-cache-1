40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{specific}} procedure for the structural {{assessment of a}} <b>container</b> <b>stack</b> is implemented to a realistic case in order to evaluate its effectiveness in the prediction of the operational limits of a container vessel. The feasibility of an extensive calculation based on such procedure is tested, paving {{the way to the}} direct analysis of a <b>container</b> <b>stack</b> subject to the inertial loads arising from the ship motions. The procedure is based on a 3 D non-linear FE analysis coupled with a direct simulation of non-linear ship motions for the determination of inertial forces acting on a <b>container</b> <b>stack.</b> A non-linear approach has been used for modelling both the ship motion response and the <b>container</b> <b>stack</b> structural response, leading to a global large amplitude analysis. A simplified model of a <b>container</b> <b>stack</b> has been defined in order to decrease the computational cost of the structural calculations, allowing for a use in the framework of an extensive analysis considering many different ship sailing conditions. As final results, diagrams showing the occurrence of failure of container structures or lashing equipment are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Container</b> <b>stacking</b> {{problem is}} an NP (Non-Polynomial) -Hard problem. This type of problem {{requires}} robust and adaptive algorithms, {{such as the}} Constraints Programming technique. Rule-based programming is ineffective due {{to the complexity of}} <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> problem. The <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> processes are restricted to certain heuristic rules, which is difficult to be coded in algorithmic ways. Improper stacking will cause non-economical container forklift movement. As a result it will increase the operational costs. This paper proposed a genetic algorithms technique to solve container-stacking problem, where a prototype has been developed. The scope of the problem is based on Kontena Nasional (KONNAS Malaysia) case study, which is restricted for one-year operational basis. The <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> mechanism is operated under several Genetic Algorithms operators such as Selection, Mutation and Crossover. The prototype is coded using C++, ORACLE 7. 0 as database and runs under UNIX platform. The average optimal stacking result obtained ranged between 78 - 83 percent.

We build on prior research and use a discrete-event simulation model to evaluate the impact of a truck announcement system on the performance of online <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> rules.

40|$|Context: The {{workload}} at seaport {{container terminal}} is increasing gradually. We {{need to improve}} the performance of terminal to fulfill the demand. The key section of the container terminal is <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> yard which {{is an integral part}} of the seaside and the landside. So its performance has the effects on both sides. The main problem in this area is unproductive moves of containers. However, we need a well-planned stacking area in order to increase the performance of terminal and maximum utilization of existing resources. Objectives: In this work, we have analyzed the existing <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> system at Helsingborg seaport container terminal, Sweden, investigated the already provided solutions of the problem and find the best optimization technique to get the best possible solution. After this, suggest the solution, test the proposed solution and analyzed the simulation based results with respect to the desired solution. Methods: To identify the problem, methods and proposed solutions of the given problem in the domain of <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> yard management, a literature review has been conducted by using some e-resources/databases. A GA with best parametric values is used to get the best optimize solution. A discrete event simulation model for <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> in the yard has been build and integrated with genetic algorithm. A proposed mathematical model to show the dependency of cost minimization on the number of containers’ moves. Results: The GA has been achieved the high fitness value versus generations for 150 containers to storage at best location in a block with 3 tier levels and to minimize the unproductive moves in the yard. A comparison between Genetic Algorithm and Tabu Search has been made to verify that the GA has performed better than other algorithm or not. A simulation model with GA has been used to get the simulation based results and to show the container handling by using resources like AGVs, yard crane and delivery trucks and <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> and retrieval system in the yard. The <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> cost is directly proportional to the number of moves has been shown by the mathematical model. Conclusions: We have identified the key factor (unproductive moves) that is the base of other key factors (time & cost) and has an effect on the performance of the stacking yard and overall the whole seaport terminal. We have focused on this drawback of stacking system and proposed a solution that makes this system more efficient. Through this, we can save time and cost both. A Genetic Algorithm is a best approach to solve the unproductive moves problem in <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> system...|$|E

40|$|<b>Container</b> <b>stacking</b> {{rules are}} an {{important}} factor in container terminal efficiency. In this paper, we describe a discrete-event simulation model that has been used to evaluate online <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> rules. We build on prior research and demonstrate that results obtained for smaller stacking areas are also valid for a larger stacking area. The use of information regarding container departure times (even if is imperfect) is shown to be more beneficial than the use of exchange categories. Stacking rules that take the workload of the automated stacking cranes into account outperform rules that do not. The experiments conducted with the simulation model show that it can capture the amount of detail required and that it is flexible enough to support the evaluation of the stacking rules. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{there exists}} a large {{competition}} between maritime ports, so that the improvement of customer service became a serious important problem within port container terminals which led to several sub-problems (Vis and Koster 2003). One of these sub-problems is the <b>Container</b> <b>Stacking</b> Problem. A container stack {{is a type of}} temporary store where containers await further transport by truck, train or vessel. The main efficiency problem for an individual stack is to ensure easy access to containers at the expected time of transfer. Since stacks are 'last-in, first-out', and the cranes used to relocate containers within the stack are heavily used, the stacks must be maintained in a state that minimizes ondemand relocations. In this paper, we study and compare the configuration of yard-bays with 4 tiers and yard-bays with 5 tiers. Keywords: <b>Container</b> <b>stacking</b> problem, Planning, Artificial Intelligenc...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> model that simulates, solves and optimizes the <b>container</b> <b>stacking</b> activity within a fluvial or maritime port. This activity constitutes a real world {{problem that is}} omnipresent in logistic and transportation domain. Given container arrivals in a container port terminal, {{the objective is to}} assign a slot to each one in a storage area at least cost with respect to pre-defined constraints. The cost is expressed in term of expected relocation movement number. The constraints to respect are stack height, stack number, and departure dates. The aim of the proposed model is to help operative management personnel by giving a stacking plan for each container. To this end, two centralized algorithms were presented: the first is an uninformed search algorithm and the second is an informed search algorithm based on heuristics. By comparing them, it is shown that the latter performs much better than the former thanks to the adopted heuristics. Keywords...|$|E

30|$|Since it was {{possible}} to create an inter-container network spanning more than four containers in a row configuration, we can conclude that assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Assumption 3 does not hold entirely because we observed 20 % more failures than during the test lab evaluation. This can be partially explained by the difference in the <b>container</b> <b>stacking.</b> The orientation of the containers was different, leading to worse multipath propagation during the validation experiment. Moreover, also, the distance between the far edges was larger than during the experiment in the test lab. It is however a situation that will frequently occur in real life.|$|E
