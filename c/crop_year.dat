40|$|OBJECT: Improved {{precision}} fertilization {{by introducing}} sensors and remote control to secure fruit yield and reduce nutrient leaching in soil culture. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We broadcasted before bedding and mulching 50  g m– 2 of a multi-mineral fertilizer. Beds had two plant rows 20  cm apart, with plant distance of 25  cm. Experimental design was split plot with three replications and three treatments. Treatments: fertigation in large plots, cultivar in small plots and year. RESULTS: Plant {{development in the}} establishing year had no benefit of fertigation in addition to fertilizer given before bedding. When the yield is 3  kg m– 2 a nutrient solution of 6  g N m– 2 gave highest yield, using 4  g m– 2 from two weeks before harvest and during harvest. ‘Florence’ and ‘Sonata’ developed well; however, ‘Florence’ had mildew on fruits in the last <b>cropping</b> <b>year.</b> ‘Korona’ presented well the first <b>cropping</b> <b>year,</b> but grew small fruits heavily infested by mildew in the last <b>cropping</b> <b>year.</b> CONCLUSION: Fertilization had effect on fruit yield.

Mapping with a single masked spot size diameter of 4. 5 µm or confocal 5 µm on beamlines U 10 B and U 2 B, respectively, produced spectra from the subaleurone layer within each wheat kernel using the high spatial resolution available with synchrotron infrared microspectroscopy.

OBJECTIVE: Investigated how quality of certified Norwegian strawberry transplants, developed and yielded from planting to first <b>cropping</b> <b>year.</b> METHODS: Plant qualities of Norwegian fresh and cold stored bare root- and plug-plants of ‘Korona’ and ‘Sonata’ were examined for establishing and yield parameters in the open, after three intervals of planting. Fresh plug-plants were delivered when available. Trials were established at NIBIO Research Station Kvithamar, Norway. Growth and yield parameters were registered in the establishing and <b>cropping</b> <b>years.</b> RESULTS: Plant establishment was poor in 2013 compared with 2014. Bare-root plants stored at 2 – 4 °C generally developed poorly. Plug-plants established well at all delivery dates, except fresh plug in one year. Development of runner plants depended on plant type, cultivar and year. Plug- and bare root-plants planted immediately after first delivery generally developed best crowns. Primary flower primordia reached a more developed stage for ‘Sonata’ than for ‘Korona’. Fruit yield of bare root was low in the establishing years. Plant-types differed in yield and fruit weight between <b>cropping</b> <b>years.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Bare-root and plug- plants planted one day after delivery generally yielded best.
