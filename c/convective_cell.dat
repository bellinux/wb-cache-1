In regime I [low moist Froude number (Fw) ], the <b>convective</b> <b>cells</b> are generated by upstream deceleration associated with orographic forcing, by gravity waves associated with <b>convective</b> <b>cells</b> over the upslope area at earlier stages, and by the upstream propagating density current at later stages when the density current is fully developed.

Despite the extreme heat fluxes and episodic seismic activity and faulting, the intensity and position of upwelling convective zones remains relatively fixed over many thousands of years. Epithermal deposits in the North island of New Zealand occur in Northland, Coromandel and Taupo regions, and all have a close association with Cenozoic volcanic rocks. Gold and silver are present in active geothermal fields and in extinct western geothermal systems of the TVZ. Here we attempt to simulate the effects of permeability contrasts, deformation and heat flow variations to constrain {{the importance of these}} different processes in controlling the localization of upflow zones.
