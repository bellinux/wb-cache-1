40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{application}} of the Lean Enterprise Model (LEM) to construction firms. LEM is a framework derived from lean manufacturing principles by MIT's Lean Aerospace Initiative (LAI) for the aerospace industry. Construction firms also need new business models to meet the change in construction industry environment. Lean enterprise could assist {{in the development of a}} new business model. In theory, LEM could be applied to any given industry. A matrix has been created in which six key construction characteristics are compared to six key lean enterprise principles in order to asses how compatible would the lean enterprise model be taking into account the particularities of the construction industry. The results show that in some aspects the construction industry is already somewhat lean, e. g. it works on the basis of <b>customer</b> <b>pull,</b> while in others {{the application of}} lean principles would require a big mindset and cultural change, e. g. adversarial relationships due to the lump sum bidding system...|$|E
40|$|Our aim is {{to develop}} new {{concepts}} {{for the analysis of}} the dynamics of marketing systems. By introducing new concepts in an analysis of an industry under high pressure for rapid change we can present a model for different alternative developments. Our approaches are conceptual and analytical. Sales & Distribution (S&D) strategies in the prestige car segment are under debate both from inside the automotive industry and from legislators. New actors and dealers are attacking with business models based on success from other industries. In the European Union, the S&D are also under pressure from the European Commission. The present Block Exemption will be deregulated from October 2002 according to most experts. One reason is the realisation of the single market; another is to open for more <b>customer</b> <b>pull</b> enabled by more efficient IT-support. The present system is typically market push of new cars from OEM via dealers to final customers. This paper investigates the driving forces and outlines three scenarios for the distribution of cars.

40|$|A lift curve, {{with the}} true {{positive}} rate on the y-axis and the <b>customer</b> <b>pull</b> (or contact) rate on the x-axis, {{is often used}} to depict the model performance in many data mining applications, especially in the area of customer relationship management (CRM). Typically, these applications concern only the model accuracy at a relatively small pull or contact/intervention rate of the whole customer base, which is predetermined by a budget constraint for the project, e. g., how many customers can be contacted every month. In this paper, we address the important problem of enhancing the lift (true positive rate) at a specified pull rate. We propose two distinct algorithms, which are applicable to different scenarios. In particular, when the binary class label of the training set is extracted from a continuous variable, we can optimize a training objective which takes into account the specified pull rate rather than the class prior, based on the often ignored continuous variable. In those cases where only the binary class label is available during training, we propose a constrained optimization algorithm to maximize the true positive rate related to a specific decision threshold at which the specified pull rate is achieved. We applied both algorithms to our projects of predicting defection (decline in account value) of mutual fund accounts for two major U. S. mutual fund companies and achieved substantial enhancement of the lift at the specified pull rate...|$|E

40|$|In many countries, {{construction}} industry contributes as ignificant {{part of their}} economy. Construction industry {{is one of the}} most complicated and fragmented industries. It is very unique industry and facing many problems such as low productivity, insufficient quality, poor safety, time over-runs, cost over-run and others. In order to address these long term problems various tools and methodologies have been developed. One of the successful approaches adopted to address these problems is lean construction. Lean construction is a new way to manage construction projects that makes significant improvements on complex, uncertain and quick projects. Lean Construction was proposed from Lean philosophies and theories that have offered lots of benefits to the manufacturing industry. It was founded by Toyota Motor Company in 1950 ’s to reduce manufacturing lead times, eliminate non-value adding activities, and reduce variability. These goals were obtained by methods such as pull scheduling, simplified operations, and buffer reduction. Lean is about doing more with less time, inventory, space, labour, and money. Lean production is a systematic elimination of waste (i. e. overproduction, waiting, transportation, inventory, and over-processing, defective units) and the implementation of continuous flow and <b>customer</b> <b>pull.</b> There are five issues that drive lean construction including cost, quality, delivery, safety, and morale. The first introduction of “Lean Construction” was in the year 1992 and was introduced by the Finnish scientist, Lauri Koskela.

40|$|Lean Thinking and its {{principles}} as {{prescribed by}} Womack and Jones {{have been successfully}} applied to manufacturing and operations environments, and associated case studies and research literature have been published extensively. The same cannot be said for Lean application to the new product introduction (NPI) or development processes. The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the application of the Womack and Jones principles of Lean Thinking to the NPI process (from concept development to detailed design through to customer delivery). While techniques such as concurrent engineering (or concurrent product development) have been implemented and have been quite successful in improving NPI, there is still a shortfall in the expected or desired improvements to NPI. This shortfall we believe can be bridged through the application of Lean Thinking to NPI; in particular, the five lean principles proposed by Womack and Jones. The five Lean principles are briefly 'specify value', 'identify the value stream and eliminate waste', 'make the value flow', 'let the <b>customer</b> <b>pull</b> the process', and 'pursue perfection'. In this paper each principle is defined and characterized within the context of NPI. The work presented was developed on the Society of British Aerospace Companies' UK Lean Aerospace Initiative involving 40 aerospace companies of all sizes from across the UK. Two case studies from the industry are also presented to demonstrate aspects of Lean application in NPI (in particular, in product design and development). The paper concludes by summarizing the key methods and tools that enable Lean in NPI, and by discussing the key adjustments required to the manufacturing/operations definitions of waste and value to accommodate the demands of effective and efficient NPI...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Key account {{management}} (KAM) is considered {{as an important}} marketing trend since last few years. The purpose of this thesis orients to the discussion about key {{account management}} practices from selling company’s perspectives in home appliance market of Pakistan. The study is carried through with four steps: elements of key accounts management, identification and analysis of key accounts, strategies for key accounts, and operational level capabilities used in key account management for profitable and long lasting relationships with key accounts. Basing on the literature review, the basic four elements for KAM practices are described. This study suggests a framework for KAM practices in terms of basic elements of KAM regarding its implementation in home appliance market of Pakistan. It also, explores {{a relationship between the}} elements of KAM framework with practices in the home appliance market of Pakistan. Four questions are answered in this study. First, four basic elements of KAM are described from the literature: 1) Identifying 2) analyzing 3) selecting suitable strategies and 4) developing operational level capabilities for key accounts. Second, dealer’s sales volume, showroom size and location, and dealer’s reputation are the identifying factors whereas analyzing factors are found regular sales invoices, expected sales share, and key account’s ability to solve end user’s problems. Third, administrative and dominant strategy is opted in the market and threats are utilized rather than promises within the relationships. Fourth, quality product with strong <b>customer</b> <b>pull,</b> effective after-sales-services, and KAM manager’s skills and abilities are regarded as operational capabilities for profitable and long-lasting relationships with key accounts in home appliance market of Pakistan. The findings are based on the empirical data acquired through questionnaire survey from Dawlance which is a market leader in home appliance market of Pakistan. This research contributes in two ways. First, it helps Dawlance to focus and prioritize the factors that are being neglected regarding identification, analysis, selecting suitable relationship strategies and operational level capabilities used in KAM. Secondly, the findings will be considered a source of information about Dawlance success for other selling companies willing to adopt KAM program in home appliance market of Pakistan...|$|E

The Pre-Sales division of the reseller provides advice based on end-to-end solution for IT infrastructure and technology management. Within the team there is expertise spanning a plethora of specifically defined technology areas to support end customers in the decision making process on their capital expenditure in IT equipment. Areas include Software licensing, Server infrastructure development, data storage and management, systems security, and networking infrastructure (and more). The business of being a re-seller may not initially strike the reader as being relevant to cybersecurity in general, and socio-technical matters at all, but we discovered the rather vital role that such an intermediary performs through their added value and corporate ethics. Specifically, this reseller’s team of customer service agents provide advice and referral to colleagues and end customers for subject-matter expertise as well, naturally, for opportunities to up-sell – specifically with that important core of any economy: Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (hereafter SMEs) - usually defined as companies with up to 250 employees.
