5|$|During 1890 {{work began}} on an eighth fort, known as Linkuva; new {{construction}} techniques were introduced, particularly reinforced concrete. The Linkuva fort {{became the most}} modern entrenchment, equipped with electricity, sewerage, and casemates for a garrison of 1,000 personnel. At the same time, massive groundworks were laid along with additional defensive structures, effecting the <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the city center between the Rivers Nemunas and Neris. By 1890, seven forts had been completed, supporting roads had been constructed, and a railroad bridge over the Nemunas had been adapted for military transport. By now, expenditures on the fortress had amounted to over nine million rubles. The first bricks for a church that would serve the garrison were laid in 1891; it was completed in 1893. The following year construction began on a dedicated narrow gauge railway.|$|E
25|$|A covered {{bridge is}} a timber-truss bridge with a roof and siding which, in most covered bridges, create an almost <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The {{purpose of the}} {{covering}} {{is to protect the}} wooden structural members from the weather. Uncovered wooden bridges have a lifespan of only 10 to 15 years because of the effects of rain and sun.|$|E
25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure</b> to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone into thin slices and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|E

The test of an interval for real roots using Budan's theorem is computationally simple but may yield false positive results. However, these will be reliably detected in the following transformation and refinement of the interval.

25|$|In 1919, Edinburgh Corporation {{bought their}} first Leyland charabancs, for tour services. The Corporation was {{authorised}} to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for Â£25,000. By {{the middle of}} 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40hp Model O chassis with worm drive axle, was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October. This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well-known and popular by 1921. One reason for the <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th century, wine presses {{advanced}} {{from the}} vertical style pressing {{of the basket}} press and ancient wine press to horizontal pressing with pressure either being applied at one or both ends or from the side through use of an airbag or bladder. These new presses were categorized as [...] "batch", which like the basket press {{had to have the}} pomace emptied and grapes reloaded, and as [...] "continuous" [...] where a belt or Archimedes' screw would subject the grapes/pomace to increasing pressure {{from one end of the}} press to the other with new grapes being added and the pomace being continuously removed.

60|$|April 16. I {{finished}} the ladder; so I went {{up with the}} ladder to the top, and then pulled it up after me, and let it down in the inside: this was a <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure</b> to me; for within I had room enough, and nothing could come at me from without, unless it could first mount my wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "At a quarter-past eight, {{being no}} longer able to draw breath without the most {{intolerable}} pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a <b>complete</b> <b>enclosure</b> on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work--in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming {{the upper part of the}} bag, I refastened the loops--not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened--but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1902, the Detroit Shipbuilding Company built two more still-surviving structures, the foundry and the {{industrial}} loft building.
