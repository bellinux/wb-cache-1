40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of a {{three-way}} catalytic converter and sampling dilution ratio on nano-scale exhaust particulate matter emissions from a gasoline direct-injection engine during cold-start and warm-up transients. Experimental results are presented from a four cylinder in-line, four stroke, wall-guided direct-injection, turbo-charged and inter-cooled 1. 6 litre gasoline engine. A fast-response particulate spectrometer for exhaust nano-particle measurement up to 1000 nm was utilised. It was observed that the three-way catalytic converter had a significant effect on particle number density, reducing the total particle number by up to 65 % over the duration of the <b>cold-start</b> <b>test.</b> The greatest change in particle number density occurred for particles less than 23 nm diameter, with reductions of up to 95 % being observed, whilst the number density for particles above 50 nm diameter exhibited a significant increase. The exhaust temperature plays a significant role on the influence of the catalytic converter on the nano-scale particulate matter. It is evident that the dilution ratio of the exhaust sample has a distinct effect on the particulate matter number and size distribution, influencing the engine-out PM more significantly than the tailpipe-out PM during cold-start engine operation. The catalytic converter also has a considerable effect on the estimated total particle mass...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{photochemical}} aging on emissions from 15 light-duty gasoline vehicles were investigated using a smog chamber {{to probe the}} critical link between the tailpipe and ambient atmosphere. The vehicles were recruited from the California in-use fleet; they represent {{a wide range of}} model years (1987 to 2011), vehicle types and emission control technologies. Each vehicle was tested on a chassis dynamometer using the unified cycle. Dilute emissions were sampled into a portable smog chamber and then photochemically aged under urban-like conditions. For every vehicle, substantial secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation occurred during <b>cold-start</b> <b>tests,</b> with the emissions from some vehicles generating as much as 6 times the amount of SOA as primary particulate matter (PM) after 3 h of oxidation inside the chamber at typical atmospheric oxidant levels (and 5 times the amount of SOA as primary PM after 5 × 10 6 molecules cm − 3 h of OH exposure). Therefore, the contribution of light-duty gasoline vehicle exhaust to ambient PM levels is likely dominated by secondary PM production (SOA and nitrate). Emissions from hot-start tests formed about a factor of 3 – 7 less SOA than <b>cold-start</b> <b>tests.</b> Therefore, catalyst warm-up appears to be an important factor in controlling SOA precursor emissions. The mass of SOA generated by photooxidizing exhaust from newer (LEV 2) vehicles was a factor of 3 lower than that formed from exhaust emitted by older (pre-LEV) vehicles, despite much larger reductions (a factor of 11 – 15) in nonmethane organic gas emissions. These data suggest that a complex and nonlinear relationship exists between organic gas emissions and SOA formation, which is not surprising since SOA precursors are only one component of the exhaust. Except for the oldest (pre-LEV) vehicles, the SOA production could not be fully explained by the measured oxidation of speciated (traditional) SOA precursors. Over the timescale of these experiments, the mixture of organic vapors emitted by newer vehicles appears to be more efficient (higher yielding) in producing SOA than the emissions from older vehicles. About 30 % of the nonmethane organic gas emissions from the newer (LEV 1 and LEV 2) vehicles could not be speciated, and the majority of the SOA formed from these vehicles appears to be associated with these unspeciated organics. By comparing this study with a companion study of diesel trucks, we conclude that both primary PM emissions and SOA production for light-duty gasoline vehicles are much greater than for late-model (2007 and later) on-road heavy-duty diesel trucks...|$|R
40|$|Simulated <b>cold-start</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the performance of H-ZSM- 5 and H-BETA zeolites as hydrocarbon traps under simulated gasoline car exhaust gases, paying special attention to the effect of water on their behaviour. It is concluded that the hydrothermal treatment of the zeolites in the acidic form contributes to the better performance of these materials as hydrocarbon traps since the stabilization of the zeolites takes place. Moreover, the decrease of the surface acidity of the zeolites results in an increase of the Si/Al ratio, which contributes to the decrease of the water affinity for adsorption sites. Thus, the competition with hydrocarbon molecules in the exhaust for the adsorption sites is reduced which increases their trap efficiency. The stabilized H-ZSM- 5 is the zeolite that showed the best performance with a propene offset temperature of 240 °C, which should be high enough for the three-way catalyst to carry out its role as catalytic converter.

40|$|To enable {{continued}} {{development and}} facilitate {{the adoption of}} new internal combustion engine technologies, the accuracy and repeatability of measurement methods used for verification need to be improved upon. A variety of methods are available for the measurement of fuel consumption based on the volumetric or gravimetric principle or by equating carbon in the fuel to carbon in the exhaust flow. Measurements of fuel consumption from five different experimental campaigns with varying engine set-ups are presented, highlighting discrepancies between gravimetric fuel balance and exhaust feed gas carbon balance. Differences were larger for <b>cold-start</b> <b>tests</b> and if all correction factors are neglected offsets can reach 7 per cent. The carbon balance and gravimetric methods have been considered independently to identify sources of inaccuracy and improvements have been suggested {{in the form of}} correction factors. The carbon balance estimate is dependent on a number of separate measurements, all taken at different conditions. To account for these, two correction factors were compared, the first proposed by the British Standards Institution and the second derived from the experimental conditions of each of the measurements. The gravimetric measurement was affected by changes in fuel temperature within the fuelling circuit and a corrective method was proposed based on the change in fuel density. When correction factors were applied to each of the measurement techniques for the five experimental campaigns, discrepancies were less than 1 per cent, which, in most cases, was small enough for there to be no statistically significant difference between measurements. In addition, in some cases the scatter of results was reduced, contributing to improved test-to-test repeatability. The improved performance when using correction factors was explained by including known disturbances, such as fuel temperature and ambient humidity, as inputs to the measurement system...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a renewed {{interest}} in the use of ethanol as a future fuel for spark ignition engines. The finite availability of oil coupled with concerns about global warming and CO 2 emissions has led to an increase in the use of ethanol which is produced from biomass. Generally ethanol is blended with gasoline to make an automotive fuel with the most common blend being E 85 (85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline by volume), which is used in Sweden and in the USA. Unlike gasoline, ethanol is a single component fuel which has a low volatility especially at low temperatures which means that cold-starting a spark ignition engine with ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is more difficult. In Europe <b>cold-starting</b> emission <b>testing</b> must be completed at ambient temperature and - 7 °C. During <b>cold-starting</b> <b>tests</b> with ethanol-gasoline blends high fuelling levels are required to form a combustible mixture and start the engine which results in high hydrocarbon emissions. This study investigates the start performance of a range of ethanol-gasoline blends in a port fuel injected spark ignition engine. Tests are completed at both ambient temperature at -rc and the start performance is characterised by the fuelling levels required to start the engine, the emissions of hydrocarbons and the fuel unaccounted for during the test. The optimum first start fuelling level is highly dependent on the proportion of ethanol in the fuel. The lower volatility of the ethanol fuel blends meant that it is harder to form a combustible mixture without injecting high levels of fuel. The high fuel injection rates result in high levels of liquid fuel being inducted into the cylinder which causes high HC emissions and fuel unaccounted for during the start. Under ambient temperature starts E 10 and E 25 offer start performance benefits over gasoline, whilst E 50 and in some aspects E 75 are comparable to gasoline. E 85 fuel results in considerably higher emissions of HCs and fuel unaccounted for than gasoline during ambient temperature starts. At -rc the start performance with ethanol suffers compared to gasoline. When using E 10 and E 25 the start performance is comparable to gasoline, but with E 50 and the higher proportion ethanol fuel blends the start performance becomes far poorer. With E 85 the mass of fuel emitted from the engine as un-burnt HCs during a -rc start is seven times the quantity with gasoline. Hardware modifications were made to the engine {{in order to try to}} improve the start performance of -rc E 85 starts. Of the modifications tested heating the fuel within the fuel rail produced the biggest start improvement followed by heating the intake air. An extended cranking period prior to the start of the test only produced a small improvement in start performance and is not worthwhile compared to the energy needed to crank the engine. With both fuel rail and intake air heating the start fuelling level can be 40. 5 % below the baseline E 85 level and peak HC emissions are reduced by 30. 5 %. The low volatility of E 85 meant that even when incorporating the hardware modifications, the start performance of the engine is still not comparable to the standard engine running on gasoline due to high emissions of HCs. When cold-starting, especially at low temperatures, the use of high proportion ethanol-gasoline fuel blends is not suitable if low emissions of HCs are a priority. Longer duration tests were also completed with different ethanol-gasoline fuel blends in order to investigate their influence on engine warm-up characteristics. Larger proportions of ethanol within the fuel resulted in higher engine work output and lower heat rejection to the coolant and oil. With E 100 it takes 7. 2 % longer for the thermostat to open compared to gasoline. The warm-up tests also showed that the exhaust gas temperature is lower with ethanol in the fuel, which will result in a longer period before the catalyst lights-off. A higher proportion of ethanol in the fuel results in lower NOx emissions due to reduced peak temperatures within the engine. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
