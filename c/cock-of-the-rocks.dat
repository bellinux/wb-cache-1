50|$|The cocks-of-the-rock, which {{compose the}} genus Rupicola, are large cotingid birds native to South America. They {{are found in}} {{tropical}} and subtropical rainforests close to rocky areas, where they build their nests. The genus is composed of only two known extant species: the Andean <b>cock-of-the-rock</b> and the smaller Guianan <b>cock-of-the-rock.</b> The Andean <b>cock-of-the-rock</b> is the national bird of Peru.|$|R
5|$|The Guanian <b>cock-of-the-rock</b> {{is one of}} {{two species}} of genus Rupicola. It was {{described}} by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 as the type species of its genus. The Andean <b>cock-of-the-rock</b> (Rupicola peruvianus) is similar in body shape and colouration.|$|R

50|$|Bird: Bird {{species are}} {{typically}} biparental in care, {{and may also}} be maternal like the Guianan <b>cock-of-the-rocks.</b> However the reverse may also hold true. Male wattled jacanas provide all parental care after the eggs have been laid by the females. This means that the males must incubate the eggs and defend the nest {{for an extended period}} of time. Since males invest much more time and energy into the offspring, females are very competitive for the right to lay their eggs in an established nest.|$|E
50|$|Sexual {{conflict}} {{refers to}} the conflicting goals of breeding males and females. It describes the diverging interests {{of males and females}} in optimizing their fitness. From the viewpoint of any one partner, the best outcome would be for the partner's mate to care for the young, thus freeing up his or her own resources (e.g., time and energy) that s/he—but typically he—can invest in further sex that may create additional offspring. In polygynous mating systems, sexual conflict means the optimization of male reproductive success by having mated with multiple females, even though the reproductive success of a polygynously mated female is thereby reduced. Such can be the case for the Guianan <b>cock-of-the-rocks,</b> whose male members spend a majority of their time and energy into maintaining their plumage and attempting to seek the most matings. Females on the other hand, spend their time building and maintaining their nest where they will lay their eggs and raise the young.|$|E
50|$|Differences in {{secondary}} sexual characteristics {{between males and females}} of a species are referred to as sexual dimorphisms. These can be as subtle as a size difference (sexual size dimorphism, often abbreviated as SSD) or as extreme as horns and colour patterns. Sexual dimorphisms abound in nature. Examples include the possession of antlers by only male deer, the brighter coloration of many male birds in comparison with females of the same species, or even more distinct differences in basic morphology, such as the drastically increased eye-span of the male stalk-eyed fly. The peacock, with its elaborate and colourful tail feathers, which the peahen lacks, {{is often referred to as}} perhaps the most extraordinary example of a dimorphism. Male and female black-throated blue warblers and Guianan <b>cock-of-the-rocks</b> also differ radically in their plumage. Early naturalists even believed the females to be a separate species. The largest sexual size dimorphism in vertebrates is the shell dwelling cichlid fish Neolamprologus callipterus in which males are up to 30 times the size of females. Many other fish such as guppies also exhibit sexual dimorphism. Extreme sexual size dimorphism, with females larger than males, is quite common in spiders and birds of prey.|$|E
