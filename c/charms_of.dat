5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum {{of money}} from his distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E

The {{kidnapping}} {{of a child}} by crows comes from Irish folktales of the Sluagh, and from Maurice Sendak's Outside Over There where a girl rescues her brother kidnapped by goblins. The literary tone of Decemberists songs is apparent in the writing style, with a weakness for the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> archaic language and sesquipedalianism.|$|E

25|$|The Green Sun Princes {{are made}} with the fifty Essences of Solar Exalts which the Yozis took in payment from the Neverborn and altered to emulate {{themselves}} in exchange for teaching the Neverborn to corrupt Solar Essences to create the Abyssals. While the first edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until 2nd edition's Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals (April 2009). The Green Sun Princes were created by a cadre of five of the Yozis; Malfeas, She Who Lives In Her Name, Cecylene, Adorjan, and the Ebon Dragon. Each of these Yozis {{is responsible for the}} creation of one caste of Green Sun Princes and the charms associated with that caste, Malfeas created the Slayers, Cecylene created the Malefactors, She Who Lives in Her Name created the Defilers, Adorjan created the Scourges and the Ebon Dragon created the Fiends. Green Sun Princes of any caste can learn the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> all five castes, as well as the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> any other Yozis who have opened up access to their charms to the Green Sun Princes; in the default setting, Kimbery is the only other Yozi who has done so. The Yozis have tasked the Green Sun Princes with transforming Creation into a mirror of Malfeas, which they believe will break their bonds and reverse their disfiguring imprisonment. They call this effort the Reclamation.|$|E
25|$|Pompey was {{supposedly}} infatuated with his bride. The personal <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Julia were remarkable: {{she was a}} kind woman of beauty and virtue; and although policy prompted her union, and she was thirty years younger than her husband, she possessed in Pompey a devoted husband, to whom she was, in return, devotedly attached. A rumor suggested that the aging conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey {{had been given the}} governorship of Hispania Ulterior, but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the Roman grain supply as curator annonae, exercising his command through subordinates.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginians {{were warned}} {{of what was}} coming when Scipio sent his legate C. Laelius with a naval force to plunder the area of Hippo Regius on the African coast west of Carthage (205 BC). They took various {{measures}} to prevent a major Roman invasion. However, the attempt to persuade the Macedonian king Philip to invade Sicily was unsuccessful, and the reinforcements sent to their own commanders in Bruttium and Liguria were not sufficient to revive the war in Italy (see the articles about the battle of Croton and the Po valley raid). Nor was Scipio dissuaded by the defection of Syphax, who took the side of Carthage thanks to the diplomatic skills of Hasdrubal Gisgo and the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> his daughter, Sophonisba.|$|E

After Shah Jahan's vassals had been {{devastated by the}} alarming expansion of Ahmednagar {{during the reign of}} the Nizam Shahi boy-prince Murtaza Shah III, the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the Safavid princess Dilras Banu Begum, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> his concubine, Udaipuri Bai. The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shikoh. In the same year, 1637, Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small Rajput kingdom of Baglana, which he did with ease.|$|E

Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times remarked {{after seeing the}} film that [...] "The cinema was a duller place before 007." [...] David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film, remarking: [...] "It's not just that Sean Connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did {{two or three years}} ago, but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy. Apart from the off-handed order for Beluga, there is little of that comic display of bon viveur-manship {{that was one of the}} <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Connery's almost-a-gentleman 007." ...|$|E

[...] Frere-Jones went on to describe the fluidity of the album, falling very loosely into the rock music genre classification.

500|$|Catherine also {{maintained}} about eighty alluring ladies-in-waiting at court, {{whom she}} allegedly used as tools to seduce courtiers for political ends. These women {{became known as}} her [...] "flying squadron". Catherine {{did not hesitate to}} use the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> her ladies as an attraction of the court. In 1577, for example, she threw a banquet at which the food was served by topless women. In 1572, the Huguenot Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre, wrote from the court to warn her son Henry that Catherine presided over a [...] "vicious and corrupt" [...] atmosphere, in which the women made the sexual advances and not the men. In fact, Charlotte de Sauve, {{one of the most notorious}} members of the [...] "flying squadron", first seduced and then became a mistress of Henry of Navarre on Catherine's orders. On the other hand, Brantôme, in his Memoirs, praised Catherine’s court as [...] "a school of all honesty and virtue".|$|E
500|$|In 1851, John Frederick Kensett (18161872) {{produced}} a large canvas, 40x60inches, of Mount Washington {{that has become}} one of the best and finest later examples of White Mountain art. [...] Barbara J. MacAdam, the Jonathan L. Cohen Curator of America Art at the Hood Museum of Dartmouth College, has written: [...] "John Frederick Kensett first made the scene famous through his monumental landscape, Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway ... Kensett's image became the single most effective mid-nineteenth-century advertisement for the scenic <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> the White Mountains and of North Conway in particular. [...] Mount Washington from the Valley of Conway, purchased by the American Art Union, was made into a print by the engraver James Smillie (18331909) and distributed to over 13,000 Art Union subscribers throughout the country. [...] Many artists painted copies of this same scene from the print, and Currier and Ives published a lithograph of this view in 1860. [...] Kensett’s painting is another example of a work of art that helped to popularize the region. [...] Catherine Campbell described the painting as [...] "canonical among White Mountain paintings" [...] and [...] "the best known landscape view of the era." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Time {{magazine}} interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, {{owner of}} Cole of California, {{and reported that}} he had [...] "little but scorn for France's famed Bikinis," [...] because they were designed for [...] "diminutive Gallic women". [...] "French girls have short legs," [...] he explained, [...] "Swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer." [...] Réard himself described it as a two-piece bathing suit which [...] "reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name." [...] Even Esther Williams commented, [...] "A bikini is a thoughtless act." [...] But, popularity of the <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Pin-up queen and Hollywood star Williams were to vanish along with pre-bikinis with fancy names over the next few decades. Australian designer Paula Straford introduced the bikini to Gold Coast in 1952. In 1957, Das moderne Mädchen (The Modern Girl) wrote, [...] "It is unthinkable that a decent girl with tact would ever wear such a thing." [...] Eight years later a Munich student was punished to six days cleaning work at an old home because she had strolled across the central Viktualienmarkt square, Munich in a bikini.|$|E
