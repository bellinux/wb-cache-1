40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} two years there has been an {{exponential}} growth in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> people questioning <b>the</b> explanations we have been given, by official U. S. government bodies, concerning <b>the</b> <b>collapses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three WTC buildings in NYC on 9 / 11 / 2001. It is probably safe to say that much of this growth can be attributed to <b>the</b> Internet publishing <b>of</b> a paper by Physics Professor Steven Jones in November 2005, which put forth the hypothesis that the Twin Towers and WTC 7 were actually demolished with prepositioned cutter charges. 3 This hypothesis is in tension with the present government explanation of impact damage and fires being the causes for <b>the</b> complete <b>collapses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> buildings. My intent here is to show that any honest and objective look at all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theories, for <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twin towers, including the present government explanation, will cause one to realize that only the controlled demolition hypothesis is sustainable. I believe an honest look at the evidence will convince anyone that the controlled demolition hypothesis provides the best explanation for <b>the</b> complete <b>collapses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers, as well as the damage to the buildings and objects surrounding them. <b>The</b> remarkable <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> WTC 7 seems to have had a separate cause in its own controlled demolition.
