50|$|Agriculture in the Atherton Tablelands {{followed}} {{mining and}} grazing. Although timber drew many settlers to the area, the maize industry was pivotal in {{opening up the}} Atherton Tablelands to agriculture. Maize initially fulfilled the requirements <b>for</b> <b>stockfeed</b> <b>for</b> the mining communities around Herberton and Irvinebank and later, further west.Realising {{that it would be}} difficult to prosper only from planting maize crops, the farmers attempted to find alternate crops. The Atherton Farmers' Associated lobbied the Minister for Agriculture to establish a State Farm to provide research and advice on the growing of different strains of maize. As a result, the Kairi State Farm was established in 1912 and was responsible for much of the experimental work carried out within the maize industry. The Kairi State Farm remained in operation until closed by the Queensland Government in 1935 despite the closure being disputed by the farming community which pointed out to the Government the desirability of having such a facility in a tropical environment.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results from a study which was done to analyse the operation of the demand for and supply of the most important stockfeed proteins (maize, wheat, sorghum, oilseed and fishmeal). A sectoral mathematical model was developed to analyze the economic impact of changes in the market <b>for</b> <b>stockfeed</b> proteins on the South African animal feed market. The model was used to simulate the effects of arbitrarily chosen scenarios on key parameters. Results indicate that models, such as these, are indispensable planning tools in situations of uncertainty. Relatively small changes in important things like production costs, yields and international prices often have profound influences on local production patterns and profitability. It clearly illustrates that in an environment of free domestic trade and increased international trade liberalisation, factors outside of agricultural policy may have much larger impacts than agricultural policy.

A study was thus conducted in two villages with contrasting agro-ecological conditions on Acrisols and Fluvisols in Western Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. The {{aim was to}} investigate the mass of soil and nutrients lost and the factors influencing variation of soil loss due to crop harvesting (SLCH) <b>for</b> <b>Carrot</b> (Daucus carrota), Onion (Allium cepa L.) and Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) under low input agriculture. A total of 108 farm plots were sampled from the two villages. The mean SLCH values were significantly higher <b>for</b> <b>carrot</b> (7. 1 Mg/ha/harvest) than for onion (3. 8 Mg/ha/harvest) than for potatoes (0. 7 Mg/ha/harvest). Soil nutrient losses in kg/ha/harvest were higher <b>for</b> <b>carrot</b> than <b>for</b> onion and potatoes (e. g. 30 N, 0. 1 P, 1. 5 K <b>for</b> <b>carrot</b> vs 6. 3 N, 0. 04 P, 0. 2 K for onion) in Majulai village.
