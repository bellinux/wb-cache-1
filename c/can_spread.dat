5|$|Aphids, {{mealybugs}} {{and other}} invertebrate pests <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> viruses. Symptoms {{vary with the}} species, but a loss of vigour is usual. Cactus virus X has been isolated from S. truncata. There is no treatment for virus diseases; {{it is recommended that}} infected plants be destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Bluebells {{are widely}} planted as garden plants, either among trees or in {{herbaceous}} borders. They flower {{at the same}} time as hyacinths, Narcissus and some tulips. Their ability to reproduce vegetatively, using bulb offsets and seed, means that they <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> rapidly, and may need to be controlled as weeds.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
25|$|HIV/AIDS {{education}} is somewhat limited in Gaborone. 14.5% of Gaborone residents between 10–64 who {{have heard of}} HIV/AIDS believe that HIV <b>can</b> be <b>spread</b> through witchcraft, and 31.3% of the residents believe HIV <b>can</b> be <b>spread</b> through mosquito bites.|$|R

5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lamiaceae <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> {{unchecked}} and become invasive plants. Planting of P.atriplicifolia near wild lands has been discouraged by some gardening guides {{out of concern for}} its potential to spread, but it is not considered invasive, and has been suggested as a substitute for purple loosestrife for this reason.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as the Horn of Africa, may be spared from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E

5|$|Wolves carry ectoparasites and endoparasites, with {{wolves in}} the former Soviet Union having been {{recorded}} to carry at least 50 species. Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects, though the effects may become more serious in sick or malnourished specimens. Parasitic infection in wolves is of particular concern to people, as wolves <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> them to dogs, which in turn can carry the parasites to humans. In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas, the parasites can be spread to livestock.|$|E
5|$|Apical abscesses <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> {{to involve}} {{periodontal}} pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen {{at the bottom}} of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodonal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other animals or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E
5|$|Persona 2: Eternal Punishment is a {{role-playing}} {{game where}} the player takes {{control of a}} group of characters exploring the fictional city of Sumaru. The camera follows the party from an adjustable angled overhead perspective. The city in general is navigated using an overworld map. A key element to the story and gameplay is the Rumor system: after the characters hear a rumor, they <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> that rumor around the city using certain characters, and those rumors can grant the characters special items or other positive or negative effects.|$|E
5|$|Saprotrophic wood-decay fungi are {{the primary}} cause of {{decomposition}} of wood, causing billions of dollars of economic damage each year. Fungal decay, while useful in composting, is destructive of timber exposed to the weather, {{and in the case of}} dry rot caused by Serpula lacrymans, also of timbers in largely dry houses. Some wood-decay fungi such as the honey fungi, species of Armillaria, are parasites of living trees, attacking their roots and eventually killing them, and continuing to decompose the wood when they are dead. Honey fungus is a serious horticultural pest, as it <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> from tree to tree by long strap-shaped rhizomorphs in the soil.|$|E

5|$|Serous {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes}} up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as omental caking) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, papillary structures, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have psammoma bodies. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.|$|E
5|$|The geology in Dwarf Fortress {{is fairly}} accurate. Rocks like olivine or gabbro can be dug up. The topmost layer usually {{consists}} of sand, clay or plain soil—this {{can be used}} for underground farming. Deeper levels will be layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or clusters around the right depth. Gems like tourmalines appear in rare clusters. Water is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having one level of water is the lowest, while a tile with seven is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. Fires <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic seasons in an in-game year: spring, summer, autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} form {{available}} in commercial nurseries is unimproved Banksia integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. It prefers a sunny aspect without exposure to frosts, and tolerates fairly heavy pruning. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 5 to 6 weeks to germinate. Flowering begins at around four to six years from seed. The other subspecies are less well known in cultivation, but are obtainable. Cultivation is presumably similar to B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia, except that B.integrifolia subsp. monticola may be assumed frost-tolerant. Dwarf forms of B.integrifolia are sometimes sold, and a registered prostrate cultivar, Banksia 'Roller Coaster', is available. The latter is a vigorous ground-hugging plant that <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> to 4 or 5 metres across yet remains only 50 centimetres high.|$|E

5|$|Violet {{root rot}} {{caused by the}} fungus Helicobasidium purpureum {{sometimes}} affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor {{the development of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head jerking and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it <b>can</b> <b>spread</b> and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
