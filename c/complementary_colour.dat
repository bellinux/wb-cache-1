60|$|The most eloquent {{descriptions}} I {{have read}} fail {{to convey to}} my mind's eye the forms and colours of snowy mountains, or to my imagination the sensations and impressions that rivet my attention to these sublime phenomena when they are present in reality; and I shall not therefore obtrude any attempt of the kind upon my reader. The latter has probably seen the Swiss Alps, which, though barely possessing half the sublimity, extent, or height of the Himalaya, are yet far more beautiful. In either case he is struck with the precision and sharpness of their outlines, and still more with the wonderful play of colours on their snowy flanks, from the glowing hues reflected in orange, gold and ruby, from clouds illumined by the sinking or rising sun, to the ghastly pallor that succeeds with twilight, when the red seems to give place to its <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> green. Such dissolving-views elude all attempts at description, they are far too aerial to be chained to the memory, and fade from it so fast as to be gazed upon day after day, with undiminished admiration and pleasure, long after the mountains themselves have lost their sublimity and apparent height.|$|E
6000|$|The check {{upon this}} free play of self-assertion, or natural liberty, {{which is the}} {{necessary}} condition for the origin of human society, is the product [28] of organic necessities {{of a different kind}} from those upon which the constitution of the hive depends. One of these is the mutual affection of parent and offspring, intensified by the long infancy of the human species. But the most important is the tendency, so strongly developed in man, to reproduce in himself actions and feelings similar to, or correlated with, those of other men. Man is the most consummate of all mimics in the animal world; none but himself can draw or model; none comes near him in the scope, variety, and exactness of vocal imitation; none is such a master of gesture; while he seems to be impelled thus to imitate for the pure pleasure of it. And there is no such another emotional chameleon. By a purely reflex operation of the mind, we take the hue of passion of those who are about us, or, it may be, the <b>complementary</b> <b>colour.</b> It is not by any conscious [...] "putting one's self in the place" [...] of a joyful or a suffering person that the state of mind we call sympathy usually arises; * indeed, it is often contrary to one's sense of [29] right, and in spite of one's will, that [...] "fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind," [...] or the reverse. However complete may be the indifference to public opinion, in a cool, intellectual view, of the traditional sage, it has not yet been my fortune to meet with any actual sage who took its hostile manifestations with entire equanimity. Indeed, I doubt if the philosopher lives, or ever has lived who could know himself to be heartily despised by, a street boy without some irritation. And, though one cannot justify Haman for wishing to hang Mordecai on such a very high gibbet, yet, really, the consciousness of the Vizier of Ahasuerus, as he went {{in and out of the}} gate, that this obscure Jew had no respect for him, must have been very annoying.** ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Complementary</b> <b>colours</b> {{have been}} {{researched}} for 340 years but {{little is known}} of their role in <b>colour</b> vision. <b>Complementary</b> <b>colours</b> are defined {{as a pair of}} colour stimuli which admix a given white (i. e. cancel all hue). This chapter aims to describe recent research of the roles of <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> in colour vision. Presently, only one role for <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> is accepted in the scientific literature: a colorimetric role in colour mixture. A second role, in chromatic induction, was generally accepted until (erroneously) usurped 50 years ago by the opponent colours theory of chromatic induction. The visual system develops many functions from <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> (whose physiological basis is color-opponent cells in retina and cortex.) For a start, two of the cones (S and L, peaks about 445 and 568 nm) are complementary. The third cone (M, peak about 530 nm) complements the nonspectral hues. This chapter shows complementarism structures ten visual functions. First, <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> are shown to form hue cycle structure. Second, a relative wavelength scale is derived from dominant and complementary wavelengths, extended into nonspectral hues to form an overarching wavelength-based metric over the;whole hue cycle. Third, complementary wavelengths are shown to structure a colour constancy mechanism where constant hues and complementary constant hues form, remarkably, parallel straight lines (related by invariant wavelength ratios) in the plane of wavelength and reciprocal ilIuminant colour temperature. The relative wavelength scale is used to extend this grid-like mechanism into the nonspectrals. A key paper establishes a further seven roles, six by formulating math models for wavelength discrimination, u. mform hue, spectral sensitivity, saturation, chromatic adaptation, chromatic induction, from tbe ratio of either complementary wavelength intervals or complementary radiant powers. Complementary colours' II varied roles (including the colorimetric role) extend over the visual process from cones to cortex. These discrete roles have an overall structural role, in shaping functions to a trimodal framework (ROB peaks, complementary CMY troughs) which facilitates adapting functions to the illuminant. Thus the general role is evidently chromatic adaptation, for the purpose of colour constancy and improved image recognition in different iIIuminants. Given the role of <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> in colour constancy and hue discrimination, they may prove to be central to the visual process. 44 pages(s...|$|R

2500|$|Another {{important}} {{influence on}} {{painting in the}} 19th century was the theory of <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, {{next to each other}} heightened the intensity of each colour [...] "to the apogee of their tonality." [...] In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the <b>complementary</b> <b>colours</b> of each colour in the spectrum. This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his Impression – Sunrise – Fog (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in Régate à Argenteuil (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in Canotage sur la Seine (1879–1880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} colours {{of biological}} communication signals {{raise questions about}} how animals perceive suprathreshold colour differences, and there are long-standing questions about colour preferences and colour categorization by non-human species. This study investigates preferences of foraging poultry chicks (Gallus gallus) as they peck at coloured objects. Work on colour recognition often deals with responses to monochromatic lights and how animals divide the spectrum. We used <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> where the intermediate is grey, and related the chicks' choices to three models {{of the factors that}} may affect the attractiveness. Two models assume that attractiveness is determined by a metric based on the colour discrimination threshold either (i) by chromatic contrast against the background or (ii) relative to an internal standard. An alternative third model is that categorization is important. We tested newly hatched and 9 -day-old chicks with four pairs of (avian) <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> which were orange, blue, red and green for humans. Chromatic contrast was more relevant to newly hatched chicks than to 9 -day-old birds, but in neither case could contrast alone account for preferences; especially for orange over blue. For older chicks, there is evidence for categorization of <b>complementary</b> <b>colours,</b> with a boundary at grey...|$|R

5000|$|In Europe and America {{orange and}} yellow are the colours most {{associated}} with amusement, frivolity and entertainment.

5000|$|Regarding painting, blue is the <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> to orange. As many {{painters}} of the 19th century discovered, blue and orange reinforce each other.

In another letter he wrote simply, [...] "there is no orange without blue." [...] Van Gogh, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and many other impressionist and post-impressionist painters frequently placed orange against azure or cobalt blue, to make both colours appear brighter.|$|E

50|$|When MOED is {{dissolved}} in various liquids, its colour will vary, {{depending on the}} solvent and its polarity. In general, the more polar the solvent, the shorter the wavelengths of the light absorbed will be. When light of a certain colour (wavelength) is absorbed, the solution {{will appear in the}} <b>complementary</b> <b>colour</b> of the one absorbed. Therefore, in water, a highly polar solvent, MOED appears yellow (corresponding to absorbed blue light of wavelengths 435-480 nm), but is purple or blue (corresponding to absorbed green to yellow light of wavelengths 560-595 nm) in acetone, a less polar solvent. The effect stems in part from the stabilization of the ground state of the merocyanine molecule in polar solvents, which increases the energy gap between the ground state and excited states, which corresponds to shorter wavelengths (increased energy) of the absorbed light.|$|E
