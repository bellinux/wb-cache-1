25|$|Furthermore, Eliade {{argues that}} Westerners {{can learn from}} non-Western {{cultures}} to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death. Traditional cultures see suffering and death as a rite of passage. In fact, their initiation rituals often involve a symbolic death and resurrection, or symbolic ordeals followed by relief. Thus, Eliade argues, modern man <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> see his historical ordeals, even death, as necessary initiations into {{the next stage of}} one's existence.|$|E

25|$|Human {{knowledge}} {{is based on}} stories and the human brain consists of cognitive machinery necessary to understand, remember and tell stories. Humans are storytelling organisms that both individually and socially, lead storied lives. Stories mirror human thought as humans think in narrative structures and most often remember facts in story form. Facts {{can be understood as}} smaller versions of a larger story, thus storytelling can supplement analytical thinking. Because storytelling requires auditory and visual senses from listeners, one <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> organize their mental representation of a story, recognize structure of language and express his or her thoughts.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has {{experienced}} a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not {{grow up in the}} tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on how to hold a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> sing Sacred Harp.|$|E

25|$|The party then learns of {{one last}} hope of {{stopping}} Melodia and Malpercio: the Magnus of Life. This power is {{counter to the}} End Magnus which currently empower Malpercio, and that this power was used to create Kalas and his brother, Fee. Kalas, however, was too human for Geldoblame's liking and only had one wing, so Geldoblame had ordered his termination. This leads Georg to blow up his laboratory with explosives and secretly flee to Mira with Kalas and Fee in tow. Due to being a creation of the Magnus of Life, however, Kalas is empowered by it, though he does not yet know how to tap into this power. The group decide to tie up some loose ends from their journey so they <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> harness the Magnus of Life's tremendous power. While they are doing this, it is decided that the islands shall launch a massive assault against Cor Hydrae's barrier. The purpose {{is to create a}} hole in it so Kalas' party can enter by flying the White Dragon into it.|$|E
25|$|Surfing, {{like all}} water sports, carries the {{inherent}} danger of drowning. Anyone {{at any age}} <b>can</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> surf, but {{should have at least}} intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.|$|E
