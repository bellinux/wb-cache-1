The $250,000 half-acre dog park is divided into a 17,000-square-foot section for larger dogs and a 5,500-square-foot part for smaller ones, fenced off from each other. Each area has its own dog exercise centers including agility courses, pet waste stations, benches, separate water fountains for dogs and their owners, and benches.

An asphalt track for dog owners to socialize, run around, or watch their dogs at play surrounds the graveled area. The remainder of Bremen Street Park does not allow dogs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} coarse aggregate characteristics on the time-dependent deformations of High Performances Concretes (HPC). Four concretes made using the same cement paste but incorporating different types of aggregate (rolled siliceous <b>gravel,</b> <b>crushed</b> granite, crushed limestone and <b>crushed</b> siliceous <b>gravels)</b> were studied in order to investigate the effect of aggregate properties on the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, shrinkage and creep. The {{results indicate that the}} aggregate type has a significant effect on creep and shrinkage deformations of HPC. An influence of the shape of aggregate on time-dependent deformations has also been observed. On the basis of these results, long-term behaviour seems to be correlated to the characteristics of the Interfacial Transition Zone (ITZ) strongly depending on the mineralogical nature and properties of aggregates. The experimental results are compared with the values calculated using the current Eurocode 2 model in order to assess the accuracy of the predictions...|$|R

50|$|There is {{a popular}} walkway along much of the Bedford Basin {{waterfront}} that begins at DeWolf park, and continues as the Bedford-Sackville Connector Greenway, a <b>crushed</b> <b>gravel</b> covered trail that meanders along the Sackville River.

5000|$|Prior to the {{developments}} {{leading to the}} use of pulverized coal most boilers utilized grate firing where the fuel was mechanically distributed onto a moving grate {{at the bottom of the}} firebox in a partially <b>crushed</b> <b>gravel</b> like form. Air for combustion was blown upward through the grate carrying the lighter ash and smaller particles of unburned coal up with it, some of which would adhere to the sides of the firebox. In 1918 The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company, later Wisconsin Electric, conducted tests in the use of pulverized coal at its Oneida Street power plant. These experiments helped Fred L. Dornbrook to develop methods of controlling the pulverized coal's tarry ash residues with boiler feed water tube jackets that served to reduce the surface temperature of the firebox walls and allowed the ash deposits be easily removed. This plant became the first central power station in the United States to use pulverized fuel.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the hours}} and days {{following}} the shooting, makeshift memorials to those killed or injured began appearing in several locations on the campus. Many people placed flowers and items of remembrance {{at the base of}} the Drillfield observation podium in front of Burruss Hall. Later, members of Hokies United, an alliance of student organizations on campus created to respond to tragedies placed 32 pieces of Hokie Stone, each labeled with the name of a victim, in a semicircle in front of the Drillfield viewing stand. What was originally termed an [...] "intermediate memorial" [...] was modeled after the makeshift memorial. Thirty-two upright blocks of Hokie Stone were engraved with the names of the victims and placed in a semicircle {{at the base of the}} reviewing stand. The original pieces of Hokie Stone placed by Hokies United were offered to the families of the victims.
