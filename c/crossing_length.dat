40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} application of the Enlargement Law for assessing the breakdown performances of shielded power cables was illustrated in the companion paper (Part 1) of this series. In the present paper, practical case-studies of the proposed theory are presented. The so-called crossing quantities of two cable lines, i. e. <b>crossing</b> <b>length,</b> crossing dielectric strength and crossing breakdown voltage, are analyzed {{on the basis of the}} results of dielectric strength tests performed on cable models insulated with different commercial compounds. In particular, the application is relevant to mini-cable samples realized with two Ethylene-Propylene Rubber (EPR) compounds, and with two cross-Linked Polyethylene (XLPE) compounds, all subjected to standard lightning impulse dielectric strength tests. The estimation of the crossing quantities, performed for various power cable voltage ratings, shows that the <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> – if any - is a strong function of the cable size and voltage rating. Thus the choice of the best compound should be based on a comparison between the value of <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> and the typical lengths of full-size cables. Furthermore, since the crossing quantities are strongly affected by the values of the Weibull parameters estimated from the dielectric strength tests, a sensitivity analysis of such quantities to the uncertainty in the estimation of the Weibull parameters is also carried out...|$|E

Consistency {{measures}} {{provide an}} indication {{on how much}} a dataset satisfies a set of integrity constraints, which is useful for com-paring, integrating and cleaning datasets. This work presents the notion of consistency measures and provides {{an evaluation of the}} cognitive ad-equacy of these measures. It evaluates the impact on the consistency measures of different parameters (overlapping size, external distance, in-ternal distance, <b>crossing</b> <b>length,</b> and touching length) and the relative size of geometries involved in a conflict.

40|$|Cable Supported Bridge (CSB), such as {{suspension}} and cable stayed ones, {{are widely used}} for waterway crossings and the only bridge typology able to surpass long spans. However, {{the effectiveness of their}} cable system greatly reduces and its cost enormously rises as the <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> increases. Submerged Floating Tunnels (SFT) represent an innovative technical solution in the field of waterway crossings, being tubular structures, submerged in the water at a fixed depth, kept in position through anchorage groups made up of cables or tethers linked to the seabed. The anchorage system of SFTs features several striking advantages as it is stable and, above all, provides a supporting condition to the tunnel which is unnoticeably affected by the <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> but it can be less effective and more costly when large water depths are encountered. Even though Cable Supported Bridges and Submerged Floating Tunnels appear to be well distinct structural solutions, several similarities can be noticed between the two: the bridge deck/tunnel is supported through vertical or sloped cables, the load conditions are analogous, the gravity loads on the cable supported bridges being replaced by the upward residual buoyancy in the SFTs and the role of wind being played by currents and waves actions; the tunnel structure can be realized with a multi cell crosssection having a fluid-dynamic shape, as most of the modern cable supported bridges feature. Therefore some of the knowledge and ideas developed in the cable supported bridges field can be conveniently transferred to the SFTs one. As a matter of fact, the cable system configurations in use for cable supported bridges can be combined with the concept of a tunnel floating underwater, giving rise to a new typology of submerged floating tunnel, the Cable Supported Immersed Inversed Bridge (CSIB). This solution seems to be convenient in intermediate to deep waters, featuring several advantages with respect to traditional Cable Supported Bridges under both the economic and the environmental impact points of view. In case of deep waters and <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> belonging to the range of feasibility of CSBs, this new solution features some important advantages also with respect to the “classic” SFT. The aims of this paper are to give a description of the differences and points in common existing between conventional Cable Supported Bridges and SFTs and to illustrate the main features and the potential applications of this alternative submerged floating tunnel solution...|$|E
40|$|This paper, {{the first}} of two {{companion}} papers, describes a new approach to the application of the statistical "enlargement law" to power cable insulation.

The relevance of the so-called <b>crossing</b> <b>length,</b> where one insulating compound performs better below it and another compound above this length, is discussed.

The synchronizability, measured by eigenratio R, can be sharply enhanced by adjusting the only parameter, <b>crossed</b> <b>length</b> m. The eigenratio R is shown very sensitive to the average distance L, and the smaller average distance will lead to better synchronizability. Furthermore, we find that, in a wide interval, the eigenratio R approximately obeys a power-law form as R∼ L^ 1. 5. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Raptors {{primarily}} use soaring-gliding flight which exploits thermals and ridge lifts {{over land}} to reduce energetic costs. However during migration, these birds {{often have to}} cross water surfaces where thermal currents are weak; during these times, birds mainly use flapping (powered) flight which increases energy consumption and mortality risk. As a result, some species have evolved strategies {{to reduce the amount}} of time spent over water by taking extensive detours over land. In this paper, we con-ducted a meta-analysis of water-crossing tendencies in Afro-Palearctic migrating raptors in relation to their morphology, their flight performance, and their phylogenetic relationships. In particular, we considered the aspect ratio (calculated as the wing span squared divided by wing area), the energetic cost of powered flight, and the maximum water <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> regularly performed by adult birds. Our results suggest that energy consumption during powered flight predominately affects the ability of raptors to fly over water surfaces [Current Zoology 61 (6) : 951 – 958, 2015]...|$|E
40|$|The Submerged Floating Tunnel is an {{innovative}} solution for waterway crossings, consisting in a tubular structure floating underwater and fixed in position {{by means of}} tensioned anchorages linked to the seabed. SFTs seem to be particularly suitable to cross waterways located in high seismicity zones, due to their large transversal flexibility and to the additional damping and inertia arising from the water-structure interaction. The seismic behaviour of SFTs features peculiar aspects that deserve to be studied, such as {{the influence of the}} asynchronous ground motion and of the propagation of vertical ground motion in the upper water layer. In order to investigate the structural response and performance of SFTs during an exceptionally severe earthquake, the 1908 Messina (Italy) earthquake is simulated, generating acceleration and velocity time histories in the ground and in the water layer. An extensive campaign of F. E. analyses is carried out, considering several structural configurations, differing for the set up of the anchoring system and the values of the <b>crossing</b> <b>length.</b> A brief overview of the main results of the study is given in this paper...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in the studies of large scale galaxy structures concerns {{the relation of the}} correlation properties of a certain population of objects with those of a selected subsample of it, when the selection is performed by considering physical quantities like luminosity or mass. I consider the case where the sampling is defined as in the simplest thresholding selection scheme of the peaks of a Gaussian random field as well as the case of the extraction of point distributions in high density regions from gravitational N-body simulations. I show that an invariant scale under sampling is represented by the zero-crossing scale of ξ(r). By considering recent measurements in the 2 dF and SDSS galaxy surveys I note that the zero-point <b>crossing</b> <b>length</b> has not yet been clearly identified, while a dependence on the finite sample size related to the integral constraint is manifest. I show that this implies that other length scales derived from ξ(r) are also affected by finite size effects. I discuss the theoretical implications of these results, when considering the comparison of structures formed in N-body simulations and observed in galaxy samples, and different tests to study this problem.

40|$|Railway level {{crossing}} (LX) safety {{continues to be}} one of the most critical issues for railways, despite an ever-increasing focus on improving design and application practices. Accidents at European LXs account for about one-third of the entire railway accidents and result in more than 300 deaths every year in Europe. Due to the non-deterministic causes, the complex operation background and the lack of thorough statistical analysis based on accident/incident data, the risk assessment of LXs remains a challenging task. In the present paper, some LX accident prediction models are developed. Such models allow for highlighting the influence of the main impacting parameters, i. e., the average daily road traffic, the average daily railway traffic, the annual road accidents, the vertical road profile, the horizontal road alignment, the road width, the <b>crossing</b> <b>length,</b> the railway speed limit and the geographic region. The Ordinary Least-Squares (OLS) and Nonlinear Least-Squares (NLS) methods are employed to estimate the respective coefficients of variables in the prediction models, based on the LX accident/incident data. The validation and comparison process is performed through statistical means to examine how well the estimation of the models fits the reality. The outcomes of validation and comparison attest that the improved accident prediction model has statistic-based approbatory quality. Moreover, the improved accident prediction model combined with the NB distribution shows relatively high predictive accuracy of the probability of accident occurrence...|$|E
40|$|A mark-recapture {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine fish passage at 5 concrete box culverts and 5 low-water crossings (concrete slabs vented by culverts) as well as 10 control sites (below a natural riffle) in Flint Hills streams of northeastern Kansas. Additionally, we tested the upstream passage of four fish species native to Great Plains streams (Topeka shiner Notropis topeka, green sunfish Lepomis cyanellus, red shiner Cyprinella lutrensis, and southern redbelly dace Phoxinus erythrogaster) through three simulated crossing designs (box culverts, round corrugated culverts, and natural rock riffles) at water velocities of 0. 1 to 1. 1 m/s in an experimental stream. The field study indicated that cyprinids were twice as likely to move upstream of box culverts than low-water crossings and 1. 4 times as likely to move upstream of control reaches than any crossing type. The best models indicated that the proportion of cyprinids that moved upstream increased with decreased culvert slope and length, perching, and increased culvert width. Our controlled experiment indicated that fish can move through velocities up to 1. 1 m/s in a 1. 86 -m simulated stream and that the proportion of fish that moved upstream did not differ among crossing designs for southern redbelly dace, green sunfish, or Topeka shiner; however, natural rock riffles had lower proportional movements (mean 0. 19) than the box (0. 38) or corrugated culvert designs (0. 43) for red shiners. Water velocity did not affect the proportional upstream movement of any species except that of Topeka shiners, which increased with water velocity. Crossing design alone may not determine fish passage, and water velocities up to 1. 1 m/s may not affect the passage of many Great Plains fishes. Barriers to fish movement {{may be the result of}} other factors (e. g., perching, slope, and <b>crossing</b> <b>length).</b> The use of properly designed and installed crossings has promise in conserving Great Plains stream fishe...|$|E
