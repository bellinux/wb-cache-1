2500|$|A {{motor-generator}} set, or {{the similar}} rotary converter, is not strictly a rectifier {{as it does}} not actually rectify current, but rather generates DC from an AC source. In an [...] "M-G set", the shaft of an AC motor is mechanically coupled {{to that of a}} DC generator. The DC generator produces multiphase alternating currents in its armature windings, which a commutator on the armature shaft converts into a direct current output; or a homopolar generator produces a direct current without the need for a commutator. M-G sets are useful for producing DC for railway traction motors, industrial motors and other high-current applications, and were common in many high-power D.C. uses (for example, <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>lamp</b> projectors for outdoor theaters) before high-power semiconductors became widely available.|$|E

50|$|When first erected, {{the towers}} were {{connected}} to electric generators at the Austin Dam, completed in 1893 {{on the site of}} present-day Tom Miller Dam. In the 1920s their original <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> which were exceedingly bright but time-consuming to maintain, were replaced by incandescent lamps, which gave way in turn to mercury vapor lamps in the 1930s. The mercury vapor lamps were controlled by a switch at each tower's base. During World War II, a central switch was installed, allowing citywide blackouts in case of air raids.|$|R
5000|$|Philco {{was founded}} in 1892 as Helios Electric Company. [...] From its {{inception}} until 1904, the company manufactured <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> As this line of business slowly foundered {{over the last decade}} of the 19th century, the firm experienced increasingly difficult times. As the Philadelphia Storage Battery Company, in 1906 it began making batteries for electric vehicles. They later supplied home charging batteries to the infant radio industry. The Philco brand name appeared in 1919. From 1920 to 1927, all radios were powered by storage batteries which were fairly expensive and often messy in the home.|$|R
40|$|This report covers {{work done}} by the authors on the solar {{simulator}} for the six-foot diameter space simulator presently in use at JPL. The space simulator was made by modifying an existent vacuum chamber and uses carbon arc lamps for solar simulation. All Ranger vehicles flown to date have been tested in this facility. The report also contains a series of appendixes covering various aspects of space-simulation design and use. Some of these appendixes contain detailed analyses of space-simulator design criteria. Others cover the techniques used in studying <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>lamps</b> and in applying them as solar simulation...|$|R
40|$|In late 1959 a {{spectrophotometer}} laboratory {{was established}} at JPL {{to be used}} as a support for temperature-control programs. The immediate task was spectroradiometric measurements of light sources to be used in a simulated-deep-space environment chamber. It was also necessary to have permanent provisions for measuring reflectances of surfaces for the calculation of solar absorptance alpha, and thermal emittance epsilon. The spectral distribution of an unknown source, in this case a Ventarc <b>carbon-arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> was derived from the ratio of detector outputs (with monochromatic light) of the arc lamp and a tungsten lamp, and the spectral intensity of the tungsten lamp. The tungsten lamp is a ribbonfilament lamp calibrated from 0. 25 to 2. 6 microns. A recording of pen deflection (linearly proportional to detector output) of each source over the visible and near infrared range is made with all parameters (slit width, amplifier gain, and source focusing) identical; then the ratios are computed at discrete wavelengths from these recordings. Because the spectral intensities of the tungsten lamp and a solar simulator are very different in most of the range, an adjustable slit is placed immediately in front of the detector to obtain comparable pen deflections for the two sources. This slit is set by means of a feeler gage, and the attenuation coefficient is evaluated by a transmission measurement...|$|E
