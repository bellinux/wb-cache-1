5|$|<b>Cardiomyopathy</b> is a {{noticeable}} {{deterioration of the}} heart muscle's ability to contract, {{which can lead to}} heart failure. The causes of many types of <b>cardiomyopathy</b> are poorly understood; some identified causes include alcohol, toxins, systemic disease such as sarcoidosis, and congenital conditions such as HOCM. The types of <b>cardiomyopathy</b> are described according to how they affect heart muscle. <b>Cardiomyopathy</b> can cause the heart to become enlarged (hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy),</b> constrict the outflow tracts of the heart (restrictive <b>cardiomyopathy),</b> or cause the heart to dilate and impact the efficiency of its beating (dilated <b>cardiomyopathy).</b> HOCM is often undiagnosed and can cause sudden death in young athletes.|$|E
5|$|However, chronic cobalt {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} {{serious health problems}} at doses {{far less than the}} lethal dose. In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize beer foam in Canada led to a peculiar form of toxin-induced <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> which {{came to be known as}} beer drinker's <b>cardiomyopathy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} doxorubicin is dilated <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of <b>cardiomyopathy</b> is dependent on its cumulative dose, with an incidence about 4% when the dose of doxorubicin is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the dose is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the dose exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis. The drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity.|$|E
40|$|Non-ischemic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> {{are defined}} as either primary or {{secondary}} diseases of the myocardium resulting in cardiac dysfunction. While primary <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are confined to the heart and can be genetic or acquired, secondary <b>cardiomyopathies</b> show involvement of the heart {{as a manifestation of}} an underlying systemic disease including metabolic, inflammatory, granulomatous, infectious, or autoimmune entities. Non-ischemic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are currently classified as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, or unclassifiable, including left ventricular non-compaction. Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) not only has the capability to assess cardiac morphology and function, but also the ability to detect edema, hemorrhage, fibrosis, and intramyocardial deposits, providing a valuable imaging tool in the characterization of non-ischemic <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> This pictorial essay shows {{some of the most important}} non-ischemic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> with an emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging features...|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of molecular mechanisms of <b>cardiomyopathies</b> has been elucidated from genetic animal models. Induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) can provide a platform to improve our {{understanding of}} familial <b>cardiomyopathies</b> diseases. iPSCs are a type of pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells. Identification of mutations in patients with inherited <b>cardiomyopathies</b> has revealed substantial molecular complexity. In spite of the complexity, the advances of iPSC-based technology may improve our understanding of familial <b>cardiomyopathies...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{meeting on}} <b>cardiomyopathies</b> {{was held in}} Geneva on 25 - 27 March 1985 to review the state of {{understanding}} concerning these diseases and to update the information and recommendations contained in the published report of the WHO Expert Committee on <b>Cardiomyopathies</b> which had met in 1983. Particular emphasis was given to discussing new scientific knowledge, priorities for etiological research, proposals for cooperation between research centres in developed and developing countries, early detection of <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> and possible population studies related to the disease...|$|R
5|$|Heart: <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (weakness of {{the heart}} muscle) is a rare but {{recognized}} problem in Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|In itself, NSML {{is not a}} {{life-threatening}} diagnosis, most people diagnosed with the condition live normal lives. Obstructive <b>cardiomyopathy</b> and other pathologic findings involving the cardiovascular system may be a {{cause of death in}} those whose cardiac deformities are profound.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} neuroacanthocytosis {{syndrome}}s, McLeod syndrome causes movement disorder, cognitive impairment and psychiatric symptoms. The particular features of McLeod syndrome are heart {{problems such as}} arrhythmia and dilated <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (enlarged heart).|$|E
40|$|<b>Cardiomyopathies</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of heart muscle diseases {{with a variety}} of specific phenotypes. According to the contemporary European Society of Cardiology classification, they are classified into hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular (ARVC), restrictive (RCM), and unclassified <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> Each class is aetiologically further categorized into inherited (familial) and non-inherited (non-familial) forms. There is substantial evidence that biological sex is a strong modulator of the clinical manifestation of these <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> and sex-specific characteristics are detectable in all classes. For the clinician, {{it is important to know}} the sex-specific aspects of clinical disease expression and the potential modes of inheritance or the hereditary influences underlying the development of <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> since these may aid in diagnosing such diseases in both sexes...|$|R
40|$|Diseases of the {{myocardium}} can {{be classified}} either as primary or secondary. Primary <b>cardiomyopathies</b> include idiopathic congestive or hypertropic forms.

40|$|<b>Cardiomyopathies</b> are a {{major cause}} of heart disease. Not only the patients, but also their {{families}} are severely burdened by these illnesses. In the past decade, studies revealed the heterogeneity of these diseases in terms of clinical presentation, as well as their genetics. Studies done in the last few decades revealed a new concept of complex manifestation of <b>cardiomyopathies</b> with different heterogeneity level, penetration, and inheritance. The incomplete penetrance, genetic heterogeneity, and variable expression in <b>cardiomyopathies</b> paradoxically raise hopes that the development of novel disease modifying therapies may be achievable...|$|R
5|$|Multiple {{mutations}} in cTnI {{have been found}} to cause cardiomyopathies. cTnI mutations account for approximately 5% of familial hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> cases and to date, more than 20 myopathic mutations of cTnI have been characterized.|$|E
5|$|<b>Cardiomyopathy,</b> {{heart murmur}} and other cardiac issues {{were present in}} 17.2% of {{responses}} while dermatolic conditions such as dermatitis or alopecia were reported by 10.8% of responses.

40|$|<b>Cardiomyopathies</b> {{represent}} an important cause of cardiovascular {{morbidity and mortality}} due to heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. A majority of hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> (HCM) and at least 30 % of dilated <b>cardiomyopathies</b> (DCM) are familial forms, with most often an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Over the last 15 years, our knowledge on the genetic bases of these diseases has considerably improved. <b>Cardiomyopathies</b> are characterized by a great genetic heterogeneity at both allelic and non-allelic levels. Hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are mainly linked to mutations on genes encoding sarcomeric proteins, and beta myosin heavy chain and myosin binding protein C gene mutations account for about 80 % of genotyped cases. Familial DCM is associated with mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins but also other proteins of the myocyte, such as cytoskeletal or nuclear membrane proteins. Due to the genetic heterogeneity and the variable clinical expressivity of these diseases, the relations between genotype and phenotype remain complex, but the age of onset, the clinical severity, or associated phenotypes may be, at least in part, related to the precise gene mutations. Therefore, besides {{a better understanding of}} the molecular basis for cardiac remodeling and heart failure, the genetic analysis of <b>cardiomyopathies</b> is going to play an increasing role in the routine management of these patients in the following years, particularly in HCM...|$|R

5|$|Born Kathy Petro, {{she grew}} up in a horse racing family from Massachusetts and married a fellow horseman, Tim Ritvo, in 1990. Kathy and Tim ran a race horse {{training}} operation in Florida, and In 2010 she took it over solo when Tim became part of the management of Gulfstream Park race track. Her accomplishments came against the backdrop of having been diagnosed with <b>cardiomyopathy</b> in 2001 and receiving a heart transplant in 2008. In spite of the medication regime and immunity issues that transplant recipients face, she lives a normal life as a horse trainer and shows no signs of organ rejection.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} such as dilated <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> where the heart becomes weakened and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, which {{is a type of}} abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the damage done by}} the bullet, the autopsy also found that the President was suffering from <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (fatty degeneration of the heart muscle). This would have weakened his heart and made him less able to recover from such an injury, and was thought to be related to his overweight frame and lack of exercise. Modern scholars generally believe that McKinley died of pancreatic necrosis, a condition that is difficult to treat today and would have been completely impossible for the doctors of his time.|$|E
30|$|Cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (CMR) has undergone considerable technology advances in recent years, {{so that it is}} now entering into mainstream cardiac imaging practice. In particular, CMR is proving to be a valuable imaging tool in the detection, morphological assessment and functional assessment of <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> Although our understanding of this broad group of heart disorders continues to expand, it is an evolving group of entities, with the rarer <b>cardiomyopathies</b> remaining poorly understood or even unclassified.

40|$|Most hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathies</b> and {{a subset}} of dilated and {{arrhythmogenic}} right ventricular <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are familial diseases.

DNA analysis in <b>cardiomyopathies</b> can help diagnose borderline cases, and cascade screening of family members can identify individuals at risk. Genotype-phenotype relations are comlex, but some associations, such as septal morphology, electrocardiogram parameters, and additional cardiac and other manifestations, point toward certain genes. Such features help target DNA testing {{and the results of}} DNA analysis con be used in making clinical decision...|$|R

5|$|One {{danger of}} {{attempting}} to consume hallucinogenic or other wild mushrooms, especially for novice mushroom hunters, {{is the possibility of}} misidentification with toxic species. In one noted case, an otherwise healthy young Austrian man mistook the poisonous Cortinarius rubellus for P.semilanceata. As a result, he suffered end-stage renal failure, and required a kidney transplant. In another instance, a young man developed cardiac abnormalities similar to those seen in Takotsubo <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> characterized by a sudden temporary weakening of the myocardium. A polymerase chain reaction-based test to specifically identity P.semilanceata was reported by Polish scientists in 2007.|$|E

Based {{on the first two}} episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would endure a worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a heart transplant. The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with <b>cardiomyopathy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated <b>cardiomyopathy,</b> which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} and, among them, channelopathies and <b>cardiomyopathies</b> are a {{major cause}} of death worldwide. The molecular and genetic defects underlying these cardiac disorders are complex, leading to a large range of structural and functional heart phenotypes. Identification of molecular and functional mechanisms disrupted by mutations causing channelopathies and <b>cardiomyopathies</b> is essential to understanding the link between an altered gene and clinical phenotype. The development of animal models has been proven to be efficient for functional studies in channelopathies and <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> In particular, the Drosophila model has been largely applied for deciphering the molecular and cellular pathways affected in these inherited cardiac disorders and for identifying their genetic modifiers. Here we review the utility and the main contributions of the fruitfly models for the better understanding of channelopathies and <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> We also discuss the investigated pathological mechanisms and the discoveries of evolutionarily conserved pathways which reinforce the value of Drosophila in modeling human cardiac diseases...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated <b>cardiomyopathy.</b> The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Familial dilated <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} {{systolic}} heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM. The cTnC mutations associated with DCM thus far are Y5H, Q50R, D75Y, M103I, D145E (also associated with HCM), I148V, and G159D. Of these, Q50R and G159D co-segregated with disease in affected family members, increasing confidence that they are clinically significant mutations. The biochemical consequences of thin filament DCM-associated mutations are less well established than for HCM, {{although there has been}} some suggestion that some of the mutations abolish the calcium desensitizing effect of cTnI phosphorylation at Ser22/23. This may be because some mutations disrupt the precise positioning of cNTnC for triggering muscle contraction when cTnI is unphosphorylated.|$|E
5|$|Hypertrophic <b>cardiomyopathy</b> (HCM) is {{a common}} {{condition}} (prevalence >1:500) characterized by abnormal thickening of the ventricular muscle, classically in the intraventricular septal wall. HCM {{is described as a}} disease of the sarcomere, because mutations in the contractile proteins of the sarcomere have been identified in about half of patients with HCM. The cTnC mutations that have been associated with HCM are A8V, L29Q, A31S, C84Y, D145E. In all cases, the mutation was identified in a single patient, so additional genetic testing is needed to confirm or refute the clinical significance of these mutations. With most of these mutations (and with HCM-associated thin filament mutations in general), an increase in cardiac calcium sensitivity has been observed.|$|E
30|$|We {{observed}} that {{ischemic heart disease}} {{was by far the}} most common cause of cardiac arrest, while non-structural <b>cardiomyopathies</b> accounted for a very low part of diagnosis. Young patients victims of a sudden unexplained death shared similar baseline characteristics and outcome with patients with non-structural <b>cardiomyopathies.</b> Focusing on this subgroup of patients for further investigations and follow-up may help in managing themselves and their relatives.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cardiomyopathies</b> {{have either}} a primary (without {{associated}} anomalies) or a secondary origin. They are classified in three groups {{according to their}} anatomy and function: hypertrophic, dilated or restrictive.

Restrictive <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> arrhythmogenic right ventricle, non compaction and Uhl's anomaly will not be dealt with in detail as they are very seldom in children...|$|R
50|$|DCM {{is one of}} the <b>cardiomyopathies,</b> a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect primarily the heart muscle. Different <b>cardiomyopathies</b> have different causes and affect the heart in different ways. In DCM a portion of the myocardium is dilated, often without any obvious cause. Left or right ventricular systolic pump function of the heart is impaired, leading to progressive heart enlargement via ventricular hypertrophy and ventricular dilation, a process called ventricular remodeling.|$|R
