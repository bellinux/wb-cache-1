50|$|Theoretical {{underpinnings}} of <b>Charles</b> E. <b>Osgood's</b> semantic differential have {{roots in the}} medieval controversy between the nominalists and realists.

5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, <b>Charles</b> E. <b>Osgood</b> {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|R
40|$|Image of Pärnu {{among the}} school-leavers of Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School and Pärnu Ülejõe Gymnasium. Main purpose of bachelor’s thesis was to {{research}} and analyze image dimensions of Pärnu among school-leavers of two different Pärnu’s schools. Author is also comparing results with Aune Past’s master’s thesis’ results from 1999. Bachelor’s thesis consists of four chapters. The first one gives an overview of different theoretical discourses that explain {{the concept of the}} image. It also explains formation of image and different methods of researching it. Second chapter explains research methods, research questions and hypothesis. Pärnu’s background as object of research is also included. Third chapter is dedicated to results and analyzes of the research. And last chapter is conclusion of the paper. Research questions were: do the dimensions of image differ among two different school students. How could the image of Pärnu be better. Is the image of Pärnu depending on wellbeing of local people. Hypothesis were: Pärnu’s public image is positive. The image is different in Pärnu Ülejõe Gymnasium and Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School. Pärnu Sütevaka Grammar School’s students are more critical about the society. As quantitative research method was used <b>Charles</b> <b>Osgood’s</b> semantic differentiation with questionnaire. Semi-structure interviews with entrants of both schools were used as qualitative method. Semantic differentiation revealed that Pärnu is perceived as “own”, “warm” and “developing”. And gender, school and educational success was not decisive. Interviews proved the results of semantic differentiation, but students also brought out facts that have negative impact on Pärnu’s image. Most often was mentioned the meer of Pärnu. Also became clear that the image of Pärnu depends on wellbeing of local people as they might be also “the important other” who form the public image of Pärnu...|$|R
50|$|Heise works {{extensively}} with <b>Charles</b> E. <b>Osgood's</b> {{semantic differential}} for measuring affective associations of words (connotative meanings). His dissertation included semantic differential measurements for 1,000 frequent English words, {{and he and}} his students compiled four more lexicons in the United States since then, each containing affective measurements for 1,250 or more English words. Heise used the affective measurements to begin quantitative studies of impression formation while at the University of Wisconsin. The impression formation research seeks empirically based equations for predicting how various kinds of events influence individuals' feelings about people, behaviors, and settings. This research employs structural equation modeling and path analysis (statistics), as discussed by Heise in his book Causal Analysis. In 1978 Heise reported research results regarding affective meanings and impression formation in Computer-Assisted Analysis of Social Action. An account of similar work over the prior century was provided in his 2010 book Surveying Cultures.|$|R
