Large {{telegraphy}} providers began to develop systems that used telephone-like rotary dialling to connect teletypewriters. These machines were called [...] "Telex" [...] (TELegraph EXchange).

2500|$|On March 10, 1891, Almon Brown Strowger, an {{undertaker}} in Kansas City, Missouri, patented the stepping switch, {{a device}} {{which led to}} the automation of telephone <b>circuit</b> <b>switching.</b> While there were many extensions and adaptations of this initial patent, the one best known consists of 10 levels or banks, each having 10 contacts arranged in a semicircle. When used with a rotary telephone dial, each pair of digits caused the shaft of the central contact [...] "hand" [...] of the stepping switch to first step (ratchet) up one level for each pulse in the first digit and then to swing horizontally in a contact row with one small rotation for each pulse in the next digit.|$|E

40|$|Hybrid <b>circuit</b> and packet <b>switching</b> {{for data}} center {{networking}} (DCN) has received considerable research attention recently. A hybrid-switched DCN employs a much faster <b>circuit</b> <b>switch</b> that is reconfigurable with a nontrivial cost, {{and a much}} slower packet switch that is reconfigurable with no cost, to interconnect its racks of servers. The research problem is, given a traffic demand matrix (between the racks), how to compute a good <b>circuit</b> <b>switch</b> configuration schedule so {{that the vast majority}} of the traffic demand is removed by the <b>circuit</b> <b>switch,</b> leaving a remaining demand matrix that contains only small elements for the packet switch to handle. In this paper, we propose two new hybrid switch scheduling algorithms under two different scheduling constraints. Our first algorithm, called 2 -hop Eclipse, strikes a much better tradeoff between the resulting performance (of the hybrid switch) and the computational complexity (of the algorithm) than the state of the art solution Eclipse/Eclipse++.
