One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can <b>claim</b> <b>I</b> denied it.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, most of the first season DVD reviews were positive towards the series as being one of the best American comedy shows. In a DVD review by Bill Treadway for DVD Verdict, he called the show [...] "the best animated American comedy since The Simpsons, it is a <b>claim</b> <b>I</b> stand behind." [...] Treadway said the show is [...] "accessible to all" [...] that [...] "adults will enjoy the witty satire and sly in-jokes subtly inserted into every episode." [...] He also mentioned that [...] "children will love the bright colors, spunky pace, and lively characters" [...] and that [...] "parents will {{not have to worry about}} violence or crude humor." [...] Jason Bovberg of DVD Talk called SpongeBob SquarePants [...] "the coolest Saturday morning cartoon since the heyday of Warner Bros." [...] In a separate review for the season's DVD release, Bovberg [...] "highly recommended" [...] the set and wrote [...] "I love the show so much, I can't see any way around giving this one a recommendation." [...] Bovberg was particular on the exclusion of the pilot episode [...] "Help Wanted", saying [...] "But why is 'Help Wanted' missing? I suppose I'll have to buy a [...] "theme" [...] disc down the road to secure that one. Sigh." [...] Furthermore, he described it as [...] "the only disappointment of the set." [...] Ron J. Epstein, also from DVD Talk, said that the character of SpongeBob is [...] "one of the strangest cartoon characters I have ever had the pleasure to watch." [...] He said that [...] "Unlike most cartoons today, SpongeBob SquarePants caters to both a child and an adult audience." ...|$|E
