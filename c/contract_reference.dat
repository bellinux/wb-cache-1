The influence of the concrete compressive strength, CFRP stiffness, geometric confinement arrangement and loading type on the compressive behaviour of reinforced concrete column elements of circular cross section up to their failure was assessed. A uniaxial stress-strain constitutive model is proposed, and the results obtained from the experimental tests were used to calibrate some of the parameters of this model, and to appraise the model performance. This model allows the simulation of reinforced concrete members by using Timoshenko one-dimensional elements, {{in the context of}} the finite element method (fibre model).

40|$|Abstract. ‘International subcontracting’ (sous-traitance de marché or de {{services}} or sous-traité, sous-entreprise, Zulieferwesen or Zuliefervertrag, subappalto or subfornitura) {{refers to a}} widespread contractual practice of the modern construction industry, at {{the very core of}} the ‘self-made law of building industry’, which has so extensively contributed {{to the development of the}} lex mercatoria. As often described in literature, international subcontracting denotes an agreement, entered into by a contractor and a third party that undertakes to perform all or a part of the contractor’s obligations required by an employer under an actual or proposed cross-border construction <b>contract.</b> <b>Reference</b> hereby shall be made to private procurements only, since subcontracts related to public procurements almost exclusively involve administrative concerns, which deserve a separate appreciation. International subcontracts, because of the contractual connection to the construction contract, raise significant issues of private international law that require, subject to certain conditions, a deviation from the classic standard of neutrality and blindness of conflict rules in contracts. Indeed, only conflict rules likely to support the substantial private interests within the contractual connection can properly keep the focus on the functional unity that closely connects international subcontracts and construction contracts, which escape mechanical allocation by means of hard and fast conflict rules. To this purpose, a recent wave of scholarship should be taken into account, which suggests a functional approach to conflict rules, which focuses on the nature of the relationships between the parties, rather than on the territorial scope of the applicable rules, to achieve the application of the law ‘which is presumed to be most concerned with the party in need of protection’. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Hart and Moore (2008) {{introduce}} new behavioral assumptions that can explain long term contracts and {{important aspects of}} the employment relation. However, so far there exists no direct evidence that supports these assumptions and, in particular, Hart and Moore’s notion that <b>contracts</b> provide <b>reference</b> points. In this paper, we examine experimentally the behavioral forces stipulated in their theory. The evidence confirms the model’s prediction that there is a tradeoff between rigidity and flexibility in a trading environment with incomplete contracts and ex ante uncertainty about the state of nature. Flexible contracts – which would dominate rigid contracts under standard assumptions – cause a significant amount of shading on ex post performance while under rigid contracts much less shading occurs. Thus, although rigid contracts rule out trading in some states of the world, parties frequently implement them. While our results are broadly consistent with established behavioral concepts, they cannot easily be explained by existing theories. The experiment appears to reveal a new behavioral force: ex ante competition legitimizes the terms of a contract, and aggrievement and shading occur mainly about outcomes within the <b>contract.</b> <b>Contracts,</b> <b>Reference</b> Points, Experiment...|$|R

40|$|Exploitation {{of plant}} {{lignocellulosic}} biomass is hampered by our {{ignorance of the}} molecular basis for its properties such as strength and digestibility. Xylan, the most prevalent non-cellulosic polysaccharide, binds to cellulose microfibrils. The nature of this interaction remains unclear, despite its importance. Here we show {{that the majority of}} xylan, which forms a threefold helical screw in solution, flattens into a twofold helical screw ribbon to bind intimately to cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall. $^{ 13 }$C solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, supported by in silico predictions of chemical shifts, shows both two- and threefold screw xylan conformations are present in fresh Arabidopsis stems. The twofold screw xylan is spatially close to cellulose, and has similar rigidity to the cellulose microfibrils, but reverts to the threefold screw conformation in the cellulose-deficient irx 3 mutant. The discovery that induced polysaccharide conformation underlies cell wall assembly provides new principles to understand biomass properties.

Although NMR offers exquisite sensitivity to the local, atomic-scale structure, making it an ideal tool for the characterisation of disordered materials, the low natural abundance of 17 O (0. 037 %) necessitates expensive isotopic enrichment to acquire spectra on a reasonable timescale. Using dry gel conversion and a novel steaming method we show that cost-effective and atom-efficient enrichment of MOFs is possible, and that high-resolution 17 O NMR spectra are sensitive both to the structural forms of the MOF and the presence of guest molecules. For mixed-metal forms of MIL- 53, NMR can also provide information on the final composition of the materials (notably different to that of the initial starting material) and the preference for cation clustering/ordering within the MOFs. For Al, Ga MIL- 53, the distribution of cations results in a mixed-pore form upon exposure to water, unlike the different structures seen for the corresponding end members. This work shows that as good levels of enrichment can be achieved at reasonable cost, 17 O NMR spectroscopy should be an invaluable tool for the study of these important functional materials.

Although a popular choice for obtaining high-resolution solid-state NMR spectra of quadrupolar nuclei, the inherently low sensitivity of the multiple-quantum magic-angle spinning (MQMAS) experiment has limited its application for nuclei with low receptivity or when the available sample volume is limited. A number of methods have been introduced in the literature to attempt to address this problem. Recently, we have introduced an alternative, automated approach, based on numerical simulations, for generating amplitude-modulated pulses (termed FAM-N pulses) to enhance the efficiency of the triple- to single-quantum conversion step within MQMAS. This results in efficient pulses that can be used without experimental reoptimisation, ensuring that this method is particularly suitable for challenging nuclei and systems. In this work, we investigate the applicability of FAM-N pulses to a wider variety of systems, and their robustness under more challenging experimental conditions. These include experiments performed under fast MAS, nuclei with higher spin quantum numbers, samples with multiple distinct sites, low-γ nuclei and nuclei subject to large quadrupolar interactions.

In this work, we investigate the observation of homonuclear 31 P J couplings in organochalcogen heterocycles, which occur between 31 P in two separate molecules, confirming without doubt their through-space nature. The presence of this interaction is even more surprising for one compound, where it occurs between crystallographically-equivalent species. Although crystallographically-equivalent species need not be magnetically equivalent in the solid state, owing to the presence of anisotropic interactions, we demonstrate that it is not the shielding anisotropy that lifts magnetic equivalence in this case, but the presence of heteronuclear couplings to 77 Se.

Somatic cells are an important component naturally present in milk, and somatic cell count is used {{as an indicator of}} udder health and milk quality. The role of somatic cells in dairy processes and products is ill-defined in most studies because the role of these cells combines also the concomitance of physicochemical modifications of milk, bacterial count, and the udder inflammation in the presence of high somatic cell count. The aim of this review is to focus on the role of somatic cells themselves and of endogenous enzymes from somatic cells in milk, in dairy transformation processes, and in characteristics of final products overcoming biases due to other factors. The immune function of somatic cells in the udder defense and their protective role in milk will be primarily considered. Different characteristics of milk induced by various somatic cell counts, types, and their endogenous enzymes influencing directly the technological properties of milk and the final quality of dairy products will be discussed as well. By comparing methods used in other studies and eliminating biases due to other factors not considered in these studies, a new approach has been suggested to evaluate the effective role of somatic cells on dairy processes and products. In addition, this new approach allows the characterization of somatic cells and their endogenous enzymes and, in future research, will allow the clarification of mechanisms involved in the release of these components from somatic cells during dairy processes, particularly in cheese technologies...|$|E

Stellar evolutionary models simulate well binary stars when individual stellar mass and system metallicity are known. The mass can be derived directly from observations only {{in the case of}} multiple stellar systems, mainly binaries. Yet, the number of such stars for which accurate stellar masses are available is rather small. The main goal of this project is to provide realistic mass estimates for a homogeneous sample of about a thousand FGK single stars, using four different methods and techniques. We present the masses inferred according to each one of these methods as well as a final mass estimate consisting in the median of the four mass estimates. The procedures evaluated here include the use of stellar evolutionary models, mass–luminosity relation and surface gravity spectroscopic observations. By combining the results obtained with different methods, we determine the best mass value for each individual star, as well as the associated error budget. Our results confirm the expected consistency between the different mass estimation methods. None the less, for masses above 1. 2 M⊙, the spectroscopic surface gravities seem to overestimate the mass. This result may be a consequence of the spectroscopic surface gravities used in this analysis. Nevertheless, this problem is minimized by {{the fact that we have}} several approaches available for deriving stellar masses. Moreover, we suggest an empirical procedure to overcome this issue.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the co-composting process of wastes from the winery and distillery industry with animal manures, using the classical chemical methods traditionally used in composting studies together with advanced instrumental methods (thermal analysis, FT-IR and CPMAS 13 C NMR techniques), to evaluate {{the development of the}} process {{and the quality of the}} end-products obtained. For this, three piles were elaborated by the turning composting system, using as raw materials winery-distillery wastes (grape marc and exhausted grape marc) and animal manures (cattle manure and poultry manure). The classical analytical methods showed a suitable development of the process in all the piles, but these techniques were ineffective to study the humification process during the composting of this type of materials. However, their combination with the advanced instrumental techniques clearly provided more information regarding the turnover of the organic matter pools during the composting process of these materials. Thermal analysis allowed to estimate the degradability of the remaining material and to assess qualitatively the rate of OM stabilization and recalcitrant C in the compost samples, based on the energy required to achieve the same mass losses. FT-IR spectra mainly showed variations between piles and time of sampling in the bands associated to complex organic compounds (mainly at 1420 and 1540 cm- 1) and to nitrate and inorganic components (at 875 and 1384 cm- 1, respectively), indicating composted material stability and maturity; while CPMAS 13 C NMR provided semi-quantitatively partition of C compounds and structures during the process, being especially interesting their variation to evaluate the biotransformation of each C pool, especially in the comparison of recalcitrant C vs labile C pools, such as Alkyl /O-Alkyl ratio.

A total of 155 faecal samples from small mammals were inoculated in Slanetz-Bartley agar supplemented or not with vancomycin (Van-SB/SB plates). The antimicrobial susceptibility profile to 12 antimicrobials and the presence of 20 antimicrobial resistance genes was analyzed. The structure of Tn. 1546 and the presence of gelE, cylA, asa, esp and hyl genes was studied. Multilocus-sequence-typing (MLST) technique was also performed. VRE isolates were recovered in Van-SB plates in 11 samples. Two samples contained vanB 2 -positive E. faecalis isolates of lineage ST 6, which showed a multiresistance phenotype and harboured the virulence genes gelE and asa. One sample contained a vancomycin-resistant E. faecium isolate of the new lineage ST 915, with the vanA gene included into Tn. 1546 (truncated with IS. 1542 and IS. 1216 elements). The vanB 2 and vanA isolates were obtained from Rattus rattus.

One hundred and forty-seven vancomycin-susceptible-enterococcal isolates were obtained in SB plates, and E. faecalis and E. faecium were the most frequent detected species. This is the first report of vanB 2 -containing enterococci in wild animals.

The assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (ADOR) mechanism is a recent method for preparing inorganic framework materials and, in particular, zeolites. This flexible approach has enabled the synthesis of isoreticular families of zeolites with unprecedented continuous control over porosity, and the design and preparation of materials that would have been difficult—or even impossible—to obtain using traditional hydrothermal techniques. Applying the ADOR process to a parent zeolite with the UTL framework topology, for example, has led to six previously unknown zeolites (named IPC-n, where n[*]=[*] 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10). To realize the full potential of the ADOR method, however, a further understanding of the complex mechanism at play is needed. Here, we probe the disassembly, organization and reassembly steps of the ADOR process through a combination of in[*]situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction experiments. We further use the insight gained to explain the formation of the unusual structure of zeolite IPC- 6. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
