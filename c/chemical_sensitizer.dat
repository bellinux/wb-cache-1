40|$|The anlm~Ll usually {{chosen for}} studies on the {{induction}} of contact sensitivity is the guinea pig. Factors which are considered (1 - 4) to be indispensable in this animal include the presence for the first 16 - 24 hr of the area of skin on which the <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer</b> is applied, {{the integrity of the}} lymphatic pathway, and the presence of the regional lymph node during the first 4 days following application of the sensitizer. In contact sensitization it is presumed that the affected area of skin is in some way rendered antigenic and two possibilities have been suggested (5) as to where the initial process of recognition of this antigenicity takes place. The first possibility is that the antigen itself passes via the lymphatics to the draining lymph node and stimulates the lymphocytes therein. The second possibility is that small lymphocytes become sensitized by direct contact with the antigen in the skin before passing to the d~inlng lymph node.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{immunological}} specificity of delayed hypersensitivity reactions in the guinea pig with conjugates of haptens with foreign proteins (1, 2), or with non-antigenic guinea pig serum albumin (3), have demonstrated the important contribution of the carrier protein to the specificity of these reactions. This behavior contrasts sharply with the specificity of the antibodies which are later formed in the serum and which react indifferently in vitro with all protein conjugates of the same hapten, provided the number of hapten groups is adequate and their linkage to the protein carrier is similar. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as Arthus or passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA), t which are mediated by serum antibodies show an immunological specificity also limited to the haptens and a complete lack of protein carrier specificity (3). The importance of "carrier specificity " in delayed hypersensitivity reactions to autologous protein conjugates suggested that contact sensitivity to simple chemicals {{can be considered as}} a form of partial autosensitization to a number of autologous conjugates of the <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer</b> (3).

However, individuals with AD {{have been shown}} to make effective virus-specific Th 1 responses raising the possibility that the skin itself contributes to driving the AD Th 2 immuno-phenotype. Therefore, to explore the programming of immunological sensitization by the skin, we examined the outcome of sensitization through non-lesional skin of AD and healthy controls. Volunteers, (controls, AD with Filaggrin gene (FLG) mutations (ADFM) and AD without FLG mutations (ADWT)) were sensitized by cutaneous application of 2, 4 -dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), a small, highly lipophilic <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer.</b> At the doses tested, DNCB showed equal penetration into skin of all groups. Clinical reactions to DNCB were significantly reduced in AD. Although both controls and AD made systemic DNCB-specific Th 1 responses, these were reduced in AD and associated with significantly Th 2 -skewed DNCB-specific T cell responses. Th 2 skewing was seen in both ADFM and ADWT with no difference between these groups. After 3 months DNCB-specific Th 2 responses were persistent in AD, and Th 1 responses persisted in controls. These data provide evidence that when antigen penetration is not limiting, AD skin has a specific propensity to Th 2 programming suggesting the existence of altered skin immune signaling which is AD-specific and independent of FLG status...|$|E

Historically, <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers</b> have been assessed mainly by in vivo methods, however, recently enforced European legislations urge and promote the development of animal-free test methods able to predict <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers.</b> Recently, we presented a predictive biomarker signature in the myeloid cell line MUTZ- 3, for assessment of skin sensitizers.

40|$|Asthma {{has been}} {{increasing}} {{over the last two}} decades in the United States. The onset of asthma has also been increasingly reported as a result of occupational exposures to over 350 different agents. Work-related asthma (WRA) has become the most frequently diagnosed occupational respiratory illness. Epidemiologic studies from the United States reported WRA incidence rates of 29 - 710 cases per million workers per year and suggest that 10 - 25 % of adult asthma is work related. Much can be learned about asthma in the general population from investigations of asthma in the workplace. Surveillance of WRA continues to highlight an important role for low molecular weight <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers,</b> as well as high molecular weight antigens. Additionally, recent reports implicate mixed exposures, including commercial cleaning solutions, solvents, and other respiratory irritants, as well as contamination in nonindustrial environments, including schools and offices. Investigations of WRA have demonstrated a clear dose-related increase in sensitization and symptoms for exposures to both <b>chemical</b> and protein <b>sensitizers.</b> High proportions of exposed working groups can be affected. Skin exposures may affect the likelihood of individuals developing respiratory symptoms. Atopy increases the risk of sensitization and illness from workplace exposure to antigens but not to <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers.</b> Irritant exposures can act as adjuvants among individuals exposed to sensitizing substances, increasing the proportion who become sensitized. Atopy might also be a result of irritant exposures in some persons.

40|$|Asthma is {{a chronic}} airway disease, {{characterized}} by reversible airway obstruction following {{exposure to the}} causative agent, non-specific airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and airway inflammation, ultimately leading to airway remodelling. Initially, asthma has been considered an allergic, T-helper 2 lymphocyte-driven, eosinophilic airway inflammatory disease. Yet, other subtypes with distinct pathophysiological mechanisms can be defined based on etiology and pattern of airway inflammation. Occupational asthma (OA), the most common work-related lung disease in industrial countries, {{can be caused by}} low molecular compounds, such as reactive chemicals. In contrast to ‘classic’ allergic asthma, induced by complete allergens, part of the pathophysiology of chemical-induced OA remains unknown. The aim of this doctoral thesis was to study the underlying mechanisms of chemical-induced asthma, using a C 57 Bl/ 6 mouse model, in which toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate, a known <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> serves as a prototypical occupational asthmogen. In this model mice are dermally sensitized, followed by a single intranasal airway challenge, resulting in AHR to methacholine 24 h after the challenge, without the influx of inflammatory cells in the airways. As such, our model mimics chemically-induced paucigranulocytic OA, a clinically relevant asthmatic phenotype. Via gene-deficient mice and pharmacological interventions we were able to demonstrate that the pathophysiology of chemical-induced asthma relies on a complex interplay between neurological pathways (TRPA 1 and TRPV 1), innate immune players (mast cells) and adaptive immune players (IL- 13 and lymphocytes). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Toluene {{diisocyanate}} (TDI) is {{a potent}} low molecular weight <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer</b> and {{a leading cause of}} chemical-induced occupational asthma. The regulatory potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been recognized in a variety of disease states, including allergic disease; however, the roles of miRNAs in chemical sensitization are largely unknown. In a previous work, increased expression of multiple miRNAs during TDI sensitization was observed and several putative mRNA targets identified for these miRNAs were directly related to regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and function including Foxp 3 and Runx 3. In this work, we show that miR- 210 expression is increased in the mouse draining lymph node (dLN) and Treg subsets following dermal TDI sensitization. Alterations in dLN mRNA and protein expression of Treg related genes/putative miR- 210 targets (foxp 3, runx 3, ctla 4, and cd 25) were observed at multiple time points following TDI exposure and in ex vivo systems. A Treg suppression assay, including a miR- 210 mimic, was utilized to investigate the suppressive ability of Tregs. Cells derived from TDI sensitized mice treated with miR- 210 mimic had less expression of miR- 210 compared to the acetone control suggesting other factors, such as additional miRNAs, might be involved in the regulation of the functional capabilities of these cells. These novel findings indicate that miR- 210 may have an inhibitory role in Treg function during TDI sensitization. Because the functional roles of miRNAs have not been previously elucidated in a model of chemical sensitization, these data contribute {{to the understanding of the}} potential immunologic mechanisms of chemical induced allergic disease...|$|E
40|$|Occupational asthma (OA) is {{the most}} common work-related lung disease in the industrialized world and is {{characterized}} by reversible airway obstruction, non-specific airway hyperreactivity and airway inflammation. In 90 % of the cases, a complaints-free latency period precedes the development of immunologically mediated OA resulting in late diagnosis of these workers. Proteomics and peptidomics techniques could help to find (new) proteins or peptides related to the pathophysiology and onset of OA, leading to novel biomarkers to identify sensitized workers. So far, theuse of these techniques in pulmonary research is limited. The research unit of Lung Toxicology has described a well-characterized and validated mouse model of chemical-induced asthma. Two dermal sensitizations and a single airway challenge with a <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizer,</b> such as toluene diisocyanate resulted in several phenotypical characteristics of chemical-induced asthma, including lymphocyte proliferation and activation, non-specific airway hyperreactivity and neutrophilic lung inflammation. In this doctoral thesis we focused on:a) applying a proteomics approach to find biomarkers of sensitization caused by chemicals and biomarkers of chemical-induced asthma (Chapter 2 and 3) b) investigating the role of B lymphocytes during sensitization (Chapter 4) c) optimizing a label-free peptidomics approach to study peptide biomarkers (Chapter 5) We used two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE) to search for possible biomarkers of sensitization in auricular lymph nodes and serum of mice that were sensitized once andtwice. In the auricular lymph nodes, {{a large portion of the}} differentially expressed proteins are structural proteins (e. g. actin, vimentin), while another substantial group are immune related proteins (e. g. lymphocyte specific protein- 1, coronin 1 a). Most of the identified proteins in serum, after one or two sensitizations are involved in binding/transport (e. g. hemopexin, apolipoprotein E). Three potential biomarkers, lymphocyte specific protein- 1, coronin 1 a and hemopexin, were verified in an independent experiment by Western blot analysis or ELISA. In a next step, we aim to validate this set of proteins in TDI-exposed workerswith the potential of advancing early diagnosis of OA. To investigate possible biomarkers of disease (chemical-induced asthma), we compared the proteome changes in auricular lymph nodes, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum of mice after the establishment of asthma. A majority of differentially expressed proteins (e. g. lymphocyte specific protein- 1, vitamin D binding protein, apolipoprotein E, hemopexin and haptoglobin) could be directly linked to inflammation (both locally in the lung as systemically in serum), a hallmark of asthma. For the first time,a systematic proteomics approach was implemented using different samples obtained from the same mice in the setting of chemical-induced asthma. The role of B lymphocytes in the development of chemical-induced asthma is still unclear. Recently, it was shown that B lymphocytes from sensitized mice could carry a sensitized signature compared to B lymphocytes of naïve mice. We isolated B lymphocytes from sensitized and non-sensitized mice and studied this sensitized signature by using 2 D-DIGE. The altered expression of cyclophilin A, cofilin 1 and zinc finger containing CCHC domain protein 11 in sensitized B lymphocytes could be linked directly to the function of B lymphocytes as initiators of T lymphocyte independent asthma-like responses. The low molecular weight proteome (In conclusion, the introduction of proteomics and (in a lesser extent) peptidomics in a mouse model of chemical-induced asthma has led to the discovery of several potential biomarkers of sensitization and disease, encouraging further validation of these results in humans. status: publishe...|$|E

The strong skin sensitizer 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) was shown to induce the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) in DC. In the present study, we investigated a putative role for oxidative stress in DNFB-induced MAPK activation and upregulation of the costimulatory molecule CD 40. In a DC line generated from fetal mouse skin, DNFB induced {{a significant increase in}} protein oxidation, measured by the formation of carbonyl groups, while it had almost no effect on lipid peroxidation. The antioxidants glutathione and vitamin E, which inhibit protein and lipid oxidation, respectively, were used to assess the role of oxidative stress in DNFB-induced MAPK activation. Glutathione, but not vitamin E, inhibited DNFB-induced p 38 MAPK and ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation, whereas none of the antioxidants interfered significantly with the DNFB-induced upregulation of CD 40 protein levels.

Only a proportion of exposed workers develop IgE-associated allergy to acid anhydrides. OBJECTIVE: We determined whether genetic susceptibility, in particular, HLA Class II alleles may be a risk factor. METHODS: We undertook HLA typing in 52 cases who had confirmed specific IgE and in 73 referents matched on site, age and duration of acid anhydride exposure identified in cross-sectional studies of workers exposed to hexahydrophthalic (HHPA), methylhexahydrophthalic (MHHPA) and methyltetrahydrophthalic (MTHPA) anhydrides. RESULTS: The linked alleles DQ 5 (odds ratio [OR]= 4. 3; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]= 1. 7, 11) and DR 1 (OR 3. 0; 95 % CI 1. 2, 11) were more prevalent in cases than in referents.

40|$|Chronic {{beryllium}} disease is an {{occupational lung disease}} that begins as a cell-mediated immune response to beryllium. Although respiratory and engineering controls have significantly decreased occupational beryllium exposures over the last decade, the rate of beryllium sensitization has not declined. We hypothesized that skin exposure to beryllium particles would provide an alternative route for sensitization to this metal. We employed optical scanning laser confocal microscopy and size-selected fluorospheres to demonstrate that 0. 5 - and 1. 0 - micro m particles, in conjunction with motion, as at the wrist, penetrate the stratum corneum of human skin and reach the epidermis and, occasionally, the dermis. The cutaneous immune response to <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers</b> is initiated in the skin, matures in the local lymph node (LN), and releases hapten-specific T cells into the peripheral blood. Topical application of beryllium to C 3 H mice generated beryllium-specific sensitization that was documented by peripheral blood and LN beryllium lymphocyte proliferation tests (BeLPT) and by changes in LN T-cell activation markers, increased expression of CD 44, and decreased CD 62 L. In a sensitization-challenge treatment paradigm, epicutaneous beryllium increased murine ear thickness following chemical challenge.

Although several in vitro assays to predict the sensitizing potential of chemicals have been developed, these methods cannot distinguish <b>chemical</b> respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> and skin sensitizers. In the present study, we describe a novel in vitro assay that can discriminate respiratory <b>sensitizers</b> from <b>chemical</b> skin <b>sensitizers</b> {{by taking advantage of}} the fundamental difference between their modes of action, namely the development of the T helper 2 immune response, which is critically important for respiratory sensitization. First, we established a novel three-dimensional (3 D) coculture system of human upper airway epithelium using a commercially available scaffold. It consists of human airway epithelial cell line BEAS- 2 B, immature dendritic cells (DCs) derived from human peripheral blood CD 14 + monocytes, and human lung fibroblast cell line MRC- 5. Respective cells were first cultured in individual scaffolds and subsequently assembled into a 3 D multi-cell tissue model to more closely mimic the in vivo situation. Then, three typical chemicals that are known respiratory sensitizers (ortho-phthaldialdehyde, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and trimellitic anhydride) and skin sensitizers (oxazolone, formaldehyde, and dinitrochlorobenzene) were added individually to the 3 D coculture system. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that DCs do not migrate into other scaffolds under the experimental conditions. Therefore, the 3 D structure was disassembled and real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was performed in individual scaffolds to analyze the expression levels of molecules critical for Th 2 differentiation such as OX 40 ligand (OX 40 L), interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10, IL- 33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin. Both sensitizers showed similarly augmented expression of DC maturation markers (e. g., CD 86), but among these molecules, OX 40 L expression in DCs was most consistently and significantly enhanced by respiratory sensitizers as compared to that by skin sensitizers.

This type of testing has traditionally been performed in animals, but a recent paradigm shift has been initiated to promote the development of in vitro alternatives. However, currently, such proposed strategies can only be used for identification of skin sensitizing hazard, and are unable to inform on other endpoints of regulatory concern, such as skin sensitizing potency and respiratory sensitization. The GARD assay was developed as a multiparametric alternative to current in vitro tests. The assay measures chemically-induced changes within a predictive biomarker signature of 200 genes using transcriptome-wide microarray profiling and has proven to be highly accurate for identification of skin sensitizers. The overall ambition of the work presented in this thesis has been to utilize novel transcriptomic technologies, advanced computational tools, and powerful machine learning strategies to further transform GARD into a versatile and highly standardized tool for regulatory decision-making. The first part of this thesis addressed the need for a more versatile test platform capable of targeting additional toxicological endpoints. By measuring complete transcriptomes of cells following chemical stimulations, two separate biomarker signatures could be identified and demonstrated to have potent ability to predict respiratory sensitizing properties and skin sensitizing potency, respectively. The second part of this thesis addressed modifications to current GARD protocols to facilitate progression from biomarker discovery into a highly standardized tool for chemical risk assessment. A novel streamlined workflow was presented, where gene expression measurements had been transferred from transcriptome-wide profiling into the NanoString nCounter platform, measuring only genes in the biomarker signatures, which enabled for increased sample throughput, simplified protocols, and reduced assay costs in a format adapted to routine testing. To conclude, by combining the novel biomarker signatures identified in this thesis with the previous biomarker signature for identification of skin sensitizers, the GARD platform demonstrates a unique possibility to simultaneously screen for skin sensitizing hazard and potency, as well as respiratory sensitizing properties in a single test sample. Following the introduction of a novel pipeline to progress from initial biomarker discovery into a highly standardized testing format, results presented in this thesis shows that GARD is a state-of-the-art platform ready to replace animal experimentation for testing of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational asthma can {{be caused}} by chemicals. Previously, we {{established}} a murine model of immunologically mediated chemical-induced asthma using toluene diisocyanate. OBJECTIVE: We sought to verify this model using trimellitic anhydride (TMA), a respiratory sensitizer, and 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (DNCB), a dermal sensitizer. METHODS: BALB/c mice received dermal applications (vehicle or chemical) on days 1 and 7. On day 10, they received an intranasal instillation (vehicle or chemical). Whole-body plethysmography (enhanced pause) was used to monitor changes in ventilatory function and methacholine reactivity. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed by using bronchoalveolar lavage (cells, TNF-alpha levels, and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 levels). Immunologic parameters included total serum IgE levels, lymphocyte distribution in auricular and cervical lymph nodes, and IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels in supernatants of lymph node cells incubated with or without concanavalin A. RESULTS: Mice dermally treated and intranasally challenged with TMA experienced markedly increased enhanced pause immediately after intranasal challenge and increased methacholine reactivity (24 hours later). Mice similarly treated with DNCB did not show any ventilatory changes. Neutrophil influx and increased macrophage inflammatory protein 2 and TNF-alpha levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in both TMA- and DNCB-treated mice. The proportion of CD 19 + B cells was increased in auricular and cervical lymph nodes of TMA-treated mice. IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels were increased in supernatants of concanavalin A-stimulated auricular and cervical lymph node cells of TMA- or DNCB-treated mice; however, the relative proportions of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma levels differed between TMA- and DNCB-treated mice. Serum total IgE levels were increased in TMA-treated mice only. CONCLUSION: Both compounds induce a mixed T(H) 1 -T(H) 2 response, but only TMA induced ventilatory changes.

40|$|Diisocyanates (dNCOs) are low {{molecular}} weight <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers</b> that react with autologous proteins to produce neoantigens. dNCO-haptenated proteins {{have been used as}} immunogens for generation of dNCO-specific antibodies and as antigens to screen for dNCO-specific antibodies in exposed individuals. Detection of dNCO-specific antibodies in exposed individuals for diagnosis of dNCO asthma has been hampered by poor sensitivities of the assay methods in that specific IgE can only be detected in approximately 25 % of the dNCO asthmatics. Apart from characterization of the conjugates used for these immunoassays, the choice of the carrier protein and the dNCO used are important parameters that can influence the detection of dNCO-specific antibodies. Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most common carrier protein used for detection of dNCO specific-IgE and -IgG but the immunogenicity and/or antigenicity of other proteins that may be modified by dNCO in vivo is not well documented. In the current study, 2, 4 -toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were reacted with HSA and human hemoglobin (Hb) and the resultant adducts were characterized by (i) HPLC quantification of the diamine produced from acid hydrolysis of the adducts, (ii) 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) assay to assess extent of cross-linking, (iii) electrophoretic migration in polyacrylamide gels to analyze intra- and inter-molecular cross-linking, and (iv) evaluation of antigenicity using a monoclonal antibody developed previously to TDI conjugated to Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Concentration-dependent increases in the amount of dNCO bound to HDI and TDI, cross-linking, migration in gels, and antibody-binding were observed. TDI reactivity with both HSA and Hb was significantly higher than HDI. Hb-TDI antigenicity was approximately 30 % that of HSA-TDI. In conclusion, this data suggests that both, the extent of haptenation as well as the degree of cross-linking differs between the two diisocyanate species studied, which may influence their relative immunogenicity and/or antigenicity.

40|$|Dendritic cells {{represent}} a morphologically and functionally heterogeneous population of professional antigen presenting cells {{and act as}} a link between innate and adaptive immune responses. The specific reactivity of the distinct DC subtypes against harmful foreign antigens {{is defined by the}} unique expression of pattern recognition receptors and their localization in the human body. How far these properties comprise the immunological fate of skin resident DC subsets under inflammatory conditions is questionable, due to the modulatory impact of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which in turn alter the activation and maturation of DC. The selective stimulation with microbial TLR agonists in presence or absence of TNF-α and IL- 1 β enabled a simulation of steady-state or inflammatory conditions and revealed a distinct disparity in the specific reactivity of both subsets towards microbial stimuli. Thus, this study refers to a possible conversion of the immunogenic characteristics of human DC populations, dependent on the respective skin environment. Considering the diverse functional properties of DC, their specific contribution in the induction, regulation or aggravation of inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis vulgaris, is still poorly understood. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediating the priming and proliferation of specific Th subtypes, is strongly regulated by the mechanisms of autophagy. Therefore, different inhibitors of autophagy were used to evaluate possible variations in the mediation of innate or adaptive immunity by MoDC and MoLC. Lysosomotrophic agents, like chloroquine, suppressed the process of the late phase of autophagy, and additionally have led to a sustainable dysregulation of cytokine release by activated DC. Whilst the secretion of IL- 12 was reduced in both subsets and consequently MoLC revealed a decrease in Th 1 priming capacity, the activation with IL- 1 together with chloroquine mediated an enhanced secretion of IL- 6, mainly by MoDC, whereas MoLC highly induced the release of IL- 23. Thus, the current thesis highlights DC as potential critical mediators of Th 17 activity during treatment with the anti-malarial agent chloroquine. In agreement with the ethical principle of the 3 R concept, which includes the reduction, replacement and refinement of animal testing procedures in industry and science, the concurrent incorporation of immature MoLC within the reconstructed epidermis of a full thickness skin equivalent possibly serves as an alternative method for the predictive assessment of <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers</b> in future. Indeed, the integration of immature MoLC into a reconstructed skin equivalent was successful, thus future studies will have to analyze the functional properties of the test system...|$|R

The radiation sensitivity of P. expansum conidia was influenced by such factors as nutritional condition of the post-irradiation media, age of the spores, delayed plating, heat treatment, and <b>chemical</b> <b>sensitizers.</b> Higher survival was obtained when irradiated conidia were plated on Czapek solution agar (sugar-salts medium) than on potato dextrose agar; yeast extract added in Czapek 2 ̆ 7 s medium hastened colony growth but reduced survival. The 6 -month-old conidia were more radiation sensitive than the 1 -week-old conidia. Recovery from the radiation injuries was observed when irradiated spores were held in the suspension for several days at 23 o C. No recovery was found at 1 o C. Heat treatment (58 o C; 4 minutes) before or after irradiation increased the radiation effect. Difolatan (10 ppm), iodacetic acid (50 ppm), and secondary butylamine (500 ppm) were effective radiation sensitizers to P. expansum. The colony growths were inhibited for various periods following irradiation of the mycelia. The duration of inhibition was influenced by the dose applied and the nutrient of the medium tested. Irradiation of the Czapek solution agar slowed the initial growth of unirradiated fungus. No such effects were found with the other media tested. From these results, it can be concluded that under proper conditions, the fungus can be effectively inactivated by low doses of gamma radiation and thus retain the quality of fresh fruit with a minimum irradiation cost. Abnormal colonies and mutants were induced by the radiation. Some mutants were no more radiation resistant than the normal strain. The culture grown from irradiated conidia produced more of pectolytic enzyme than did the control after 3 days of post-irradiation incubation. The enzyme production was stimulated by the irradiation. Nucleic acid content of the mycelia grown from irradiated spores was related to the growth stage of the fungus and not directly influenced by the irradiation. The slowed growth rate of the irradiated fungus indirectly influenced the nucleic acid content. When isotope labeled mycelia were irradiated, no radiation induced degradation of nucleic acid was detected in the fungus during 8 hours of post-irradiation incubation, either by chemical or isotopic analysis...|$|R
50|$|A {{leuco dye}} and a developer, when melted together, {{are enough to}} produce color. However, the thermal {{threshold}} of the coated layer containing the colorizing components {{is determined by the}} lowest melting component of the layer. Furthermore, developers and leuco dyes often mix poorly upon melting. To optimize the colorization temperature and to facilitate mixing, a third <b>chemical</b> called a <b>sensitizer</b> is commonly added to the imaging layer. Sensitizers are commonly simple ether molecules such as 1,2-bis-(3-methylphenoxy)ethane or 2-benzyloxynapthalene. These two materials melt at approximately 100C, which is a practical lower limit for thermal coloration. These low-cost ethers are excellent low viscosity solvents for leuco dyes and developers, and this facilitates color formation at a well-defined temperature and with minimum energy input.|$|R

However, validated methods, which provide information about the potency of skin sensitizers, are still lacking. The cell-based assay Genomic Allergen Rapid Detection (GARD), targeting key event 3, dendritic cell activation, of the skin sensitization AOP, uses gene expression profiling and a machine learning approach for the prediction of <b>chemicals</b> as <b>sensitizers</b> or non-sensitizers. Based on the GARD platform, we here expanded the assay to predict three sensitizer potency classes according to the European Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation, targeting categories 1 A (strong), 1 B (weak) and no cat (non-sensitizer). Using a random forest approach and 70 training samples, a potential biomarker signature of 52 transcripts was identified. The resulting model could predict an independent test set consisting of 18 chemicals, six from each CLP category and all previously unseen to the model, with an overall accuracy of 78 %. Importantly, the model was shown to be conservative and only underestimated the class label of one chemical. Furthermore, an association of defined chemical protein reactivity with distinct biological pathways illustrates that our transcriptional approach can reveal information contributing to the understanding of underlying mechanisms in sensitization...|$|R
40|$|The {{monoterpene}} ascaridole, {{a fairly}} stable endoperoxide found in essential oils such as tea tree oil can provoke {{allergic contact dermatitis}} which has been evidenced under patch test conditions. However, concomitantly we observed irritative skin reactions that demand further data underlining the sensitization potential of ascaridole. Here, we studied the effects of ascaridole on dendritic cell (DC) activation and protein reactivity, 2 key steps of chemical-induced skin sensitization. Treatment of human monocyte-derived DC with ascaridole found support for full DC maturation, a capability of sensitizers but not irritants. It induced significant upregulation of {{the expression of the}} costimulatory molecules CD 86, CD 80, CD 40, and the adhesion molecule CD 54 in a time-dependent manner. Maturation was accompanied by release of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 ß, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL- 6, and IL- 8. Similar to other <b>chemical</b> skin <b>sensitizers</b> including hydroperoxides, we observed a certain reactivity of ascaridole toward cysteine- but not lysine-containing peptides. During recent years, evidence accumulated for a radical mechanism as trigger for protein reactivity of peroxides. Treatment of the fairly stable endoperoxide ascaridole with iron as radical inducer (“activated ascaridole”) resulted in cysteine peptide reactivity exceeding by far that of ascaridole itself. Furthermore, activated ascaridole showed increased potential for induction of the Nrf 2 target gene heme oxygenase 1 and upregulation of CD 86 and CD 54 on THP- 1 cells, an established DC surrogate.
