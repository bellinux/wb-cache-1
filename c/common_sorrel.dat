50|$|Its flower {{hay meadow}} is an {{ecological}} relict {{with a high}} plant diversity due to the continuing centuries old practice of receiving only a cut in late season for a hay crop. In June it is coloured by yellow flag, marsh cinquefoil, bog bean, and ragged robin (a source of nectar for the adult swallowtails). In early July, there are <b>common</b> <b>sorrel,</b> the purple glass Yorkshire fog, southern marsh orchids, yellow rattle and valerian. These are followed by purple loosestrife and meadowsweet.|$|E
50|$|The site mainly {{consists}} of hay meadows, which are managed by traditional methods and support {{a wide variety}} of grasses and forbs. Common grasses include red fescue, Festuca rubra, cock's foot, Dactylis glomerata, common bent, Agrostis capillaris, and sweet vernal grass, Anthoxanthum odoratum. Common herbs include <b>common</b> <b>sorrel,</b> Rumex acetosa, wood cranesbill, Geranium sylvaticum, and great burnet, Sanguisorba officinalis. Less common are the locally rare melancholy thistle, Cirsium helenioides, globe flower, Trollius europaeus, common bistort, Polygonum bistorta, and alpine bistort, P. viviparum.|$|E
50|$|In the spring, {{species such}} as European wood anemone, <b>common</b> wood <b>sorrel</b> and false {{lily of the valley}} are blooming.

The seeds of two species of Fagopyrum, known as buckwheat (sarrasin in French), provide grain (its dark flour is known as blé noir (black wheat) in France). The petioles of rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum and hybrids) are a food item. The leaves of the <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosa) are eaten in salads or as a leaf vegetable.|$|E
40|$|Sulphonated anthraquinones are {{precursors}} of many synthetic dyes and pigments, recalcitrant to biodegradation {{and thus}} not eliminated by classical wastewater treatments. In {{the development of}} a phytotreatment to remove sulphonated aromatic compounds from dye and textile industrial effluents, {{it has been shown that}} rhubarb (Rheum rabarbarum) and <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosa) are the most efficient plants. Both species, producing natural anthraquinones, not only accumulate, but also transform these xenobiotic chemicals. Even if the precise biochemical mechanisms involved in the detoxification of sulphonated anthraquinones are not yet understood, they probably have cross talks with secondary metabolism, redox processes and plant energy metabolism. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases and peroxidases in the detoxification of several sulphonated anthraquinones. Both plant species were cultivated in a greenhouse under hydroponic conditions, with or without sulphonated anthraquinones. Plants were harvested at different times and either microsomal or cytosolic fractions were prepared. The monooxygenase activity of cytochromes P 450 toward several sulphonated anthraquinones was tested using a new method based on the fluorimetric detection of oxygen consumed during cytochromes P 450 -catalysed reactions. The activity of cytosolic peroxidases was measured by spectrophotometry, using guaiacol as a substrate. A significant activity of cytochromes P 450 was detected in rhubarb leaves, while no (rhizome) or low (petioles and roots) activity was found in other parts of the plants. An induction of this enzyme was observed at the beginning of the exposition to sulphonated anthraquinones. The results also indicated that cytochromes P 450 were able to accept as substrate the five sulphonated anthraquinones, with a higher activity toward AQ- 2, 6 -SS (0. 706 nkat/mg protein) and AQ- 2 -S (0. 720 nkat/mg protein). An activity of the cytochromes P 450 was also found in the leaves of <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> (1. 212 nkat/mg protein (AQ- 2, 6 -SS)), but no induction of the activity occurred after the exposition to the pollutant. The activity of peroxidases increased when rhubarb was cultivated in the presence of the five sulphonated anthraquinones (0. 857 nkat/mg protein). Peroxidase activity was also detected in the leaves of the <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> (0. 055 nkat/mg protein), but in this plant, no significant difference was found between plants cultivated with and without sulphonated anthraquinones. Results indicated that the activity of cytochromes P 450 and peroxidases increased in rhubarb in the presence of sulphonated anthraquinones and were involved in their detoxification mechanisms. These results suggest the existence in rhubarb and <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> of specific mechanisms involved in the metabolism of sulphonated anthraquinones. Further investigation should be performed to find the next steps of this detoxification pathway. Besides these promising results for the phytotreatment of sulphonated anthraquinones, it will be of high interest to develop and test, at small scale, an experimental wastewater treatment system to determine its efficiency. On the other hand, these results reinforce the idea that natural biodiversity should be better studied to use the most appropriate species for the phytotreatment of a specific pollutant...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies have}} shown that {{phenolic}} compounds have antiproliferative and tumour arresting effects. The aim of this original study was to investigate the content of phenolic compounds (PhC) in flowers of Allium schoenoprasum (chive), Tragopogon pratensis (meadow salsify) and Rumex acetosa (<b>common</b> <b>sorrel)</b> and their effect on proliferation of HaCaT cells. Antiproliferative effects were evaluated in vitro using the following concentrations of phenolic compounds in cultivation medium: 100, 75, 50 and 25 µg/mL. Phenolic composition was also determined by HPLC.

All five species are on the Yosemite priority non-native species list (Gerlach et al. 2003). Bull thistle was the most widely recorded non-native, occurring in 14 plots (Table 1).|$|R
50|$|Hardwood-conifer mixed forests {{occur in}} a {{transition}} zone between lowland conifer and northern hardwood forests. The ground is less rocky than in the lowland conifer forests and thus supports more vegetation. Trees include red spruce, balsam fir, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The understory vegetation is abundant, with witchhobble (Viburnum lantanoides), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum).

40|$|One of {{the finest}} areas of marshy {{grassland}} in Hertfordshire. It is at its best in late spring when it is carpetted with orchids. Blagrove Common {{is one of the}} few remaining areas of unimproved marshy grassland on poorly drained boulder clay. It is bisected by a stream and varies in wetness from marshy grassland to dry neutral grassland. The marshy areas are dominated by rushes and tufted hairs grass. Amongst these large numbers of early marsh, southern marsh and common spotted orchids and a variety of their hybrids can be found. The grasslands have been maintained for several centuries by grazing. This form of management ensures that some species, such as orchids, survive instead of allowing the more vigorous grasses to out compete all other species. Traditional grazing on wet areas also produces muddy, trampled areas which are an important micro-habitat for some plants and invertebrates. The drier areas of the common support meadow fox tail grasses, common cat's ear and <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> among many other species. Winter Blagrove is alot quiter in the winter months but management work continues, primarily focusing on cutting and raking the dominant rush growth. Flocks of tits can be seen around the edge of the common, with the odd goldcrest or treecreeper amongst them. Kestrels often hunt over the common, perching on the overhead wires and searching the ground for voles and mice, which are common on the reserve. Buzzards can be heard and seen gliding over distant woodland togther with red kites. Summe...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in an area of meadow located in a proper dry meadow habitat. The soil {{comprised}} black degrad-ed earth with the mechanical composition of heavy clayey sand and a pH of 4. 4. The study involved the following methods of utilisation: mowing and harvesting the biomass, mowing and leaving the biomass on the swathe, mulching the biomass and leaving it on the swathe and leaving the meadow non-utilised. Despite significant differences in utilisation, no statisti-cally significant differences were observed in sward density although leaving mowed biomass on the swathe contributed to a decline in sward density. The height of the mowed sward was lowest where biomass was collected and tallest where it was left after mulching. Despite the extensive utilisation and lack of fertiliser the crop yield remained relatively high, ranging from 4. 3 – 4. 7 t·ha- 1 DMB. The different methods of utilisation did not bring significant differences in crop yield. The botani-cal composition of the sward deteriorated significantly with a decline in valuable grasses and the spread of dicotyledonous plants, including varieties such as the common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg.) and <b>common</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosa L.). This effect was particularly marked in the non-utilised meadow and the meadow where the biomass was left on the swathe. The results of the study indicate that leaving harvested biomass to mulch is more beneficial to meadow than be-ing left non-utilised, but in the long term this leads to degradation, particularly of sward (through the spread of weeds) but also sward density (by rarefaction) ...|$|E
40|$|Rumex acetosa L. (<b>common</b> <b>sorrel)</b> is a dioecious, wind pollinated {{plant with}} an XX/XY 1 Y 2 sex {{chromosome}} system. Sex-ratio in {{the populations of}} dioecious plants is rarely even; generally it is skewed towards one gender. Rumex populations showed female sex-ratio bias {{at all of the}} stages of development, but the difference in sex proportion was smaller in earlier stages (Stehlik et al. 2008). Moreover, sex-ratio bias varied in different populations of the same species (Zarzycki & Rychlewski 1972). The possible causes of unequal proportion of males and females are: certation, sex-dependent germinability of seeds, and/or difference in mortality of gametophytes, embryos, and plants (Błocka-Wandas et al. 2007). The plants originating from two distant populations in S Poland (Dobranowice and Wieliczka) were isolated and pollinated in a controlled condition to minimize the influence of certation. The pollinations were following: DW – ♀ from Dobranowice and ♂ from Wieliczka, WD – ♀ from Wieliczka and ♂ from Dobranowice, and DD – ♀ from Dobranowice and ♂ from Dobranowice. Seeds obtained from each experiment were collected and examined for sex by PCR. Two pairs of PCR primers that amplify sequences located in Y chromosomes were used: RAY-f and RAY-r (Korpelainen 2002), and UGR 08 -r and UGR 08 -f (Mariotti et al. 2009). To confirm the good quality of isolated DNA an amplification of autosomal sequence using R 730 -a and R 730 -b primers were carried out (Navajas-Peréz et al. 2005). The same set of primers was successful in our previous studies on sorrel (Kwolek & Joachimiak 2010). Sex ratios of WD and DW seeds were similar, but clearly differed from the observed in DD seeds (Tab. 1). Progeny produced by parents from different populations showed much larger proportion of females than progeny of parents originated from the same population. The finding requires further investigations to verify the results and to explain the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon...|$|E
