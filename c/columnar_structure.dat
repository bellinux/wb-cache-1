30|$|Figure  2 {{also shows}} that the {{morphology}} of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> strongly depends on {{the parameters of the}} deposition configurations. Figure  2 b shows that the height distribution of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> obtained through the high template-assisted rotational GLAD is not uniform, although the heights of the templates are the same. Furthermore, slight inclination of the axial of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> is observed. For the template-assisted static GLAD, the inclination is more pronounced than the template-assisted rotational GLAD, as shown in Figure  2 b. In addition, the discrepancy between the heights of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> is pronounced, and the coalescence of <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> occurs. A comparison between Figure  2 b,c shows that the template-assisted rotational GLAD leads to a lower but more uniform <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> than the template-assisted static GLAD, given the same height of the templates. As compared to the high template-assisted rotational GLAD, Figure  2 d shows that the morphologies of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> obtained through the low template-assisted rotational GLAD are more uniform, as the structures are mainly straight and the heights are almost the same. We note that the morphology of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> may strongly depend on the rotational velocity, which determines the coverage of deposited Al atoms in conjunction with the deposition rate. It suggests that the height of the templates has strong influence on the morphology of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> obtained through the template-assisted rotational GLAD.|$|R

3000|$|Since {{nucleated}} islands {{acting as}} shadowing centers are essentially {{required for the}} formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> in the initial period of the rotational GLAD, recently placing nano-sized templates on the bare substrate is proposed to replace the nucleated islands, in such a way both deposition period and deposition flux can be reduced significantly.

40|$|In this study, DEM {{simulations}} of triaxial creep tests on dense and loose sand samples {{were carried out}} to examine the micromechanics involved during creep. The simulated creep responses reproduce qualitatively the published experimental results. During the primary creep, the creep stress is gradually borne by the contact normal forces instead of contact tangential forces so that the <b>columnar</b> particle <b>structures</b> can be formed. This process also leads to a continuous decrease in the creep rate. The <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> eventually are completely formed and the creep rate reaches a minimum. However, the structures become meta-stable and susceptible to buckling. This explains why a sand packing does not show {{an extended period of}} secondary creep in the experiment. Buckling of the <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> also gives rise to maximum dilatancy and a sharp transition of the major fabric orientation of weak forces from horizontal to vertical. The continuous buckling process of <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> increases the creep rate and sliding ratios of contacts during the tertiary creep. In addition, the trend of contact tangential forces decreasing and contact normal forces increasing is reversed. Finally creep rupture occurs as the creep stress-strain line intersects the complete stress-strain curve.

30|$|In summary, we perform MD {{simulations}} of the pre-existing template-assisted rotational GLAD {{to investigate the}} influence of templates on the formation of Al columnar nanostructures on Cu substrate. Our simulation results show that under small deposition flux, {{the presence of the}} templates significantly contributes to the formation of <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> due to the intensified shadowing effect, while there are only islands formed during template-free rotational GLAD. As compared to the template-assisted static GLAD, the azimuthal rotation of the substrate during the template-assisted rotational GLAD leads to uniform morphologies of the formed <b>columnar</b> <b>structures.</b> Our simulations reveal the two deformation modes of dislocation mechanisms and deformation twinning that operating in the plastic deformation of the templates, which strongly influence both the morphologies of the templates and the formed <b>columnar</b> <b>structures.</b> While the formation of TBs mainly causes the shape change of the templates, the presence of ISF leads to the shear of the template by an atomic step.

To map submillimeter <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> noninvasively, we have evaluated various functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques using a well-established feline orientation column model. The conventional positive blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is widespread and diffuse due to large venous vessel contributions, resulting in its poor specificity to columns. However, the early-negative BOLD signal is induced by the early oxygen consumption increase without significant change in blood flow. This negative signal has been successfully applied for columnar mapping. Tissue-specific cerebral blood flow (CBF) response is also specific to individual cortical columns, suggesting that parenchyma-specific fMRI techniques are capable to map individual single-condition functional cortical columns in animals as well as humans...|$|R

Our approach is to investigate the dynamics of the waves and vortices separately: we ensure that the two-dimensional <b>columnar</b> <b>structures</b> are not directly forced so that the vortices can result only from association with wave to vortical energy transfers. Detailed energy transfers between waves and vortices are computed as a function of scale, allowing the direct tracking of the role and scales of the wave–vortex nonlinear interactions in the accumulation of energy in the large two-dimensional <b>columnar</b> <b>structures.</b> It is shown that the dominant energy transfers responsible for the generation of a steep two-dimensional spectrum involve direct non-local energy transfers from small-frequency small-horizontal-scale three-dimensional waves to large-horizontal-scale two-dimensional columnar vortices.
