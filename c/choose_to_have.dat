2500|$|Proponents of childfreedom posit that <b>choosing</b> not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{children}} {{is no more}} or less selfish than <b>choosing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children. <b>Choosing</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the children themselves and society at large. As philosopher David Benatar explains, {{at the heart of}} the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one's legacy/genes), rather than the potential person's interests. [...] At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent.|$|R

25|$|If {{a player}} was shown a red card – whether {{as a result}} of two bookable {{offences}} or a straight red – he would become suspended from playing in his team's next match. A player would also become suspended for one match for picking up two yellow cards in separate matches. However, any yellow cards accumulated would be cancelled once a team was eliminated from the tournament or reached the semi-finals.

25|$|Sometimes {{the front}} {{head of a}} kit bass drum has {{a hole in it}} to allow air to escape when the drum is struck for shorter sustain. Muffling can be {{installed}} through the hole without taking off the front head. The hole also allows microphones to be placed into the bass drum for recording and amplification. In addition to microphones, sometimes trigger pads are used to amplify the sound and provide a uniform tone, especially when fast playing without decrease of volume is desired. Professional drummers often <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a customized bass drum front head, with the logo or name of their band on the front.|$|E

25|$|Transsexual self-identified people {{sometimes}} wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their primary sexual characteristics, secondary characteristics, or both, {{because they feel}} {{they will be more}} comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, sex reassignment surgery is performed on people who <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.|$|E
25|$|The Isle of Man is a low-tax {{economy with}} no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or {{inheritance}} tax {{and a top}} rate of income tax of 20%. A tax cap is in force; {{the maximum amount of}} tax payable by an individual is £120,000 or £240,000 for couples if they <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their incomes jointly assessed. The £120,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the Island.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of other nations requires the player to continue expanding their empire using military force, propaganda. or simply buying out cities. Players can choose their method of global domination depending on the types of cities they own. Military states grow solely by attacking other cities. Nations with a religious trait construct special missionary units that convert other cities via religious propaganda. Likewise, economic states communicate solely by trade and have no weapons (except for defensive Turrets). If the player's nation captures a city of a different type, they can <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the city retain its original type if they wish. Players of all three ideological paths can eventually use a superweapon, which requires {{a large number of}} cities and Sporebucks, but gives the player a significant advantage over rival nations. Aside from enemy nations, Epic creatures may threaten individual cities.|$|E

25|$|The {{forwards}} of {{each team}} (though not necessarily all of them, their number is throwing-in team option) line up a metre apart, {{perpendicular to the}} touchline and between 5 m and 15 m from the touchline. The ball is thrown from the touchline down {{the centre of the}} lines of forwards by a player (usually the hooker) from the team that did not play the ball into touch. The exception to this is when the ball went out from a penalty, in which case the side who gained the penalty throws the ball in. There is an advantage to being the team throwing the ball as that team then knows where along the line the throw is aimed. If the ball passes over the 15 m line, it can be played by everyone and the line-out is over; if the ball is not thrown straight {{down the middle of the}} line-out, the non-infringing team may <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the put-in to either a new line-out or a scrum 15 m infield.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{reaches the}} hotel where Clementine is captive where he comes {{face to face with}} her captor, who reveals that he was the owner of the station wagon that the group ransacked after leaving the dairy and lost his family to walkers as a result. Seeking revenge, the {{stranger}} found Clementine on his walkie-talkie and manipulated her into keeping tabs on the group under the guise that he had her parents and had been following them ever since. Realizing that the man is insane, Lee, with Clementine's help, kills him. As Lee and Clementine leave the hotel, Clementine spots her parents, both of whom have turned into walkers, and Lee falls unconscious. Awakening soon after, he realizes he is near conversion, and instructs her to escape the city and meet Omid and Christa at the edge of town. The player can <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Lee order Clementine to either kill him or leave him to become a walker, or can opt to do nothing, in which case Clementine will choose based on the culmination of the player's choices within the game.|$|E
25|$|Cremated remains can be {{scattered}} or buried. Cremation plots or columbarium niches {{are usually}} cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often {{be accomplished in}} the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (£36 to incumbent and £78 to church council) a total of £114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked—such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons <b>choose</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a small part of}} their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as space burial and offered by companies such as Elysium Space, Celestis and Ascending Memories).
