The One is destroyed {{near the end of the}} War of the Ring when it falls into the Cracks of Doom in Mount Doom. Tolkien is not entirely <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened to the other rings, though he implied that the power of any that survived came to an end. After the War of the Ring, the three Elven Rings were taken by their bearers over the sea to the Undying Lands.|$|E

After Hudson's death and in the face of increasing public anxiety, Reagan directed Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to provide a report on the epidemic. Though Koop was a political conservative, his report was nevertheless <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> causes AIDS and what people and the U.S. government should do to stop it, including sex and AIDS education provided for all people.|$|E

She thought that the lyrics portrayed a powerful message about love, fame, and sexuality which was the central theme of The Fame. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "LoveGame" [...] {{is set in the}} time signature of common time and is composed in the key of B minor with a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute. Gaga's vocal range spans from B3 to G5. It follows in the chord progression of Am–Dm–C–Am–Dm–C in the first two verse and chorus while progressing as Am–Dm–Am–Dm in the intermediate verse before the final chorus.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2014, the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned Wonga {{from using}} a TV advert that it said {{breached}} its code {{because of a}} claim that customers would save money. The authority said this {{was likely to be}} interpreted as a statement that Wonga’s loans were cheaper than those of other lenders and was therefore a price comparison. It ruled that Wonga should consequently have informed consumers of its 5,853% annual interest rate. The ruling was in response to a complaint from the charity Citizens Advice, whose chief executive Gillian Guy, said: [...] "Adverts must be <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> taking out a loan means and how much it will cost. The consequences are really serious when payday lending goes wrong. High interest rates and fees can mean that a small loan balloons into a huge debt… both the advertising and payday loan industries need to look at why so many adverts are not meeting the grade and change their ways". It was the third Wonga advert to be banned by the ASA in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} {{has been}} compared to the 2012 trial of Pussy Riot for hooliganism and incitement of religious hatred in Moscow after their protest at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. [...] A Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty article about the Moscow trial described the Stop the Church protest as [...] "seminal", contributing to early 1990s reforms granting Americans with HIV and AIDS federal protection from discrimination, a U.S. government office on AIDS policy, and millions of dollars for biomedical research. [...] "ACT UP activists now say the St. Patrick's protest changed the way many Americans viewed the Catholic Church. It was no longer untouchable, and its policies -- on everything from condoms and abortion to gay marriage and women priests -- were no longer sacrosanct." [...] Jim Hubbard, an ACT UP member and maker of the documentary [...] "United in Anger" [...] about ACT UP history, said [...] "I wasn't <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> going inside the church would add at the time. But now I think that the shock of going inside and confronting the cardinal really worked. [...] It helped bring ACT UP to mainstream attention. It brought the crisis to a point where the government and the mainstream media really had to start dealing with it." ...|$|E

There is, however, a certain animal courage in every man who has lived by bodily toil, and Jasper, who had also a vindictive temper, did all he could. When he had once felt Leland's hand, he clinched with him, and, reeling locked together, they fell with a crash against the table and overturned one of the benches. Then, gasping, panting, floundering, and striking when they could, they went swaying towards the door, while Jasper's friends howled encouragingly, and men, attracted by the uproar, ran out of the opposite store. Foot by foot they neared the verandah, and when Leland, gasping with passion, made a supreme effort, they staggered out into it.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} a fourth class of people who take {{whatever}} it is that they happen to want, and say that that is the ultimate aim of evolution. And these are the only sensible people. This is the only really healthy way with the word evolution, to work for what you want, and to call THAT evolution. The only intelligible sense that progress or advance can have among men, {{is that we have a}} definite vision, and that we wish to make the whole world like that vision. If you like to put it so, the essence of the doctrine is that what we have around us is the mere method and preparation for something that we have to create. This is not a world, but rather the material for a world. God has given us not so much the colours of a picture as the colours of a palette. But he has also given us a subject, a model, a fixed vision. We must be <b>clear</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> we want to paint. This adds a further principle to our previous list of principles. We have said we must be fond of this world, even in order to change it. We now add that we must be fond of another world (real or imaginary) in order to have something to change it to.|$|E

Taken seriously, it should be a cause of concern for anyone working in the discipline today. But, should it been taken seriously? Was Wittgenstein’s evaluation ever justified?

This chapter argues it was and still is, and that this fact highlights an urgent and inescapable need for conceptual clarification in psychology.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{issues in}} evolutionary art related to Art Theory and Aesthetics {{with a view}} to better understanding how they might contribute to both research and practice. Aesthetics is a term often used in evolutionary art, but is regularly used with conflicting or naïve understandings. A selective history of evolutionary art as art is provided, with an examination of some art theories from within the field. A brief review of aesthetics as studied in philosophy and art theory follows. It is proposed that evolutionary art needs to resolve some important conflicts and be <b>clearer</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> what it means by terms like “art ” and “aesthetics”. Finally some possibilities for how to resolve these conflicts are described...|$|R

The government school authorities asked the school to be <b>clearer</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was parish work and what was school education.
