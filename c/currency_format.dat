5000|$|The {{process of}} website {{localization}} {{is complex and}} involves three different levels of adaptation. [...] First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into {{the language of the}} country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense. In order to translate, the [...] "target culture" [...] must be known. [...] Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” [...] Target locale is understood as the “market segment defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” [...] Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time <b>formats,</b> <b>currency</b> <b>formats,</b> number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed. In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, {{it is important to consider}} the following items: information architecture, theme and navigation, graphics, photographs, audio, and visual. Third is internationalization, which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.|$|R
40|$|In global {{networking}} the {{human-computer interface}} is the crucial communication {{link between the}} author and the user. In website design {{it is important to}} recognize cultural differences and understand how the design of the computer interface can reflect the culture of a particular audience. Digital storytelling is a design technique that can reflect cultural differences and engage the user. Modern technology creates opportunities to use storytelling to inform diverse audiences about cultural differences. This paper presents research in intercultural communication theory and shows how storytelling can improve cross-cultural communication in global networking. Intercultural Communication Global networking eliminates geographic distances and facilitates communication with different cultural groups. The Internet presents an opportunity to highlight cultural differences and promote an understanding and awareness of diverse cultural perspectives. For many years researchers have recognized the role that cultural differences play in intercultural communication. More recently, researchers have recognized the significance of this research in user interface design. Cultural differences in interface design extend beyond the cultural meaning of symbols, colors, data (time, date, <b>currency)</b> <b>formats,</b> etc. User interface designs can also reflect underlying social structures that define how individuals and organizations interact and communicate with eac...|$|R

40|$|With growing {{competition}} in the global E-Market place, the focus of E-Businesses is moving from customer acquisition to customer retention. Towards this, E-Businesses, {{in addition to providing}} a usable site, are integrating Customer-relationship Management (CRM) strategies into the design and usability of E-Commerce environments. These CRM strategies include personalisation, providing consistent customer service across different communication channels of the E-Business, meeting customers' expectations with regards to product information, giving cues for trustworthiness (e. g. security seals, data protection assurances), etc. However, CRM strategies employed in American and West European market places are aimed at an individual's (customer–s) self-interest and self-gratification and these might not be applicable in other cultures, for example, in Asia where, loyalty to family and clan, filial piety, delayed gratification, and connections and networks of trust and obligations via relatives and extended family, are valued. Through several examples, this position paper highlights the challenges that E-Businesses face in the global marketplace of localising not only the user interface design issues of the E-Commerce Web site such as colours, language, <b>currency</b> <b>formats,</b> etc., or the cultural attractors such as religious iconography, beliefs, national symbols, and so on, but also the CRM strategies of the E-Commerce environment. The issues, therefore, for discussion in the workshop arising from this paper are as follows: – Significance of integrating both HCI / Usability and CRM strategies into the design and usability of E-Commerce environments for customer retention and loyalty; – Localisation of CRM strategies in E-Commerce environments; – Are the usability and CRM strategies genre-specific, that is, specific to a particular domain of E-Commerce, such as banking, shopping, travel, and so on; – Which elicitation and usability evaluation techniques can be applied by designers and usability professionals in order to elicit values, attitudes, and expectations towards CRM of local customers? – Are patterns of on-line purchasing becoming standardised (as more and more Web retailers follow Amazon's retail processing business model) ? Are people learning to lead two different lives: responding to such standardised E-Commerce environments as well as to localised interfaces that meet their local preferences and requirements...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} effect {{of the crisis in}} academic publishing is the decline in publication and purchase of the scholarly mono-graph in the humanities. As library collections of monographs in the humanities continue to shrink, humanities scholars are clearly confronting difficult challenges in performing and publishing their research. Analysis of viable solutions to the publishing crisis in general, and in the humanities in particular, requires concrete information about the current state of academic publishing. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide some insight, through citation analysis, into current patterns of scholarly publishing in the field of nineteenth-century British and American literary studies. Emerging and shifting publication <b>formats,</b> <b>currency</b> in secondary mate-rials, and existing core groups of authors, works, journals, and publishers were evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} internationalisation and globalisation {{of business}} {{has meant that}} accounting increasingly is crossing national boundaries {{and that it has}} heightened importance to national and international users. This has highlighted the problem of how best to compare information created in different languages, <b>currencies</b> and <b>formats,</b> in a way that accords with different generally accepted accounting principles and yet also reflects economic, social, political and historical environments. In this paper we analyse the Annual Report and Accounts of companies belonging to the FTSE 300 index in order to draw conclusions about the current state of efforts directed to international harmonisation of accounting standards. We introduce a new method of measuring harmonisation that combines harmony index analysis with the calculation of the index distribution and probability of obtaining higher values. This methodology is applied in measure of de facto harmony for major areas of accounting diversity. The results allow us to identify areas of 'high', 'medium' and 'low' harmony. The highest levels of harmony are observed in the translation of foreign financial statements and in the recognition of acquired intangible assets. But more importantly, our measurement method is a useful diagnostic tool for it identifies low levels of harmony, which ought to be the focus of attention by those responsible for effecting accounting harmonisation. We observed the lowest levels of harmony in the recognition of temporary differences in deferred taxes and measurement of inventories. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologi...|$|R
40|$|Lifestyle {{television}} is popular, non-fictional programming {{that aims to}} instruct its viewers in everyday life practices, from home decoration and food preparation to fashion, shopping and child-rearing. In recent years, a range of lifestyle advice programs, and, in particular, reality-based makeover shows, have made their way onto primetime schedules around the world. The global <b>currency</b> of such <b>formats</b> has been interpreted {{as a sign of}} broader cultural and social shifts around the world, in particular the growing prevalence of individualised, consumer-oriented models of selfhood. The lifestyle format takes on particular significance in Asia with the emergence of &# 039;new&# 039; formations of consumer oriented &# 039;middle classes&# 039; characterised by lifestyle aspirations that are shaped in complex ways by national, regional and global influences. Focusing on Singaporean lifestyle TV, this article examines the kinds of cultural values and modes of selfhood promoted on these shows. It argues that, as etiquette manuals for the twenty-first century, these increasingly ubiquitous forms of advice television provide rich insights into the ways in which contemporary Asian media cultures are negotiating globalised models of cosmopolitan consumer-citizenship...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were: 1. to identify the source, character, <b>currency</b> and <b>format</b> of environmental, ecological, geological and other data for each existing facility site and organize it in a “hard copy” and/or computerized framework to aid the prioritization and planning process for facility upgrades {{to protect the environment}}, for regulatory compliance, and for potential replacement or relocation of existing sites; 2. to identify and assess the criteria currently employed by INDOT to select locations for new and/or relocated facilities, including the ASTM Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessment criteria, and to recommend additional criteria including those required to mitigate potential environmental impacts at new sites, if necessary; 3. - 4. to recommend Best Management Practices for implementation at existing sites to protect the environment and for new facilities sited at locations where potential environmental impacts exist, and to provide cost estimates of Best Management Practices involving engineering upgrades for existing and new facilities; 5. to recommend procedures and policies for decommissioning facilities prior to their closure and relocation. The research entailed a review of available GIS databases from all government, institutional and private sources and the preparation of specific GIS maps depicting locations of INDOT facilities and highways and the publication of a directory and CD-ROM for use by INDOT staff. The GIS database investigation identified nine environmental sensitivity criteria {{that could be used to}} prioritize facilities relative to the potential threat they pose to the surrounding environment. The study included a thorough investigation of the literature concerning best management practices (BMPs) for control of storm water. A CD-ROM was prepared which included documents from 23 public, institutional and private sources and their hyperlinks. The study concludes with an analysis of the ASTM Phase I and II Standards for Environmental Site Assessments and the recommendation of the RISC Investigation Report format to supplement the use of Phase I and II for assessment of future facility sites and prior to closing existing facilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{presents an}} in-depth investigation and {{description of a}} single user group, system administrators. Following an overview of these computing professionals and their complex, risky work environment, system administrator work practices were investigated using data collected from previous experience, interviews, a usability study, and the literature. This research contributes to existing knowledge by presenting an analysis of system administrator work practices and identifying them as broker technicians. As such, many {{of the findings of}} this study may apply to other broker technicians. Because the work of system administration is so dependent upon technology and the way sysadmins access and control that technology, investigations of tool use were then studied. Through an analysis of work practices related to tool use, attributes important to system administrator work practices were identified. These attributes fell into two categories: information quality (<b>currency,</b> completeness, accuracy, <b>format,</b> logging, and verification) and system quality (reliability, flexibility, integration, accessibility, speed, scriptability, credibility, situation awareness, and monitoring). This research proposes the use of Wixom and Todd's (2005) integrated user satisfaction model in the context of system administration. This theoretical model provides an opportunity to link the identified characteristics with system administrator beliefs and tool usage. This research contributes to existing knowledge by identifying information and system quality attributes important to system administrators, and empirically testing the modified user satisfaction model in the untested context of system administration. The user satisfaction model was found to be significant and predictive of system administrator tool use behaviors, with two information quality attributes (accuracy and verification) and two system quality attributes (reliability and credibility) significant...|$|R
