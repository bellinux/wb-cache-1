We find the evidence that large <b>cap</b> <b>portfolios</b> lead small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolios</b> in both subperiods of German stock market but this structure is seen only in the first subperiod of Turkish stock market. Analysing the market-wide and portfolio-specific information effects on portfolio returns shows that above stated lead-lag relation {{is associated with the}} market-wide information content in lagged large <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns. We also document a directional asymmetry in small (large) <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns’ reactions to lagged large (small) <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns. The evidence is contradicting to the previous findings of McQueen, Pinegar and Thorley (1996) and Marshall and Walker (2002) whoose researches are conducted on US and Chile stock markets. Our findings show the lagged effects of bad news - not good news - on small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> returns. It is documented that the speed of adjustment of small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> prices to common market-wide information is slower than large <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> prices and small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> prices are slower in reacting to bad news.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{information}} {{content of the}} ex post overnight return for one-day-ahead equity Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. To do so, we deploy a univariate VaR modeling approach that constructs the forecast at market open and, accordingly, exploits the available overnight close-to-open price variation. The benchmark is the bivariate VaR modeling approach proposed by Ahoniemi et al. that constructs the forecast at the market close instead and, accordingly, it models separately the daytime and overnight return processes and their covariance. For a small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio,</b> the bivariate VaR approach affords superior predictive ability than the ex post overnight VaR approach whereas for a large <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> the results are reversed.

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine if smaller {{companies}} outperform large {{ones in the}} backwashes of the crisis, i. e. if growth stocks are better off than value stocks when investing. I will investigate how well the three largest companies from Nasdaq OMX’s small cap, mid cap and large cap managed to perform compared to the market index OMXSPI. Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model I will use the beta {{as a measure of}} risk to see if higher risk entails higher returns, as the risk-return tradeoff model assumes. Three portfolios consisting of three companies each will be observed and compared. The samples observed will be: i) a portfolio consisting of the three largest companies at Nasdaq OMX small cap list, ii) a portfolio consisting of the three largest companies at Nasdaq OMX mid cap list and iii) a portfolio consisting of the three largest companies at Nasdaq OMX large cap list and an comparing index: OMXSPI. The three portfolios will be divided into two different measure groups: one where the three portfolios are equally weighted and one where the portfolios are weighted by its market capitalization, to investigate if there are any significantly large differences. Each one of the three portfolios will also be compared to an appropriate index. The result supports the assumption of the risk-return tradeoff: the higher the risk, the higher the return. Given that the investor is willing to bear more risk, the return on the investment made will be higher. According to the research made I found that smaller companies do outperform larger ones, since the large <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> had the lowest rate of return for the given time period. But the risk-return tradeoff assumption is not totally true: the small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio</b> did not manage to outperform the mid cap, hence the best performance made after the crisis was by the mid <b>cap</b> <b>portfolio.</b> I therefore conclude that the risk-return tradeoff is partly true, that a mix of growth- and value stocks would generate the highest return and that more data need to be used to give more exact result...|$|R

Water entitlements in NSW {{are based on the}} irrigated area with the actual volume of water received in any year depending almost entirely on seasonal conditions. Musgrave and Lesueur (1973) argued that these entitlements could be replaced by a portfolio of entitlements, with each type of entitlement in the <b>portfolio</b> <b>guaranteeing</b> a nominated minimum value of water at a different probability. Thus, irrigators could purchase a portfolio of water entitlements which would suit their individual risk preferences.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{predictable}} covariances between means and variances of stock returns {{may have a}} first order effect on portfolio composition. In an international asset menu that includes both European and North American small capitalization equity indices, we find that a three-state, heteroskedastic regime switching VAR model is required to provide a good fit to weekly return data and to accurately predict the dynamics in the joint density of returns. As {{a result of the}} non-linear dynamic features revealed by the data, small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolios</b> become riskier in bear markets, i. e. display negative co-skewness with other stock indices. Because of this property, a power utility investor ought to hold a well diversified portfolio, despite the high risk premium and Sharpe ratios offered by small capitalization stocks. On the contrary small caps command large optimal weights when the investor ignores variance risk, by incorrectly assuming joint normality of returns. These results provide the missing partial equilibrium rationale for the presence of co skewness in the empirical asset pricing models that have been proposed to explain the cross-section of stock returns.

40|$|In {{the light}} of recent {{evidence}} that liquidity and idiosyncratic risk may be priced factors in the cross section of expected stock returns and that market capitalization significantly affects investor behavior and liquidity, we explore the interactions between liquidity, idiosyncratic risk and return across {{time as well as}} across size-based portfolios of stocks listed in the London Stock Exchange. In a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) analytical framework, we find that volatility spills over from large cap stocks to small cap stocks and vice versa. Volatility shocks can be predicted by illiquidity shocks in both large cap {{as well as in the}} small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolios.</b> Illiquidity can be predicted by return shocks in small cap stocks. Finally, we document some evidence of asymmetric liquidity spillovers, from large cap stocks to small cap ones, supporting the intuition that common information is first incorporated in the trading behavior of large-cap investors and the liquidity of large cap stocks and is then transmitted in the trading of small stocks. 1 Acknowledgement: We are grateful to V.

40|$|Small {{capitalization}} {{stocks are}} known to have asymmetric risk across bull and bear markets. This paper investigates how variance risk affects international equity diversification by examining the portfolio choice of a power utility investor confronted with an asset menu that includes (but is not limited to) European and North American small equity portfolios. Stock returns are generated by a multivariate regime switching process that is able to account for both non-normality and predictability of stock returns. Non-normality matters for portfolio choice because the investor has a power utility function, implying a preference for positively skewed returns and aversion to kurtosis. We find that small <b>cap</b> <b>portfolios</b> command large optimal weights only when regime switching (and hence variance risk) is ignored. Otherwise a rational investor ought to hold a well-diversified portfolio. However, the availability of small caps substantially increases expected utility, in the order of riskless annualized gains of 3 percent and higher. These findings are robust to a number of modifications concerning the coefficient of relative risk aversion, the investment horizon, short-sale possibilities, and the exact structure of the asset menu. strategic asset allocation, markov-switching, size effects, liquidity (variance) risk...|$|R
