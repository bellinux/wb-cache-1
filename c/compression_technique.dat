40|$|Abstract: Digital image {{compression}} {{has been the}} focus of a large amount of research in recent years. As a result, Image compression methods grow as new algorithms or variations of the already existing ones are introduced. In order to utilize digital images effectively, specific techniques are needed to reduce the number of bits required for their presentation. It has led to an instant growth in Area of Digital Image Processing. In {{image compression}}, we do not only concentrate on reducing size but also concentrate on doing it without losing quality and information of image. The survey summarizes the major image <b>compression</b> <b>techniques</b> that maybe lossy and lossless, advantages, disadvantages and research possibilities. This analysis of various <b>compression</b> <b>techniques</b> provides knowledge in the identifying the advantageous features and help in choosing correct method for compression.

25|$|The {{popularity}} of LZW led CompuServe to choose {{it as the}} <b>compression</b> <b>technique</b> for their version of GIF, developed in 1987. At the time, CompuServe {{was not aware of}} the patent.

The subsequent agreement was announced on 24 December 1994. Unisys stated that they expected all major commercial on-line information services companies employing the LZW patent to license the technology from Unisys at a reasonable rate, but that they would not require licensing, or fees to be paid, for non-commercial, non-profit GIF-based applications, including those for use on the on-line services.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} load a gas as {{a sample of}} {{pressure}} transmitting medium, the gas must be in a dense state, as to not shrink the sample chamber once pressure is induced. To achieve a dense state, gases can be liquefied at low temperatures or compressed. Cryogenic loading is a technique that uses liquefied gas {{as a means of}} filling the sample chamber. The DAC is directly immersed into the cryogenic fluid that fills the sample chamber. However, there are disadvantages to cryogenic loading. With the low temperatures indicative of cryogenic loading, the sample is subjected to temperatures that could irreversibly change it. Also, the boiling liquid could displace the sample or trap an air bubble in the chamber. It is not possible to load gas mixtures using the cryogenic method due to the different boiling points of most gases. Gas <b>compression</b> <b>technique</b> densifys the gases at room temperature. With this method, most of the problems seen with cryogenic loading are fixed. Also, loading gas mixtures becomes a possibility. The technique uses a vessel or chamber in which the DAC is placed and is filled with gas. Gases are pressurized and pumped into the vessel with a compressor. Once the vessel is filled and the desired pressure is reached the DAC is closed with a clamp system run by motor driven screws.|$|E
