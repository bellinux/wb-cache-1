The Boer witnesses nightly proclaimed the wrongs of the Transvaal in the smoking-rooms of the hotels. They openly asserted their belief that Jameson and his officers could not be convicted in an English court. Their distrust provoked them, and their self-confidence permitted them, to use the boldest language in discussing the situation in mixed gatherings.

I want you to think of the oat crops cut green and half-grown, and the men who raised them mending their clothes with flour-bags and measuring out their groceries by the cent's worth, after spending half a lifetime chopping out the ranch. It's wrong--clean against the economy of things.

"You know, moreover, of what {{consequence}} it is, {{that the}} missioners, who {{are sent to}} the Indies, should be proper for the end proposed; and it is convenient, on that account, that you come to Portugal and Rome: for not only many more will be desirous of going on those missions, but you will make a better choice of missioners, and will see more clearly to what parts such and such are proper to be sent. You judge yourself of what consideration it is, not to be mistaken in these affairs; and whatsoever relation you <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us,</b> your letters are not sufficient {{to give us a}} true notion of what labourers are fitting for the Indies. It is necessary that you, or some one as intelligent as you, should know and practise those who are designed for those countries. Besides what it will be in your power to do for the common benefit of the East, you will warm the zeal of the king of Portugal, in relation to Ethiopia, which has been under consideration for so many years, but nothing yet performed. You will also be of no little use to the affairs of Congo and Brasil, on which you can have no influence in India, for want of commerce betwixt them and you.

We must put up {{with what we have}} already, I suppose, and let Mr. Webster stand threatening to blow us all up with his pistol pointed at the elongated keg of gunpowder on which his left hand rests,--no bad type of the great man's state of mind after the nomination of General Taylor, or of what a country member would call a penal statue. But do we reflect that Vermont is half marble, and that Lake Superior <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us</b> bronze enough for regiments of statues? I go back to my first plan of a prohibitory enactment. I had even {{gone so far as to}} make a rough draught of an Act for the Better Observance of the Second Commandment; but it occurred to me that convictions under it would be doubtful, from the difficulty of satisfying a jury that our graven images did really present a likeness to any of the objects enumerated in the divine ordinance. Perhaps a double-barrelled statute might be contrived that would meet both the oratorical and the monumental difficulty. Let a law be passed that all speeches delivered more for the benefit of the orator than that of the audience, and all eulogistic ones of whatever description, be pronounced in the chapel of the Deaf and Dumb asylum, and all statues be set up within the grounds of the Institution for the Blind. Let the penalty for infringement in the one case be to read the last President's Message, and in the other to look at the Webster statue one hour a day, for a term not so long as to violate the spirit of the law forbidding cruel and unusual punishments.|$|E

It is nice to know that you back home really are behind us. Nothing is more discouraging than to hear and read of strikes, etc. back home.

We need all the guns, tanks, radio parts, motors, etc. you <b>can</b> <b>send</b> <b>us.</b> The more we get, the fewer the lives that we will lose.

Fascism suppressed education [...] we encourage it. We are beating the Germans and Japs because we are better educated than they.
