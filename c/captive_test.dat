50|$|US Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory {{developed}} the FDL-23, a 2nd generation Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)In the early 1970s, two Ryan Model 147G reconnaissance drones were requisitioned from the Air Force Museum by the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory at WPAFB to investigate high maneuverability flight and discover whether a high performance {{remotely piloted aircraft}} could perform {{some of the same}} missions as manned aircraft. The 147G was particularly suited for this since it had an extended nose section for equipment, a more powerful engine, and a larger wing than previous FireBee variants. The aircraft was fitted with a reinforced wing box, an active rudder, a nose video camera, a Vega digital control/data link, speed brakes, and a Lear Sieglar digital proportional autopilot. The modified drone was originally designated the FDL-23 and later the XQM-103. Six captive and six free flight test flights were performed, with the machine able to perform 10G turns in its final configuration. On its fifth mission, the engine shaft bent at 10 G's and impacted the compressor housing, damaging its engine. On its sixth mission, the aircraft refused to accept ground commands and self-recovered in the mountains north of Los Angeles with minor damage. The Program was completed successfully, and met all of its development objectives. Several major system including the autopilot and the command/control system were adopted by production drone programs. The major limitation to using the RPA for fighter missions was the lack of a video tracking system, which made tracking maneuvering targets extremely difficult.At the conclusion of the program, the aircraft was donated to the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, and became a static display at the entrance to Eagle Range. This aircraft reappeared at Edwards AFB without the engine as a <b>captive</b> <b>test</b> platform for optics testing.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{underwater}} vehicles have control surfaces to enable manoeuvring. The problem with an underwater vehicle with control surfaces is operating it at low speed. At low speed, the control surfaces become inoperative as {{the magnitude of}} the generated lift relates to the water speed passing over the control surfaces. A novel device, which is a potential solution to this problem, is the collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP). The CCPP can generate both axial and transverse thrusts in one device. The research focused on the performance of the CCPP and the performance of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP. The information about the true performance of this CCPP has not been investigated. Assessing the true performance in a straight line of the CCPP was the first objective of this research. The development of the simulation program was the second objective of this research in order to assess the motion control of an underwater vehicle by using the CCPP. The performance in a straight line of the CCPP behind an underwater vehicle was assessed by using a <b>captive</b> <b>test</b> in the Towing Tank at the Australian Maritime College. In the experiment, the propeller was set at various pitch angles, and it was tested at various advance coefficients. Polynomial equations for estimating the thrust and the torque coefficients of the propeller with the collective pitch setting were established. In addition, the effects of the collective pitch, cyclic pitch, and advance coefficient related to the magnitude and direction of the transverse thrust were studied. Increasing {{the magnitude of the}} collective pitch setting caused the direction of the transverse thrust to rotate clockwise when looked at from aft. The magnitude of the transverse thrusts increased as the collective pitch setting increased. Different types of cyclic pitch setting affected the direction of the transverse thrust differently. Increasing the magnitude of the cyclic pitch setting raised the magnitude of the transverse thrust. According to the experimental information, the direction and the magnitude of the transverse thrust was found to be difficult to control manually. Hence a motion control system of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP was developed in order to assist an operator to control the vehicle. The proportional integral derivative control law was used to develop the control system. The capability of the motion control system and the manoeuvrability of {{the underwater}} vehicle equipped with the CCPP were assessed by using a developed simulation program. In addition, the numerical simulation of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP is an essential tool to develop the CCPP in the future. The simulation program was developed by using the mathematical model of a test underwater vehicle. Furthermore, the forces of the CCPP were modelled by using the experimental results and the performance prediction program. The simulation study has shown that the underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP has flexible manoeuvrability, and controllability. The CCPP is capable of controlling an underwater vehicle in all directions. For further development, the free running test should be conducted in order to demonstrate the performance of the underwater vehicle and to verify the simulation program...|$|E

40|$|The Marine Dynamic Test Facility (MDTF) is a 5 DOF <b>captive</b> {{hydrodynamic}} model <b>test</b> apparatus being jointly procured by the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND) and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). This apparatus (Fig. 1) {{is being built}} by Bombardier Inc. of Montreal {{and is expected to}} be commissioned by late 1997. To be installed in the towing tank (Fig. 2) of NRC's Institute for Marine Dynamics (IMD) in St. John's, Newfoundland, this apparatus can oscillate a captive model in any arbitrary combination of heave, picth, surge and swat motions through electrically driven actuators. A submarine model will generally be sting-mounted and can be rotated in roll using a hydraulic actuator. The alternative strut mounting option is also available both for surface ships and submarines, particularly when propulsion systems are to be installed in the latter (Fig. 3).

Increasing the ratio of sting diameter to reference length to 0. 53 influences damping considerably at angles of attack from 0 to 3 deg at all Reynolds numbers but shows little or no effect at higher angles.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of computerised planar motion carriages (CPMC) offered many advantages to researchers {{making use of}} <b>captive</b> model <b>testing</b> for investigating ship manoeuvring.

Nevertheless {{it is still not}} clear in which way optimal use can be made of the possibilities of this experimental equipment in the determination of acceleration derivatives occurring in a ship's mathematical manoeuvring model, especially in shallow water conditions and low speed values. In order to overcome some disadvantages of conventional PMM sway testing, an alternative way of determining sway acceleration derivatives was introduced.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{problem of}} predicting the course which a ship follows 1 n {{response to a}} prescribed stern-plane or rudder motion has not been satisfactorily solved. A satisfactory solution of this problem would have considerable practical value, particularly for the motion of a submarine where "maneuverability in depth" is so important. The theory is unsatisfactory {{in the sense that}} trajectories describing the motion cannot reliably be predicted from the results of <b>captive</b> model <b>tests.</b> The commonly accepted reason for this failure is that the hydrodynamic characteristics which are determined from <b>captive</b> model <b>tests</b> are not known with sufficient precision or reliability. This reason is quite plausible in view of the discrepant results which are often obtained from different model tests of the same prototype. The present study was undertaken with the object of ascertaining whether it is possible to combine information from <b>captive</b> model <b>tests</b> with information from free-running model tests for the purpose of constructing hydrodynamic characteristics which may be introduced into differential equations of a given form, such equations being used to characterize the motion, and thus allowing one to predict new trajectories. Only hand computation methods have been used in this investigation. Although no very fixed conclusions can be drawn, it appears that more accurate free-running tests (as well as <b>captive</b> model <b>tests)</b> are required to obtain positive results. However, it is misleading to imply that nothing of value can be learned from this type of approach. One can, in fact, roughly predict some trajectories and, given enough patience, one could, perhaps, continue to modify the equations so that they fit more and more trajectories. It is known that nonlinear differential equations must be used to characterize the motion and it is, therefore, evident a priori that theoretically there must always exist some ambiguity regarding the validity of the equations. However, from a practical point of view one may say that if equations have been constructed which have as one solution a given trajectory, then these equations should be approximately valid for trajectories which are not too different, i. e., trajectories which do not involve a different type of maneuver and do not involve large differences in the magnitudes of any of the parameters which directly influence the motion...|$|R
