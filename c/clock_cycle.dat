5|$|Simultaneous {{multithreading}} (of which Intel's Hyper-Threading is {{the best}} known) was an early form of pseudo-multi-coreism. A processor capable of simultaneous multithreading includes multiple execution units in the same processing unit—that is it has a superscalar architecture—and can issue multiple instructions per <b>clock</b> <b>cycle</b> from multiple threads. Temporal multithreading {{on the other hand}} includes a single execution unit in the same processing unit and can issue one instruction at a time from multiple threads.|$|E
5|$|However, power {{consumption}} P by a chip {{is given by}} the equation P = C × V 2 × F, where C is the capacitance being switched per <b>clock</b> <b>cycle</b> (proportional {{to the number of}} transistors whose inputs change), V is voltage, and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second). Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor {{power consumption}} led ultimately to Intel's May 8, 2004 cancellation of its Tejas and Jayhawk processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each <b>clock</b> <b>cycle.</b> EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E

50|$|Historical note: ISO/IEC 7816-3:1989 only defined that N code the EGT as {{a number}} of ETU, the method now used when T&#8239;=&#8239;15 is absent from the ATR.

The 1997 edition of the standard introduced that when T&#8239;=&#8239;15 is present in the ATR, N code the EGT as a multiple of the number of <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> per ETU coded by TA1, making the EGT effectively independent of the number of <b>clocks</b> <b>cycles</b> per ETU negotiated, while maintaining compatibility with former readers at least if they did not change the number of <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> per ETU.|$|R

25|$|Although {{this meant}} fewer clock cycles per instruction, {{compared}} to the Z80 for instance, the latter's higher resolution state machine allowed clock frequencies 3-5 times as high without demanding faster memory chips, which was often the limiting factor. This is because the Z80 combines two full (but short) clock cycles into a relatively long memory access period {{compared to the}} clock, while the more asynchronous 6809 instead has relatively short memory access times: depending on version and speed grade, approximately 60% of a single <b>clock</b> <b>cycle</b> was typically available for memory access in a 6809 (see data sheets).|$|E

This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements around a decade later when the i486 (1989) or the original Pentium (1993) were introduced. This was {{partly due to the}} non-multiplexed address and data buses, but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as base+index) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do effective address computation using its general ALU, consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex microcoded numerical operations such as MUL/DIV than its predecessor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for extending {{the capacity of}} trace buffers when capturing debug data during post-silicon debug. It exploits the fact that is it not necessary to capture error-free data in the trace buffer since that information {{can be obtained from}} simulation. A selective data capture method is proposed in this paper that only captures debug data during <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> in which errors are present. The proposed debug method requires only three debug sessions. The first session estimates a rough error rate, the second session identifies a set of suspect <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> where errors may be present, and the third session captures the suspect <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> in the trace buffer. The suspect <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> are determined through a 2 -D compaction technique using multiple-input signature register signatures and cycling register signatures. Intersecting both signatures generates a small number of suspect <b>clock</b> <b>cycles</b> for which the trace buffer needs to capture. The effective observation window of the trace buffer can be expanded significantly, by up to orders of magnitude. Experimental results indicate very significant increases in the effective observation window for a trace buffer can be obtained.

25|$|The Nord-100 was {{introduced}} in 1979, which was specialized at flexibility and focused on administrative applications. When Digital launched their VAX-11 in 1977, Norsk Data had the Nord-5 32-bit computer ready for CERN. As the VAX-11 was 32-bit and regarded as a superminicomputer, Norsk Data did not initially {{see it as a}} competitor since the Nord-5 had much better processing power. Nord-50 had similar processing power to the Nord-5, but was not a general-purpose computer. The 32 bit computer used a Nord-10 front processor that ran the SINTRAN III operating system. Development of the ND-500 started in 1978 and had so fundamental changes to the system architecture (was not made from bit-slice components but microprammed with a new instruction set) that all software had to be rewritten - except for the SINTRAN. The computer was launched in 1981, but with fundamental shortcomings imposed by the OS It was much faster than the VAX, but did not meet the general customers' expectation of being a multi-purpose computer. Later models improved the performance and tweaking of the system allowed it to become a multipurpose system.at the performance of a special purpose super computer as sold by Cray. A major contract with the ND-500 was the Joint European Torus project, which took delivery of twenty-seven ND-100 and -500 units. Development of the ND-5000 started before the ND-500 was completed. The design was changed to become more modular; this increased the development costs, but reduced production costs and increased scalability. On the ND5000, components were placed in cards that were interconnected, initially to simplify cooling but also to enable the high clock frequency If an electric current is switched at a clock frequency of 1GHz, it travel about one foot per cycle, so 10cm is a delay of a <b>clock</b> <b>cycle</b> at 3GHz. The ND-500 computers had timing problems caused by wire-distance, and going faster just required everything to be close.|$|E
