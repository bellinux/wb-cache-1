5000|$|When a {{transaction}} is made, the card holder is offered a paper or electronic transaction record containing {{information about the}} purchase. This includes: transaction amount, transaction number, transaction date and time, transaction type (deposits, withdrawal, purchase or refund), type of account being debited or credited, card number, identity of the <b>card</b> <b>acceptor</b> (organization/store address) {{as well as the}} identity of the terminal (company name from which the machine operates). The use of debit cards in 2014 increased by 18% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. As for credit cards, it increased by 26% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. These two types of payment methods combined make up for more transactions than cash. Card transaction data has increased through the expansion of payment channels available to customers. Additionally, incentive and reward programs have increased the use of electronic cards for their benefits. The use of contactless and e-commerce payment has also allowed for a growth in card transaction data to increase due to the simplicity of the transaction. The use of Interact Debit transactions have increased rapidly in the last 6 years according to Interact Debit statistics. However, Canada has a lower rate debit use transactions by inhabitant in comparison to the United States, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, and Great Britain.|$|E
40|$|March 29 th, 2004 The {{technology}} {{being studied}} is smart card. A smart card {{is a standard}} credit card-sized plastic token within which a microchip has been embedded. Today, the internet, in particular, is focusing the need for online identification and authentication between parties who cannot otherwise know or trust each other, and smart card is the solution. The {{most important part of}} this technology is on the security features, and the security features need both software and hardware support. The physical structure of a smart card is a plastic card with the dimensions of 85. 60 mm x 53. 98 mm x 0. 80 mm. It has an integrated circuit chip embedded in. The integrated circuit chip consists a microprocessor, read only memory (ROM), non-static random access memory (RAM) and electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) which will retain its state when the power is off. The data exchange speed limit between the integrated circuit chip and the <b>card</b> <b>acceptor</b> device (CAD) is 9600 bits/second. The transmission of data is in one direction at a time. There will be lot of information stored in the card and it should be kept secret and revealed to other users. The smart card life cycle contains five main phases and each phase has their limitation on transfer and access of data. Fabrication phase, this phase is for the chip manufacturers. Pre-personalisation phase, this phase is for the card suppliers. Personalisation phase, this phase is conducted by the card issuers. Utilisation phase, this phase is for the normal use of the card by the cardâ€™s holder. Endof-Life phase, {{there are two ways to}} get into this phase. One is initialized by the application which writes the invalidation lock to an individual file or the master file. The other way is when the control system irreversibly blocks access because both the PIN and unblocking PIN are blocked. The following table is a summary of the conditions and memory accesses of a smart card during the various phases which are mentioned above: Phases and access rights of smart card's life cycle (ref 1...|$|E
5000|$|The company's success so far {{in terms}} of funding and {{industry}} recognition reflects a number of developing trends - the growth of e-commerce, the drive to use machine learning to solve problems for which big data is available, and online retailers' growing concern about the impact fraud prevention has on their customers. As Gartner {{pointed out in the}} April 2016 report, How <b>Card</b> <b>Acceptors</b> Can Protect Against the New Wave of Card Fraud, [...] "Web commerce has shifted the role of fraud detection from the arcane back office loss prevention department to being front and center in the customer experience." [...] This is something that both retailers and customers are beginning to realize and sophisticated fraud prevention solutions are receiving increased attention as a result.|$|R
50|$|Integration of {{technology}} allows kiosks {{to perform a}} wide range of functions, evolving into self-service kiosks. For example, kiosks may enable users to order from a shop's catalogue when items are not in stock, check out a library book, look up information about products, issue a hotel key card, enter a public utility bill account number in order to perform an online transaction, or collect cash in exchange for merchandise. Customised components such as coin hoppers, bill <b>acceptors,</b> <b>card</b> readers and thermal printers enable kiosks to meet the owner's specialised needs.|$|R
