50|$|Many radios are {{equipped}} with transmitter time-out timers which limit {{the length of a}} transmission. A bane of push-to-talk systems is the stuck microphone: a radio locked on transmit which disrupts communications on a two-way radio system. One example of this problem occurred in a car with a concealed two-way radio installation where the microphone and <b>coiled</b> <b>cord</b> were hidden inside the glove box. An operator tossed the mike into the glove box and shut it, causing the push-to-talk button to be depressed and locking the transmitter on. On taxi systems, a driver may be upset when a dispatcher assigns a call (s)he wanted to another driver and may deliberately hold the transmit button down (for which the owner can be fined by the FCC). Radios with time-out timers transmit for the preset amount of time, usually 30- or 60-seconds, after which the transmitter automatically turns off and a loud tone comes out of the radio speaker. The volume level of the tone on some radios is loud and cannot be adjusted. As soon as the push-to-talk button is released, the tone stops and the timer resets.|$|E

40|$|Background : Preeclampsia {{is one of}} {{the major}} three causes of {{maternal}} death in the world including Indonesia according to WHO and Health Ministry of Indonesia. In subject with preeclampsisa, there is an abnormal placentation. The trophoblast cells fail to invade the muscle layer of spiralis arteries and surrounding tissue. Thus, the spiralis arteries relatively constrict lead to a decrease in uteroplacental circulation. The vascular resistance will increase due to a decrease in uteroplacental circulation. There is a significant correlation between umbilical vein flow rate and umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index. Umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index can be used as an indicator of poor perinatal outcomes (associated with preeclampsia, the extreme age, GDM, and others). Aim : To determine the difference of umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index between subject with severe preeclampsia and normotensive Methods : An analytical observational study with cross sectional design. The primary data was taken from macroscopic observation of the length and the number of <b>coils</b> from umbilical <b>cord.</b> The samples consisted of 30 subjects; 14 subjects with severe preeclampsia as case group and 16 subjects with normotensive pregnancy served as control group in a couple of health facilites in Semarang. Analysis data used Mann-Whitney test. Results : The analysis showed a difference of umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index between subject with severe preeclampsia and subject with normotensive pregnancy (p= 0, 009). Umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index of subject with severe preeclampsia (0, 3709 ± 0, 21637 coil/cm) was lower than umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index of subject with normotensive pregnancy (0, 4034 ± 0, 04118 coil/cm).

40|$|Our aim was {{to review}} the {{literature}} on umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling.</b> Relevant articles in English published between 1966 and 2003 were retrieved by a Medline search and cross-referencing. The normal umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling</b> index (UCI) is 0. 17 (+/- 0. 009) spirals completed per cm. Abnormal <b>cord</b> <b>coiling,</b> i. e. UCI 90 th centile (> 0. 30) is associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Hypocoiling of the cord is associated with increased incidence of fetal demise, intrapartum fetal heart rate decelerations, operative delivery for fetal distress, anatomic-karyotypic abnormalities and chorio-amnionitis. Hypercoiling of the cord is associated with increased incidence of fetal growth restriction, intrapartum fetal heart rate decelerations, vascular thrombosis and cord stenosis.

40|$|To {{determine}} if {{presence of the}} Roach muscle, a small muscle bundle lying just beside the umbilical artery, contributes to umbilical <b>cord</b> <b>coiling.</b> 251 umbilical <b>cords</b> were examined. The umbilical coiling index (UCI) was calculated {{as the number of}} coils divided by the cord length in cm. Cords were classified as hypocoiled (UCI p 90). On microscopic examination of a cross section of the cord, absence or presence of a Roach muscle was determined. The t-test for independent samples and logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. A Roach muscle was observed in 101 cords. The mean UCI was higher in cords with the muscle bundle (0. 23 coils/cm) than in cords without a muscle (0. 18 coils/cm). Difference in mean: 0. 05 coils/cm (95 % C. I. 0. 01 - 0. 09). OR for hypercoiling in presence of the muscle was 2. 98 (95 % C. I. 1. 57 - 5. 64). OR for hypocoiling {{in the presence of the}} muscle was 1. 49 (95 % C. I. 0. 79 - 2. 81).

In order {{to arrive at a}} diagnosis, clusters are evaluated for certain cytomorphologic features including size, shape, smooth vs. scalloped borders, and three-dimensional (3 -D) configuration. By conventional microscopy, the image of these clusters is often blurred due to limitations in resolution. Consequently, the exact internal structure and cellular arrangement within these clusters cannot be adequately determined. Utilizing confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we examined serous fluids from a variety of conditions. Cases included mesothelioma, adenocarcinoma, and papillary adenocarcinoma. Smears were stained with 0. 01 % ethidium bromide and 1 % eosin Y, followed by analysis with an ACAS 570 ™ image analyzer (Meridian Instruments, Inc. Okemos, MI).

40|$|Background : Umbilical cord is a {{connective}} tissue between the placenta and fetus {{which has an}} important function in interaction between mother and fetus during pregnancy. Circulatory disorders on umbilical cord can cause asphyxia of the fetus’ organs and metabolisms, which can be acute or chronic, {{so that it will}} affect outcomes of the newborn. Aims : To know the influences between coiling index of the umbilical cord to ponderal index of the newborn on an aterm pregnancy. Methods : This study was a cross sectional observational research. The samples are pregnant women which has aterm baby’s delivery (37 - 42 weeks) who were treated in Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit in RSUP Dr. Kariadi Semarang, Bunda Maternity Hospital Semarang, Puskesmas Halmahera Semarang and Puskesmas Ngesrep Semarang.

A uniaxial muscle preparation (right ventricular trabecula of rat) was used so that the 3 -D collagen configuration could be readily related to sarcomere length. Transmission electron microscopy showed that these preparations were structurally homologous to ventricular wall muscle. Trabeculae were mounted {{on the stage of}} an inverted microscope and fixed at various sarcomere lengths. After a trabecula was stained with the fluorophore Sirius Red F 3 BA and embedded in resin, sequential optical sectioning enabled 3 -D reconstruction of its perimysial collagen fibres. The area fraction of these fibres, determined from the cross-sections of seven trabeculae, was 10. 5 ± 3. 9 % (means ± s. d.). The reconstructed 3 -D images show that perimysial collagen fibres are wavy (as distinct from <b>coiled)</b> <b>cords</b> which straighten considerably as the sarcomere length is increased from 1. 85 ± 0. 06 μm (near-resting length) to 2. 3 ± 0. 04 μm (means ± s. d., n = 4).

As a product line, the MDR-series Studio Monitor folding headphones have been noted as a [...] "favorite of sound professionals because they're reasonably flat sounding, inexpensive, compact, and they can take a lot of punishment." [...] The MDR prefix is an initialism of the Micro Dynamic Receiver trademark.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To compare {{selected}} {{umbilical cord}} parameters, especially <b>cord</b> <b>coiling,</b> between breech and vertex presentations. Methods: We prospectively collected umbilical cords from uncomplicated breech and vertex obtained during elective term cesarean deliveries. We compared various cord parameters {{between the two}} groups as well as data regarding obstetric history and pregnancy outcome. Results: We evaluated 55 umbilical cords from breech and 55 from vertex deliveries. Umbilical cord length (56. 93  cm vs. 63. 95  cm, P= 0. 05), number of coils (5. 1 ± 0. 4 vs. 11. 7 ± 0. 6, P&# 60; 0. 0001) and umbilical cord index (UCI) (0. 09  coils/cm vs. 0. 18  coils/cm, P&# 60; 0. 0001) were all significantly lower for breech presentations and remained significant following multivariate analysis. Conclusion: We document significant differences in umbilical coiling and the UCI between breech and vertex presentation. The precise reason for these differences is still unclear.
