40|$|Oil spill {{models are}} {{combined}} with bathymetric, meteorological, oceanographic, and geomorphological data to model {{a series of}} oil spill accidents in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. A total of 104 oil spill simulations, computed for 11 different locations in the Levantine Basin, show that oil slicks will reach the coast of Cyprus in four (4) to seven (7) days in summer conditions. Oil slick trajectories are controlled by prevailing winds and current eddies. Based on these results, we {{support the use of}} chemical dispersants in the very few hours after large accidental oil spills. As a corollary, we show shoreline susceptibility to vary depending on: a) differences in <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and exposure to wave action, b) the existence of uplifted wave-cut platforms, coastal lagoons and pools, and c) the presence of tourist and protected environmental areas. Mitigation work should take into account the relatively high susceptibility of parts of the Eastern Mediterranean...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of newly-built infrastructures {{along the coast}} of Batang, Central Java, has inherent effects on coastal hydrodynamics and natural equilibrium of annual sediment transport near the coastline. Retreating coastline as a result of severe erosion continuously occurs at some locations in recent years. This study aims to calculate the sediment transport behaviour {{along the coast of}} Batang, Central Java, by considering the {{presence of}} infrastructures. Modeling was done by means of a commersially available software package MIKE 21, especially the LITPACK module, developed by DHI Water and Environment, Denmark. The model shows that sediment drift parallel to the coastline occurs primarily within the distance of 300 meters from the coast. From 2010 to 2013, the general trend of sediment transport in the area {{is that there is a}} net sediment transport from the west to the east direction in the early months of the year, followed by a shorter period of transport in opposite direction (westward) for a few months. The inbalance of this sediment transport capacity is suspected to be responsible for the changes in <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> in Batang...|$|E
40|$|Coastline change {{reflects}} {{the dynamics of}} natural processes and human activity, and influences the ecology and environment of the coastal strip. This study researched the change in coastline and sea area of the Bohai Sea, China, over a 30 -year period using Landsat TM and OLI remote sensing data. The total change in coastline length, sea area, and the centroid of the sea surface were quantified. Variations in the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> were measured using four shape indexes: fractal dimension, compact ratio, circularity, and square degree. Equations describing fit of the shape index, coastline length, and marine area were built. Then the marine area 10 years later was predicted using the model that had the highest prediction accuracy. The {{results showed that the}} highest prediction accuracy for the coastline length was obtained using a compound function. When a cubic function was used to predict the compact ratio, then the highest prediction accuracy was obtained using this compact ratio and a quadratic function to predict sea area. This study can provide theoretical support for the coastal development planning and ecological environment protection around the Bohai Sea...|$|E
40|$|We discuss various {{situations}} where the formation of rocky coast morphology {{can be attributed to}} the retro-action of the coast morphology itself on the erosive power of the sea. Destroying the weaker elements of the coast, erosion can creates irregular seashores. In turn, the geometrical irregularity participates in the damping of sea-waves, decreasing their erosive power. There may then exist a mutual self-stabilization of the wave amplitude together with the irregular morphology of the coast. A simple model of this type of stabilization is discussed. The resulting <b>coastline</b> <b>morphologies</b> are diverse, depending mainly on the morphology/damping coupling. In the limit case of weak coupling, the process spontaneously builds fractal morphologies with a dimension close to 4 / 3. This provides a direct connection between the coastal erosion problem and the theory of percolation. For strong coupling, rugged but non-fractal coasts may emerge during the erosion process, and we investigate a geometrical characterization in these cases. The model is minimal, but can be extended to take into account heterogeneity in the rock lithology and various initial conditions. This allows to mimic coastline complexity, well beyond simple fractality. Our results suggest that the irregular <b>morphology</b> of <b>coastlines</b> as well as the stochastic nature of erosion are deeply connected with the critical aspects of percolation phenomena.

As with most members of the smelt whiting family, it is important to small coastal fisheries in various areas of its range.|$|R
40|$|The {{northern}} Andaman Sea {{including the}} Myanmar waters {{is one of}} the least studied regions of the northern Indian Ocean. The freshwater and suspended sediments carried by Ayeyawady / Irrawaddy, the peculiar surface circulation, <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and shallow bathymetry in the Gulf of Mottama facilitate several diverse environmental settings in the study region. In order to understand the environmental settings and their linkages to the plankton community in the study region, this paper combined in- situ data of ‘First India- Myanmar Joint Oceanographic Expedition ’ with satellite oceanography observations. The study period was the Spring Inter-monsoon (March- May), which was characterized by high tidal activity in the Gulf of Mottama region (tidal height 6 - 8 m) causing strong tidal currents and re-suspension of sediments. The tidal currents and eastward advection of Ayeyawady influx caused the lowest salinity, highest concentration of nutrients, suspended sediments and chlorophyll a in the Gulf of Mottama region. Conversely, high salinity, highest temperature, lowest nutrients and suspended sediments prevalent in the offshore waters of the northern Andaman Sea induced a massive bloom of Trichodesmium erythreum, which was mostly in the declining phase during the observation. The in-situ and satellite remote sensing data clearl...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{explores the}} use of a range of image {{processing}} methods combined with Landsat TM imagery for mapping the morphodynamics of the delta of the Axios River, one of the largest rivers of Greece, between 1984 and 2009. The techniques evaluated ranged from the traditional spectral bands arithmetic operations to unsupervised and supervised classification method. Changes in <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and erosion and deposition magnitudes were also estimated from direct photo-interpretation of the TM images, forming our reference dataset. Our analysis, conducted in a GIS environment, showed noticeable changes in the coastline of the study area, with erosion occurring mostly in the early periods followed by deposition later on. In addition, relatively similar patterns of coastline change were obtained from the different approaches, albeit of different magnitude. The differences observed were largely attributed to the varying ability of the different approaches to utilise the spectral information content of the TM data, strongly linked to the relative strengths and weaknesses underlying the implementation of the different techniques. Notably, supervised classifiers based on machine learning showed the closest results to the photo interpretation of TM, evidencing a promising potential for monitoring shoreline changes over long timescales in a cost-effective and rapid mannerPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{earthquake}} of March 11 {{of magnitude}} 9 offshore Tohoku, Japan, {{was followed by}} a tsunami wave with particularly destructive impact, over a coastal area extending approx. 850 km along the Pacific Coast of Honshu Island. First arrival times and measurements and maximum height were recorded by the Japanese monitoring system (wherever there was no failure of the equipment). The maximum run-up is well evident in satellite images available through USGS, Google and other institutes. Moreover, personal observations of Prof. Lekkas were made during a field survey in March 2011. The results of the study of the tsunami impact and run-up show the variety of factors affecting the run-up, creating zones with similar phenomena, but also specific locations where run-up exceeds by far the run-up zone maximum values. This differentiation, observed also in the past by other authors, is here attributed to the general orientation of the coast, the distance from the tsunami generation area, bathymetry offshore, the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and land geomorphology. In certain cases that funnelling and reflection effects in narrow gulfs parallel to the tsunami propagation vector were combined with narrow valleys onshore, peak run-up exceeded 20 m, or even 40 m (Miyagi coastline, Ogatsu, Onagawa, etc) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{proposes a}} method, {{based on the}} use of spatial data and aerial {{photographs}} to analyse long term evolution of the coastline along the Gâvres - Penthièvre beach system extending over more than 50 km (Southern Brittany; France). Spatial data layers include: air photograph measurements of coastline position through time, sediment cover, <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and bathymetry. These were combined with current data derived from both field and modelled data to digitise the limits of sediment cells. Aerial photographs analysis also provides data about the location and the density of anthropogenic features established along the coastline through time. All these data were compiled in a personal geodatabase and a series of both spatial and geostatistical analyses were carried out to assess their spatial relationships. Spatial analyses aim at identifying spatial associations between the type of site evolution (erosion polygon vs accretion polygon) and the characteristics of the coastline (type of sediment cell sites / low density of human pressures / high density of human pressures). Statistical analyses aim at assessing the statistical dependency between variables defining the spatial associations. The results enable identification of at least two different dynamics controlling coastline movements. At a regional scale coastal dynamics are mainly related to incident wave propagation. Over more local areas, interrelationships between coastal dynamics and increasing concentration of anthropogenic features partly explain coastline variations. Through these results, this study highlights benefits associated with GIS facilities to analyse the role of various factors on coastal dynamics control over a regional scale...|$|E
40|$|Shelves from {{volcanic}} ocean islands {{result from}} the competition between two main processes, wave erosion that forms and enlarges them and volcanic progradation that reduces their dimension. In places where erosion dominates over volcanism, shelf width {{can be used as}} a proxy for the relative age of the subaerial volcanic edifices and reconstruction of their extents prior to erosion can be achieved. In this study, new multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution seismic reflection profiles are exploited to characterize the morphology of the insular shelves adjacent to each volcanic edifice of Terceira Island in order to improve the understanding of its evolution. Subaerial morphological and geological/stratigraphic data were also used to establish the connection between the onshore and offshore evolution. Shelf width contiguous to each main volcanic edifice is consistent with the known subaerial geological history of the island; most of the older edifices have wider shelves than younger ones. The shelf edge proved to be a very useful indicator in revealing the original extent of each volcanic edifice in plan view. Its depth was also used to reconstruct vertical movements, showing that older edifices like Serra do Cume-Ribeirinha, Guilherme Moniz, and Pico Alto have subsided while more recent ones have not. The morphology of the shelf (namely the absence/presence of fresh lava flow morphologies and several types of erosional, depositional, and tectonic features) integrated with the analysis of the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> allowed us to better constrain previous geological interpretations of the island evolution. © 2014.

40|$|The annual {{export of}} the Mediterranean {{seagrass}} (Posidonia oceanica) litter to adjacent beaches and coastal dunes was quantified {{by examining the}} fortnight evolution of seagrass beach-cast volume on two beaches in the NW Mediterranean (Son Real and Es Trenc, Mallorca Island, Spain) {{for two years and}} analyzing the wind speed and direction obtained from the closest Meteorological Spanish Agency surface weather stations. The decomposition stage of the deposits was examined by analyzing the total hydrolysable amino acids, its percentage distribution and derived degradation indexes. Prevalent winds exceeding 6  m s− 1, the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and type of terrestrial vegetation determine the annual dynamics of the seagrass beach-cast. In the most protected beach (Son Real) the seagrass beach-cast remained nearly stationary during the two studied years while it exhibited wide annual fluctuations in the less protected one (Es Trenc). The amounts of P. oceanica wrack washed on Son Real and Es Trenc beaches, respectively, were estimated at 309  kg DW m coastline− 1 yr− 1 and 1359  kg DW m coastline− 1 yr− 1. They supplied between 20  kg CaCO 3 m coastline− 1 yr− 1 and 47  kg CaCO 3 m coastline− 1 yr− 1. Between 54 % (Son Real) and 70 % (Es Trenc) of seagrass beach-cast, respectively accounting for 1. 5  kg N m coastline− 1 yr− 1 and 8. 6  kg N m coastline− 1 yr− 1, were annually exported from the beaches to adjacent dune systems.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the perception of}} maritime space in the SW Aegean area of Greece during the Late Bronze Age, analysing and linking issues of <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and harbour location and maritime ideology. Drawing heavily {{on the concept of}} the maritime cultural landscape, the thesis reviews the state of knowledge about the nature of coastal settlement during the Mycenaean period in the SW Aegean and how the coastline has altered since antiquity due to geomorphological processes. The thesis presents the results of a coastal and offshore (snorkeling) survey carried out along several stretches of coast in Messenia and Laconia in the Peloponnese, the island of Kythera and in West Crete with the aim of assessing the location of possible harbours/anchorages dating to the Late Bronze Age. These results are compared with those available for comparable harbour locations in the Cyclades, Central and East Crete, the Dodecanese, East Aegean and parts of Italy dating to the Late Bronze Age period. The survey included the coastal sites of Pavlopetri and Epidauros Limera in the South Peloponnese and Kastelli, Chania and Phalasarna in West Crete. In the research presented in this thesis, harbours/anchorages of the Late Bronze Age should be considered as located at promising ancient sandy beaches, river outfalls and promontories. As there are no stone built harbour structures the default landing place was the beach. This thesis adopts a maritime perspective, viewing the coastal littoral from the sea. It examines various parameters including natural processes on the coast and hinterland that were, and remain, vital to the connectivity of cultures through the sea during the Late Bronze Age and thereafter. The intention is to contribute to a fuller understanding of seascapes and the maritime cultural landscape as seen through the evidence of potential harbours, and to gain insight into how maritime space may have impacted on the issue of harbour installations in the Late Bronze Age Aegean world...|$|E
40|$|The {{landscape}} {{evolution of}} the late Quaternary Tyrrhenian coast during the Holocene was controlled by the rates of postglacial sea-level rise and fluvial input. In this study the microfaunal data coming from some significant Italian coastal sites were considered in order to elaborate an evolutionary model valid at regional level, by mean of benthic foraminiferal assemblages. The coastal depositional system {{is characterized by a}} lowstand phase, which developed during the eustatic sea-level fall between about 120 and 30 - 26 kyr BP. During the late lowstand phase, which is characterized by stillstand and slow eustatic sea-level rise, lagoon and marsh associations occurred. These paralic environments are very sensitive to coastline variations, and provide one of the most sensitive tools for studying sea level change. One of their main characteristics is the degree of marine influence that depends on climatic conditions and on the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> and evolution. Foraminiferal assemblages represent {{one of the most important}} microfaunistic component of the paralic environments for their high adaptability also in euryhaline conditions. Salinity seems to be the most significant factor controlling the foraminiferal distribution in these environment although other parameters like organic and oxygen content could have a great influence on the frequencies of the taxa and on the assemblage composition. Two assemblages were recognized distinguished on the base of different confined conditions. The first one (Ammonia parkinsoniana, Ammonia tepida, Haynesina depressula and Haynesina germanica assemblage) is characterized by very low -Fisher index (mainly 10). Locally this infralittoral environment was colonized by Posidonia oceanica meadows as suggested by high frequencies of epiphytic taxa (miliolids, -Fisher index > 10). During the subsequent highstand phase and sea-level stabilization the foraminiferal assemblages reflect the current microfaunal distribution and the establishment of modern water circulation pattern (Globocassidulina subglobosa, Melonis pompilioides and Reussella spinulosa assemblage with -Fisher index > 10). After the sea-level stabilization, locally the coastal progradation and flood events lead to freshwater marsh episodes followed by backshore environments. On the whole, five main characteristic benthic foraminiferal assemblages are recognized in the Holocene cores: two indicate lagoonal or, in general, confined environments, two are related to marine infralittoral zone (0 - 50 mwd) and, finally, one is characteristic of the upper circalittoral zone (50 - 100 mwd) ...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the coastal}} super system {{there are the}} two main systems of the cliff and the {{foreshore}} and thirdly, but at a lower hierarchical level, the coastline system. The forms of and processes shaping each of these physical features are analysed quantitatively. Instrumented sites {{have been set up}} for the measurement of rates of erosion of the shore platform, of other foreshore features, and of the cliff foot over a longer period than has so far been possible. A section of cliff has also been instrumented. An original technique for the analysis of <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> is described. Bays that are fundamentally arcuate, triangular, or rectangular are associated with different extranous factors, the first particularly with a bare cliff foot or a sand or pebble beach, the second with a boulder beach or geological heterogeneity and the third with glacial deposits. The c 1 iff consists of any combination of the elements termed the sandstone scarp, the bevel, and the marine-activated cliff. The bevel results from protection of the cliff foot by talus cones and boulder beaches. It is concluded that bevelled cliffs are in dynamic equilibrium though relaxation time is long, leading to continuous changes in form. A cliff consisting of the marine-activated element only is probably a steady-state feature and is associated with a bare cliff foot or one which has a sand or pebble beach. The shore platform may include any combination of two elements, the ramp and the plane, the former being steeper than 2. 5 degrees and shaped by the corrasion of the overlying debris. The sub-horizonta 1 ity of the plane is a product of secondary erosive processes - mainly expansion and contraction of the shale due to wetting and drying in tidal and intertidal periods. The resistance of boulder beaches is increased if the boulders become imprisoned. Boulders partly embedded in the shore platform may remain perched when this feature is lowered. In the base of talus cones conglomerate can be formed in less than 200 years. Therefore the nature of the cliff foot is the principal regulator in the coast su rsystem but superficial deposits undergo erosion so this regulator and the supersystem continuously change. Measurements of erosion rates show that it is incorrect to hypothesise that some of the coastal landforms have been inherited from Pleistocene times...|$|E
40|$|Spatial data {{acquisition}} {{is a critical}} process for {{the identification of the}} coastline and coastal zones for scientists involved in the study of coastal morphology. The availability of very high-resolution digital surface models (DSMs) and orthophoto maps is of increasing interest to all scientists, especially those monitoring small variations in the earth’s surface, such as <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology.</b> In this article, we present a methodology to acquire and process high resolution data for coastal zones acquired by a vertical take off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attached to a small commercial camera. The proposed methodology integrated computer vision algorithms for 3 D representation with image processing techniques for analysis. The computer vision algorithms used the structure from motion (SfM) approach while the image processing techniques used the geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) with fuzzy classification. The SfM pipeline was used to construct the DSMs and orthophotos with a measurement precision in the order of centimeters. Consequently, GEOBIA was used to create objects by grouping pixels that had the same spectral characteristics together and extracting statistical features from them. The objects produced were classified by fuzzy classification using the statistical features as input. The classification output classes included beach composition (sand, rubble, and rocks) and sub-surface classes (seagrass, sand, algae, and rocks). The methodology was applied to two case studies of coastal areas with different compositions: a sandy beach with a large face and a rubble beach with a small face. Both are threatened by beach erosion and have been degraded by the action of sea storms. Results show that the coastline, which is the low limit of the swash zone, was detected successfully by both the 3 D representations and the image classifications. Furthermore, several traces representing previous sea states were successfully recognized {{in the case of the}} sandy beach, while the erosion and beach crests were detected in the case of the rubble beach. The achieved level of detail of the 3 D representations revealed new beach characteristics, including erosion crests, berm zones, and sand dunes. In conclusion, the UAV SfM workflow provides information in a spatial resolution that permits the study of coastal changes with confidence and provides accurate 3 D visualizations of the beach zones, even for areas with complex topography. The overall results show that the presented methodology is a robust tool for the classification, 3 D visualization, and mapping of coastal morphology...|$|E
40|$|Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province {{is one of}} {{the largest}} port cities in China and has {{achieved}} high economic development during the past decades. The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976 – 2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of ± 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan- 3 (ZY- 3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1. 09 to 1. 12, and the <b>coastline</b> <b>morphology</b> changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation...|$|E
