The {{vulnerability of}} the supramolecular structure of <b>casein</b> micelles face {{to changes in the}} environmental conditions restrains their applications in other domains besides food. Thus, redesigning <b>casein</b> micelles is a challenge to create new functionalities for these biosourced particles. The objective of this work was to create stable <b>casein</b> microgels from <b>casein</b> micelles using a natural cross-linker, named genipin. Suspensions of purified <b>casein</b> micelles (25 g L− 1) were mixed with genipin solutions to have final concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 mM genipin. Covalently linked <b>casein</b> microgels were formed via cross-linking of lysyl and arginyl residues of <b>casein</b> molecules. The reacted products exhibited blue color. The crosslinking reaction induced gradual changes on the colloidal properties of the particles. The <b>casein</b> microgels were smaller and more negatively charged and presented smoother surfaces than <b>casein</b> micelles. These results were explained based on the cross-linking of free NH 2 present in an external layer of κ-casein. Light scattering and rheological measurements showed that the reaction between genipin and <b>casein</b> molecules was intramicellar, as one single population of particles was observed and the values of viscosity (and, consequently, the volume fraction of the particles) were reduced. Contrary to the <b>casein</b> micelles, the <b>casein</b> microgels were resistant to the presence of dissociating agents, e. g., citrate (calcium chelating) and urea, but swelled as a consequence of internal electrostatic repulsion and the disruption of hydrophobic interactions between protein chains.

40|$|To be able {{to improve}} the quality of dairy {{products}} and dairy processes, knowledge of <b>casein</b> molecules, <b>casein</b> micelles and <b>casein</b> aggregates is important. The rheological properties of <b>casein</b> products, <b>casein</b> gels and adsorbed layers of <b>casein,</b> have been widely investigated. However, the micellar properties of <b>casein</b> could, until recently, only be studied by ensemble methods such as dynamic light scattering and microscopic techniques, using dried or frozen samples. Nano-techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) have now made it possible to make complementary nanorheological measurements in a liquid environment. In this thesis, the observed nanorheological properties of single <b>casein</b> micelles, adsorbed thin <b>casein</b> layers and rennet-induced casein-retentate gels, are presented and discussed. The ultimate objective of these studies was to investigate the relationship between the local and the macroscopic rheological properties of cheese. The renneted <b>casein</b> gels were produced from <b>casein</b> retentate from ultrafiltration (UF), as another objective of the work was to increase our knowledge on cheese production from concentrated milk. Natural rennet-induced cheese is essentially a particulate calcium phosphate-para-casein matrix, composed of interconnected and overlapping strands of partially fused para-casein aggregates, which are in turn made up of para-casein micelles. To increase our knowledge on the nanorheological behaviour of the building blocks of the <b>casein</b> matrix, the first step was to investigate single adsorbed <b>casein</b> micelles. In the AFM measurements, the nanorheological properties of adsorbed <b>casein</b> micelles could not be explained by any model describing an elastic material (Paper I).

5000|$|Milk is {{approximately}} {{made up of}} 3.0-3.5% proteins, the main proteins in cream are <b>caseins</b> and whey proteins, <b>caseins</b> are globular proteins with phosphoserine residue. Of the total fraction of milk proteins <b>caseins</b> make up 80% of the fraction while the whey protein make up 20% of the total fraction of proteins. There are four main classes of caseins; β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-casein and κ-caseins. These casein proteins form a multi molecular colloidal particle known as a casein micelle. The proteins mention have an affinity to bind with other casein proteins, or to bind with calcium phosphate, this binding is what forms the aggregates. The casein micelle are the aggregates of β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-caseins, that are coated with κ-caseins. The proteins are held together by small clusters of calcium phosphate, the micelle also contains lipase, citrate, minor ions, and plasmin enzymes, along with entrapped milk serum. Casein micelles are rather porous structures, ranging {{in the size of}} 50-250 nm in diameter and the structures on average are 6-12% of the total volume fraction of milk. The structure is porous {{in order to be able}} to hold a sufficient amount of water, it structure also assists in the reactivity of the micelle. The formation of casein molecules into the micelle is very unusual due to β-caseins large amount of propyl residues (the proline residues disrupt the formation of α-helical and β-sheet [...] ) and because κ-caseins only contain one phosphorylation residue (they are glycoproteins). Due to κ-caseins being glycoproteins, they are stable in the presence of calcium ions so the κ-caseins are on the outer layer of the micelle to partially protect the non glycoproteins β-caseins, α(s1)-caseins, α(s2)-caseins from precipitating out in the presence of excess calcium ions. Casein micelles are not heat sensitive particles, they are pH sensitive. The colloidal particles are stable at the normal pH of milk which is 6.5-6.7, the micelles will precipitate at the isoelectric point of milk which is a pH of 4.6.|$|E
