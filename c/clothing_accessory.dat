50|$|For Didier le Fur, Breton regionalists, {{as soon as}} the Breton Association was founded, {{were searching}} for a {{personality}} capable of personifying their ideal view of an agrarian and regional renewal, while manifesting their attachment to the French nation. They choose Anne of Brittany, who is increasingly portrayed in Breton costume in images. As prescribed by decorum in the 15th century, the duchess permanently wears a headdress (see contemporary representations of the duchess). For Didier Le Fur, the regionalists use this <b>clothing</b> <b>accessory</b> to attach Anne to their people, and to demonstrate the simplicity of the national (Breton) tastes. Didier Le Fur later indicates that regionalists give Anne simple and dark clothing (with the exception of official ceremonies, during which she wears sumptuous clothes, as seen on the official iconography). But the headdress was also adopted by the Breton bourgeoisie {{at the end of the}} 19th, which mitigates the peasant character of the portrayal of Anne at this time.|$|E
5000|$|Increased informality {{may have}} been the primary reason for the decline in the wearing of spats. In 1913, friends {{scrambled}} to help Griffith Taylor find spats and a top hat to receive the King's Polar Medal from King George V. [...] In 1923 King George V opened the Chelsea Flower Show, an important event in the London Season, wearing a frock coat, gray top hat and spats. By 1926, the King shocked the public by wearing a black morning coat instead of a frock coat (a small but significant change). This arguably helped speed the Frock coat's demise (although it was still being worn {{on the eve of the}} Second World War). Spats were another <b>clothing</b> <b>accessory</b> left off by the King in 1926. Interestingly it is said that the moment this was observed and commented on by the spectators it produced an immediate reaction; the ground beneath the bushes was littered with discarded spats.|$|E

50|$|The main {{element in}} the Mordvinian costume was a white canvas shirt, {{decorated}} with embroidery. Erzya shirt is made from two cloths, which beaned in two. In the middle, at the central suture there was a seam left to slit for the collar and the slit on the hem for a step. In the side seams on the top at right angle there were sewed sleeves. Traditional chest fastener in the Erzya costume was «fibula syulgamo». It was an oval buckle made of thick wire with a movable pin which was used for chipping the collar. Rich lower part covered a deep chest slit. In the 19th century, the collar was usually fastened by two fibulas, one of which had no decoration.Complex belt elements played a particular importance in Mordovian women`s costumes.Costume was loincloth- pulay, which was worn over a shirt. As a sign of pubescence, girls begin to wear a pulay since 13-14 years old and then it remained the woman`s costume accessory until her death. Mordvinian woman could not appear in men society without a «pulay». Depending on the place of existence, it had a different form: square, trapeziform or as a belt with magnificent fringe.Holiday « pulay» was decorated with shells, chains, copper buttons, badges, colored beads and along the edge with long, black, red, green or blue wool and with tassels on each side. As a result, the weight of such a «pulaya» was up to 6 kilograms. Waist decoration «pulay» was of two types. The {{right side of the}} cloth was decorated with embroidery. Then, almost to knees there was a fringe from the wool, usually of black, but on holidays it could be of red or green wool. Wool decorated with copper chains and on each side attached tassels of beads.Typical thing for Erzya costume was a canvas over clothes- “rutsya”. It was the <b>clothing</b> <b>accessory</b> of married women and had options for different situations in life and ritual. Over the shirt or rutsya they wore an apron - « ikelga patsya». It was tied low on the abdomen to close the hem of her shirt. In the complex adornments, which included several tiers of necklaces, especially distinguished original round collars on a firm basis covered with a canvas embroidered with rows of beads, buttons and chains. All of them perfectly matched with massive embroidery “rutsi”.The quality of clothing was defined by the type of embroidery. Spruce Erzya shirt was embroidered all along longitudinal stripes. Erzya embroidery was characterized by a beautiful carpet texture, borders and planes distinguished high relief. Although the ornament was pretty simple: rhombus, crosses and polylines. Decorating clothes women choose the best patterns - «sermat». In the old days they were the symbols of family belonging. Erzya woman naturally endowed with a sense of proportion. Intuitively, without the knowledge of designing and modeling clothes, she sewed a masterpiece. Red and black vertical stripes on a white canvas looked noble. A wide belt, «pulay» with long black strands emphasized hips and women looked slimmer. Removable adornments -were an obligatory addition to the clothes. This is a necklace with different lengths and materials, beaded collars, fibula-syulgamo, badges and bells.|$|E
