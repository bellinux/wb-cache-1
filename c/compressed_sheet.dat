Observations at other wavelengths indicated it is a 'blue continuum'; the flashes occur in pairs {{at the ends}} of flux loops and result from the precipitation of energetic particles.

The dimensions and orientations of the high, angular forms support the hypothesis that they constitute a stress release phenomenon, but the characteristics of the low, thin plated forms suggest that these are erosional features. The structures are eventually destroyed by the movements, as yet largely unexplained, of surrounding rock slabs, and by the gradual abrasion of the edges of the popped up slabs as a result of slight movements caused by daily heating and cooling of the surface sheet...|$|R

This technique of papermaking first came to America in Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1690 when William Rittenhouse established the first paper mill.

40|$|International audienceCompressing thin sheets usually {{yields the}} {{formation}} of singularities which focus curvature and stretching on points or lines. In particular, following the common experience of crumpled paper where a paper sheet is crushed in a paper ball, one might guess that elastic singularities should be the rulebeyond some compression level. In contrast, we show here that, somewhat surprisingly, <b>compressing</b> a <b>sheet</b> between cylinders make singularities spontaneously disappear at large compression. This “stress defocusing” phenomenon is qualitatively explained from scale-invariance and further linked to a criterion based on a balance between stretching and curvature energies on defocused states. This criterion is made quantitative using the scalings relevant to sheet elasticity and compared to experiment. These results are synthesized in a phase diagram completed with plastic transitions and buckling saturation. They provide a renewed vision of elastic singularities as a thermodynamic condensed phase where stress is focused, in competition with a regular diluted phase where stress is defocused. The physical differences between phases is emphasized by determining experimentally the mechanical response when stress is focused or defocused and by recovering the corresponding scaling laws. In this phase diagram, different compression routes may be followed by constraining differently the two principal curvatures of a sheet. As evidenced here, this may provide an efficient way of <b>compressing</b> a <b>sheet</b> that avoids the occurrence of plastic damages by inducing a spontaneous regularization of geometry and stress...|$|R

Rather than branching of wrinkles into generations of ever-smaller sharp folds, we discover a smooth cascade in which the coarse pattern in the bulk is matched to fine structure at the edge by the continuous introduction of discrete, higher wavenumber Fourier modes. The observed multiscale morphology is controlled by a dimensionless parameter that quantifies the relative strength of the edge forces and the rigidity of the bulk pattern.

However, most naturally occurring wrinkles do not satisfy these stipulations. Here we present a scheme that quantitatively explains the wrinkle wavelength beyond such idealized situations. We propose a local law that incorporates both mechanical and geometrical effects on the spatial variation of wrinkle wavelength.

40|$|Based on {{one-dimensional}} differential {{pulse code}} modulation, the coder is multiplication-free, codes each pixel {{as soon as}} it is available, and outputs a fixed number of bits for each pixel. Hence, {{there is no need for}} any buffering of the input image or coder output bitstream. The compression scheme is visually lossless and yields a modest compression ratio of 3 to 4. Because of its simplicity, it is useful when hardware is limited and coding delays cannot be tolerated. There is often a need for some level of data compression in many imaging devices and products, such as scanners and facsimile machines. The reason can be the limited bandwidth of the data bus connecting the scanner to the host computer or the size of the memory available in the product. In addition, strict hardware limitations can preclude the use of compression schemes that are computationally intensive. A desirable feature of a compression scheme is that it be a fixed-rate coder. Specifically, it is desirable for the compression scheme to produce the same number of bits in compressing an 8. 5 -by- 11 -inch sheet of paper regardless of its content. This guarantees that the memory of the device will never overflow and that the data is always transmitted to the host in a fixed time. Many popular compression schemes, such as the lossy JPEG and its newly adopted lossless JPEG-LS algorithms, are variable-rate coders. They have the advantage that they yield higher compression ratios than fixed-rate coders of comparable complexity. However, their variable-rate nature implies that in <b>compressing</b> a <b>sheet</b> of paper, there can be a large variation in the number of bits they generate, depending on the content of the sheet.

40|$|Introduction. Peripheral nerve injury {{leads to}} {{sensation}} and movement loss that is devastating to the patient. In cases of complete nerve transection (neurotmesis), {{it is often}} necessary to use an autologous nerve graft to bridge the injury site. Various {{attempts have been made}} to develop artificial conduits that can replace autologous grafts, but such conduits are usually only effective at bridging short gaps. Here, we have developed and tested a new form of nerve repair conduit, based on 3 D microstructured collagen. Methods. Two forms of conduit were fabricated using different thicknesses of plastic <b>compressed</b> collagen <b>sheet.</b> Low density (LD) guidance-surface conduits were made from spiralling a single standard thickness (100 ìm) collagen sheet. High density (HD) conduits were made from spiralling three thin collagen sheets. The HD conduits have 3 x as many layers (and guidance interface) as the LD conduits. For assessment in vivo, a segment of the rat sciatic nerve was removed and a HD or LD conduit (0. 5 cm in length) was implanted. Separate control experiments involved either direct repair of a sciatic nerve injury by coaptation, or insertion of an autologous graft. At 2 weeks, the implanted conduit and attached proximal and distal nerve portions were removed, fixed in formaldehyde and processed for immunocytochemistry. Results. Transverse and longitudinal sections revealed immunoreactive axons within the conduits, with axons confined to the interfaces between the spiralled collagen sheets. In the same regions an extensive cellular infiltration was present, which included numerous Schwann cells. Conclusions. The results indicate that interfaces between spiral layers of plastic compressed collagen can act as guidance and support structures for Schwann cell migration and axon regeneration. Ongoing studies are analysing the differences between the HD and LD conduits, and the topographical cues that maximise axon growth. ...|$|R

Van der Waals forces are modelled, to a first order approximation, as linear physical springs which connect the nodes between the layers. Critical buckling loads and their associated modes are established and analyzed under different boundary conditions, aspect ratios and compressive loading ratios {{in the case}} of graphene <b>sheets</b> <b>compressed</b> in two perpendicular directions.

To model more accurately the buckling behaviour of multi-layered graphene sheets, a physically more representative and realistic mixed boundary support concept is proposed and applied.

Results are compared with existing known solutions to illustrate the excellent numerical accuracy of the proposed modelling approach.
