Stability of a <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> is also important, so a range of strategies may be used to prepare a reference material that is more stable than the natural material it is prepared from. For example, stabilizing agents such as antioxidants or antimicrobial agents may be added to prevent degradation, liquids containing certified concentrations of trace metals may have pH adjusted to keep metals in solution, and clinical reference materials may be freeze-dried for long term storage if they can be reconstituted successfully.|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{robust and}} {{reliable}} method for mercury determination in seawater matrices {{based on the}} combination of cold vapour generation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (CV-ICP-MS) and its complete in-house validation are described. The method validation covers parameters such as linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), trueness, repeatability, intermediate precision, and robustness. The validation experiments {{have been carried out}} by spiking <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> (BCR- 579), embedding a low mercury content. Correlation factors higher than 0. 9992 were obtained for several calibration curves. Therefore, an excellent linear signal-mass fraction curve was achieved covering the whole working range. The repeatability of the method (RSDrep) was 0. 5 %, whereas the intermediate precision was 2. 3 %. Both of them were obtained at the target mass fraction (20 ng/kg). Moreover, the method was robust concerning the salinity of the seawater sample. The limit of quantification was 2. 7 ng/kg, which corresponds to 13. 5 % of the target mass fraction in the future <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material</b> (20 ng/kg). An uncertainty budget for the measurement of mercury in seawater at target mass fraction, applying the described method, has been established. The relative expanded (k= 2) combined uncertainty is in the order of 7 %. The major uncertainty contribution was related to the trueness assessment. Finally, the validated method has been used for the processing control in the production of a candidate <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material.</b> Moreover, the method will be applied in the homogeneity and stability studies for the certification of a new candidate <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>material.</b> JRC.

40|$|The {{need for}} <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> for quality control of {{analysis}} of foodstuffs has been stressed frequently. This {{has been particularly}} true in the phycotoxins field, {{where there is a}} great shortage of both pure calibration standards and <b>reference</b> <b>materials.</b> Worldwide there are very few independent bodies that produce <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> for phycotoxins, the main producers currently being the National Research Council Canada and the Japanese Food Research Laboratory. Limited availability of contaminated shellfish and algae, as well as the time and knowledge necessary for the production of adequate <b>reference</b> <b>materials,</b> continuously lead to limited editions of <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> and even more limited production of in-house <b>reference</b> <b>materials.</b> The restricted availability of in-house quality control materials promotes the rapid use of the limited <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>materials,</b> which in turn hampers the production of the suite of materials required globally for complete protection of public health. This paper outlines the various options that analysts can pursue in the use of <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> for internal and external quality control, with a view to optimising the efforts of both <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> users and <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> producers. For this purpose, the logical sequence is reviewed from the discovery of a new bioactive compound in shellfish, through initial method development up to regulation for food safety purposes including accepted reference methods. Subsequently, the requirements for and efforts typically spent in the production and characterisation of laboratory <b>reference</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>certified</b> <b>reference</b> <b>materials</b> and other test materials used in inter-laboratory studies or proficiency testing, in the area of marine biotoxins are evaluated.
