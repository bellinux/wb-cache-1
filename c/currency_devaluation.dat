5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment was down to 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. <b>Currency</b> <b>devaluation</b> effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde {{resigned}} {{as vice president}} and was elected Governor of Buenos Aires Province in 1991, and re-elected in 1995. He ran for president in 1999, being defeated by Fernando de la Rúa. De la Rúa resigned during the December 2001 riots, and Congress appointed the governor of San Luis Province Adolfo Rodríguez Saá as president. When Rodríguez Saá also resigned, Congress appointed Duhalde. During Duhalde's term in office, a huge <b>currency</b> <b>devaluation</b> and an increase of the exchange rate led to a gradual recovery. He successfully supported the obscure candidate Néstor Kirchner against Menem, who sought a new presidential term. Duhalde had political disputes with Kirchner in later years, and is largely retired from politics since his defeat in the 2011 presidential elections.|$|E
5|$|Rosas' early {{administration}} was {{preoccupied with the}} severe deficits, large public debts {{and the impact of}} <b>currency</b> <b>devaluation</b> which his government inherited. A great drought that began in December 1828, which would last until April 1832, greatly impacted the economy. The Unitarians were still at large, controlling several provinces that had banded together in the Unitarian League. The capture of José María Paz, the main Unitarian leader, in March 1831 resulted in the end of the Unitarian–Federalist civil war and the collapse of the Unitarian League. Rosas was content, for the moment, to agree to recognize provincial autonomy in the Federal Pact. In an effort to alleviate the government's financial problems, he improved revenue collection while not raising taxes and curtailed expenditure.|$|E

5|$|Sarah’s {{personal}} income was now considerable, {{and she used}} the money to invest in land; she believed this would protect her from <b>currency</b> <b>devaluation.</b> The dowager duchess purchased Wimbledon manor in 1723, and rebuilt the manor house. Her wealth was so considerable that Sarah hoped to marry her granddaughter, Lady Diana Spencer, to Frederick, Prince of Wales, for which she would pay a massive dowry of £100,000. However, Robert Walpole, the First Lord of the Treasury (effectively the same as today's Prime Minister) vetoed the plan. Walpole, although a Whig, had alienated Sarah by supporting peace in Europe; she was also suspicious of his financial probity; and Walpole, in turn, mistrusted Sarah. Despite this, {{good relations with the}} royal family continued, and Sarah was occasionally invited to court by Queen Caroline, who attempted to cultivate her friendship.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} <b>currency</b> <b>devaluation</b> has {{to involve}} a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their export competitiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} large <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations</b> on output, as {{measured}} by the real gross domestic product, continues to be an elusive question in the empirical macroeconomic literature. This paper aims at re-examining and providing new empirical evidence on this relationship, by using a sample covering 109 emerging market and developing economies for the period 1960 - 2006. In contrast with the existing empirical literature, we examine not just the impact of large nominal <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations</b> on output growth, as has been customary in the literature, but also provide estimates of how devaluationary episodes affect output trend. By doing so, we find that the devaluation-output relationship is not robust across regions and time, and that the persistence of devaluations matters. In particular, one-time devaluations induce output trend gains at ten year horizons, while successive devaluationary episodes have no impact whatsoever. A policy implication is that poorly executed devaluations induce no long-run output gains. Finally, the role of the external sector in explaining the heterogeneity of the results is examined. We find that real imports rather than exports do most of the adjustment, thus suggesting a strong expenditure-switching effect and, possibly, the emergence of export financing constraints at the time of devaluations. This last aspect highlights the need to avoid a credit crunch at the time of large <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations</b> as it might wipe out all the beneficial gains that devaluations may have on exports and, ultimately, on output...|$|R

Moreover, government policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based on a tripod which involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer goods, and the third, to the production of durable goods (such as automobiles).

25|$|Controversy about {{currency}} speculators {{and their}} effect on <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations</b> and national economies recurs regularly.

Other economists, such as Joseph Stiglitz, consider this argument to be based more on politics and a free market philosophy than on economics.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{episodes of}} {{financial}} turmoil in Mexico, East Asia, Russia, Brazil, and Argentina are often dubbed financial crises. However, the severe downturns in equity markets, abrupt <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations,</b> and massive capital flight that characterize these events {{can still be}} deemed compatible with efficient and functioning financial markets. Thus, why is a financial crisis a “crisis? ” To answer this question, we conduct an empirical investigation of the efficiency and pricing of the emerging ADR market. More specifically, using a non-parametric technique, we test for regime shifts in two basic structural relationships for ADR returns in 20 emerging countries, identified via arbitrage and capital mobility considerations. We find that “normal ” market conditions were violated in proximity of financial crises: The law of one price often ceased to hold, and domestic sources of risk became more important for many depositary receipts in our sample. We also find that some popular explanations for the occurrence of financial crises in emerging economies, in particular uncertainty among investors, exchange rate volatility, economic integration, and liquidity (but not financial integration, <b>currency</b> <b>devaluations,</b> or capital flight) made their equity markets less efficient as well. Based on this evidence, we can state with greater confidence that those episodes of financial turmoil were indeed “crises. ” JEL classification: F 37; G 1...|$|R

But Warm has claimed that, although Pommer was in charge of production at Decla when Caligari was made, he was not actually a producer on the film itself.

Warm claimed Meinert produced the film [...] "despite the opposition of a part of the management of Decla." [...] Meinert said Pommer had [...] "not sanctioned" [...] the film's abstract visual style. Nevertheless, Pommer claimed to have supervised Caligari, and that the film's Expressionistic style was chosen in part to differentiate it from competing Hollywood films. The predominant attitude at the time was that artistic achievement led to success in exports to foreign film markets. The dominance of Hollywood at the time, coupled with a period of inflation and <b>currency</b> <b>devaluation,</b> forced German film studios to seek projects that could be made inexpensively, with a combination of realistic and artistic elements so the films would be accessible to American audiences, yet also distinctive from Hollywood films.

Sweden's floating rate currency gives it a short-term advantage, structural reforms and constraints account for longer-term prosperity.
