5000|$|Capped herons are {{strongly}} territorial; the same bird {{may be seen}} at a foraging site {{for weeks at a}} time. [...] One <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> was seen chasing another away from a foraging site, until the other bird settled high in a tree.|$|E
50|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> {{normally}} inhabits {{swamps and}} ditches in wet grasslands or rainforests. Sometimes it can venture into deeper ponds and rivers. They prefer to forage {{on the shore}} or in floating vegetation, but have also been observed in trenches of coffee plantations and flooded rice fields.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> {{appears to}} be {{adaptable}} and may be expanding its use of man-made habitats. People have found some individuals in pools along the Transamazonian Highway Brasil. [...] However, given that it is mainly a riverine forest species, the loss of this habitat due to logging and conversion of forest to pasture might pose long-term threats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Capped</b> <b>herons</b> move {{frequently}} between feeding sites, sometimes flying up to 100m. They may be crepuscular, {{but have}} been observed foraging during broad daylight, unlike the night-herons. They usually hunt solitarily.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Capped</b> <b>herons</b> hunt {{mainly for}} fish, but also aquatic insects and larvae, tadpoles, and frogs. Fish taken as prey {{tend to be}} between 1 and 5 cm long. The insects are hunted in the nearby {{vegetation}} along the river or pond, and {{the fish in the}} shallow waters.|$|R
5000|$|Frederick the Great {{created it}} as the 2nd Hussar Regiment (H2), and in 1743 it adopted the {{distinctive}} tiger-skin pelisse for their parade uniforms, with company officers wearing fur <b>caps</b> with <b>heron</b> feathers and field officers using an eagles's wing. During the 1806 campaign of the War of the Fourth Coalition, the regiment was known as von Rudorff Hussar regiment, soon renamed Life Hussar Regiment von Rudorff (No.2) (No.2 Leib-Husaren von Rudorff).|$|R
50|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> (Pilherodius pileatus) is a {{water bird}} endemic to the neotropics, inhabiting the Amazonian {{rainforest}} {{from the center}} of Panama to the south of Brazil. It is the only species of the Pilherodius genus, and one of the least known of the heron family Ardeidae. It is superficially similar to the group of the night herons, but is active during daytime or at twilight.|$|E
50|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> is {{endemic to}} the neotropics and almost {{exclusive}} to the Amazonian rainforest. It {{is present in}} Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. It inhabits low lands up to 900 m above sea level, though in Venezuela it is only found below 500 m, and in Ecuador below 400 m. Although there are no migrations registered to this species and {{it is believed that}} is sedentary, there may be seasonal movements in Darien, Panama.|$|E
50|$|The <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> is {{normally}} solitary, {{although there are}} cases {{where they have been}} found in couples or groups. Birds may be seen with other species such as snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), however other studies have found that they avoid large mixed-species flocks, appearing in fewer than 1% of 145 observed feeding aggregations. Capped herons appear to be submissive to great egrets (Ardea alba), but dominant to snowy egrets (Egretta thula) and striated herons (Butorides striatus).|$|E
500|$|In {{the winter}} of 17411742, and during the short peace {{between the first and}} second Silesian wars, Zieten was engaged in the {{reorganization}} of Prussian cavalry. In 1743 he had his family house, the old [...] "Kaluppe", demolished, and began construction of a new, stately mansion in Wustrau. [...] During the short peace, the hussars, like the rest of the Prussian cavalry, had undergone a complete transformation. [...] To their discipline they had added the dash and skirmishing qualities of the best irregulars, and the Prussian hussars were considered the best of their kind in Europe. [...] In 1743 the Zieten hussars adopted the distinctive tiger-skin pelisse for their parade uniforms, with company officers wearing fur <b>caps</b> with <b>heron</b> feathers and field officers using an eagles' wing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I well believe,' {{the maid}} replied, [...] As her light skiff {{approached}} the side,-- [...] 'I well believe, that ne'er before [...] Your foot has trod Loch Katrine's shore [...] But yet, {{as far as}} yesternight, [...] Old Allan-bane foretold your plight,-- [...] A gray-haired sire, whose eye intent [...] Was on the visioned future bent. [...] He saw your steed, a dappled gray, [...] Lie dead beneath the birchen way; [...] Painted exact your form and mien, [...] Your hunting-suit of Lincoln green, [...] That tasselled horn so gayly gilt, [...] That falchion's crooked blade and hilt, [...] That <b>cap</b> with <b>heron</b> plumage trim, [...] And yon two hounds so dark and grim. [...] He bade that all should ready be [...] To grace a guest of fair degree; [...] But light I held his prophecy, [...] And deemed it was my father's horn [...] Whose echoes o'er the lake were borne.' ...|$|R
6000|$|For Eustacie {{no sooner}} {{gathered}} {{the sense of}} Veronique's words than she darted suddenly forwards, and was {{in a few seconds}} more {{at the foot of the}} stairs. There, indeed, lay a pool of dark gore, and almost in it Berenger's black velvet <b>cap,</b> with the <b>heron</b> plume. Eustacie, with a low cry, snatched it up, continued her headlong course along the corridor, swiftly as a bird, Veronique following, and vainly shrieking to her to stop. Diane, appearing at the other end of the gallery, saw but for a moment the little figure, with the cloak gathered round her neck, and floating behind her, understood Veronique's cry and joined in the chase across hall and gallery, where more stains were to be seen, even down to the marble stairs, every step slippery with blood. Others there were who saw and stood aghast, not understanding the apparition that flitted on so swiftly, never pausing till at the great door at the foot of the stairs she encountered a gigantic Scottish archer, armed to the teeth. She touched his arm, and standing with folder arms, looked up and said, 'Good soldier, kill me! I am a Huguenots!' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{difficult}} {{access and}} rocky cliffs makes this area an ideal location {{for a significant}} population of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) and the common tern (Sterna hirundo), that annually migrate through the Azores to nest, in addition to <b>capped</b> <b>heron</b> (Arrfea cinerea), the sanderling (Calidris alba), the Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and other marine birds such as seagulls. The presence of these birds, protected by Annex I of the Habitats Directive, resulted in the islets' reclassification as a Zona de Protecção Especial (Special Protection Zone), warranting its inclusion within the listing of Important Bird Areas (Zonas Importantes para as Aves) in the Azores (published by BirdLife International).|$|E
