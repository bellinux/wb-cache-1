50|$|There are {{two basic}} types of bangles: a solid {{cylinder}} type; and a split, <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> opening/closing type. The primary distinguishing factor between these is the material {{used to make the}} bangles. This may vary from anything from glass to jade to metal to lac and even rubber or plastic.One factor that adds to the price of the bangles is the artifacts or the work done further on the metal. This includes embroidery or small glass pieces or paintings or even small hangings that are attached to the bangles. The rareness of a color and its unique value also increase the value. Bangles made from lac are one of the oldest types and among the most brittle. Lac is a resinous material, secreted by insects, which is collected and molded in hot kilns to make these bangles. Among the recent kinds are rubber bangles, worn more like a wrist band by youngsters, and plastic ones which add a trendy look.|$|E

40|$|An impacting-based {{piezoelectric}} energy harvester {{was developed}} to address {{the limitations of the}} existing approaches in single-dimensional operation as well as a narrow working bandwidth. In the harvester, a spiral <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> rather than the conventional thin cantilever beam was utilized to extract the external vibration with arbitrary directions, which has the capability to impact the surrounding piezoelectric beams to generate electricity. And the introduced vibro-impacting between the spiral <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> and multi-piezoelectric-beams resulted in not only a three-dimensional response to external vibration, but also a bandwidth-broadening behavior. The experimental results showed that each piezoelectric beam exhibited a maximum bandwidth of 8 Hz and power of 41 μW with acceleration of 1 g (with g= 9. 8 ms− 2) along the z-axis, and corresponding average values of 5 Hz and 45 μW with acceleration of 0. 6 g in the x-y plane...|$|E

For {{mechanical}} reliability design with more random variable parameters, if the parameters are queued with {{their impact on}} the sensitivity of {{mechanical reliability}}, which will be as random variables with relatively high impact, while low-impact will be determined variables, thus would simplify reliability analysis due to the random variable number reduced.

40|$|Summary. Mathematical {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of a solid body upon a buffer positioned on a thin isotropic plate, whose dynamic behaviour is described by the Uflyand-Mindlin wave equations taking the rotary inertia and shear deformations into account, is investigated. Two types of the isotropic plate are considered in the present paper: elastic and viscoelastic. The buffer represents a steel screw <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> and a liquid damper connected with the spring consecutively. Wave equations allow to assume that in a plate the transient wave of transverse shear, because of which there is a deformation of a plate material outside of contact area, is generated with final velocity. As a method of the decision the ray method and method of splicing asymptotic expansion received for small times in a contact area and outside of it are used. ...|$|E
40|$|Creep {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{properties}} of materials, its speed significantly depends on the temperature. Helical cylindrical springs are widely used in the elements of heating systems. This results in necessity of taking into account the effect of temperature on the stress-strain state of the spring. The object of research is a helical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> used at high temperatures. Under this condition the spring state stability should be ensured. The paper studies relaxation of stress state and generation of residual stresses. Calculations are carried out in ABAQUS environment. The purpose of this work is to discuss the law of relaxation and residual stress in the spring. This paper describes the basic creep theories of helical <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> material. The calculation formulas of shear stress relaxation for a fixed compression ratio are obtained. Distribution and character of stress contour lines in the cross section of spring are presented. The stress relaxation – time relationships are discussed. The approximate formula for calculating relaxation shear stresses in the cross section of helical springs is obtained. The paper investigates creep ratio and law of residual stress variation in the cross-section of spring at 650 ℃. Computer simulation in ABAQUS environment was used. Research presents a finite element model of the spring creep in the cross-section. The paper conducts analysis of the stress changes for the creep under constant load. Under constant load stresses are quickly decreased in the around area of cross-section and are increased in the centre, i. e. the maximum and minimum stresses come close with time. Research work shows the possibility for using the approximate formula to calculate the relaxation shear stress in the cross section of spring and can provide a theoretical basis for predicting the service life of spring at high temperatures. In research relaxation processes of stress state are studied. Finite element model is cre ated for analyzing creep and relaxation at high temperature. The change law of residual stress and the length of spring are analyzed with time. </p...|$|E
40|$|The work {{deals with}} the {{application}} of Cad active parametric/variational model in the mechanisms’ modeling in “physically based design” field of research. The term “active Cad model” means a parametric/variational Cad model, geometric one, whose dimensions can {{vary according to the}} Physical laws, that describe their original mechanical behavior. For example, if the specimen is subjected to a traction stress and a moving law is imposed to one of its ends, it must not only be able to stretch indefinitely, but it will have to show the same physical phenomena happening in the real test (elastic extension, strain and plasticization till the break point). Such model can be obtained imposing the characteristics of the material to the model under the feature of CAD’s parameters, that will be used to refresh dimensions and shape of the own model. Modern CAD systems offer to users several programming tools {{that can be used to}} manage the model. In particular it is possible to impose on a model a whole series of geometrical and dimensional constraints, that allow us to manage the shape, modifying the parameters’ values. Such constraints are managed through functions opportunely defined. In the active model, the function depends also on the parameters representing the mechanical characteristic of the simulated materials. The aim of this work is to show the use and the versatility of the active models in different applications. It has been realized an active model of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>spring</b> and it has been applied in two mechanisms, different for typology and for backlash loads.
