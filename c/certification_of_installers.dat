The cooperation has three main elements.

The development project comprises the development of a system design handbook and a combined system bench-marking and test method development. The test method, based on the Combitest method (1), is called Direct Characterization (DC) and the result is supposed to describe the annual system performance. The test method comprises laboratory measurements during 6 days and is based on selected weather data. The present set-up is for a typical single family building with 13 000 kWh space heating load and 3 000 kWh domestic hot water (DHW) load...|$|E
40|$|This BEER {{addresses}} informational {{barriers to}} energy efficiency. It {{is a widely}} acknowledged result that an energy efficiency gap exists implying {{that the level of}} energy efficiency is at an inefficiently low level. Several barriers to energy efficiency create this gap and the presence of asymmetric information is likely to be one such barrier. In this article a theoretical framework is presented addressing the issues of moral hazard and adverse selection related to energy efficiency. Based on the theoretical framework, European policies on energy efficiency are evaluated. The article is divided into two main parts. The first part presents the theory on information asymmetries and its consequences on energy efficiency focusing on the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. Having established a theoretical framework to understand the agency barriers to energy efficiency, the second part evaluates the policies of the European Union on energy efficiency. The BEER finds that problems of moral hazard and adverse selection indeed can help explain the seemingly low levels of energy. In both presented models the cost to the principal from implementing high energy efficiency outcome is increased with the informational asymmetries. The theory reveals two implications to policies on energy efficiency. First, the development of measures to enable contractual parties to base remuneration on energy performance must be enhanced, and second, the information on technologies and the education of consumers and installers on energy efficiency must be increased. This could be complemented with <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>installers</b> and energy efficiency advisors to enable consumers to select good agents. Finally, it is found that the preferred EU policy instrument on energy efficiency, so far, seems to be the use of minimum requirements. Less used in EU legislation is the use of measuring and verification as well as the use of certifications. Therefore, it is concluded that the EU should consider an increased use of these instruments, and in particular focus on a further development of standards on measurability and verification as well as an increased focus on education of consumers as well as installers and advisors on energy efficiency. ...|$|E

The development of a standard for small wind turbine systems and the creation of the Small Wind Certification Council support small wind technology that is reliable and safe.

The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, under the guidance and funding support of the U. S.

However, the small wind community is not supportive <b>of</b> the installer <b>certification.</b> There are currently only nine certified installers in the U. S. pool.

Iako ovisni o potražnji na tržištu i gospodarskoj isplativosti u odnosu na neobnovljive izvore energije, obnovljivi se izvori mogu i moraju početi bolje iskorištavati. Primjeri iz Austrije, Irske i Hrvatske ističu neke od ključnih čimbenika koji su utjecali na razvoj i stanje na tržištu peleta u tim zemljama. Na osnovi pregleda početnog i trenutačnog stanja i analize spome­nutih tržišta, u radu su definirani kritični čimbenici koji utječu na razvoj do­maćeg tržišta peleta. Kritični društveno-gospodarski čimbenici za razvoj nacionalnog tržišta peleta koji proizlaze iz predstavljenih analiza su: financij­ski poticaji, postojanje snažne drvno-prerađivačke industrije, strogi zahtjevi kvalitete na kotlove na pelete, uspostava djelotvornih mehanizama kontrole kvalitete za pelete, namjenski programi edukacije i certificiranje instalatera, povezivanje subvencija sa zahtjevima kvalitete za kotlove i certificiranjem in­stalatera, promotivne kampanje, poticanje nabave sustava grijanja na pelete za javne zgrade i razvoj poticaja za tvrtke koje pružaju energetske usluge. The {{quality of}} raw material, {{as well as}} {{tradition}} in wood pro­cessing and pronounced trends of increased use of wood residues as a renewa­ble and organic material {{play an important role}} in expansion of national pellet industry and market. Although dependent on market demand and eco­nomic feasibility in relation to non-renewable energy sources, renewable ene­rgy sources can and must be exploited in a better and more effective way. The use of wood pellets as fuel for domestic stoves and boilers and for co­firing in thermal power plants has been an amazing success story over the past 20 years. Socio-economic impact studies are commonly used to evaluate the local, regional and/or national implications of implementing particular development decisions. Typically, these impacts are measured in terms of eco­nomic variables, such as employment, revenue and taxes, but a complete ana­lysis must also include social, cultural and environmental issues. In many ways the social implications arising from local pellets production or any bioe­nergy activity represents the less clear and concrete end of impact studies; ne­vertheless they can be broken down into two categories: those relating to an increased standard of living and those that contribute to increased social co­hesion and stability. The primary instruments for the development of renewable energy technolo­gies across the world are international carbon reduction policy drivers. But the development of one type of technology over another on national, regional or local level is often a function of the intricate balance of socio-economic factors in that particular geographical location. The development of wood pellet mar­kets has been very strong in some coutries and almost non-existent in others. Based on these considerations, this paper is primarily focused on investiga­ting the critical socio-economic factors in developing national pellet markets. Examples from Austria, Ireland and Croatia highlight some of the key fac­tors that influenced the development and pellet market situation in these coun­tries. Based on initial review, current situation and analysis of these markets, this paper defines critical factors that influence development of national pellet market. Critical socio-economic factors for the development of national pellet market resulting from presented analysis are the following: • Financial incentives for investing in wood pellet heating rapidly increase uptake even when pellets are competitive with alternative fuels; • The existence of a strong sawmilling industry to provide, at least initially, a low cost and readily available source of raw material; • Stringent quality and sustainability requirements for pellet boilers with re­gard to emissions, efficiency and security – poor products can permanently damage the market, trigger serious environmental concerns and cause major functional problems;• • Establishment of effective quality control mechanisms for wood pellets. Establishment of national or international tracking systems that allow identification of the origin of pellets; • Dedicated educational programs and <b>certification</b> <b>of</b> <b>installers</b> establis­hing pellet heating systems.; • Linking of subsidies with quality requirements for boilers and certification of installers; • Procurement of wood pellet heating in public buildings to provide user confidence and to stimulate the supply chain; • Development of incentives for energy service companies to enter into the biomass heating market. In conclusion, looking at the overall situation regarding pellets production and utilisation a strong growth can be expected with political support at the EU level, playing a major role for the extension of the pellet industry into new member states in particular. The ambitious EU target of achieving 20 % of energy supply from renewable energy by the end of 2020 is impossible without dedicated policies to develop renewable heating. In addition, the on-going oil price rally and carbon dioxide reduction targets also encourage the expansion of the markets for pellets...|$|E
