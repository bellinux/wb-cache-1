Individual species of tardigrades can survive extreme conditions that would be rapidly fatal to nearly all other known life forms, including complete global mass extinction events due to astrophysical events, such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, large asteroid impacts, or passing-by stars. Some tardigrades can withstand temperatures down to 1 K (close to absolute zero) while others can withstand 420 K for several minutes, pressures about six times greater than those found in the deepest ocean trenches, ionizing radiation at doses hundreds of times higher than the lethal dose for a human, and the vacuum of outer space. They can go without food or water for more than 30 years, drying out to the point where they are 3% or less water, only to rehydrate, forage, and reproduce. Tardigrades, living in harsh conditions, undergo an annual process of <b>cyclomorphosis.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although Daphnia cucullata {{is used as}} a {{textbook}} example for <b>cyclomorphosis,</b> distinct helmet development, as shown in the field, has not been demonstrated in the laboratory until now. We show {{for the first time that}} small-scale turbulence is able to induce the maximum response of morphological plasticity in D. cucullata. Helmet elongation reached magnitudes as extreme as observed in the field. Different modes of generating small-scale turbulence caused different levels of helmet formation. Small-scale turbulence alone may not be responsible for <b>cyclomorphosis</b> in nature because field data show that two nearby lakes with similar morphometry differ in <b>cyclomorphosis</b> patterns, while laboratory experiments show that there is no difference in the ability to form helmets in the clones of each lake.

40|$|D ow nloaded from Laboratory <b>cyclomorphosis</b> {{experiments}} with crustacean zooplankton {{often fail to}} produce morphological trait expression as extreme as that observed in field populations. A seven-generation laboratory experiment found that maximum expression of relative head area in a round-helmet morph of Daphnia mendotae was delayed until the third generation of non-lethal, chemical exposure to Leptodora kindtii. By the third generation and after, relative head area remained high and comparable in degree to field specimens. The induction pattern from parents to offspring was statistically positive into the fourth generation. Published studies on kairomone induction of morphological trait expression extending only one generation may fail to measure transgenerational effects, which could account for mismatch between laboratory and field results. In a second laboratory experiment with a pointed-helmet morph of D. mendotae exposed to L. kindtii and Chaoborus punctipennis, we show that induction levels {{are not the same}} for all predators or combinations of predators. The maximum relative head area for pointed morph individuals exposed to both predator cues was still not as extreme in the lab as the field.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that Daphnia hybrids are {{intermediate}} to their parental species for several life history traits, and that they combine advantageous traits of the parental species, thereby decreasing their risk of being preyed upon by planktivorous fish. In this study D. galeata, D. cucullata and their interspecific hybrid are compared with respect to <b>cyclomorphosis</b> and juvenile growth as a potential mechanism to avoid invertebrate predation. Helmets and tail spines are known to reduce predation risk, whereas fast juvenile growth reduces the period that Daphnia are vulnerable to predation. In laboratory cultures, I tested the hypothesis that, with regard to <b>cyclomorphosis,</b> juvenile hybrids are more comparable to the juveniles of D. cucullata, and with respect to growth rate, they are more comparable to D. galeata. The hybrid did not differ significantly from D, galeata in the time needed to reach 0. 9 mm body length. In contrast, the relative spine and helmet length of juvenile hybrids were more comparable with those of D. cucullata, whereas in adult instars these characters were more similar to D. galeata. Thus during the first juvenile instars, the hybrids combine the relative long helmet and spine of D. cucullata, with the faster growth of D. galeata. This combination of characteristics might reduce hybrid vulnerability to invertebrate predation in field situations.

40|$|In {{this review}} we analyze the {{dormancy}} strategies of metazoans inhabiting “hostile to life” habitats, {{which have a}} strong impact on their ecology and in particular on the traits of their life history. Tardigrades are here considered a model animal, being aquatic organisms colonizing terrestrial habitats. Tardigrades evolved a large variety of dormant stages that can be ascribed to diapause (encystment, <b>cyclomorphosis,</b> resting eggs) and cryptobiosis (anhydrobiosis, cryobiosis, anoxibiosis). In tardigrades, diapause and cryptobiosis can occur separately or simultaneously, consequently the adoption of one adaptive strategy is not necessarily {{an alternative to the}} adoption of the other. Encystment and <b>cyclomorphosis</b> are characterized by seasonal cyclic changes in morphology and physiology of the animals. They share several common features and their evolution is strictly linked to the molting process. A bet-hedging strategy with different patterns of egg hatching time has been observed in a tardigrade species. Four categories of eggs have been identified: subitaneous, delayed-hatching, abortive and diapause resting eggs, which needs a stimulus to hatch (rehydration after a period of desiccation). Cryptobiotic tardigrades are able to withstand desiccation (anhydrobiosis) and freezing (cryobiosis) at any stage of their life-cycle. This ability involves a complex array of factors working at molecular (bioprotectans), physiological and structural levels. Animal survival and the accumulation of molecular damage are related to the time spent in the cryptobiotic state, to the abiotic parameters during the cryptobiotic state, and to the conditions during initial and final phases of the process. Cryptobiosis evolved independently at least two times in tardigrades, in eutardigrades and in echiniscoids. Within each evolutionary line, the absence of cryptobiotic abilities is more related to selective pressures to local habitat adaptation than to phylogenetic relationships. The selective advantages of cryptobiosis (e. g. persistency in “hostile to life” habitats, reduction of competitors, parasites and predators, escaping in time from stressful conditions) could explain the high tardigrade species diversity and number of specimens found in habitats that dry out compared to freshwater habitats...|$|E
40|$|Halobiotus crispae is {{a marine}} eutardigrade {{belonging}} to Hypsibiidae. A characteristic {{of this species}} is the appearance of seasonal cyclic changes in morphology and physiology, i. e. <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> Halobiotus crispae was originally described from Nipisat Bay, Disko Island, Greenland. The present study investigates the distribution of this species and describes the seasonal appearance of cyclomorphic stages at the southernmost locality, Vellerup Vig in the Isefjord, Denmark. Our sampling data indicate that the distribution of H. crispae is restricted to the Northern Hemisphere where we now have found this species at seven localities. At Vellerup Vig data from sampling cover all seasons {{of the year and}} all of the originally described cyclomorphic stages have been found at this locality. However, when comparing the lifecycles of H. crispae at Nipisat Bay and Vellerup Vig, profound differences are found in the time of year, as well as the period in which these stages appear. Noticeably, at Nipisat Bay the pseudosimplex 1 stage is a hibernating stage occurring during the long Arctic winter. In contrast, at Vellerup Vig, this stage appears during the summer. Thus, while pseudosimplex 1 seems to be an adaptation to withstand low temperatures in Greenland, this stage possibly enables the animal to tolerate periods of oxygen depletion and heat stress during the Danish summer. Moreover, a characteristic of the Danish population is the presence of a prolonged pseudosimplex 2 stage. The environmental or endogenous signals underlying the transition between different stages remain unknown. In addition, we report the genetic diversity and phylogenetic position of H. crispae based on the first molecular data obtained from this species. Our molecular data confirm that H. crispae from Greenland and Denmark are in fact the same species. Thus, the observed life cycle changes occur within a species and do not represent life cycle variation between different species. In addition, our molecular data suggest that Halobiotus has evolved within Isohypsibius. Further investigations on the lifecycle of members of the Halobiotus genus as well as other members of the Hypsibiidae is needed in order to establish whether <b>cyclomorphosis</b> is i) a general theme among members of Hypsibiidae or ii) an autapomorphy for Halobiotus...|$|E
40|$|This note {{reports a}} {{comparison}} between Daphnia phenology in the weather anomalous 2014 and a previous three years period (2011 - 2013), in a shallow water body of Northern Italy (Bodrio del pastore III) where we recorded D. pulex. In 2011 - 2013, Daphnia population showed 1 - 2 density peaks from mid spring to early summer, it declined in July-August and did not recover, from ephippia, until the following spring. The seasonal dynamics was probably related to the species thermal tolerance. Males and ephippial females appeared {{at the beginning of}} growth season according to a typical feature of Daphnia populations from temporary habitats. The presence of the Chaoborus larvae resulted in juvenile adaptive predator-avoidance <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> In 2014, in the study area, mean winter air temperature was much warmer than average recorded {{during the past three years}} while it was much colder than average in July and August. This reflected the relatively rainy and cloudy summer months: the winter and summer precipitations total was above the previous three years average. In 2014, Daphnia was found all over the year and showed a maximum peak of density in November. The general increase of Daphnia was related to a shift in D. pulex population phenology, seasonal growth started earlier and lasted longer, and to the occurrence of D. longispina. Both species were identified by genetic markers and phylogenetic analyses of ND 5 sequences placed isolates from the Bodrio del pastore III into the European D. pulex group. Both populations reproduced by cyclical parthenogenesis and showed <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> However, D. pulex produced more males and ephippial females than D. longispina. Their seasonal dynamics were quite different: D. longispina dominated in late summer while D. pulex showed the highest density in November. The presence of D. pulex in the Bodrio is important in the framework of conservation ecology especially because we have showed that it is native European strain instead of the invasive North American clone that replaced native D. pulex throughout Africa and was already recorded in Italy. We provide some indications and discuss how Daphnia phenology of shallow lakes of temperate areas may be susceptible to inter-annual variability in weather conditions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that <b>cyclomorphosis</b> in Daphnia galeata mendotae is equated with seasonal changes in the genetic structure of populations. Multilocus electrophoretic genotyping of individual D. g. mendotae was used to identify related parthenogenetic lines. Between different clones and genotypes, there was phenotypic variability in both laboratory and field populations. Within clones and within genotypes, {{and in the absence}} of intense invertebrate predation, phenotypic expression was conservative. These pat-terns suggested that there was a correlation between phenotypic and genetic change. However, in the field, only two of three populations showed seasonal changes in genotypic frequency, whereas all three showed seasonal changes in phenotype. Furthermore, the patterns of phenotypic change seen in the field populations were different and appeared to be correlated with changes in physical conditions and predation pressure. We conclude that helmet morphology within genotypes is plastic enough to account for much of the seasonal variability observed in three populations of D. g. mendotae and that genotypic frequency changes are not necessary to explain seasonal changes in D. g. mendotae phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Four {{species of}} cyclomorphic Daphnia (D. pulex, D. galeata mendotae, D. retrocurva, D. lumholtzi) {{were exposed to}} the {{insecticide}} carbaryl for a short term (8 - 14 h) from the final embryonic stage to the first instar. Daphnia pulex formed neckteeth, and the remaining three Daphnia species developed high helmets and long tailspines. The results suggest that the development of such protuberant structures (anti-predator morphologies) in response to the insecticide exposure is a general phenomenon in Daphnia, and that stimuli on the nervous system of Daphnia may induce the morphological changes, which originally evolved as a response to predator kairomone. Two clones of D. pulex were examined and a clone which was more sensitive to the predator Chaobonts kairomone than another developed more marked neckteeth in response to carbaryl, suggesting that the sensitivity in morphological response to the insecticide {{may be related to the}} sensitivity to the kairomone. <b>Cyclomorphosis</b> (seasonal morphological change in successive generations) of plankton organisms occurs in many species of the cladoceran Daphnia, which develop high helmets and elongate carapace spines in late spring and summer.

40|$|Two {{varieties}} of Daphnia carinata showed a disjunct distribution in four ponds in South India: an exuberant variety, cephalata, was generally restricted to those ponds {{that did not}} contain a more usual morph, forma typica, and vice versa. The ponds studied were quite similar except {{for the presence of}} large Anisops spp. in the two ponds containing cephalata and their absence or low abundance in those containing forma typica. Experiments showed that the exuberant cephaluta form was frequently able to evade capture and thus was preyed upon at a much lower rate than forma typica. In the absence of such predation, however, forma typicu had the competitive advantage: its survivorship and rate of increase were higher and its feeding rate more rapid. Thus the exuberant morphology of D. carinatu var. cephalutu appears to be an adaptation that reduces invertebrate predation. <b>Cyclomorphosis</b> and persistent di-morphisms in zooplankton have long in-terested limnologists. For a number of years it was thought that the selective force behind cyclic variability of body form of some temperate zooplankton spe-cies was related to an increase in buoy-ancy of such exuberant morphs (Fritz 1935; Hutchinson 1967).

40|$|Abstract. The {{variations}} in the body length, swimming legs and some setae of the freshwater cyclopid Acanthocyclops robustus were analysed during an annual cycle in the field, and in laboratory exper-iments at different culture temperatures. In Lake Cr£teil. a shallow temperate sand-pit lake, there is a seasonal morphological variation of the setae: the plumose forms were restricted to the wanner season and the spinose ones to colder periods. Contrary to other years, the specific 'spine formula ' of the swimming legs (3 - 4 - 4 - 4) did not vary during the reference year. In laboratory experiments, both sex and post-embryonic developmental temperatures {{had an effect on}} the length of adults. A significant par-ental effect on body length was detected. Pairs with anomalous spine formulae produced offspring either with anomalous spine formulae or typical 3 - 4 - 4 - 4 formulae. No significant effects of parental culture temperatures, offspring culture temperatures and sex on the total number of spines were found. Modification of plumose into spinose setae did not occur, whatever the offspring developmental tem-peratures.

40|$|Phenotypically plastic {{defenses}} are strategies to reduce predation risk in variable environments. Predator-induced formations of protective devices in cladocerans are prominent examples of phenotypically plastic defenses. To understand the adaptive {{value of a}} defense, {{it is better to}} investigate its effects in a multipredator context, instead of merely concentrating on a two-species interaction. Small cladocerans such as Daphnia cucullata are prey items for many aquatic invertebrate predators and thus comprise a useful model system to investigate defenses and their effects. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the helmets of Daphnia cucullata are inducible with chemical cues from different kinds of predators and that they act as a generalized defense offering protection against several predators, each using a different hunting strategy. Results from our induction experiment show that chemical cues released from Chaoborus flavicans, Leptodora kindtii, and Cyclops sp. induce significantly longer helmets and tail spines and thus act as proximate factors for <b>cyclomorphosis</b> in Daphnia cucullata. Our predation experiments revealed that the induced morphological changes offered protection against each of the predators tested. Interestingly, the protective mechanisms and the prey size classes which were protected differed between predator systems. Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia cucullata evolved as a “diffuse” coevolution against different invertebrate predators which selectively feed on small prey items. The additive benefits may increase the adaptive value and thus facilitate the evolution and persistence of this generalized defense...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, Daphnia {{has become a}} model {{organism}} in aquatic ecology. I review the changing concepts and paradigms in plankton ecology {{as reflected in the}} work on Daphnia. The availability of radiotracers favoured a new physiological approach that resulted in better energetic models and more reliable estimates of filtering rates. This led to deeper insights into the role of herbivore grazing on phytoplankton and microbial communities, and nutrient recycling. It provided a conceptual basis for general hypotheses on predictable seasonal successions (e. g. the PEG model). On the other hand, increasing knowledge about selective predation on zooplankton triggered population dynamic models and gave explanations for changing community structures. The Size-Efficiency-Hypothesis generated a framework for studies on trade-offs between competitive ability and susceptibility to predation. Daphnia was now in the centre of interaction-based concepts, being predator and prey at the same time. It was the backbone of practical applications of the theory in food-web manipulations. When ultimate factors came into the focus, Daphnia {{played an important role in}} explaining striking phenomena like diel vertical migration and <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> Its central position in food-webs, the unique propagation mode, easy cultivation and accessibility by molecular genetic methods made it a favourite object for studies in evolutionary ecology, concerning local adaptation, evolution of defences and life histories, induced phenotypic change, and genetic diversity.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{occurrence}} of Daphnia pulex in a small fishless water body of Northern Italy (Bodrio del pastore III) and describes its population dynamics. Bodrio is a typical water body originated by erosion from the old Po river-bed surface. During a three year study (2011 - 2013), D. pulex population showed an increase in density from spring to early summer, it declined in July-August and did not recover, presumably from ephippia, until the following spring. The seasonal dynamics {{was related to the}} species thermal tolerance and to invertebrate predation by Chaoborus that resulted in juvenile high mortality and in adaptive predator-avoidance <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> Seasonal variation was observed in the frequency of individuals, most juveniles, showing neckteeth. D. pulex population reproduces by cyclical parthenogenesis and showed a very early investment in sexual reproduction, independent of population density. Males and ephippial females appeared at the beginning of growth season before the density peak according to a typical feature of Daphnia populations from temporary habitats. This suggests a lower influence of the environmental factors on sex determination compared to populations inhabiting more permanent habitats. Lineages that produce males and ephippial females early in the season had lower growth rate than parthenogenetic ones but may preserve from selection pressure by predators a significant percentage of genetic variation linked to sex allocation so that evolution proceeds toward earlier and increased sexual reproduction. Our results suggest further investigation to verify whether the current population is the last remnant of a once much larger metapopulation eventually reduced by anthropogenic disturbances or if it represents the invasion of North American strains. </p...|$|E
40|$|The partly varved and well-dated {{sediment}} {{record of}} Lake Tiefer See (NE Germany) allowed the high resolution paleolimnological {{reconstruction of the}} lake evolution during the whole Holocene. This paper presents results of subfossil Cladocera analysis. During the Holocene, the fauna of subfossil cladoceran was represented by 36 species belonging to 6 families. Cladocera were dominated by typical open-water species, belonging especially of the Bosminidae family. The sediment record of Lake Tiefer See exhibited distinct decadal- to centennial-scale alternations of well- and non-varved intervals, which were related {{to changes in the}} thermal circulation of the lake water column. In general, well varved sediments were deposited during periods of reduced lake circulation, and were characterised by maximum abundance of Cladocera, whereas non-varved sedimentation phases occurred during periods of increased lake circulation and showed a lower number of Cladocera specimens. The most suitable conditions for the development of cladoceran fauna occurred during the early Holocene and from ~ 2055 – 725 yr cal BP. On the basis of the increasing number of species associated with high lake productivity, eight stages of increasing trophy were inferred. The first two were attributed to climate warming, while the next six to human impact. Higher human driven trophic conditions of Lake Tiefer See occurred in the periods 5750 - 5500 and 4500 - 4100 yr cal BP, and four times from 1000 to 50 yr cal BP.

40|$|Comparatively {{little work}} has been done on the ecology of Cladocera except in regard to planktonic varieties, and special {{subjects}} such as <b>cyclomorphosis.</b> This thesis is an attempt to ascertain the factors governing the occurence and distribution of Cladocera, by means of a special, mainly laboratory, study of certain factors combined with a general field-survey. Temperature, the factors influencing parthenogenetic reproduct ion. and food-supply were specially studiedIt was not possible, except for a few varietie, to correlate resistance to high temperatures with occurence and distribution. Resistance to low temperatures was correlated with seasonal but not with spatial occurence. The effects of temperature, crowding, amount of food, and light on parthenogenetic reproduction were investigated. Increased temperatures increase frequency of moulting, and shorten the duration of the pre-adult phase. Egg-number {{may or may not be}} reduced, the behaviour being probably associated with the seasonal occurenece of the species. The other factors all have marked effects on egg-number, varying some-what as between species. They have no effect on frequency of moulting or logevity. Food and temperature effects show no inter-action. A general survey was made of the distribution of Cladocera in lakes and pools in Scotland, England, and Denmark. Notes were made on individual species. The opportunity was taken of clearing up some taxonomic difficulties. Within habitats Cladocera often show marked localization. Factors responsible for this include food-supply; presence and nature ofvegetaion; water-movement; and type of bottom. It is more difficult to correlate Cladoceran distribution with the general nature of the habitat. Most,but not all, Cladocera appear to be indifferent to trophicity and pH. Larger habitats have more varied faunas, and also somewhat acid habitats. General stability of the habitat is probably important. Parasites are often fatal but are tooo rare to be important. Epibiotes are usually harmless. Many species prey on Cladocera, but only fish and tadpoles certainly control their numbers. Competition is probably very important in determining distribution, but related species often occur together. Apaper on Daphnia systematics (in Ms. form) is included with this thesis. <p...|$|E
