She was holding on to the door handle, still watching me, her skirts blowing about her in strange confusion. For a moment I had half a mind to turn back. The dead loneliness before me seemed imbued with fresh horrors--the loneliness, my fireless grate and empty larder. Moyat was at least hospitable. There would be a big fire, plenty to eat and drink. Then I remembered the man's coarse hints, his unveiled references to his daughters and his wish to see them settled in life, his superabundance of whisky and his only half-veiled tone of patronage. The man was within his rights. He was the rich man of the neighbourhood, <b>corn</b> <b>dealer,</b> farmer, and horse breeder. I was an unknown and practically destitute stranger, come from Heaven knew where, and staying on--because it took a little less to keep body and soul together here than in the town. But my nerves were all raw that night, and the thought of John Moyat with his hearty voice and slap on the shoulder was unbearable. I set my face homewards.|$|E

40|$|Western bean cutworm (WBC) is a corn pest {{that has}} been {{expanding}} it’s range across Iowa and into more eastern states. Beginning in 2003, Iowa State University set up a network of pheromone traps to monitor WBC range expansion and to provide moth emergence data to enhance scouting efforts. Pheromone trap cooperators included local seed <b>corn</b> <b>dealers,</b> private <b>corn</b> and soybean agronomists and others interested in pest management issues...|$|R
50|$|The Beaufort Arms {{was named}} after the Dukes of Beaufort, whose lands these once were. According to Charles Heath in 1804, this inn {{consisted}} originally of two small tenements, one a butcher's {{and the other a}} <b>corn</b> <b>dealer's,</b> and the inn yard was a fives court managed by a Mr Pye. In the early 18th century after Pye's death Mr John Tibbs became the owner and developed the inn with the Beaufort portcullis as the sign. The Beaufort Arms became important after the building of the Shire Hall in 1724. Through the influence of the Duke of Beaufort it acquired, in 1760, a part of that new building which encroached on the inn's fives court. The balcony below, facing Agincourt Square, is reputed to have been used by the Dukes of Beaufort for making speeches during elections.|$|R
5000|$|Research by Kevin Binfield {{and others}} asserts that since {{organized}} action by stockingers had occurred {{at various times}} since 1675, {{the movements of the}} early 19th century must be viewed {{in the context of the}} hardships suffered by the working class during the Napoleonic Wars, rather than as an absolute aversion to machinery. Irregular rises in food prices provoked the Keelmen working in the port of Tyne to riot in 1710 and tin miners to steal from granaries at Falmouth in 1727. There was a rebellion in Northumberland and Durham in 1740, and the assault of Quaker <b>corn</b> <b>dealers</b> in 1756. Skilled artisans in the cloth, building, shipbuilding, printing and cutlery trades organized friendly societies to peacefully insure themselves against unemployment, sickness, and in some cases against intrusion of [...] "foreign" [...] labour into their trades, as was common among guilds.|$|R

5000|$|In 1803 The Times {{argued against}} war with Spain: [...] "She is our best customer; {{and by the}} gentle and peaceable stream of commerce, the treasures {{of the new world}} flow with greater {{certainty}} into English reservoirs, than it could do by the most successful warfare. They come in this way to support our manufactures, to encourage industry, to feed our poor, to pay taxes, to reward ingenuity, to diffuse riches among all classes of people. But for the full understanding of this beneficial circulation of wealth, we must refer to Dr. Adam Smith's incomparable Treatise on the Wealth of Nations". In 1810 a correspondent writing under the pseudonym of Publicola included at the head of his letter Smith's line that [...] "Exclusive Companies are nuisances in every respect" [...] and called him [...] "that learned writer". In 1821 The Times quoted Smith's opinion that the interests of <b>corn</b> <b>dealers</b> and the people were the same.|$|R

When the town was connected to train tracks in 1896 via the Hagenow Land-Bad Oldesloe railway, it grew larger and became home to various factories (for barrels, potatoe fabrication, a lime kiln), and construction entrepreneurs, <b>corn</b> and cattle <b>dealers</b> settled. 1938, when Zarrentin already grew to a population of 2000, it received town privileges. Since then, it also became popular with tourists for the surrounding nature and the renowned hospitality.|$|R

50|$|Gittins {{was born}} in Leicester in 1845, the {{daughter}} of a <b>corn</b> and flour <b>dealer,</b> Edward Gittins, and the third of five children. She was educated by Miss Drayton, many of whose pupils became prominent women of Leicester. She was {{an active member of the}} Unitarian Great Meeting Chapel, teaching in the Sunday School for over forty years. A watercolour artist and drawing teacher, she exhibited several landscape paintings at the Royal Academy and the New Walk Museum and Art Gallery, Leicester, holds several of her watercolours. Gittins helped to found a local branch of the Kyrle Society, a national organisation established in 1877 with the aim of bringing art, books and open spaces to the working class poor, under the slogan 'Bring beauty home to the people'. Strongly committed to women's suffrage, in 1886 she was a founding member of the Leicester Women’s Liberal Association. She was on the committee of the Leicester Women's Suffrage Society, formed in 1887, a member of the Leicester branch of National Union of Women Workers and of Leicester Secular Society.|$|R
50|$|In 1746, {{when he was}} aged 14, Thomas's father {{arranged}} {{for him to be}} apprenticed to Alexander Somerville, a wine merchant in Leith. When Thomas completed his apprenticeship he decided that the corn trade offered better prospects than did wine, and he established himself in Leith as a provision merchant and <b>corn</b> <b>dealer,</b> eventually trading at both wholesale and retail.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about his childhood; {{most of it is}} based on his ghost-written {{autobiography}} and a few documents in French archives. His father was well educated and, for those days, very wealthy, since he was also a <b>corn</b> <b>dealer.</b> Vidocq had six siblings: two older brothers (one of whom had died before he was born), two younger brothers and two younger sisters.|$|E
5000|$|Whiteley {{was born}} in Yorkshire in the small village of Purston, {{situated}} between Wakefield and Pontefract. His father was a prosperous <b>corn</b> <b>dealer.</b> William along with his three brothers enjoyed a healthy open-air life. He left school {{at the age of}} 14, and started work at his uncle's farm. He {{would have liked to have}} been a veterinary surgeon or perhaps a jockey but his parents had other ideas. In 1848 they started him on a seven-year apprenticeship with Harnew & Glover, the largest drapers in Wakefield. Whiteley took his new job seriously and received a 'severe drilling in the arts and mysteries of the trade.' ...|$|E
50|$|Antonio Ascari {{was born}} near Mantua, {{but in the}} Veneto region of Italy, {{as the son of}} a <b>corn</b> <b>dealer.</b> He began racing cars at the top levels in Italy in 1919, using a {{modified}} 1914 Fiat. Along with Enzo Ferrari, he raced in the first Targa Florio held after the end of World War I in 1919, but did not finish after crashing into a deep ravine. His bad luck there continued in 1920 and 1921, but in 1922 he finished a strong fourth. Driving an Alfa Romeo for Vittorio Jano in April 1923, he narrowly lost the Targa Florio, finishing second to his Alfa Romeo teammate, Ugo Sivocci. However, the following month at the Cremona Circuit he drove to his first major Grand Prix victory. In 1924, he was again the winner at Cremona in the first race of the P2, then went on to Monza where he won the Italian Grand Prix.|$|E
40|$|The Susan S. and Edward J. Cutler House is {{significant}} {{at the local level}} under Criteria A, B, and C in the areas of community planning and development and architecture. The property reflects the broad patterns of history of Providence, Rhode Island {{in the late nineteenth century}} as it became a national leader in industrial production, saw its population rapidly multiply and a subsequent boom in new housing construction, facilitated in part by improvements in transportation and an upwardly mobile middle class. The symbiotic relation of these trends laid the groundwork for Edward J. Cutler, a broom manufacturer, to build an early house in what was then an up-and coming Victorian streetcar suburb located on the same streetcar route as his factory on Pawtucket Avenue. Built in 1880, the Cutler House is an unusually well-preserved representation of the first phase of this development from rural countryside to streetcar suburb on the outskirts of the city, and then to dense urban neighborhood near the city core. The Cutler House is also significant at the local level under Criterion B for its association with industrialist Edward J. Cutler, who ran one of the only broom manufacturing outfits in Rhode Island and was the leading broom <b>corn</b> <b>dealer</b> in the state in the late nineteenth century, along with his other ties to Rhode Island industry. Finally, the Cutler house is also significant at the local level under Criterion C in the area of architecture as an artifact of a middle class Picturesque cottage that embodies the distinctive characteristics of the Stick style, through a vernacular interpretation, with great architectural integrity...|$|E
