500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{woman in}} the secret of this conspiracy, though how she {{obtained}} a knowledge of it no one seemed to know. Her name was Epicharis. While the execution of the plans of the confederates was delayed, Epicharis came to the principal conspirators privately, first to one and then to another, and urged them to action. None {{of the members of the}} plot would admit that they had given her any information on the subject, and how she obtained her information no one <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> a woman of bad character, and as such women often are, she was violent and implacable in her hatred. She hated Nero, and was so impatient at the delay of the conspirators that she made repeated and earnest efforts to urge them on.|$|E
60|$|As for Rosek, {{she treated}} {{him as if}} that little scene had never taken place. The idea of {{appealing}} to her husband in a difficulty was gone for ever since the night he came home drunk. And she did not dare to tell her father. He would--what would he not do? But she was always on her guard, knowing that Rosek would not forgive her for that dart of ridicule. His insinuations about Daphne Wing she put out of mind, as she never could have if she had loved Fiorsen. She set up for herself the idol of pride, and became its faithful worshipper. Only Winton, and perhaps Betty, <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not happy. Fiorsen's debts and irresponsibility about money did not worry her much, for she paid everything in the house--rent, wages, food, and her own dress--and had so far made ends meet; {{and what he did}} outside the house she could not help.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} the woman is insane or ignorant. I wish I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to make me}} angry for the benefit of those horrid unshaven men, or merely for her private edification." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> looking full {{into his}} eyes and yet he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> angry with him or only amused.|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't {{thought it}} worth while {{to ask for}} a dance yet," [...] she remarked, and Foster <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{offended}} or not.|$|R
6000|$|But soon I {{found that}} there was good in her too. She used {{sometimes}} to give me pennies, so that once I had four in my pocket all at the same time; but the best part of her was the stories that she <b>could</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> sore frightened of frogs, so I would bring one to her, and tell her that I would put it down her neck unless she told a story. That always helped her to begin; but when once she was started it was wonderful how she would carry on. And the things that had happened to her, they were enough to take your breath away. There was a Barbary rover that had been at Eyemouth, and he was coming back in five years in a ship full of gold to make her his wife; {{and then there was a}} wandering knight who had been there also, and he had given her a ring which he said he would redeem when the time came. She showed me the ring, which was very like the ones upon my bed curtain; but she said that this one was virgin gold. I asked her what the knight would do if he met the Barbary rover, and she told me that he would sweep his head from his shoulders. [...] What they could all see in her was more than I could think. And then she told me that she had been followed on her way to West Inch by a disguised prince. I asked her how she knew it was a prince, and she said by his disguise. Another day she said that her father was preparing a riddle, and that when it was ready it would be put in the papers, and anyone who guessed it would have half his fortune and his daughter. I said that I was good at riddles, and that she must send it to me when it was ready. She said it would be in the Berwick Gazette, and wanted to know what I would do with her when I won her. I said I would sell her by public roup for what she would fetch; but she would tell no more stories that evening, for she was very techy about some things.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Tiddler's Ground is {{also used}} in modern English as a {{euphemism}} for having an uncertain status, for example, [...] "I asked her why her performance review was late and I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on Tom Tiddler's Ground".|$|E
5000|$|Doubleday {{acquired}} rights to publish Pelosi's memoirs in July 2007, led by Doubleday president Stephen Rubin. Pelosi {{was represented by}} the William Morris Agency, including chairman Norman Brokaw, who said, [...] "When I first met Nancy Pelosi twenty years ago, I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> destined to make history. I told her to start taking notes." [...] Publishers Weekly described the book as [...] "a gentle account from a tough politician." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> appeased or not, and he rather feared not. [...] "You don't ask why. And I {{asked you}} why at once." ...|$|R
60|$|She greeted Aaron {{with some}} of the childish shyness. He <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> glad he had come, and that she had {{wondered}} at his not coming sooner. She introduced him to her visitors: two young ladies and one old lady and one elderly Italian count. The conversation was mostly in French or Italian, so Aaron was rather out of it.|$|R
60|$|Helena {{belonged to}} the unclassed. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> not ladylike, nor smart, nor assertive. One <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>were</b> of {{independent}} means or a worker. One thing was obvious about her: <b>she</b> <b>was</b> evidently educated.|$|R
50|$|Harry {{decides to}} study for the {{ministry}} after graduation. He also {{falls in love with}} Esther while at Cloudland. Horace simply wants to live his life with Tina, whom he has loved since they first met. Shortly before their graduation from the academy, Ellery Davenport returns from England with important news for Harry. He found Sir Harry Percival and was able to get the marriage certificate from him because young Harry was now his only heir. During Ellery's visit, Tina is strangely shy and Horace <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> smitten with him.|$|E

5000|$|On 17 October 1998 Harris went to {{the house}} of 33-year-old Yvonne Ford, who had a mild {{intellectual}} handicap. Harris later said he [...] "just went there. I was probably out on one of me walks and I probably had a few drinks, in the area so I just went {{went to the}} house ended up there". Ford let him in, and after some time he made a sexual advance towards her. He later said [...] "We struck up a bit of a friendship, as, just, just driving her around, and I obviously <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> lonely, she was slightly handicapped. I didn't come, I didn't come around here for sex, I didn't come around here for anything, I just came around to say Hello, I live nearby, but then these thoughts started entering my head that I wanted to kill her." [...] As they sat in the bath together, Harris strangled her and held her under the water for 3 or 4 minutes. [...] "It could have been her, it could've been anybody. She was just unlucky...I just thought she would be easy, to target, she wouldn't put up a fight or ... she would be relatively easy to kill". Asked how he felt after the murder he said [...] "powerful, angry, just anger, pure anger. Not, not that she, there was no sex or anything, I was angry at the world. This is why this whole thing has happened, has started, and it was just my total anger building up from, I don't know, from the day I was adopted, it's just all built and built and, and something has set, set me off and I, I killed her".|$|E
60|$|For {{the life}} of him he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pleased or disappointed. She had turned her {{shoulder}} to him. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> looking steadily out of the window, {{and he could not}} see her face.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{also often}} asked {{to work as}} a compere. Terry Dobson, a member of the pop band Black Lace {{recalled}} a time in 1977 in his book: [...] "Lynne Perrie {{was in and out of}} her dressing room, a change of costume between every act, not that much time, two songs, some six or so minutes and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> on the stage again, bring off the act, then introducing the next... brilliant, and very professional; you <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> doing this sort of thing for years." ...|$|R
60|$|Her first {{attempts}} at usefulness {{were in an}} endeavour {{to find out who}} were the parents, but Harriet <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> ready to <b>tell</b> every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration. <b>She</b> had <b>been</b> satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.|$|R
40|$|I met Margaret Berger in 1974, {{when she}} had just joined the Brooklyn Law School faculty, {{one of the first}} three young women to do so. At that time, I had no {{affiliation}} with the law school, but was lucky enough to meet Margaret, because I was just starting out as a clerk for Judge Jack B. Weinstein, and Margaret was a distin-guished alumnus of his chambers. Margaret understood that I was new to clerking and to Brooklyn, and she reached out to me and helped me with the transition from student to clerk. Immediately, I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> special. For one thing, she was warm and friendly and supportive. For another, she was “hooked ” on teach-ing and legal scholarship. Margaret wanted only the best for Brooklyn Law School and she expected the best from herself. She talked about her goal of producing superior scholarship and her ideas for strengthening the School. Although I was barely out of law school, Margaret convinced me to think about becoming a professor at Brooklyn. I think the rest of the faculty were somewhat less sanguine about my candi-dacy at the time⎯after all, I hadn’t even taken the bar exam and was not quite sure what lay in my future. But, years later, Marga-ret, still my friend, urged me once again to consider joining the faculty. I have now had the pleasure of being Margaret’s colleague for twenty-two years. My initial assessment of her talents was cor-rect. She is first-rate. Margaret has been a leader at the law schoo...|$|E
6000|$|... "George, I wish to God I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>she</b> <b>is</b> dead," [...] {{answered}} Jim, nervously {{pacing the}} room. [...] "But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> well when I last saw her. She endured the hard journey better than either Nell or I. Girty did not carry {{her into the}} encampment, as Silvertip did Joe and me, but the renegade left us {{on the outskirts of}} the Delaware town. There was a rocky ravine with dense undergrowth where he disappeared with his captive. I suppose he has his den somewhere in that ravine." ...|$|R
60|$|Whether she {{had fallen}} in or been pushed in no one <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> but unquestionably <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in, having gone in, too, head-foremost, so that, {{although}} she had struggled right-end up she reappeared coated with mud to an extent that might have suggested a sculptor's clay model--had sculptors been known to the Norsemen of those days.|$|R
60|$|Carrie stood still, {{thankful that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in the shadow, though {{for the moment}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pleased or not. For one thing, the man's {{assurance}} that she would feel so somewhat jarred upon her, and the advantage was with him, for he had come there knowing that he would see her, and she had not expected him.|$|R
60|$|One {{thing which}} used to be a {{pleasure}} to Edna she refrained from altogether, and that was the making of plans. She had put her past life entirely behind her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> beginning a new existence--what sort of an existence <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> now living with the determinate purpose of getting the greatest good out of her life, whatever it might be.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, as {{she spoke}} she fell down insensible, and when she {{recovered}} {{she found herself in}} her own little bed at home; how she got there <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dressed in the most beautiful lace and ribbons, and on her finger was a little ring, made of a single red hair, which fitted so tightly that, try as she might, she could not get it off.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was written}} on pink paper, edged with blue, as if nothing could be too good for Jessie; and it said no words <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> how glad <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and what a comfort {{it was to have}} this real work to do. [...] "It is really like a ray of hope in the darkness," [...] said poor Bessie, in her little thin weak writing, with a very hard steel pen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But Lord bless me,' pursues Mr Toots, 'she was as entirely {{conscious}} {{of the state of}} my feelings as I was myself. There was nothing I <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> the only person who could have stood between me and the silent Tomb, and she did it, in a manner to command my everlasting admiration. She knows that there's nobody in the world I look up to, as I do to Miss Dombey. Knows that there's nothing on earth I wouldn't do for Miss Dombey. She knows that I consider Miss Dombey the most beautiful, the most amiable, the most angelic of her sex. What is her observation upon that? The perfection of sense. [...] "My dear, you're right. I think so too."' ...|$|R
50|$|Everything {{was up to}} Luce this time. She now has {{the ability}} to see through her past lives without the use of an Announcer. She {{discovered}} her true nature on just her own. She knew that the curse prevented her from knowing her true nature as an angel, caused her to die whenever she began to approach a memory of her past. That's why none of the others <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her who <b>she</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
60|$|Miss Keene cast a hurried glance around her, in {{the faint}} hope--she {{scarcely}} knew why--that Mr. Hurlstone had overheard the Senor's invitation; nor <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>tell</b> why <b>she</b> <b>was</b> disappointed at not seeing him. But {{he had not}} appeared on deck during the presence of their strange visitors; nor was he in the boat which {{half an hour later}} conveyed her to the shore. He must have either gone in one of the other boats, or fulfilled his strange threat of remaining on the ship.|$|R
5000|$|Allan Cunningham, {{a friend}} of Blake's, claimed [...] "the merit or the fault of surpassing all human {{comprehension}} ... {{what he meant by}} them even his wife declared <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell,</b> though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> sure they had a meaning, and a fine one" [...] and that [...] "it is not a little fearful to look upon; a powerful, dark, terrible, though undefined and indescribable, impression is left on the mind—and it is in no haste to be gone".|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] Deane cried. [...] "Listen, please! This is important! I am Mr. Deane--Mr. Stirling Deane--of the Incorporated Gold-Mines Association. I {{have just}} been rung up by a woman in distress--some one who appealed for help. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> dragged away from the {{telephone}} before <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> me where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> speaking from. You must try and find out the number for me. You must do it! It may {{be a matter of}} life or death!" ...|$|R
60|$|In truth, the {{sculptor}} {{had never before}} seen, nor hardly imagined, such a figure of peaceful beatitude as Hilda now presented. While coming towards him in the solemn radiance which, at that period of the day, is diffused through the transept, and showered down beneath the dome, she seemed of the same substance as the atmosphere that enveloped her. He <b>could</b> scarcely <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> imbued with sunshine, {{or whether it was}} a glow of happiness that shone out of her.|$|R
60|$|But even then, as {{she stood}} leaning against the wall, {{motionless}} save for the surging of her breast, there was about her the same strange, feral inscrutableness. He was baffled, he <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking. <b>She</b> seemed, unconquered, to triumph over her disarray and the agitation of her body. Then, with an involuntary gesture she raised {{her hands to her}} hair, smoothing it, and without seeming haste left the room, not so much as glancing at him, closing the door behind her.|$|R
60|$|She {{began to}} suspect, then, {{that she had}} {{in some way or}} other lost the right road. She, however, went on, looking anxiously about for {{indications}} of an approach to the farm, until at length she saw signs of an opening in the woods, at some distance before her. She concluded to go on until she came to this opening, and if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> by the appearance of the country there, she would go back again by the road she came.|$|R
60|$|One {{day when}} they were thus in the garden {{together}} a strange lady came towards them down the pathway. Over her had and face was drawn a thick veil, so that the two <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> who <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> When <b>she</b> came close to them she raised the veil, and the raven-prince saw that her face was the living likeness of the queen's; and yet {{there was something in}} it that was different. It was the second sister of the queen, and the old man knew her and bowed before her.|$|R
25|$|Praed {{never lost}} her {{interest}} in her native country and though {{most of her life}} was passed in England, a large proportion of her novels were based on her Australian experiences. Others dealt with the occult, with spiritualism, or with abnormal states of mind. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> much interested in psychological problems, her character-drawing is good although her women are better than her men, she had some sense of humour, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> a story. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> entitled to a leading place among the Australian novelists who developed in the nineteenth century.|$|R
60|$|He <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{grateful}} for his words, or annoyed. She resolutely said no more, {{but her mother}} took up the strain and discoursed long upon it, arranging all the particulars of their meeting and going together. Ferris was a little piqued, and began to wonder why Miss Vervain did not stay at home {{if she did not}} want to go. To <b>be</b> sure, <b>she</b> went everywhere with her mother but it was strange, with her habitual violent submissiveness, that she should have said anything in opposition to her mother's wish or purpose.|$|R
