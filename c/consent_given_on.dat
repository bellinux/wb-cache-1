40|$|Living-donor liver {{transplantation}} {{took root}} in Asia {{as a natural}} result of circumstances, because the supply of organs from the cadaveric pool remained scarce over the years. In contrast to Western countries, the majority of organs for liver transplantation in Asia come from live donations. As the expertise of the transplant teams grows, patient outcomes improve, and public awareness increases, the option of live donation of the liver is increasingly chosen. Although no live liver donor death has yet been reported from Asia, the risk is not eliminated and remains a major consideration in the potential donor's decision to donate. The low morbidity and mortality rate {{could be attributed to}} the extensive experience of surgeons in liver surgery, because surgical liver disease is highly prevalent in Asia. Although the donor risk is estimated to be low, live organ donation should be absolutely voluntary, with <b>consent</b> <b>given</b> <b>on</b> the basis of unbiased information and chosen only when the option for obtaining a cadaveric graft is practically nil. It is only under these conditions that living-donor liver transplantation should be perpetuated. Although the disease-donation-transplantation process involves a complex interplay of psychosocial and family dynamics, the potential candidate's perception will necessarily depend on the surgeon's explanation. The ethical soundness of the practice of living-donor liver transplantation rests primarily on the ones who deliver the service. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recruitment {{targets of}} {{patients}} to multi-centre primary care-based randomized controlled trials (RCT) {{are often not}} met. A critical step in the pathway is whether an eligible patient will <b>give</b> <b>consent.</b> OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patient, practice or practitioner characteristics {{are associated with a}} patient's likelihood of <b>giving</b> <b>consent</b> to participation in a large primary care-based RCT. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of patients from 260 practices in England and Wales who met the eligibility criteria for an RCT of aspirin versus warfarin for stroke prevention and attended an appointment with their GP to consider trial participation. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine which patient and practitioner factors independently predicted whether or not a patient would <b>give</b> <b>consent</b> {{to take part in the}} trial. RESULTS: Of the 1740 patients, 973 (55. 9 %) <b>gave</b> <b>consent.</b> <b>On</b> multivariable analysis, patient factors associated with increased likelihood of <b>giving</b> <b>consent</b> were younger age, current use of warfarin and year of recruitment to the trial. Patients with a history of transient ischaemic attack, angina or valve disease were less likely to <b>give</b> <b>consent.</b> Practice/practitioner factors that were associated with increased likelihood of consent were smaller practice size (practices with greater than eight GPs as compared with those with one to two GPs, odds ratio 0. 40, 95 % confidence interval 0. 21 - 0. 75) and older GPs. CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of consent with year of recruitment may be due to changes in trial procedures and investigator training. If so, this has important implications for the conduct of future trials...|$|R
