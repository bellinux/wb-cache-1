5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as supple and muscular in its rhythms and {{sometimes}} harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry is a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the legalization}} of {{same-sex}} marriage sometimes <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as redefining marriage or redefined marriage, especially in the United States. The term homosexual marriage is generally used by organisations opposed to same-sex marriage such as the Family Research Council in the United States; that term is rarely used in the mainstream press.|$|E
25|$|Anti-LGBT {{rhetoric and}} anti-gay slogans are themes, catchphrases, and slogans {{that have been}} used against {{homosexuality}} or other non-heterosexual sexual orientations and to demean lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. They range from the demeaning and pejorative to those expressing negativity on religious, medical, or moral grounds and some <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as being hate speech.|$|E

25|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{is one of}} the oldest African American communities in the nation. The community was very slow to develop, and by 1961 there were just 2,449 residents living in Marshall Heights in 428 homes and apartments. The neighborhood's residents were mostly poor, but it boasted a stable base of middle-class residents. Although significant middle-class flight from the neighborhood occurred in the 1970s, by 1981 The Washington Post continue to <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as a middle-class neighborhood (albeit one with a large number of retiree residents).|$|E

Above the building is [...] "McKinley Birthplace/Niles Ohio", and beneath it the date and [...] "Memorial".|$|E
500|$|Goldschmidt's confessional {{letter was}} {{published}} {{on the front page}} of The Oregonian. It differed from the Willamette Weeks account, most notably in the length of the relationship ("nearly a year" [...] according to Goldschmidt, but three years according to Willamette Week) and in Goldschmidt's use of the term [...] "affair" [...] to <b>characterize</b> <b>it.</b> The Oregonian was criticized for its coverage and use of the term [...] "affair." [...] Writers and editors at The Oregonian acknowledged mistakes in their handling of the story, but denied that a desire to protect Goldschmidt motivated the mistakes. The Willamette Week article, written by Nigel Jaquiss, was awarded the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.|$|E

500|$|During Mondale's 1967 {{questioning}} {{about what}} was to become known as the [...] "Phillips Report", Seamans was afraid Mondale might actually have seen a hard copy of Phillips' presentation, and responded that contractors have occasionally been subjected to on-site progress reviews; perhaps this was what Mondale's information referred to. Mondale continued to refer to [...] "the Report" [...] despite Phillips' refusal to <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as such, and angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, he questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.|$|E
500|$|The active {{participants}} of CrimethInc. <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as a mindset {{and a way}} of life first and foremost, rather than as an organization per se. Its main goal is to inspire people to take more active control of their own lives, becoming producers of culture and history instead of passive consumers. Those who ascribe to the CrimethInc. philosophy advocate radical ways of living one's life to the end of eliminating the perceived inequities and tyrannies within society. Contributors to publications are generally not credited in respect of an anonymity asserted by participants {{to be one of the}} organization's primary values. The name [...] "CrimethInc." [...] itself is a satirical self-criticism about the hypocrisy of revolutionary propaganda (and other [...] "margin-walking between contradictions") and a direct reference to the concept of [...] "thoughtcrime" [...] developed in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, garage rock had no {{name and}} was not {{thought of as a}} genre, but as typical {{elemental}} rock of the period. [...] When it began to be recognised in the early 1970s, [...] "garage rock" [...] was not the name initially prescribed. [...] Between 1971-1973 certain rock critics began to speak nostalgically of mid-1960s garage bands (and artists perceived to be in their tradition) as a genre and for several years used the term [...] "punk rock" [...] to <b>characterize</b> <b>it,</b> making it the first musical form to bear the description. [...] Conjuring up the mid-1960s, Lester Bangs in 1971 wrote: [...] "...then punk bands started cropping up who were writing their own songs but taking the Yardbirds' sound and reducing it to this kind of goony fuzztone clatter... oh, it was beautiful, it was pure folklore, Old America, and sometimes I think those were the best days ever".|$|E

500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence would somehow create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "45minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".|$|E
500|$|Have a {{nice day}} is a {{commonly}} spoken expression used to conclude a conversation (whether brief or extensive), or end a message by hoping the person to whom it is addressed experiences a pleasant day. Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers {{at the end of}} a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as an imperative, obliging the person to have {{a nice day}}. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that [...] "Have a nice day" [...] can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.|$|E
500|$|An {{analogous}} {{case is that}} of the screwball comedy, {{widely accepted}} by film historians as constituting a [...] "genre": the screwball is defined not by a fundamental attribute, but by a general disposition and a group of elements, some—but rarely and perhaps never all—of which are found in each of the genre's films. Because of the diversity of noir (much greater than that of the screwball comedy), certain scholars in the field, such as film historian Thomas Schatz, treat it as not a genre but a [...] "style". Alain Silver, the most widely published American critic specializing in film noir studies, refers to film noir as a [...] "cycle" [...] and a [...] "phenomenon", even as he argues that it has—like certain genres—a consistent set of visual and thematic codes. Other critics treat film noir as a [...] "mood", <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as a [...] "series", or simply address a chosen set of films they regard as belonging to the noir [...] "canon". There is no consensus on the matter.|$|E

500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Murphy Pizza {{suggests that}} Heathenry {{can be understood}} as an example of what the historian Eric Hobsbawm termed an [...] "invented tradition". As the religious studies scholar Fredrik Gregorius states, despite the fact that [...] "no real continuity" [...] exists between Heathenry and the pre-Christian belief systems of Germanic Europe, Heathen practitioners often dislike being considered adherents of a [...] "new religion" [...] and [...] "modern invention" [...] and thus prefer to depict theirs as a [...] "traditional faith". Many practitioners avoid using the scholarly, [...] term [...] "reconstructionism" [...] to describe their practices, preferring to <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as an [...] "indigenous religion" [...] with parallels to the traditional belief systems of the world's indigenous peoples. In claiming a sense of indigeneity, many Heathens—particularly in the United States—attempt to frame themselves as the victims of Medieval Christian colonialism and imperialism. Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kirsten Horton argued that in doing so, these Heathens ignore {{the fact that most of}} them are white, and thus members of the same ethnic community which has perpetrated and benefitted from colonial and imperial policies against indigenous communities in the Americas and elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|In 1900, William Crookes {{isolated}} protactinium as {{an intensely}} radioactive material from uranium; however, {{he could not}} <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as a new chemical element and thus named it uranium-X (UX). Crookes dissolved uranium nitrate in ether, the residual aqueous phase contains most of the [...] and [...] His method was still [...] used in the 1950s to isolate [...] and [...] from uranium compounds. Protactinium was first identified in 1913, when Kasimir Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring encountered the isotope 234Pa during their studies of the decay chains of uranium-238: [...] → [...] → [...] → [...] They named the new element brevium (from the Latin word, brevis, meaning brief or short) because of its short half-life, 6.7 hours for [...]-das neue Element der Uranreihe|journal = Physikalische Zeitschrift|date = 1913|volume = 14|pages = 877–84}} In 1917/18, two groups of scientists, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner of Germany and Frederick Soddy and John Cranston of Great Britain, independently discovered another isotope of protactinium, 231Pa having much longer half-life of about 32,000 years. Thus the name brevium was changed to protoactinium as the new element {{was part of the}} decay chain of uranium-235 before the actinium (from [...] = protos meaning first, before). For ease of pronunciation, the name was shortened to protactinium by the [...] IUPAC in 1949. The discovery of protactinium completed one of the last gaps in the early versions of the periodic table, proposed by Mendeleev in 1869, and it brought to fame the involved scientists.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{researchers}} say that street {{children do not}} always see survival sex as exploitative: rather, they sometimes <b>characterize</b> <b>it</b> as the [...] "beginning of a potential relationship."

2500|$|Under Joseph Stalin's rule, Kolyma {{became the}} most notorious region for the Gulag labor camps. Tens of {{thousands}} or more people may have died {{en route to the}} area or in the Kolyma's series of gold mining, road building, lumbering, and construction camps between 1932 and 1954.

The Mask of Sorrow monument in Magadan commemorates all those who died in the Kolyma forced-labour camps and the recently dedicated Church of the Nativity remembers the victims in its icons and Stations of the Camps.|$|E
