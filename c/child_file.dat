50|$|These two files contain {{information}} {{obtained from the}} survey response of one adult and one child (if one exists) sampled from each family contained in the family file, and can be linked up to household and family information (using the HHX and FMX variables). These two sample person files contain much more in-depth information about health conditions, {{physical and mental health}} status, health limitations, behaviors, and utilization than the family file. Their question topics are specific to either adults or children, but not both (such as occupational demographic questions in the adult file and childhood immunization questions in the <b>child</b> <b>file).</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} EnvyFS, an N-version {{local file}} {{system designed to}} improve reliability {{in the face of}} file-system bugs. EnvyFS, implemented as a thin VFS-like layer {{near the top of the}} storage stack, replicates file-system metadata and data across existing and diverse commodity file systems (e. g., ext 3, ReiserFS, JFS). It uses majority-consensus to operate correctly despite the sometimes faulty behavior of an underlying commodity <b>child</b> <b>file</b> system. Through experimentation, we show EnvyFS is robust to a wide range of failure scenarios, thus delivering on its promise of increased fault tolerance; however, performance and capacity overheads can be significant. To remedy this issue, we introduce SubSIST, a novel single-instance store designed to operate in an N-version environment. In the common case where all <b>child</b> <b>file</b> systems are working properly, SubSIST coalesces most blocks and thus greatly reduces time and space overheads. In the rare case where a child makes a mistake, SubSIST does not propagate the error to other children, and thus preserves the ability of EnvyFS to detect and recover from bugs that affect data reliability. Overall, EnvyFS and SubSIST combine to significantly improve reliability with only modest space and time overheads. ...|$|E

40|$|In England and Wales, local {{authorities}} {{have a duty}} under the 1989 Children Act {{to protect children from}} significant harm. This study builds on a previous paper that considered patterns of re-referral in cases that were not allocated; it considers re-referrals involving serious concerns about a <b>child.</b> <b>File</b> studies were carried out on 400 consecutive referrals to three {{local authorities}} in London that were closed rather than being allocated for long-term work in early 2000. Information on the presence and nature of re-referrals involving concerns about actual or potential ‘significant harm’ in the 27 months after closure (i. e. up to 2002) was noted. Such re-referrals were rare (2. 75 %). The factors that were statistically associated with them were: previous involvement with Social Services, physical abuse and parental alcohol misuse in the closed referral. These factors were also identified in a descriptive analysis of the re-referrals, though in addition issues not present in the original referral were identified as important, namely parental mental illness and sexual abuse. The findings were encouraging about the effectiveness of initial child protection assessment processes at the time of referral closure. The potential for the factors identified in the analyses to be used in initial risk assessment and their applicability to current policy and practice is considered...|$|E
40|$|Few studies utilize large {{national}} data sets to provide statistical {{estimates of the}} degree of disproportionate representation of African-American children placed in CPS foster care. The current study examined the association of African-American racial identity with foster care placement while controlling for child, caregiver, household and abuse characteristics. We conducted secondary analyses of the 2005 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) on investigated reports of child abuse and neglect that received a maltreatment disposition in the reporting year, 2005. NCANDS 2005 <b>Child</b> <b>File</b> reflects case-level data based on the submissions of 48 states and the District of Columbia resulting in 3, 461, 872 investigations. Our unweighted study sample was restricted to 71, 802 investigations of primary substantiated maltreatment in the reporting year 2005. A logit model was used to examine the association between foster care placement and racial identity. After controlling for child, caregiver, household and abuse characteristics African-American children had 44 % higher odds of foster care placement when compared with Caucasian children. This study supports the cumulative evidence that African-American racial identity is a significant predictor of foster care services. Continued examination of the factors associated with foster placement is warranted to unravel the complex circumstances facing this vulnerable segment of children.
