40|$|It is {{intuitive}} that a <b>clamping</b> <b>element</b> will grip {{better if}} {{the surface is}} provided with teeth which penetrate Into {{the surface of the}} clamped object. This paper is concerned with the problem of determining a quantitative comparison of the gripping ability of various penetrator shapes. It is presumed that the effects noted for a single penetrator will be applicable to an array of penetrators as on a serrated <b>clamping</b> <b>element.</b> Mathematical considerations show that a vertical penetrator load is held in equilibrium by the vertical components of the yield pressure which act on the penetrator surfaces. This is mathematically equivalent to the force given by the yield pressure acting over the area of the indentation projected on a plane normal to the direction of the load. This paper endeavors to show that the same concept will apply to forces applied transversely. Therefore the maximum possible transverse force which can be applied to a penetrator is theoretically equal to the product of the yield pressure of the Penetrated material and the area of tie penetrator face projected on a plane normal to the transverse force. Plasticity considerations show that the, yield pressure for a given material varies according to the penetrator shape. Strain hardening is also a factor in most materials. The influence of conventional friction is also shown to vary with the penetrator shape. In same cases vectorial addition of the frictional effect is required, but special cased permit algebraic addition. It is shown analytically that a friction reversal occurs at the surface of the penetrator as the transverse force roaches its maximum value. The result of the friction reversal is to lower the yield pressure Against the penetrator face. Experiments show that the foregoing theories are justified for the cases tested...|$|R

However, reversible microfluidic devices fabricated with current standard procedures can only be used for low-pressure applications. Assembling technology based on glass-PDMS-glass sandwich configuration provides an alternative sealing method for reversible microfluidic devices, which can drastically increase the sealing strength of reversibly adhered devices. The improvement mechanism of sealing properties of microfluidic devices based on the sandwich technique has not been fully characterized, hindering further improvement and broad use of this technique. Here, we characterize, for the first time, the effect of various parameters on the sealing strength of reversible PDMS/glass hybrid microfluidic devices, including contact area, PDMS thickness, assembling mode, and external force.

40|$|Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) is {{a well-known}} contributor that reduces the reliability and yield of the integrated circuits (ICs). As ICs become more complex, they are increasingly susceptible to such failures due to the scaling of physical dimensions of devices and interconnect on a chip [1]. These failures are caused by excessive electric field and/or excessive current densities and result in the dielectric breakdown, electromigration of metal lines and contacts. ESD can affect the IC in its different life stages, from wafer fabrication process to failure in the field. Furthermore, ESD events can damage the integrated circuit permanently (hard failure), or cause a latent damage (soft failure) [2]. ESD protection circuits consisting of I/O protection and ESD power supply clamps are routinely used in ICs to protect them against ESD damage. The main objective of the ESD protection circuit {{is to provide a}} low-resistive discharge path between any two pins of the chip to harmlessly discharge ESD energy without damaging the sensitive circuits. The main target of this thesis is to design ESD power supply clamps that have the lowest possible leakage current without degrading the ESD protection ability in general purpose TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. ESD clamps should have a very low-leakage current and should be stable and immune to the power supply noise under the normal operating conditions of the circuit core. Also, the ESD clamps must be able to handle high currents under an ESD event. All designs published in the general purpose 65 nm CMOS technology have used the SCR as the <b>clamping</b> <b>element</b> since the SCR has a higher current carrying capability compared to an MOS transistor of the same area [3]. The ESD power supply clamp should provide a low-resistive path in both directions to {{be able to deal with}} both PSD and NDS zapping modes. The SCR based design does not provide the best ESD protection for the NDS zapping mode (positive ESD stress at VSS with grounded VDD node) since it has two parasitic resistances (RNwell and RPsub) and one parasitic diode (the collector to base junction diode of the PNP transistor) in the path from the VSS to VDD. Furthermore, SCR-based designs are not suitable for application that exposed to hot switching or ionizing radiation [2]. In GP process, the gate oxide thickness of core transistors is reduced compared with LP process counterpart to achieve higher performance designs for high-frequency applications using 1 V core transistors and 2. 5 V I/O option. The thinner gate oxide layer results in higher leakage current due to gate tunneling [4]. Therefore, using large thin oxide MOS transistors as <b>clamping</b> <b>elements</b> will result in a huge leakage. In this thesis, four power supply ESD clamps are proposed in which thick oxide MOS transistors are used as the main <b>clamping</b> <b>element.</b> Therefore, the low-leakage current feature is achieved without significantly degrading the ESD performance. In addition, the parasitic diode of the MOS transistors provides the protection against NSD-mode. In this thesis, two different ESD power supply clamp architectures are proposed: standalone ESD power supply clamps and hybrid ESD power supply clamps. Two standalone clamps are proposed: a transient PMOS based ESD clamp with thyristor delay element (PTC), and a static diode triggered power supply (DTC). The standalone clamps were designed to protect the circuit core against ± 125 V CDM stress by limiting the voltage between the two power rails to less than the oxide breakdown voltage of the core transistors, BVOXESD = 5 V. The large area of this architecture was the price for maintaining the low-leakage current and an adequate ESD protection. The hybrid clamp architecture was proposed to provide a higher ESD protection, against ± 300 V CDM stress, while reducing the layout area and maintaining the low-leakage feature. In the hybrid clamp structure, two clamps are connected in parallel between the two power supply rails, a static clamp, and a transient clamp. The static clamp triggers first and starts to sink the ESD energy and then an RC network triggers the primary transient clamp to sink most of the ESD stress. Two hybrid designs were proposed: PMOS ESD power supply clamp with thyristor delay element and diodes (PTDC), and NMOS ESD power supply clamp with level shifter delay element and diode (NLDC). Simulation results show that the proposed clamps are capable of protecting the circuit core against ± 1. 5 kV HBM and at least against ± 125 V CDM stresses. The measurement results show that all of the proposed clamps are immune against false triggering, and transient induced latch-up. Furthermore, all four designs have responded favorably to the 4 V ESD-like pulse voltage under both chip powered and not powered conditions and after the stress ends the designs turned off. Finally, TLP measurement results show that all four proposed designs meet the minimum design requirement of the ESD protection circuit in the 65 nm CMOS technology (i. e. HBM protection level of ± 1. 5 kV) ...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{wafer bonding}} {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} technology {{in the manufacture of}} silicon-on-insulator substrates (SOI), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and three-dimensional inte-grated circuits (3 D IC’s). While the process is currently employed in applications such as these, a lack of knowledge of the basic mechanics of the process has made developing robust processes and preventing process failures extremely challenging. The current work addresses this problem through the development and validation of mechanics-based models that connect the wafer geometry, etch pattern, clamping configuration, and work of adhesion to bonding failure. An energy-based bonding criterion, which allows the effect of flatness variations and etch pat-terns to be quantified, is presented and employed to develop analytical and numerical models. Analytical models, based on plate theory, are developed to examine the role of wafer-scale shape variations, etch patterns, and the <b>clamping</b> configuration. Finite <b>element</b> models are developed to verify the analytical models and to evaluate the bonding criterion for wafers with anisotropic elas-tic properties and arbitrary geometries. Experiments in which silicon substrates with wafer-scale shape variations and etch patterns were bonded demonstrate that the shape and size of the bonde...|$|R
40|$|A {{device is}} {{disclosed}} for sealing and <b>clamping</b> a cylindrical <b>element</b> {{which is to}} be attached to an object such as a wall, a pressurized vessel or another cylindrical element. The device includes a gland having an inner cylindrical wall, which is threaded at one end and is attached at a bendable end to a deformable portion, which in turn is attached to one end of a conical cantilever structure. The other end of the cantilever structure connects at a bendable area to one end of an outer cylindrical wall. The opposite end of cylindrical wall terminates in a thickened portion, the radially outer surface of which is adapted to accommodate a tool for rotating the gland. The terminal end of cylindrical wall also includes an abutment surface, which is adapted to engage a seal, which in turn engages a surface of a receiver. The receiver further includes a threaded portion for engagement with the threaded portion of gland whereby a tightening rotation of gland relative to receiver will cause relative movement between cylindrical walls and of gland. This movement causes a rotation of the conical structure and thus a bending action at bending area and at the bending end of the upper end of inner cylindrical wall. These rotational and bending actions result in a forcing of the deformable portion radially inwardly so as to contact and deform a pipe. This forcible contact creates a seal between gland and pipe, and simultaneously clamps the pipe in position...|$|R
40|$|The phloem is {{a complex}} tissue {{composed}} of highly specialized cells with unique subcellular structures and a compact organization that is challenging to study in vivo at cellular resolution. We used confocal scanning laser microscopy and subcellular fluorescent markers in companion cells and sieve elements, for live imaging of the phloem in Arabidopsis leaves. This approach provided a simple framework for identifying phloem cell types unambiguously. It highlighted the compactness of the meshed network of organelles within companion cells. By contrast, within the sieve elements, unknown bodies were observed {{in association with the}} PP 2 -A 1 :GFP, GFP:RTM 1 and RTM 2 :GFP markers at the cell periphery. The phloem lectin PP 2 -A 1 :GFP marker was found in the parietal ground matrix. Its location differed from that of the P-protein filaments, which were visualized with SEOR 1 :GFP and SEOR 2 :GFP. PP 2 -A 1 :GFP surrounded two types of bodies, one of which was identified as mitochondria. This location suggested that it was embedded within the sieve <b>element</b> <b>clamps,</b> specific structures that may fix the organelles to each another or to the plasma membrane in the sieve tubes. GFP:RTM 1 was associated with a class of larger bodies, potentially corresponding to plastids. PP 2 -A 1 :GFP was soluble in the cytosol of immature sieve elements. The changes in its subcellular localization during differentiation provide an in vivo blueprint for monitoring this process. The subcellular features obtained with these companion cell and sieve element markers can be used as landmarks for exploring the organization and dynamics of phloem cells in vivo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{how to make}} a finite element model of a scooter CVT. This finite element model will be made in ABAQUS. To check the results from the ABAQUS model an experimental CVT test setup is used. While making a model, different in fluences will be studied and simplified to make a simple but effective model for studying rubber belt CVTs. First some material test are done to achieve the material properties of the belt. The properties of the pulleys and boss are achieved from the manufacturer. From the measurements can be concluded, that the belts material is anisotropic and viscoelastic in the longitudinal direction. Because the belt will be simulated as isotropic and the material behavior in the longitudinal direction is most important, an isotropic viscoelastic model should be used. The reason for choosing isotropic instead of anisotropic is due to its complexity and lack of time. The other parts will be simulated as analytical rigid due to its 200 times larger Young's modulus. The simulation is split into 5 steps, it starts with a model where forces or stresses are not present, converted into a model where the pulleys are rotating and the belt is <b>clamped.</b> The <b>elements</b> used for the model are 20 -node quadratic bricks with reduced integration. To see the difference between the effects, different models are made. The details that are researched in this paper are: - The geometry of the modeled belt - Material behavior (viscoelastic/elastic) - Misalignment of the pulley sets - Symmetric/Asymetric model To see the difference and compare the results of the experiments, 6 models are made. After studying the results of the experiments and the models, {{it became clear that the}} in fluence of the torque on the effciency has the same behavior in the simulation as in the experiments. Only the in uence of the speed on the effciency is not visible in the results. To see the effects of the different details which are investigated, the mean effciency is compared between the models. The highest in uence on the effciency is the belt shape. The in uence of the cogs on the effciency was 3. 7 % on average. The in fluence of viscoelastic and misalignment were respectively 0. 89 % and 0. 33 %, which are remarkably low. In the model with cogs, only simple square cogs are used to compare against a model without cogs. Probably when a exact copy of the belt shape was used even a larger effciency increase was noticed. The difference between a symmetric or asymmetric model in mean effciency is small, only 2 %. When a model without misalignment, clearance and exact pulley positions is suffcient a symmetric model is preferred because of its lower computational costs...|$|R
