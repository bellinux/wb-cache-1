40|$|Spent cider lees(yeast), a {{by-product}} of the <b>cider</b> <b>industry,</b> was subjected to subcritical water in a batch process over a temperature range of 100 °C to 300 °C. The efficacy of subcritical water to convert the waste biomass into a mixture of valuable compounds was investigated by studying formed products in the extracts. At milder temperatures (up to 150 °C), yeast intracellular contents such as proteins were released. Also, phenolic compounds which were previously adsorbed on cell walls during fermentation start to release, which was shown for the first time, leading {{to an increase in}} the antioxidant activity of the extracts (maximum 80 g ascorbic acid equivalent in 100 ml). The release of phenolics was compared to organic solvent extraction and the same level of extraction was observed in subcritical water treatment. At higher temperatures, polymers of the yeast cell wall started to solubilise producing monosaccharides which later were converted to hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF). Kinetics of HMF synthesis were determined using first order kinetics suggesting that milder conditions are required for HMF production when compared to the same process using cellulose as substrate. Results support the potentials of the studied feedstock as a substrate for numerous bio-based chemicals...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} measure the {{potential}} of apple pomace as a raw material for manufacturing food-related products (such as lactic acid, fiber-rich concentrates and pectin), samples from <b>cider</b> <b>industry</b> were assayed for composition and enzymatic digestibility. Alcohol-soluble compounds (monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and malic acid) accounted for 32 – 45 mass percent of oven-dry pomace. Glucose and fructose were the major components of this fraction. The alcohol-insoluble fraction accounted for 55 – 68 mass percent of oven-dry pomace and was mainly made up of neutral detergent fiber (62 – 69 percent of the mass fraction) and pectin (16. 2 – 19. 7 percent of the mass fraction). The feedstock content of N, P and metal ions (K, Mg, Fe and Mn) was favourable for further manufacture of lactic acid fermentation media. Apple pomace showed a high susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis: in media with a cellulase loading of 8. 5 FPU/g of apple pomace and a cellobiase loading of 5 IU/FPU, about 80 % of the total glucan was converted into glucose after 15 h. Considering the low enzyme charge, liquor to solid ratio employed, reaction time needed to achieve the maximal sugars concentration and N, P and metal ion (K, Mg, Fe and Mn) content of samples, {{it can be concluded}} that apple pomace is a promising raw material for lactic acid production...|$|E

50|$|At {{its peak}} with the {{conversion}} of the Millerites in 1846, White Water village comprised 706 acre in Hamilton County and 190 acre in Butler County on which 200 believers in two families worked the large farm and engaged in a variety of industries. The Shakers would purchase additional land and establish a third family in the 1850s, and they remained a vibrant community into the 1880s when the long, slow decline began. The White Water Shakers operated a grist mill, sawmill, and possibly a brewery. They raised broom corn and manufactured brooms, sold packaged garden seeds (grossing $5,704 in 1857), and maintained large apple orchards for the sale of applesauce and <b>cider.</b> Other <b>industries</b> included sorghum molasses, honey, and preserved currents, grapes, and strawberries. The Shakers also raised silkworms for the manufacture of their own shawls, scarves, and handkerchiefs. In the final years of the community, the Believers were well known for raising fish in two Shaker-made ponds and for selling turkey eggs. The Civil War affected the Whitewater community. In April 1863, Morgan's Raiders passed through the community. Because a mill worker warned the rest of the community of the approach of the Raiders and the Shakers quickly hid their horses, only two horses were stolen. However, pursuing Union cavalrymen troops arrived on the following day, and they too took horses.|$|R
40|$|The {{birth of}} this {{dissertation}} is founded {{in a personal}} fascination with the industrial archetype, which has developed over time from crude mechanistic structures to refined, sophisticated edifices of technological and structural ingenuity. However by excluding human experience and disregarding the making of public space, industry has isolated itself, creating limited and restricted spatial and experiential environments. Additionally, the extraction of natural resources {{has led to a}} destructive relationship between industry and the landscape creating a scarred environment. As natural resources are exhausted, widespread deindustrialization is becoming a reality where mines fail to meet demands of profitability. Man is now tasked with reclaiming his sense of place within the post-industrial scarred environment as the legacy of a mechanized industrial age. The genesis of Cullinan is woven into the very fabric of the diamond mine as the catalytic core which extracts resources to sustain its surroundings economically. Its inevitable decommissioning and the current rehabilitation strategy proposed by mine authorities, will create an inaccessible industrial ruin devoid of meaning and quality that allow for man’s sense of belonging. This threatens the tangible and intangible industrial heritage value of the mine resulting in a loss of authenticity and connection with place. Through an exploration of the scenario following the decommissioning of the mine, this dissertation investigates the role that architectural design can play as an alternative solution to increase resilience while regenerating the scarred landscape. By utilizing the principles of regenerative design, unexpected potential was discovered and harnessed to inform the design of a facility for the extraction of essential oils and the making of <b>cider</b> as interconnected <b>industries</b> providing social and economic incentive for rehabilitation. The concept of constructive extraction, reinsertion and reconciliation informed a new approach to the design and technification of industry. Through this approach an architecture of the senses and experience is created by a promenade in the scarred environment. A new mutualistic relationship is thus established between the landscape and production through this experiential interface The architecture becomes a multi-functional regenerative device which redefines industry, remediates the scarred environment by giving resources and nutrients back to the landscape and creates new social and economic opportunities in the industrial heritage precinct.

40|$|Cider {{production}} {{is a traditional}} industry in Northern Spain and it needs specific cultivars to produce a high quality beverage. Six cultivars selected in Asturias (Spain) for cider production, 'Blanquina', 'Cristalina', 'Marialena', 'Reineta Encarnada', 'Raxao' and 'Teorica' have been tested to determine their performance during eleven years on fwo rootstocks, MM. 106 and MM. 111. Full bloom was quite late with all cultivars, from 28 April to 20 May, which could be of interest in areas with late frost. The harvest time of 'Marialena' was particularly early, and could be inconvenient for the <b>cider</b> <b>industry.</b> MM. 106 and MM. Ill showed similar vigor in our conditions, but MM. 106 induced a higher productivity with some cultivars. With both rootstocks, 4 x 3. 5 m was an insufficient planting distance for all cultivars except 'Cristalina' which could be planted closer. All cultivars began to fruit the fourth year except 'Blanquina' and 'Cristalina', which fruited the fifth and sixth year, respectively. The most productive cultivar {{during the first two}} years was 'Marialena'. All cultivars exhibited biennial bearing except 'Cristalina'. Considering total production after ten years, two groups could be established: i) cvs. Blanquina, Marialena and Raxao, with more than 200 kg/tree, and ii) cvs. Cristalina, Reineta Encarnada and Te 6 rica, with less than 170 kg/tree. The most vigorous cultivars were 'Marialena' and 'Raxao'. 'Blanquina', 'Te 6 rica' and 'Marialena' had high productivity and are recommended using MM. 106 rootstock in our conditions. 'Raxao' is also quite interesting though it should be grafted on a dwarf rootstock such as M. 9. 'Cristalina' should be rejected because it is non-precocious with low productivity, and likewise 'Reineta Encarnada' which was the least productive cultivar tested...|$|E
40|$|Apple pomace (AP) is {{the main}} {{by-product}} of <b>cider</b> <b>industry</b> being mainly composed of carbohydrates and dietary fibre, small amounts of protein, fat and ash. In addition AP {{is also a good}} source of phytochemicals such as phenolic acids and flavonoids making AP a valuable source of antioxidants. The common applications of this by-product are the direct disposal to soil in a landfill and for pectin recovery usage. These applications are not sufficient to drain the several tonnes produced every year and studies to valorise the AP for other purposes have gained momentum. AP due to its chemical composition, rich in fibre with significant amounts of antioxidants, can be incorporated in human food-chain thus generating new potential functional foods. Extruded snacks and baked scones were incorporated with increasing levels (0 - 30 %) of AP. The incorporation of AP from the chemical and nutritional analysis was successful with 20 % addition in extruded snacks and 30 % addition in baked scones. At these levels of incorporation fibre content, phenolic content and antioxidant capacity (DPPH radical scavenging activity, FRAP and β-carotene/linoleic acid system) increased when compared to the products with no AP incorporation. Chlorogenic acid and quercetin were the major phenolic compounds of AP incorporated extruded and baked products. Feruloylquinic acid, isorhamnetin/rhamnetin, phloretin, luteolin and rutin were also present in the AP based products. The AP incorporated baked products also showed the presence of catechin/epicatechin and phloridzin. Nevertheless, compounds other than phenolics affected the antioxidant activities of AP incorporated extruded and baked products probably products resulting from Maillard reaction. These data suggest that AP from a chemical and nutritional point of view can be successfully incorporated in extruded and baked products conferring fibre and antioxidant properties to the final products...|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} explores {{the potential to}} develop a cherry-apple hard cider market as a potential means to increase demand for {{and the value of}} Michigan fruit grower's product. Factors affecting both the development of hard cider markets in Michigan and cherry-apple hard cider were explored. Research results show that the potential value of Michigan hard cider market is relatively small but significant, estimated at ranging between $ 580, 000 and $ 2, 900, 000 per year. Microbrews would be primary actors to promote HC market. They are willing and able to dabble in it, promote it. But they are constrained by need for license and this impedes participation of many who would be otherwise interested. Some microbrews uninterested in state-wide push because they feel it will focus on sweet product that they are uninterested in producing. This position is reflective of a seeming contraction inherent in current enthusiasm over the potential of the market, as figures recent market growth is largely fueled by the current trendiness of "malternatives" as a beverage category, while the maintenance of the market, and the interests of some microbrewers and other purveyors is primarily derived from the traditional image of hard cider, with "traditional" vs. "trendy" hard cider products reflecting significant taste differences. Hard cider is also potentially an important product for wineries. There is a high sales potential for a Michigan-brewed hard cider product, however producing a hard cider that is produced exclusively from Michigan-grown fruit could be more difficult due to supply limitations, logistical constraints, and cost. Constraints to growth of hard <b>cider</b> <b>industry</b> include licensing requirements, taxation issues, primary ingredient sourcing and transport, and fluctuating prices, particularly for cherry juice. The research showed high potential for hard cider that blends cherries (and many other fruits) with apple, however such a product would be rotated with current hard cider, not added as a new product in most cases. Its demand increasing potential still exists, however, even if offered as a substitute to hard cider, due to its novelty and variety. Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|E
40|$|Foodways, {{which in}} short refers to eating and {{drinking}} practices, are constitutive of personal and group identity. In this thesis, I explore the symbolic values of food and drink in group identification processes evolving across North America. Through the cases of poutine, mezcal, and hard cider, I investigate cultural identity formation, negotiation, and transformation; from everyday practices to global interactions. What I develop in this thesis is a rationale that can be actively used by members of a group, {{as well as by}} community development practitioners, governments, and industry stakeholders to bolster community capitals and agency through making, supporting or rejecting food and drink ownership claims. In the first article, titled Poutine Dynamics, I explore both the culinary and social status of poutine. First, I identify poutine as a new(er) and distinct way to consume food that is increasingly adopted and adapted, and I propose a working definition of poutine as a new dish classification label in its own. Then, by coupling poutine’s sociohistorical stigma and its growing Canadization (that is, the presentation, not the consumption per say, of poutine as a Canadian dish), I expose two related situations: the ongoing culinary appropriation of poutine and the threat of Quebecois cultural absorption by Canadians. In Poutine Dynamics, I problematize the notion of a “national cuisine” in the context of multinational and settler states. Although the focus is about cuisine, Poutine Dynamics provides elements of analysis regarding how the Canadian nationalist project is constructed and articulated today, in current celebrations of the 150 th anniversary of Confederation in Canada. The second article of this thesis, titled Strategic Authenticity: The Case of Mezcal, draws upon the recent major update to the mezcal denomination of origin certification (DO) that was long-awaited and requested by “traditional mezcaleros. ” This tour de force in the modification of the mezcal DO leads me to identify the notion of authenticity in food as a powerful rhetorical strategy in social negotiation between groups. Through the case of mezcal, I assert that the tasting experience is the most legitimate group identification path and authentication boundary (as opposed to political, ethnical or religious boundaries) in terms of foodways. The third article, titled The Identity Crisis of Hard Cider, looks at the ongoing cultural affirmation of hard cider from its European counterparts. So far, the research on hard cider in Vermont has looked at the low-level of cider-specific apple production in that state as a supply issue. Instead, I approach this problematic from a demand angle, specifically from the low demand for hard ciders made with cider-specific apples. In this study, I survey the Vermont hard <b>cider</b> <b>industry</b> stakeholders as to possible mechanisms in order to differentiate between hard cider styles, as well as strategies to boost the demand for hard ciders made with cider-specific apples. The implementation of a geographical indication (GI) label was of high interests among participating cider makers. In this study, I also suggest that the hard cider foodways found in Vermont are part of a broader emerging hard cider identity that is taste-based and which crosses political borders within the American Northeast...|$|E
40|$|The {{ensilage}} of {{fish and}} fisheries derived by-products as alternative ingredients to fish meal in diets for aquaculture may be an effective strategy to reduce feed and production costs of farmed marine fish. In this context, the production of fish silage {{by means of the}} fermentation of whole sardine (Sardina pilchardus) using Lactobacillus plantarinn starter culture together with apple pomace co-product as the principle carbohydrate source was developed. Apple pomace is an important co-product from the <b>cider</b> <b>industry</b> in the UK and was ideally suited for this purpose. The minimum of total sugars necessary for a successful fermentation was found to be 5 % (w/w) which was equivalent to a ratio of 0. 15 : 1 apple pomace to minced sardine. The optimum conditions for the fermentation process during ensilage of sardines in apple pomace and molasses were evaluated. Successful fermentation was obtained at 25 and 35 °C with an inoculum size of more thanl 02 cfu g-,. The effect of autolysis and storage on chemical composition of whole fish and fish silage was also investigated. Fish silage was compared before and after fermentation and acidification {{as well as in the}} fresh state and after 7, 14, 21 and 30 days of storage at different temperatures for the fermented fish silage product. Specific changes in the proximate composition (i. e. moisture, protein, lipid and ash) of raw fish after the ensiling process were obtained. Reduction in the bound protein amino acids and consequent elevation in "free" amino acids occurring during the ensilage process was also noticed. The assessment of fermented fish silage storage conditions showed minor effects on the proximate composition and amino acid profile of the finished silage material. Fish silage samples tested after storage at all temperatures gave a sufficiently low pH to maintain a successful fermentation condition. Storage time and temperature dependency effect showed an increase in non-protein nitrogen (NPN) values in both fermented fish silages. An elevation in total volatile bases (TVB-N) values occurred in apple pomace and molasses fish silage as storage time increased. Increases of Free Fatty Acid (FFA) content and associated high values of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) in stored apple pomace and molasses fish silages could indicate a problem with rancidity. A comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional effect of the partial replacement of fish heal by fish silage products in the diet of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) was conducted under laboratory conditions. Feeding sea bass with fish silage based diets generated similar or lower growth performance, feed utilization, protein efficiency and retention compared to the fish meal based diet. Extended investigations showed no evidence of any morphological, histopathological or haematological changes in seabass. Incorporation of a polychaete worm meal in the apple pomace fish silage diets appeared to increase the palatability of diets and improved the microvilli morphology of the posterior intestine of seabass. In separate experiments, the apparent digestibility coefficient of dry matter of the experimental diets was relatively low. However the apparent digestibility coefficients for protein and energy were deemed acceptable for all silages tested. The overall findings of this study indicate that fish silage could be generated by biological fermentation using by-catch. over-catch and processing waste fish with carbohydrates obtained from industrial waste streams such as, apple pomace from cider production. This silage product was an effective replacement of expensive fish meal in aquaculture feeds with potential for future applications in aquafeeds.
