40|$|Often read as tragic realism, The Sopranos {{has rarely}} {{been seen in the}} light of the comedy created in every episode.    While a number of {{television}} critics and commentators have compared the series to the tragedies of Shakespeare (Bushby, Macintyre, Varble), none have focused on the comic elements, which, as I will show, are descendants of Italian <b>Commedia</b> <b>dell</b> <b>Arte</b> and Shakespearean comedies.   The best way of seeing this is to focus on the character Paulie Walnuts, whom I see as an Italian American version of the zanni of the Commedia or the fool/clown of Shakespeare.   In this article, I present David Chase’s serial narrative as a comedy that serves not only to create laughter but also to criticize U. S. and especially Italian American culture through the character Paulie Walnuts.   Before I launch into this reading I want to present a few words on just how we might read the seriality of Chase’s narrative.   Through Paulie Walnuts, the writers of the show are able insert a running joke throughout the entire series that enables them to poke fun at traditional notions of Italian immigrant culture, and at the same time, show that those notions also serve as viable criticisms of U. S. capitalist culture.   Paulie, who is certainly more reactionary than revolutionary, reflects the many Italian Americans who assimilated quickly into American culture, in spite of holding on to traditions and superstitions of Italian folk culture...|$|E

40|$|Esse trabalho visa estudar as relações entre o teatro tusso de vanguarda e as artes circenses. Para tanto, foram enfatizadas as encenações de Vsévolod Meyerhold, principalmente na montagem do texto A Barraquinha de Feira, de Aleksandr Blok, e nas montagens das peças escritas por Vladímir Maiakóvski: Mistério Bufo, O Percevejo e Os Banhos. Nesses trabalhos, Meyerhold incorporou técnicas dos palhaços circenses na construção de máscaras sociais, resgatando elementos da Commedia dellArte e do teatro de feira, por meio dos quais trabalhou a estética do grotesco. O contato com o teatro de vanguarda, junto aos acontecimentos provocados pela Revolução de Outubro, causou mudanças significativas no circo. Nascem daí os clowns-tribunos, que abandonam as maquiagens e figurinos extravagantes dos clowns do ocidente, mudando também a sua maneira de atuar no picadeiro. Assim, podiam se aproximar mais da realidade do homem soviético. Nasce, então, uma nova escola clownesca na URSS, sob um viés político e existencial profundo, que se perpetuará nas décadas posteriores, com figuras como Karandach e Iúri Nikúlin, entre outros. This work aims {{to study}} the {{relationship}} between the Russian avant-garde theater and circus arts. In order to reach its main goal, the scenarios created by Vsevolod Meyerhold are emphasized, mainly the ones for the play Balaganchik, by Aleksandr Blok, and Mystery-Bouffe, The Bedbug and The Bathhouse, written by Vladimir Mayakovsky. In these works, Meyerhold incorporated techniques used by circus clowns to build up social masks, rescuing elements of <b>Commedia</b> <b>dell</b> <b>Árte</b> and Théâtre de la foire. Through these influences, he could work upon the aesthetic of the grotesque. The contact with the avant-garde theater, as well as the events caused by the October Revolution, caused significant changes in the circus world. From this period came the tribune-clowns, who left behind the makeup and extravagant costumes of Western clowns and also changed the way of acting in the circus ring. Thus they got closer to the reality of the Soviet man.

40|$|In this chapter, I {{consider}} {{the means of}} participation within the public sphere of eighteenth- century Venice. My interest is to flesh out the nature of discourse within interior institutional spaces, and I will do so through a discussion of two related phenomena. First, I will examine {{the role of the}} mask, which by the eighteenth century had become synonymous with Venetian carnival and debauchery. Indeed, Venice in the eighteenth century gained much of its naughty reputation due to the exploits of Sior Maschere. Masks, however, were not only worn for amusement or the possibility of anonymous pleasure. During the carnival season, masking was regulated and required for entry into interior public spaces such as ridotti (gaming halls) and theaters. Ironically; {{at the same time that}} masks were regulated within the theater of the city, they began to leave the stage of the theater proper. In the second part of the chapter, I will discuss this shift through exploring the transformation of the nature and subject matter of theatrical productions, from the tradition of the <b>commedia</b> <b>dell</b> 2 ̆ 7 arte to character plays. The significance of character plays was embodied in the public quarrel of two playwrights: Carlo Coldoni and Carlo Cozzi. In each writer 2 ̆ 7 s work, unmasked characters replaced the masked roles of the <b>commedia</b> <b>dell</b> 2 ̆ 7 arte. The words and actions of the unmasked characters, however, must be read as thinly masked attacks by each author against the other. My wager is that the existence of such masking - one physical, the other symbolic - created a nuanced form of participation within the evolving public realm and had a direct affect on identity and the self in the eighteenth century...|$|R

Actantial models. - This treatise follows {{and comments}} on {{the historical development of}} actantial models. Their currently established form and terminology were established by A. J. Greimas who applies them to all literary genres: A. Ubersfeld took Greimas 2 ̆ 7 idea and adjusted it to the special demands of drama, and later on made it prominent as a useful instrument of dramatic analysis. The actantial model actually appeared in its rudimentary form in thesecond half of the 18 th century, when first defined by Italiam dramatist Carlo Gozzi, who presumably derives it from the special structure of charecter and action in <b>commedia</b> <b>dell</b> 2 ̆ 7 arte. In later phases of development, actantial models were twice used to analyze drama (by G. Polti and É. Souriau) and only once in narrative, i. e. a folktale (by V. Propp). Greimas added a vital new dimension in this development. On the basis of the thesis oflinguist L. Tesnière, he defined the actantial modelas an extrapolation of syntactic structure, which also means that every narrative and hereafter the plot as a whole has its own subject, object, sender, receiver, helper and opponent. The present paper deals with variants of the actantial model since Gozzi, with the aid of Greimas 2 ̆ 7 uniform terminology. In this way, a comparison between models becomes much clearer, if not impossible without the Greimas terminology. On the basis of these comparisons, A. Ubersfeld 2 ̆ 7 s work {{can be seen as a}} convergence of historical forms, while drama can be described as the most suitable for this kind of analysis. Ubersfeld also introduced special features, including the possibility that an actant is abstract, i. e. non-personal, or even that some actantial positions remain unoccupied. Such unoccupied actantial positions very clearly indicate that the most essential characteristic feature of the play discussed is constituted per negationem, i. e. by the absence of some fundamental and almost indispensable primary matter.

40|$|The theatre {{director}} (metteur en {{scene in}} French) {{is a relatively}} new figure in theatre practice. It was not until the I 820 s that the term 'mise en scene' gained currency. The term 'director' was not in general use until the I 880 s. The emergence {{and the role of the}} director has been considered from a variety of perspectives, either through the history of theatre (Allevy, Jomaron, Sarrazac, Viala, Biet and Triau); the history of directing (Chinoy and Cole, Boll, Veinstein, Roubine); semiotic approaches to directing (Whitmore, Miller, Pavis); the semiotics of performance (De Marinis); generic approaches to the mise en scene (Thomasseau, Banu); post-dramatic approaches to theatre (Lehmann); approaches to performance process and the specifics of rehearsal methodology (Bradby and Williams, Giannachi and Luckhurst, Picon-Vallin, Styan). What the scholarly literature has not done so far is to map the parameters necessarily involved in the directing process, and to incorporate an analysis of the emergence of the theatre director during the modem period and consider its impact on contemporary performance practice. Directing relates primarily to the making of the performance guided by a director, a single figure charged with the authority to make binding artistic decisions. Each director may have her/his own personal approaches to the process of preparation prior to a show. This is exemplified, for example, by the variety of terms now used to describe the role and function of directing, from producer, to facilitator or outside eye. However, it is essential at the outset to make two observations, each of which contributes to a justification for a generic analysis (as opposed to a genetic approach). Firstly, a director does not work alone, and cooperation with others is involved at all stages of the process. Secondly, beyond individual variation, the role of the director remains twofold. The first is to guide the actors (meneur de jeu, directeur d'acteurs, coach); the second is to make a visual representation in the performance space (set designer, stage designer, costume designer, lighting designer, scenographe). The increasing place of scenography has brought contemporary theatre directors such as Wilson, Castellucci, Fabre to produce performances where the performance space becomes a semiotic dimension that displaces the primacy of the text. The play is not, therefore, the sole artistic vehicle for directing. This definition of directing obviously calls for a definition of what the making of the performance might be. The thesis defines the making of the performance as the activity of bringing a social event, by at least one performer, providing visual and/or textual meaning in a performance space. This definition enables us to evaluate four consistent parameters throughout theatre history: first, the social aspect associated to the performance event; second, the devising process which may be based on visual and/or textual elements; third, the presence of at least one performer in the show; fourth, the performance space (which is not simply related to the theatre stage). Although the thesis focuses primarily on theatre practice, such definition blurs the boundaries between theatre and other collaborative artistic disciplines (cinema, opera, music and dance). These parameters illustrate the possibility to undertake a generic analysis of directing, and resonate with the historical, political and artistic dimensions considered. Such a generic perspective on the role of the director addresses three significant questions: an historical question: how/why has the director emerged?; a sociopolitical question: how/why was the director a catalyst for the politicisation of theatre, and subsequently contributed to the rise of State-funded theatre policy?; and an artistic one: how/why the director has changed theatre practice and theory in the twentieth-century? Directing for the theatre as an artistic activity is a historically situated phenomenon. It would seem only natural from a contemporary perspective to associate the activity of directing to the function of the director. This is relativised, however, by the question of how the performance was produced before the modern period. The thesis demonstrates that the rise of the director is a progressive and historical phenomenon (Dort) rather than a mere invention (Viala, Sarrazac). A chronological analysis of the making of the performance throughout theatre history is the most useful way to open the study. In order to understand the emergence of the director, the research methodology assesses the interconnection of the four parameters above throughout four main periods of theatre history: the beginning of the Renaissance (meneur de jeu), the classical age (actor-manager and stage designer-manager), the modern period (director) and the contemporary period (director-facilitator, performer). This allows us properly to appraise the progressive emergence of the director, as well as to make an analysis of her/his modern and contemporary role. The first chapter argues that the physical separation between the performance space and its audience, which appeared in the early fifteenth-century, has been a crucial feature in the scenographic, aesthetic, political and social organisation of the performance. At the end of the Middle Ages, French farces which raised socio-political issues (see Bakhtin) made a clear division on a single outdoor stage (treteau) between the actors and the spectators, while religious plays (drame fiturgique, mystere) were mostly performed on various outdoor and opened multispaces. As long as the performance was liturgical or religious, and therefore confined within an acceptable framework, it was allowed. At the time, the French ecclesiastical and civil authorities tried, on several occasions, to prohibit staged performances. As a result, practitioners developed non-official indoor spaces, the Theatre de fa Trinite (1398) being the first French indoor theatre recognized by scholars. This self-exclusion from the open public space involved breaking the accepted rules by practitioners (e. g. Les Confreres de fa Passion), in terms of themes but also through individual input into a secular performance rather than the repetition of commonly known religious canvases. These developments heralded the authorised theatres that began to emerge from the mid-sixteenth century, which in some cases were subsidised in their construction. The construction of authorised indoor theatres associated with the development of printing led to a considerable increase in the production of dramatic texts for the stage. Profoundly affecting the reception of the dramatic text by the audience, the distance between the stage and the auditorium accompanied the changing relationship between practitioners and spectators. This distance gave rise to a major development of the role of the actor and of the stage designer. The second chapter looks at the significance of both the actor and set designer in the devising process of the performance from the sixteenth-century to the end of the nineteenth-century. The actor underwent an important shift in function in this period from the delivery of an unwritten text that is learned in the medieval oral tradition to a structured improvisation produced by the <b>commedia</b> <b>dell</b> 'arte. In this new form of theatre, a chef de troupe or an experienced actor shaped the story, but the text existed only through the improvisation of the actors. The preparation of those performances was, moreover, centred on acting technique and the individual skills of the actor. From this point, there is clear evidence that acting began to be the subject of a number of studies in the mid-sixteenth-century, and more significantly in the seventeenth-century, in Italy and France. This is revealed through the implementation of a system of notes written by the playwright to the actors (stage directions) in a range of plays (Gerard de Vivier, Comedie de la Fidelite Nuptiale, 1577). The thesis also focuses on Leoni de' Sommi (Quatro dialoghi, 1556 or 1565) who wrote about actors' techniques and introduced the meneur de jeu in Italy. The actor-manager (meneur de jeu), a professional actor, who scholars have compared to the director (see Strihan), trained the actors. Nothing, however, indicates that the actor-manager was directing the visual representation of the text in the performance space. From the end of the sixteenth-century, the dramatic text began to dominate the process of the performance and led to an expansion of acting techniques, such as the declamation. Stage designers carne from outside the theatre tradition and played a decisive role in the staging of religious celebrations (e. g. Actes des Apotres, 1536). In the sixteenth-century, both the proscenium arch and the borders, incorporated in the architecture of the new indoor theatres (theatre a l'italienne), contributed to create all kinds of illusions on the stage, principally the revival of perspective. This chapter shows ongoing audience demands for more elaborate visual effects on the stage. This led, throughout the classical age, and even more so during the eighteenth-century, to grant the stage design practitioner a major role in the making of the performance (see Ciceri). The second chapter demonstrates that the guidance of the actors and the scenographic conception, which are the artistic components of the role of the director, appear to have developed independently from one another until the nineteenth-century. The third chapter investigates the emergence of the director per se. The causes for this have been considered by a number of scholars, who have mainly identified two: the influence of Naturalism (illustrated by the Meiningen Company, Antoine, and Stanislavski) and the invention of electric lighting. The influence of the Naturalist movement on the emergence of the modem director in the late nineteenth-century is often|$|R
