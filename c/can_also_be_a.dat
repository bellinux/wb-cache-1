5|$|Risk parity <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{generalized}} {{term that}} denotes {{a variety of}} investment systems and techniques that utilize its principles.

5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E

5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E

5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes <b>can</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
