5|$|A <b>clutch</b> {{consists}} of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean <b>clutch</b> sizes of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed {{only by the}} female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Females can lay five {{clutches}} per year, but two is {{a normal}} average after including the 30–50% of a population's females that do not produce any clutches in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one <b>clutch</b> per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per <b>clutch.</b> <b>Clutch</b> sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the two more southerly subspecies, southern (4.2) and eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.|$|E
40|$|Hydrodynamic <b>clutches</b> damp {{torsional}} vibrations. Both running-wheels, {{pump and}} turbine, correspond to two masses, which are coupled by fluid. The masses replace the double-mass-flywheel of passenger-cars. In {{the case of}} fuel cut-off in the overturn, hydrodynamic <b>clutches</b> {{can be used as}} a retarder. Compared to single dry plate <b>clutches,</b> hydrodynamic <b>clutches</b> transfer the power without wear. The present doctoral dissertation describes construction and experimental testing of two hydrodynamic <b>clutches.</b> The blades of one of the two running-wheels swing round radial axes. The angle of attack variates. The tests fhow higher efficiency compared to hydrodynamic <b>clutches</b> with axial movable blades. The designed hydrodynamic <b>clutches</b> offer substantial lower switching times than <b>clutches</b> with volumetric control. The diagram of a 100 kW-engine, lines of resistance of the belonging passenger-car and characteristic curves of the <b>clutches</b> show their stationary operating performance. (orig.)

5|$|Western jackdaws hatch asynchronously and {{incubation}} begins before <b>clutch</b> completion, {{which often}} leads {{to the death of}} the last-hatched young. If the supply of food is low, parental investment in the brood is kept to a minimum as little energy is wasted on feeding a chick that is unlikely to survive. Replacement clutches are very rarely laid in the event of <b>clutch</b> failure.|$|E

40|$|Position {{control devices}} enable precise selection, but {{significant}} <b>clutching</b> degrades performance. <b>Clutching</b> {{can be reduced}} with high control-display gain or pointer acceleration, but there are human and device limits. Elastic rate control eliminates <b>clutching</b> completely, but can make precise selection difficult. We show that hybrid position rate control can outperform position control by 20 % when there is significant <b>clutching,</b> even when using pointer acceleration.

5|$|Egg laying {{dates and}} <b>clutch</b> size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The <b>clutch</b> size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads may display {{multiple}} paternity. Multiple paternity {{is possible}} due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single <b>clutch</b> may {{have as many}} as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the <b>clutch.</b> Multiple paternity and female size are positively correlated. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher fecundity (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.|$|E
5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost or abandoned their previous <b>clutch,</b> replacement <b>clutch)</b> or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
40|$|In this research, the imposed {{forces on}} three muscles including: Gastrocnemius muscle, Trapezius muscle and Quadratus lumborum of the tractor drivers during <b>clutching</b> have been studied.

5|$|Multiple well {{preserved}} Macroolithus nests are known, representing M. rugustus and M. yaotunensis. A {{very well}} preserved <b>clutch</b> of M. yaotunensis contains 20 eggs arrayed in two, possibly three, circular layers. When complete this nest may have contained 40 or more eggs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>clutch</b> is {{typically}} {{three to five}} eggs (range two to six), which are usually whitish-buff or greenish-blue and are spotted with red, purple or brown. The average size of the egg is , and weighs , of which 6% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 12–15days, mainly by the female. The chicks are altricial and downy, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 14–16days after hatching. There are normally two broods, except in Siberia, where there is only one, the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second <b>clutch.</b> Sometimes the same nest is reused for both broods. The young are dependent on their parents for 15–20 days after fledging.|$|E

50|$|Introduction - Multiple disk <b>clutches</b> {{are used}} to deliver {{extremely}} high torque in a relatively small space. These <b>clutches</b> can be used dry or wet (oil bath). Running the <b>clutches</b> in an oil bath also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple speed gear boxes and machine tool applications.|$|R
30|$|S. invicta colonies were {{collected}} in the Zoological Experimental Station area of Santa Fe Province, Argentina, approximately 3  weeks before the caimans hatched. S. invicta individuals were placed in closed plastic trays and fed with glucose (a 20 % solution). We used caiman hatchlings from four different <b>clutches</b> harvested in the wild during the 2005 to 2006 season and six <b>clutches</b> each from the 2006 to 2007, 2007 to 2008, and 2008 to 2009 seasons. In the last season (2008 to 2009), we measured the effect on survival in six <b>clutches.</b> Only three of these <b>clutches</b> were used to measure subsequent growth, because blood was collected from the other three <b>clutches</b> for corticosterone determination, and this procedure could have affected growth due to stress (Lance and Elsey 1999). However, {{it is known that}} the bleeding process does not affect survival, so we used all caiman <b>clutches</b> (Sheriff et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} three {{different}} European populations showed a mean <b>clutch</b> size of 3.6 eggs, producing 2.6 chicks, of which 1.9 fledged. Adult survival rate varied from 83 to 92%, with no significant difference detected between males and females. Survival of first-year birds was, at 77%, {{lower than that of}} adults. The availability or otherwise of human food supplied from tourist activities did not affect breeding success.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern.

50|$|Introduction - Of all the {{electromagnetic}} <b>clutches,</b> the tooth <b>clutches</b> provide {{the greatest amount}} of torque in the smallest overall size. Because torque is transmitted without any slippage, <b>clutches</b> are ideal for multi stage machines where timing is critical such as multi-stage printing presses. Sometimes, exact timing needs to be kept, so tooth <b>clutches</b> can be made with a single position option which means that they will only engage at a specific degree mark. They can be used in dry or wet (oil bath) applications, so they are very well suited for gear box type drives.|$|R
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in <b>clutch</b> size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for their mates upon hearing their mates approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the <b>clutch</b> is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
