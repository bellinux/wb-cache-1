6000|$|Her dining-room was {{difficult}} for some time. She had equipped that with a dark oak Welsh dresser made very bright with a dessert service that was, in view of its extremely decorative quality, remarkably cheap, and with some very pretty silver-topped glass bottles and flasks. This dresser {{and a number of}} simple but shapely facsimiles of old chairs, stood out against a nearly primrose paper, very faintly patterned, and a dark blue carpet with a margin of dead black-stained wood. Over the mantel was a German <b>colour-print</b> of waves full of sunlight breaking under cliffs, and between this and the window were dark bookshelves and a few bright-coloured books. On the wall, black-framed, were four very good Japanese prints, rich in greenish-blues and blueish-greys that answered the floor, and the window curtains took up some of the colours of the German print. But something was needed towards the window, she felt, to balance the warmly shining plates upon the dresser. The deep rose-red of the cherries that adorned them was too isolated, usurped too dominating a value. And while this was weighing upon her mind she saw in a window in Regent Street a number of Bokhara hangings very nobly displayed. They were splendid pieces of needlework, particularly glorious in their crimsons and reds, and suddenly it came to her that {{it was just one of}} these, one that had great ruby flowers upon it with dead-blue interlacings, that was needed to weld her gay-coloured scheme together. She hesitated, went half-way to Piccadilly Circus, turned back and asked the prices. The prices were towering prices, ten, fifteen, eighteen guineas, and when at last the shopman produced one with all the charm of colour she sought at eight, it seemed like ten guineas snatched back as they dropped from her hands. And still hesitating, she had three that pleased her most sent home, [...] "on approval," [...] before she decided finally to purchase one of them. But the trial was conclusive. And then, struck with a sudden idea, she carried off a long narrow one she had had no idea of buying before into the little study behind. Suppose, she thought, instead of hanging two curtains as anybody else would do in that window, she ran this glory of rich colour across from one side on a great rod of brass.|$|E

40|$|Plasmonic colour {{printing}} has drawn wide attention as a promising {{candidate for the}} next-generation <b>colour-printing</b> technology. However, an efficient approach to realize full colour and scalable fabrication is still lacking, which prevents plasmonic {{colour printing}} from practical applications. Here we present a scalable and full-colour plasmonic printing approach by combining conjugate twin-phase modulation with a plasmonic broadband absorber. More importantly, our approach also demonstrates controllable chromotropic capability, that is, the ability of reversible colour transformations. This chromotropic capability affords enormous potentials in building functionalized prints for anticounterfeiting, special label, and high-density data encryption storage. With such excellent performances in functional colour applications, this <b>colour-printing</b> approach could {{pave the way for}} plasmonic colour printing in real-world commercial utilization...|$|R

5000|$|When {{describing}} prints [...] "hand-coloured" [...] {{means that}} a monochrome print has been painted afterwards. This is to be distinguished from [...] "colour-printed" [...] {{which means that the}} printing itself was in colour. Colour printing could be produced either by painting the plate carefully with differently coloured inks and then making a single pressing, or by making a number of plates, engraved appropriately for each colour, and making sequential impressions. These techniques may be combined together in a single illustration. An example of the British 1788 edition of Animals is described as having [...] "hand-coloured aquatint plates by and after Catton, heightened with white and gum arabic." [...] meaning that the illustrations were coloured afterwards and the reference to gum arabic further suggests that this what is meant. According to Baynton-Williams (1990) [...] "Despite the fact that stipple engraving and mezzotints were being printed in colours at the time aquatinting started, it was some time before aquatints were <b>colour-printed.</b> James Molton first published a series of views titled Picturesque Views of the City of Dublin in 1795, printed in monotone, but there is a colour version printed in 1798, which is probably the first colour aquatint book." ...|$|R
5000|$|Crane was {{the second}} son of Thomas Crane, a {{portrait}} painter and miniaturist, and Marie Crane (née Kearsley), {{the daughter of a}} prosperous malt-maker. His older brother Thomas would also go into illustration, and sister Lucy a noted writer. He was a fluent follower of the newer art movements and he came to study and appreciate the detailed senses of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was also a diligent student of the renowned artist and critic John Ruskin. A set of coloured page designs to illustrate Tennyson's [...] "Lady of Shalott" [...] gained the approval of wood-engraver William James Linton to whom Walter Crane was apprenticed for three years in 1859-62. As a wood-engraver he had abundant opportunity for the minute study of the contemporary artists whose work passed through his hands, of Pre-Raphaelites Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais, as well as Alice in Wonderland illustrator Sir John Tenniel and Frederick Sandys. He was a student who admired the masters of the Italian Renaissance, however he was more influenced by the Elgin marbles in the British Museum. A further and important element in the development of his talent was the study of Japanese <b>colour-prints,</b> the methods of which he imitated in a series of toy books, which started a new fashion.|$|R
6000|$|This Mr. Thomas Miller wrote {{abundant}} {{flowers of}} language in his book, and the plates were coloured by hand. By the bye, what a blessed thing <b>colour-printing</b> is! These hand-tinted plates, to an imaginative person, are about as distressing as any plates can very well be. Whenever I look at these triumphs of art over the beauties of nature, with all their weary dabs of crimson, green, blue, and yellow, I think of wretched, anæmic girls fading their youth away in some dismal attic over a publisher's, toiling through the whole edition tint by tint, and being mocked the while by Mr. Miller's alliterative erotics. And they are erotics! In one place he writes, [...] "Beautiful art thou, O Broom! on the breezy bosom of the bee-haunted heath"; and throughout he buds and blossoms into similar delights. He wallows in doves and coy toyings and modest blushes, and bowers and meads. He always adds, [...] "Wonderful boy!" [...] to Chatterton's name {{as if it were}} a university degree (W.B.), and he invariably refers to Moore as the Bard of Erin, and to Milton as the Bard of Paradise--though Bard of the Bottomless Pit would be more appropriate. However, we are not concerned with Mr. Miller's language so much as with a very fruitful suggestion he throws out, that [...] "it is surely worth while to trace a resemblance between the flower and the emblem it represents" [...] (a turn like that is nothing to Mr. Miller) [...] "which shall at least have some show of reason in it." ...|$|R
40|$|My {{work has}} {{continuously}} explored issues {{of place and}} the built environment. Nummianus focuses on the Greater Manchester area and displays entire estates of empty, boarded-up terraced houses. The economic downturn and an exodus of residents have resulted in extreme devaluation: unable to sell their homes, some inhabitants are forced to remain in this area in a downward spiral of social exclusion. The series raises issues of displacement {{and the collapse of}} a community. Background research included studying social and architectural history, liaising with local councils and following housing debates. Photographic research involved experimentation with over-exposure, exploration of special tones produced in hand-based <b>colour-printing,</b> and development experiments to achieve the required red tone. In total the project took two years: the photographing took nine months, since particular weather conditions and empty streets were key to the images. The series consists of large hand-printed colour photographs that present the particular street through the juxtaposition of individual images: each house is individually photographed and framed. Nummianus is intended as a contemporary frieze, following a format used by the Romans and Greeks, displaying narrative as a sequence. The photos highlight the houses' red-coloured façades, referencing Pompeii-red, the colour signalling wealth found {{on the walls of the}} excavated city. Nummianus refers to the name of a trader inscribed on a Pompeii house: it derives from the word 'nummus' which means money or coin. The series comments on the area's former wealth, diversity and livelihood through the reference to Pompeii, while suggesting both the fragility and resilience of life. As a result of Nummianus I was awarded the 2008 German New Talent Award for the most promising young photographic artist. Nummianus will be included in the forthcoming book Art and Home: Comfort, Alienation and the Everyday by Imogen Racz (IB Tauris, 2014) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} review on galaxy black hole co-evolution through merger, star {{formation}} and AGN-jet feedback. We highlight results on transitional galaxies (e. g. NGC 1482, NGC 6764, NGC 3801, Speca, RAD- 18 etc.) which has data from Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and other sub-mm, IR, optical, UV and X-ray telescopes. The `smoking gun' relic-evidences of past AGN-jet feedback which {{is believed to}} have quenched star formation in transitional galaxies are still missing. Relic radio lobes, as old as a few hundred Myr, can be best detected at low radio frequencies with the GMRT, LOFAR and in future SKA. However, similar relic evidences of quasar activities, known as `Hanny's Voorwerp' discovered by Galaxy Zoo in optical data, are only around a few tens of thousand years old. More discoveries are needed to match these time-scales with time since the decline of star formation in transitional galaxies. Such faint fuzzy relic emissions in optical and angular-scale sensitive radio interferometric images can be discovered most efficiently by citizen-scientists but with a formal training. We describe RAD@home, the only Indian citizen-science research project in astronomy which takes such a modified approach. We present interesting objects, discovered from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey (TGSS) by 69 trained citizen-scientists or e-astronomers, like relic radio lobes, episodic radio galaxies, jet-galaxy interaction, bent radio galaxy in filament etc [...] This model can provide an equal opportunity of academic-growth to people even in the under-developed regions where we always need to establish our optical and radio telescopes. This can expand the research-activity of city-based research-institutes beyond their four brick walls, and alleviate various socio-economic and geo-political constraints on growth of citizens located in remote areas. #RADatHomeIndia #ABCDresearchComment: To appear in Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy (JOAA) special issue on "Science with the SKA: an Indian perspective".

Marjorie, with her innate hunger for good fine things, with her quite insufficient pocket-money, and the irregular habits of expenditure a spasmodically financed, hard-up home is apt to engender, fell very readily into this new, delightful custom of having it put down (whatever it happened to be).
