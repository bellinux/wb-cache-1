5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial <b>communications</b> <b>port</b> is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E
2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital <b>communications</b> <b>port</b> to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of advanced meters in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues {{that may affect}} ordinary customers. [...] These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. [...] Some meters {{have one or two}} IR LEDs on the front - one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR <b>communications</b> <b>port</b> for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples' possessions and behavior. [...] For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods. [...] Nonintrusive load monitoring gives even more detail about what appliances people have and their living and use patterns.|$|E

50|$|There {{is also a}} {{requirement}} under the European Average Weight System that data collected by checkweighers is archived and is available for inspection. Most modern checkweighers are therefore equipped with <b>communications</b> <b>ports</b> to enable the actual pack weights and derived data to be uploaded to a host computer. This data {{can also be used}} for management information enabling processes to be fine-tuned and production performance monitored.|$|R
50|$|The {{communication}} system allows for player-created channels which support access lists, password protection, and player ownership. Unused channels tend to self-delete due to inactivity, {{but there are}} several channels owned by Dentin and other gods which have been granted permanence. There is a <b>communications</b> <b>port</b> (port 3011) that shows only communication, which is useful for displaying channel sends {{that may have been}} missed by the player if they are heavily spammed. The recent addition of the 'replay' command and client channel windows provides another way to separate communication from real-time game information.|$|E
50|$|The Game Boy Color (also {{referred}} to as GBC or CGB) is Nintendo's successor to the Game Boy and was released on October 21, 1998, in Japan and in November {{of the same year}} in the United States.

40|$|The {{communications}} link {{in a space}} program is a crucial point for upgrading its performance by handling data between spacecraft bus and payloads, because spacecraft’s missions {{are related to the}} data handling mechanism using <b>communications</b> <b>ports</b> such as a controlled area network bus (CAN Bus) and a universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter (UART). The NEXTSat- 1 has a lot of <b>communications</b> <b>ports</b> for performing science and technology missions. However, the top level system requirements for the NEXTSat- 1 are mass and volume limitations. Normally, the communications for units shall be conducted by using point to point link which require more mass and volume to interconnect. Thus, our approach for the novel {{communications link}} in the NEXTSat- 1 program is to use CAN and serializer and deserializer low voltage differential signal (SerDesLVDS) to meet the system requirements of mass and volume. The CAN Bus and SerDesLVDS were confirmed by using already defined communications link for our missions in the NEXTSat- 1 program and the analysis results were reported in this study in view of data flow and size analysis...|$|R

From the interface, CDRs are collected on computer systems running call logging and analysis software. Some PBX manufacturers provide their own basic call logging software but many other third-party software packages are available.|$|E
50|$|The first Palms, the Pilot 1000 and Pilot 5000, had no {{infrared}} port, backlight, or flash memory, but {{did have}} a serial <b>communications</b> <b>port.</b> Their RAM size was 128 kB and 512 kB respectively, and they used version 1 of Palm OS. Later, it became possible to upgrade the Pilot 1000 or 5000's internals to up to 1 MB of internal RAM. This {{was done with the}} purchase of an upgrade module sold by Palm, and the replacement of some internal hardware components. Originally, it was conceived that all Palm PDAs were to be hardware-upgradable to an extent, but ultimately, this capability gave way to external memory slots and firmware-upgradable flash memory after the Palm III series.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the CODA framework for modelling and refinement of component-based embedded systems. CODA is an extension of Event-B and UML-B and is supported by a plug-in for the Rodin toolset.
