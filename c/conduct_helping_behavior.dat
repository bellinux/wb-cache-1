40|$|The present {{research}} established three objectives in examining <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> in organizations. First, a need was identified {{to focus on}} a broader range of <b>helping</b> <b>behaviors</b> than previous organizational research has typically focused on. Second, a need was identified to examine a comprehensive model of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> in organizations which included antecedents from across several of the helping literatures. Finally, a need to examine a cross-level model of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> in organizations, including both individual-level and group-level antecedents, was identified. Two hypothesized models were developed, one including the antecedents of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> directed toward coworkers and one including the antecedents of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> directed toward the supervisor. ^ A measure capturing a broad conceptualization of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> in organizations was developed and the models were tested using management teams in a freight delivery firm. The cross-level models were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results from the model of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> directed toward coworkers supported the effects of the group, with both group size and proximity to coworkers being significantly related to <b>helping</b> <b>behavior.</b> No individual-level antecedents were found to have significant effects on <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> directed toward coworkers. The results from the model of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> directed toward the supervisor supported the role of both the individual and the group. Specifically, the supervisor played an instrumental role both through the quality of the exchange relationship, an individual-level process, and through the leader 2 ̆ 7 s positive mood, a group-level or contextual effect. Implications for the study of <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> are discussed including the need {{to focus on a}} broader range of <b>helping</b> <b>behaviors</b> and the need to consider the helping process and its antecedents from a multiple-level perspective. ...|$|R

We employed multi-wave data collected from 1, 064 employees in 107 work teams over a three-year period to test the multi-level effects of PJ on <b>helping</b> <b>behavior.</b> Results of the multi-level analysis showed that PJ climate enhances <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> by two intervening processes, namely, the group-level coworker trust climate and individual-level organizational commitment. Moreover, the level and strength of PJ climate served as cross-level moderators that amplify the individual-level effect of PJ perceptions on <b>helping</b> <b>behavior.</b> By employing a three-wave time-lagged design, this study demonstrated the interplay between PJ perceptions and PJ climate, which induced changes in the <b>helping</b> <b>behavior</b> of group members by multi-level mediating and moderating processes that unfold over a substantial period of time.
