5000|$|H∞ (i.e. [...] "H-infinity") {{methods are}} used in control theory to {{synthesize}} controllers to achieve stabilization with guaranteed performance. To use H∞ methods, a <b>control</b> <b>designer</b> expresses the control problem as a mathematical optimization problem and then finds the controller that solves this optimization. H∞ techniques have the advantage over classical control techniques {{in that they are}} readily applicable to problems involving multivariate systems with cross-coupling between channels; disadvantages of H∞ techniques include the level of mathematical understanding needed to apply them successfully and the need for a reasonably good model of the system to be controlled. It {{is important to keep in}} mind that the resulting controller is only optimal with respect to the prescribed cost function and does not necessarily represent the best controller in terms of the usual performance measures used to evaluate controllers such as settling time, energy expended, etc. Also, non-linear constraints such as saturation are generally not well-handled. These methods were introduced into control theory in the late 1970s-early 1980sby George Zames (sensitivity minimization), J. William Helton (broadband matching),and Allen Tannenbaum (gain margin optimization).|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Currently, rail <b>control</b> <b>designers</b> {{are looking}} for {{innovative}} types of control strategies {{in order to make}} rail infrastructures more robust, more reliable, and more efficient. <b>Control</b> <b>designers</b> are focusing on more flexible control strategies {{in order to keep the}} system performance stable when non planned situations occurs. Applying new control strategies to rail infrastructures is difficult, because strategies cannot be fully assessed for their quality before implementation. Existing testing tools normally only assess the strategy itself and do not consider its impact on the whole system, nor do they assess the impact of the system on the strategy. This issue was confirmed during an inductive case study performed at a Dutch transportation company. To tackle this problem, a simulation based environment is proposed to better assess control strategies for rail infrastructures...|$|R

Axial metrics highlight acceleration and deceleration capabilities under different flight loads and include specific excess power measurements to characterize energy meneuverability.

40|$|Designing {{control for}} rail {{infrastructures}} is a challenging task. Many aspects influence the system performance {{and have to}} be taken into account, such as physical layout of the network, vehicle types, expected passenger movements, control system characteristics and safety measures. <b>Control</b> <b>designers</b> have to test different combination of these aspects, by varying the configuration possibilities and analyze how the system will operate. Existing tools do not support the full assessment of control strategies before implementation. Normally, control strategies are tested in an isolated manner and control decisions are usually made based on employee’s experiences and on results of historical data analyses. Although these methods are of importance, they should not be the main basis for decisions. The disadvantage of data analyses is that they might lead to wrong decisions, if the analyzed data set is related to a part of the infrastructure where different control strategies were in use before. The employees’ expertise should be complemented with IT support, as the complexity of control design grows accordingly {{to the size of the}} infrastructure and the number of aspects that can vary.
