50|$|Thomas Whitty (1713-1792) was an English carpet {{manufacturer}} {{who founded}} <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpets</b> in 1755.|$|R
50|$|Whitty's carpets, looking {{much like}} horizontal-tapestries, became the {{benchmark}} for wealthy aristocrats {{to have in}} their country homes and town houses, between 1755 and 1835. The company produced <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpets</b> for: the music room of the Royal Pavilion, Brighton; Chatsworth House; Powderham Castle; Saltram House; and Warwick Castle. King George III and Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz purchased <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpets</b> and also visited the factory.|$|R
50|$|Today, <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpets</b> is {{the only}} {{manufacturer}} to purchase, wash, card, spin and dye its own yarn before weaving the carpet itself.|$|R
5000|$|There were woollen {{mills in}} the village, {{powered by the}} River Dart. A large mill was taken over in the 1950s by <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpets.</b> When the company went into {{administration}} in 2013 the Abbey acquired the Mill premises.|$|R

25|$|<b>Axminster</b> <b>carpet</b> {{has three}} main types of {{broadloom}} carpet construction {{in use today}} (machine woven, tufted & hand knotted). Machine woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years and woven <b>Axminster</b> and Wilton <b>carpets</b> are still extremely popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are {{a big part of}} the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.|$|R
50|$|Every Wetherspoon pub has {{a unique}} carpet, drawing on the location, {{building}} and name. They are produced by <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpets</b> and, having {{more than the usual}} six colours, have to be partially handmade on old fashioned looms, costing up to Â£30,000 - twice as much as stock designs.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed and}} built as a carpet factory for James Templeton and Son, for the manufacture of Templeton's patented spool <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpets.</b> After repeated design proposals had been rejected by Glasgow Corporation, James Templeton hired the famous architect William Leiper to produce a design that would be so grand it {{could not possibly be}} rejected, so William Leiper modelled the building on the Doge's Palace in Venice.|$|R
50|$|Old engravings, {{photographs}} and stereographs show {{a succession of}} ornate printed wall and ceiling papers, highly figured <b>axminster</b> <b>carpets,</b> and ornate gas lighting fixtures. During the administration of Theodore Roosevelt this room was greatly simplified {{as a part of}} an overall refurbishment of the house directed by Charles Follen McKim. Victorian decoration was removed, and the underlying wood floor was exposed. Low bookcases were constructed, and the room began use as the president's in-residence study.|$|R

2500|$|A {{reception}} {{area for the}} restaurant was added in the foyer of the B-Deck aft Grand Staircase on Titanic, which did not exist on Olympic, and the main reception room on D-Deck was also slightly enlarged. [...] private promenade decks {{were added to the}} two luxury parlour suites on B-Deck on Titanic, as well as additional First-Class gangway entrances on B-Deck. Cosmetic differences also existed between the two ships, most noticeably concerning the wider use of <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpeting</b> in Titanics public rooms, as opposed to the more durable linoleum flooring on Olympic.|$|R
5000|$|In 1800, {{the company}} made a 74 x 52 ft carpet for Mahmud II, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, known today as the most famous <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpet</b> of all.

2500|$|Cleveland's successor, Benjamin Harrison, {{refurbished}} {{most of the}} State Floor rooms {{again in}} 1891 after the White House was wired for electricity. W. H. Post & Co. of Hartford, Connecticut, did the work. The ceiling was repainted, the wallpaper replaced, and new silk damask curtains installed. The furniture in the East Room was reupholstered as well in a gold brocatelle (a brocade with the design in high relief). A new <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpet,</b> [...] in size, was also laid down.

50|$|Whitty was {{impressed}} by a large Turkish carpet he saw at Cheapside Market in London, and upon his return to Axminster he used his skills as a weaver to work out how to produce a product of similar quality. After several months work he completed his first carpet on midsummer's day 1755. His carpets were then chosen by wealthy aristocrats to have in their English country homes and town houses. <b>Axminster</b> <b>Carpets</b> were produced for the music room of the Brighton Royal Pavilion, Saltram House, Warwick Castle, Chatsworth House and in 1800 for the Sultan of Turkey.|$|R
50|$|The most seriously damaged rooms {{had largely}} been emptied of their {{valuable}} contents the previous day, and some paintings were on loan to a travelling exhibition. Items from the Royal Collection lost include the Sir William Beechey equestrian portrait George III and the Prince of Wales Reviewing Troops, which at 13 feet (4 m) by 16 feet (5 m) was {{too large to}} remove; an 18-foot (5.5 m) long 1820s sideboard by Morel and Seddon; several items of porcelain; several chandeliers; the Willis organ; and the 1851 Great Exhibition <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpet</b> was partly burnt. Peter Brooke, then Secretary of State for National Heritage, called the fire a national disaster.|$|R
50|$|By the 17th century, weaving {{had become}} a large trade, and the carpet {{industry}} began in 1741, when two French weavers were brought in by Earl Henry Herbert of Pembroke to teach the local people new skills. Carpet weaving prospered until 1815, when peace following the Napoleonic Wars introduced European competition. Machinery to produce <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpets</b> was installed in 1835. The Wilton Royal Carpet Factory was founded {{at the turn of}} the century, with the help of the then Lord Pembroke, to rescue the previous carpet factory that had fallen into financial difficulty. The carpet factory continued to operate until 1995, when it closed temporarily after a takeover. The factory re-opened, although it was unable to retain the Wilton Royal prefix.|$|R

2500|$|... was {{a unique}} floor {{covering}} made originally in a factory founded at Axminster, Devon, England, in 1755 by the cloth weaver Thomas Whitty. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpets</b> were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woolen warps and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced {{at the same time}} in Exeter and in the Moorfields section of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made <b>carpeting.</b> The name <b>Axminster,</b> however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille.|$|R
50|$|The Reception Room was {{decorated}} in richly carved mahogany Jacobean-style paneling painted a glossy white. Furnished with comfortable wicker chairs and Chesterfields upholstered in green damask silk, the room {{would have been}} conspicuously light and airy because of the beautifully illuminated leaded-glass windows which ran along {{either side of the}} room. These were lit naturally during the day through portholes concealed behind the windows and electrically in the evening. In contrast to the linoleum floors on the Olympic, the Titanics Reception Room was covered with plush <b>Axminster</b> <b>carpeting</b> and there were potted palms in built-in holders in the corners of the alcoves. An imposing Aubusson tapestry, La Chasse du duc de Guise, hung in front of the staircase. On the wall close to the tapestry were letters indicating the name of the deck.|$|R
