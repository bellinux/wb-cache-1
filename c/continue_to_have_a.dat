5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> high training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E
5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national sales company. Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> subtle {{role in shaping the}} real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E

5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate {{a substantial amount of}} international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> positive effect on local businesses and tourism.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, an {{addition}} 15 units were ordered by Oslo, with {{an option for}} further orders later. This will allow all the eastern lines to have a 7.5-minute headway on their services into the city center, instead of the current 15-minute headway. Trains would start using the balloon loop located at Stortinget, and the western lines will <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 15-minute headway. At the same time, the trains serving the Ring Line will be extended to six cars. The order cost NOK675 million. In addition, Akershus finalized their order for five units, costing NOK240 million. Unlike the Oslo-owned units, Akershus' five units will be owned by the transit authority Ruter. The same year, the city council in Oslo decided to upgrade the Holmenkoll Line to metro standard, to allow six-car MX3000 trains {{to be the main}} mode of transport to Holmenkollen during the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. This allowed 9,000people per hour to be transported to the sports venue. In 2009, the T2000 units were taken out of service, and on 22 April 2010 the last T1300 was taken out of service, making the MX3000 the only units to be used on the Oslo Metro. The city council was considering ordering 15 additional MX3000 to replace the T2000, as an alternative for a NOK50-million renovation.|$|E
5|$|In {{that same}} year, Edmund Grey, {{the son of}} a Marick family maid and gardener, returns to town to see his {{childhood}} friend, Angelique. Dimitri is furious to see Edmund again since he had stolen money from Dimitri's father to pay for his education. Dimitri is stunned when Edmund informs him that they are half-brothers. Edmund had discovered this when he found a will of Hugo Marick that states he is not only his illegitimate son, but that he is the lawful heir to Wildwind. Helga had planted the will because she believed Dimitri was going to leave Angelique for Erica. When Dimitri assures Helga he will stay with Angelique, she destroys the will {{in order to keep the}} estate for her daughter. Edmund accuses Dimitri of stealing the will and files a lawsuit to have Hugo's body exhumed in order to perform a DNA test. Dimitri believes Edmund is lying about everything and is infuriated by the lawsuit. The hatred between the two deepens even more. Eventually, the truth about what Helga did is revealed and she dies. Dimitri and Edmund agree to put the past behind them and they bond as brothers. They develop an extremely close and loving relationship, but they also <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> standing rivalry.|$|E

25|$|The {{successor}} {{states of}} Yugoslavia <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> population growth rate that {{is close to}} zero or negative. This is mostly due to emigration, which intensified {{during and after the}} Yugoslav Wars, during the 1990s to 2000s. More than 2.5 million refugees were created by the fighting in Bosnia and Kosovo, which led to a massive surge in North American immigration. Close to 120,000 refugees from the former Yugoslavia were registered in the United States from 1991 to 2002, and 67,000 migrants from the former Yugoslavia were registered in Canada between 1991 and 2001.|$|E
25|$|That {{a goddess}} evoked in war and for {{political}} reasons receive the homage of women and that women <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> role in her cult is explained by Palmer as a foreign cult of feminine sexuality of Etruscan derivation. The persistence of a female presence in her cult through the centuries down to the lectisternium of 217 BC, when the matronae collected money for the service, and to the times of Augustus during the ludi saeculares in the sacrifices to Capitoline Juno are proof of the resilience of this foreign tradition.|$|E

25|$|The Hindu {{personal}} laws of 1956 (applying to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jains) gave women {{rights to}} inheritances. However, sons had an independent {{share in the}} ancestral property, while the daughters' shares {{were based on the}} share received by their father. Hence, a father could effectively disinherit a daughter by renouncing his share of the ancestral property, but a son would <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> share in his own right. Additionally, married daughters, even those facing marital harassment, had no residential rights in the ancestral home. Thanks to amendment of the Hindu laws in 2005, women now have the same status as men.|$|E
25|$|Race is {{a concept}} used in the {{categorization}} of humans into groups, called races or racial groups, based on combinations of shared physical traits, ancestry, genetics, and social or cultural traits. Although such groupings lack a firm basis in modern biology, they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong influence over contemporary social relations. First {{used to refer to}} speakers of a common language and then to denote national affiliations, by the 17th century race began to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits. The term was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense, starting from the 19th century, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.|$|E

Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.|$|E
