It looks at the interrelation between the Consumer Sales and Guarantee Directive (CSD) and the Ecodesign Directive (EDD) with respect to guarantees and product expected lifetime. Through legal research and stakeholder surveys, it develops an EU lifespan guarantee model, which could be implemented by amendments to the proposal for an Online Sales Directive (OSD) and the EDD. It recommends extending the EDD to include the lifespan and extending the limitation period of the OSD. A <b>commercial</b> <b>guarantee</b> for the lifespan of a product is also suggested...|$|E
30|$|The {{question}} of the insufficiencies of collateral, credit information, and economic benefits of SME loans, {{as well as political}} risks associated with SME credit, are the four main obstructions for China’s SMEs financing market (Yibin 2003). A <b>commercial</b> <b>guarantee</b> company was the first to appear in Guangdong in 1994, which established a provincial and municipal level of a government-sponsored credit guarantee agency in 1999. With support and encouragement from the central government, China’s credit guarantee schemes have been an important means for local government to ensure credit for high-tech enterprises. However, the function of the credit guarantee schemes was difficult to implement, as the intervention of local government lacked sound prudential supervision.|$|E

We derived and explained the surviving rule of different types of guarantee companies, and we further conclude the condition in which guarantee companies are likely to be involved in a moral hazard problem. We conclude that, in the presence of regulatory arbitrage opportunity, the guarantee company has incentive to switch its role from bank agent to the borrower, being a second-hand lender. When the macroeconomic risk is high, the switching of this role will transfer the risk back to the banks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Passage time densities {{are useful}} {{performance}} measurements in stoch-astic systems. With them the modeller can extract probabilistic quality-of-service guarantees such as: {{the probability that}} the time taken for a network header packetto travel across a heterogeneous network is less than 10 ms must be at least 0. 95. In this paper, we show how new tools can extract passage time densities and dis-tributions from stochastic models defined in PEPA, a stochastic process algebra. In stochastic process algebras, the synchronisation policy is important for defin-ing how different system components interact. We also show how these passage time results can vary according to which synchronisation strategy is used. Wecompare results from two popular strategies. 1 Introduction Probabilistic quality-of-service <b>guarantees</b> underpin most <b>commercial</b> SLAs (servicelevel agreements) : e. g. the probability that a 10 -node cluster should be able to process 3000 database transactions in less than 6 seconds should be greater than 0. 915; or atrain service should not run more than 10 minutes late more than 20 % of the time. Whether these <b>commercial</b> <b>guarantees</b> are met or broken depends on the aggregate timebehaviour across a whole system of complex interactions. It is frequently useful to model these systems with a process model and still furtherconvenient to let individual process actions have random delay: this random delay might represent either incomplete or uncertain knowledge {{on the part of the}} modeller, or...|$|R

40|$|In {{the modern}} <b>commercial</b> world <b>guarantees</b> {{have become an}} {{important}} instrument. Guarantees {{are not limited to}} those given by a bank in the <b>commercial</b> world. <b>Guarantees</b> may also be issued by a parent company on behalf of a subsidiary, or by an individual(s) in personal transactions. The question then is what is a contract of guarantee? A guarantee is an assurance or security issued by one party (the guarantor) {{at the request of the}} party with the liability (the principal) to the party the liability is owed to (the beneficiary). Guarantees are discussed in this paper in the context of bank issued guarantees in shipbuilding contract. In shipbuilding contracts there are two types of guarantees issued – (i) refund guarantees, and (ii) payment guarantees. When payment is due under a guarantee, irrespective of if it is a refund guarantee or a payment guarantee, is dependent upon if it is a traditional guarantee type, or an on-demand bond type. The aim of this thesis is to examine the distinction between the true guarantee type and the on-demand bond type under English law. At the same time the objective of this thesis is to analyse the legal literature and the English common law cases to understand how a refund guarantee issued in shipbuilding contracts is conceived by the English courts to be either an on-demand bond or true guarantee. What are true guarantees and on-demand bonds? What are the distinguishing characteristics of each type of guarantee...|$|R

The possibility to validate protocol interfaces is extremely useful in many industrial design flows and the proposed methodology does not impose particular requirements and it is able to fit in existing design flows: the proposed approach is based on coupling a commercial simulator with a genetic algorithm that tries to disprove the equivalence of an implementation with its high-level prototype. The use of a <b>commercial</b> simulator <b>guarantees</b> a complete compatibility with current standards and the method is able to fit painlessly in an existing industrial flow. Moreover, the use of a genetic algorithm allows the analysis of large and realistic designs. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effectively able to deal with realistic designs, discovering potential problems, and, although approximate in nature, it is able to provide a high degree of confidence in the result...|$|R
