40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} sources {{in the course of}} the energy transition is accompanied by grid decentralization and fluctuating power feed-in characteristics. This raises new challenges for power system stability and design. We intend to investigate power system stability from the viewpoint of self-organized synchronization aspects. In this approach, the power grid is represented by a network of synchronous machines. We supplement the classical Kuramoto-like network model, which assumes constant voltages, with dynamical voltage equations, and thus obtain an extended version, that incorporates the coupled <b>categories</b> <b>voltage</b> stability and rotor angle synchronization. We compare disturbance scenarios in small systems simulated on the basis of both classical and extended model and we discuss resultant implications and possible applications to complex modern power grids.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) for intracellular electro-manipulation experiments implies {{the application of}} extremely short (ns) high intensity (MV/m) electric field pulses.

40|$|Matrix {{converter}} {{belongs to}} direct frequency converter <b>category.</b> Output <b>voltage</b> {{is made by}} direct switching of input phases to output phases. This fact means that converter does not need DC-link capacitor which increases the costs and volume requirements of the converter. The absence of DC-link capacitor {{is one of the}} main advantages of the matrix converter. On the other hand it means that the output voltage amplitude is limited by 86. 6 % of the input voltage amplitude. Higher voltages can be achieved with overmodulation, which causes input current distortion. The other advantages of the converter compared to conventional indirect frequency converter are: power factor regulation, operation in all four quadrants, its high dynamic, sinusoidal current consumption, nearly sinusoidal output voltage waveform with low harmonic content, and high efficiency. To the main disadvantages belongs: amount of semiconductor devices, limited output voltage amplitude, and complicated control algorithm. The new prototype of the matrix converter equipped with modern sophisticated components (FPGA, one desk PC, etc.) in the converter’s control part is being developed. Modulator of the converter is going to be realized in Field Programmable Gate Array. The hardware protection circuits against over voltage and current overload are going to be evaluated directly in the FPGA, therefore the reaction time of the control algorithm to the possible failure will be much shorter...|$|R
40|$|Canadian {{electric}} power utilities have been collecting and processing transmission equipment reliability data {{as part of}} the Canadian Electrical Association Equipment Reliability Information System (CEA-ERIS) since 1978. Eight concurrent annual reports have been produced each covering a five year period.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} to efficiently estimate the substrate noise generated by large scale aggressor circuits. Small spatial voltage differences within the ground distribution network of an aggressor circuit are exploited {{to reduce the}} overall number of input ports before the substrate extraction process. Specifically, the substrate of an aggressor circuit is partitioned into voltage domains where each domain is represented by a single substrate contact. The remaining ports of the substrate within that domain are ignored to reduce the computational complexity. A linear time algorithm is developed to identify these voltage domains and generate an equivalent contact. A reduction of more than four orders of magnitude in the number of extracted substrate resistances is demonstrated while introducing 20 % error in the peak-to-peak value of the substrate noise <b>voltage.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors B. 7. m [Integrated Circuits]: Miscellaneous—Mixed signal circuits, substrate coupling noise, noise analysi...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} an ever-growing demand for {{low-power}} mixed signal integrated circuits for such applications as mobile or wired communications and other portable systems. In these applications, the supply voltage is being scaled down to reduce overall power consumption. As for the fabrication process, digital CMOS is always the preferred technology due to its efficient economic costs. As a result, contemporary analog circuits must not only operate with low supply voltages, but should also be realizable in typical digital CMOS processes. However, this concession leads to significant performance degradation of the analog circuits. Since op amps are the most critical building blocks in all analog systems, {{the objective of this}} report is to study the theory and design of low voltage op amps for digital CMOS processes. Two <b>categories</b> of low <b>voltage</b> op amps have been identified as being suitable for low voltage applications [1]. The first category operates with 2 - 3 V power supplies.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} one of the most {{important}} disturbances that affect the quality of the electrical supply. Voltage sags cause industrial processes malfunction, producing an enormous economical impact. A voltage sag is defined as a short duration reduction of the rms voltage. A voltage disturbance is in general considered as a sag when the rms voltage remains below 90 % of nominal voltage for a period not exceeding 3 minutes, however, there is not full agreement about these limits. A comprehensive literature review on power quality and voltage sags is included in this thesis. A voltage sag characterisation method based on instantaneous voltages and phasor analysis is introduced. Through the analysis of the voltage phasor the sag magnitude, the phase-angle jump and the event duration are obtained. A new method for the sag classification of unbalanced sags into ABC <b>categories</b> using instantaneous <b>voltages</b> is proposed. The presentation of the voltage sag characteristics is also important for the understanding of the event. Several methods for the presentation of sag characteristics are described. Besides the usual rms voltage vs. time and phase angle vs. time representation, a new method based on the phasor locus, extreme phasors, and a set of phasor snapshots is proposed. The system performance is assessed through sag indices such as voltage sag frequency. The indices are obtained from measurements and a deterministic method combined with two simulation tools: a time-domain simulation program and a short-circuit calculation program. Both approaches are very suitable to simulate voltage sags. The choice for one of the approaches should be based on the goals of the study and the availability of system data. The system performance is also assessed by stochastic simulation using the method of fault positions. The performance of some selected buses is estimated and compared to the actual one obtained from a voltage sag survey. The strengths and shortcomings of the method of fault positions are discussed. The sensitivity of the method is analysed in terms of variations of the fault rate, fault type distribution, and fault position. The location of the source of voltage sags is estimated considering two network regions: upstream and downstream to a certain monitored bus. Several methods using voltage and current information are investigated and their performances are compared. A new method using only sag magnitude is introduced. The method is successfully applied in a simulated case study and verified by data obtained during a sag survey. The method shows its strength when applied in a sag survey where only voltage information is available...|$|R
