In a separate scene, Agent Jessup is shown working at a computer, annotating an image of the creature from The Transformation with biblical verses, notably from the Book of Revelation. The final scene reveals that Charlie is actually the shapeshifter, who disposes of the real agent's body in a furnace beneath the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits <b>can</b> <b>justify.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 'Nick', Matty is re-enlisted at Roundview, but his {{relationship}} with Liv causes a new love triangle to form—between him, Liv and Franky. Having lost both Mini and Liv, and now living in Matty's shadow, Nick has a nervous breakdown and smashes up his house with a golf club. Through Matty, however, Nick comes to see his father Leon (Dorian Lough) and his parenting in a more negative light and the two brothers take a stand. In his episode, Alo's parents take him out of sixth form {{to work on the}} farm, and after he causes an explosion they sell all of his belongings. In protest, he throws a massive party and when he confronts his parents, his father suffers a heart attack. Rather than burden his friend Rich, who has just proudly had sex {{for the first time with}} Grace, he goes home and attempts to repair things with his parents. In 'Grace', Grace introduces Rich to her parents; Rich is shocked to discover that her father is headmaster David Blood (Addison). Blood schemes to have Grace's grades slip on her drama assessment, a staging of 'Twelfth Night', so that he <b>can</b> <b>justify</b> removing her from Roundview. Grace sees her dilemma, as peacemaker, through 'Hamlet's sea of troubles soliloquy; she uses 'Twelfth Night' to bring the love triangle between Matty, Liv and Franky to a head, and ultimately receives an A. After Blood still forces Grace to change schools, Rich is inspired by 'Romeo and Juliet' and proposes to her. In the series finale, the two attempt to marry in secret with the gang as witnesses, though Alo's van breaks down. Mini begins to recognise her attraction to Franky, and becomes very protective of her. After an attempt at sex with Matty, Franky has a panic attack, charges through a forest, and accidentally falls over a ledge. After being rescued by Mini, Matty and Liv, Franky reveals more to her friends about her insecurities. Though Blood intervenes and Grace and Rich do not marry, they are happily allowed to continue dating and the gang, solidified as friends, party together at a local fête.|$|E

Parties agree to recognise the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to consider complaints [...] "by or on behalf of" [...] individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Convention have been violated. If a complaint is submitted on behalf of a victim, then this requires their consent, unless the submitter <b>can</b> <b>justify</b> acting without it.

500|$|A few songs feature lyrical collaborations between Vedder {{and other}} members of the group, {{including}} one with Ament ("Ghost"), one with Cameron ("You Are"), and two with Gossard ("Bu$hleaguer" [...] and [...] "All or None"). Sole lyrical contributions from band members other than Vedder include Cameron with [...] "Get Right" [...] and Ament with [...] "Help Help". The album's lyrics tackle existential matters ("Love Boat Captain", [...] "Cropduster", and [...] "I Am Mine"), as well as social and political concerns ("Green Disease", [...] "Bu$hleaguer", and [...] "1/2 Full"). The lyrics of [...] "Save You" [...] represent the anger felt by anyone who watches a close friend waste away his or her life. Regarding [...] "Love Boat Captain", Vedder said, [...] "Love is one resource that the corporations aren't going to be able to monopolize." [...] Vedder said that [...] "Cropduster" [...] is [...] "about man's giant ego, that he's the most important thing on the planet." [...] Regarding [...] "Green Disease", Vedder stated he was [...] "mystified" [...] at CEO and corporate-management salaries and [...] "how someone <b>can</b> <b>justify</b> taking that much at the cost of other people's livelihoods."

500|$|Over {{the next}} several years, the Métis, unhappy with the Canadian government's {{handling}} of their land rights, move farther west across the Prairies. [...] There as well, they see their petitions to the government repeatedly ignored and their rights trampled on. [...] Finally, after being ignored for too long, the Métis search for Riel in Montana, {{in the hope that}} his return will force the Canadians to take their claims seriously. [...] He is reluctant at first, as he has started a family and settled down as a schoolmaster. [...] In the hopes that he will get money from the Canadian government for his tenure administering the Red River settlement (by this time known as Winnipeg), he moves his family to Batoche (now in Saskatchewan) in mid-1884. [...] Macdonald has returned to the prime ministership and conspires with George Stephen, president of the financially burdened Canadian Pacific Railway, to use the situation to gain support for finishing the railway. [...] By inciting a violent revolt amongst the Métis, the government <b>can</b> <b>justify</b> funding the railway to move troops to the Prairies. [...] The Métis under Riel respond with arms as intended. [...] Riel declares [...] "Rome has fallen!" [...] and breaks from the Catholic Church. [...] He breathes the Holy Spirit into his followers, thereafter known as the Exovedate. [...] Tensions build until the bloodshed at the Battle of Duck Lake, where Riel and his followers drive back the North-West Mounted Police. [...] Macdonald takes this as a cue to send two thousand troops to the area. [...] At the Battle of Fish Creek, the outnumbered Métis manage to drive back the Canadians, but at the Battle of Batoche, while Riel is increasingly immersed in religious activities, the Métis finally suffer defeat. [...] In the hope that his trial will provide an opportunity to get the Métis' story to the public, Riel surrenders instead of fleeing.|$|E
