40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} {{studies the}} effect on pressure of the filling volume rate in a manufactured nickel powder capillary structure (wick) for a loop heat pipe (LHP). The filling volume ratio is an index of pressure from 1 to 1. 3 to investigate the influence on filling weights of the internal parameters of a wick (permeability, effective pore radius and porosity) and heat transfer performance for LHP. The wick is manufactured, based on the standard and non-pressurized filling weights in the manufactured wick mold. The conversion of a pressure change to a weight change used to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> volume of pressure to the internal parameters of the wick and the heat transfer performance. As the filling volume rate increases, the capacity of the wick increases, but an excessive filling volume rate makes the wick too dense, affecting its permeability and heat transfer performance in LHP. An experimental test demonstrates that the permeability and heat transfer performance are optimal at a filling volume ratio of 1. 2...|$|E
40|$|Background. This study {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} changes in heart rate, atrial pressure, volume, and cardiac tissue atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration in the modulation of plasma ANF concentration in a model of pacing-induced heart failure. Methods and Results. The effects of acute right ventricular pacing (250 beats/min), acute volume expansion (35 ml/mmn), and volume expansion after 1 week of right ventricular pacing on plasma ANF concentration were compared in eight dogs (group 1). As shown during right ventricular pacing previously, volume expansion produced significant increases in cardiac filling pressures and left atrial volume. Right ventricular pacing and volume expansion produced similar increments in plasma ANF concentration: from 32 ± 12 to 168 ± 153 pg/ml (p< 0. 05) and from 32 ± 9 to 137 ± 113 pg/ml (p< 0. 05), respectively. When pacing was initiated after volume expansion, plasma ANF concentration increased further to 462 ± 295 pg/ml (p< 0. S 05) despite little <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressures and left atrial volume. With repeated volume expansion after 1 week of pacing, {{there were no significant}} further increases in left atrial volume and plasma ANF concentrations (from 332 ±f 121 to 407 ±+ 113 pg/ml) despite significant increases in filling pressures.

40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEU) {{has been}} used to measure muscle microvascular perfusion in vivo in response to exercise and insulin. In the present study we address whether CEU measurement of capillary volume is influenced by bulk flow and if measured capillary filling rate allows discrimination of different flow pattern changes within muscle. Three in vitro models were used: (i) bulk flow rate was varied within a single length of capillary tubing; (ii) at constant bulk flow, capillary volume was increased 3 -fold by joining lengths of capillary in series, and compared to a single length; and (iii) at constant bulk flow, capillary volume was increased by sharing flow between a number of lengths of identical capillaries in parallel. The contrast medium for CEU was gas-filled albumin microbubbles. Pulsing interval (time) versus acoustic–intensity curves were constructed and from these, capillary volume and capillary filling rate were calculated. CEU estimates of capillary volume were not affected by changes in bulk flow. Furthermore, as CEU estimates of capillary volume increased, measures of capillary filling rate decreased, regardless of whether capillaries were connected in series or parallel. Therefore, CEU can detect a <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> rate of the microvascular volume under measurement, but it {{can not be used to}} discriminate between different flow patterns within muscle that might account for capillary recruitment in vivo...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{effects of}} acute endotoxemia (Escherichia coli endotoxin, 1 mg/kg, intravenously) on left ventricular (LV) {{function in the}} first 4 h after induction of endotoxic shock in anesthetized canine preparations (n = 7 each, endotoxin and control groups). LV pressure and conductance (volume) catheters were used to construct pressure-volume loops. Transient inferior vena cava occlusion was used to rapidly and reversibly alter LV end-diastolic volume. LV contractility was assessed from {{the slope of the}} LV end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (Ees) and from preload-recruitable stroke work (PRSW), and from their change (DeltaEes and DeltaPRSW, respectively, measured at 2 and 4 h only), in response to a dobutamine infusion (5 microg/kg/min). Diastolic function and arterial tone were assessed as the maximal negative <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure versus time (max -dP/dt), filling rate, and arterial elastance (Ea), respectively. Ees, PRSW, Ea, diastolic function, and hemodynamics were measured hourly. Endotoxemia induced an immediate hypotensive, hyperdynamic, tachycardic state with progressive lactic acidosis. By 2. 5 h after endotoxin infusion, heart rate returned to preendotoxin and control levels, but the other changes remained. However, no change occurred in LV Ees, DeltaEes, PRSW, DeltaPRSW, diastolic function, or Ea during the 4 -h measurement interval. The cardiovascular collapse seen during the first 4 h of endotoxemia is therefore not due even partly to alterations in LV contractility...|$|E
30|$|In this paragraph, we {{attempted}} to correlate fluid flow characteristic with surface properties and device structures. The lower filling time on plasma-treated surfaces {{was due to the}} higher polar surface energy due to plasma treatment (Figure 3). The surface chemistry studies revealed higher oxygen content and hydroxyl species on DBD processed PMMA surfaces (Figure 4 b) and that {{may be one of the}} reasons of higher speed of fluid flow than on pristine PMMA surface. The higher surface roughness on DBD processed PMMA (Figure 5) may be another reason of higher speed of water flow than that on pristine PMMA surface [45]. The geometry of the microchannel can also play a significant effect on microfluidic flow. We have modified the speed of microfluidic flow by varying the surface wettability and designed surface roughness on the bottom wall of microchannel, and Saha et al. [11] theoretically predicted that the channel walls and pillars would have significant effects on fluid flow, with the contributions being 1 - 3 % for the side walls, 5 - 13 % for the pillars and 85 - 89 % from the top and bottom walls. In our study, we modified the bottom and side wall surfaces to change the surface wettability (measured as static contact angle on the surface), however the surface wettability on the top wall was constant for each device. Since the surface area to volume ratio is very high in microchannels, the surface wettability has a significant effect on microfluidic flow, and as a result a small change of contact angle leads to a larger change in capillary forces, thus making a significant <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> time (Figure 9).|$|E

40|$|Haemodynamic changes {{produced}} by rapid atrial pacing (60 patients, 52 of whom developed angina) or {{in association with}} spontaneous angina (32 patients) were measured in 92 patients with angiographic coronary artery disease. The extent of coronary artery disease was scored by the jeopardy score system (range 0 to 12). The haemodynamic changes induced by ischaemia occurred in 3 patterns: pattern I, no <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure or in mean systemic arterial pressure; pattern II, a rise in filling pressure and a rise in mean systemic arterial pressure; pattern III, a rise in filling pressure, but no significant change or a fall in mean systemic arterial pressure.

The likelihood of a patient showing a given pattern of ischaemia-induced haemodynamic change {{was related to the}} extent of coronary artery disease; of 22 patients with jeopardy scores of 2 or 4, 91 % exhibited pattern I, 9 % pattern II, and none pattern III; of 39 patients with jeopardy scores of 6 or 8, 40 % exhibited pattern I, 22 % pattern II, and 38 % pattern III; of 31 patients with jeopardy scores of 10 or 12, 12 % exhibited pattern I, 10 % pattern II, and 78 % pattern III (P less than 0. 01). Among the 54 patients in whom serial cardiac output determinations were available, a decline of the left ventricular function curve during ischaemia was demonstrable in 8 % of those with a pattern I response, in 54 % of those with a pattern II response, and in 90 % of those with a pattern III response (P less than 0. 01). The pattern of response was unrelated to resting angiographic left ventricular ejection fraction, whether ST segments became elevated or depressed, or whether ischaemia was pacing-induced or spontaneous.

40|$|The Molecular compounds, (DMe-DCNQI) 2 M, where DMe-DCNQI is 2, 5 -dimethyl-dicyanoquinonediimine and M is Li, Ag or Cu, {{attract a}} variety of {{physical}} interests. DMe-DCNQI is a planer molecule as shown in Fig. 1 (a). This is an organic π acceptor molecule, which are uniformly stacked along the crystallographical c axis, forming one dimensional (1 D) columns in the compounds. The metallic ions, M, are coordinated tetrahedrally by CN groups of DMe-DCNQI molecules. The complexes with M are all isostructual with the space group, I 4 1 /a, irrespectively of the M(Li, Ag, Cu). (DMe-DCNQI) 2 Cu(DMe-Cu) remains metallic down to low temperatures {{in spite of the}} low dimensional structure. The 3 d orbitals of Cu ions hybridize with LUMO (the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbitals) of DMe-DCNQI and play a role of interconnecting the 1 D π band. The valence of the Cu ions are around 4 / 3 (Cu 1 +Cu 2 +〓 2 : 1) and the filling of 1 D π band turns out to be about 1 / 3. On the other hand, the compound with monovalent Li/Ag (DMe-Li/DMe-Ag) has the same crystal symmetry as the DMe-Cu. The electrons of Li/Ag does not contribute to the conduction band. Therefore it behaves as a 1 D electronic system with a quarter filled π band. The DMe-Li/DMe-Ag is metallic in high temperature region, while it undergoes a non-magnetic(spin-) Peierls transition with freezing of 2 kF charge density wave(CDW). DI-DCNQI molecule is shown in Fig. 1 (b), where methyl group in DMe-DCNQI is replaced by iodine. Recently, the electronic state of Cu salt of DI-DCNQI, DI-Cu, has been reported. The possibility of the high correlation effect of DI-Cu was suggested by the measurements of resistivity, spin susceptibility and band calculation. This peculiarities in DI-Cu is attributed to degree of hybridization and intra/inter-column transfer integrals different from those of DMe-DCNQI system. In the present study, the novel electronic states of DCNQI-M system have been searched for by 1) substituting Me by I, and 2) controlling the filling of the 1 D π band of DMe-DCNQI columns through the Cu doping to the DMe-Li. The Cu doping is expected to cause some <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> of the band and generate 3 D nature through hybridization of the Cu 3 d orbitals with the π band. The electronic states were investigated by the resistivity, ρ, spin susceptibility, χ and 1 H- and 13 C-NMR measurements. The cyano carbons in the DCNQI molecules are enriched by 13 C isotope for NMR. 1. Electronic state of (DI-DCNQI) 2 M(DI-DCNQI) 2 Ag DI-Ag is insulating below room temperature with a charge gap of ～ 490 K, which was obtained by the temperature dependence of ρ. The χ follows a Curie-Wei β law in high temperature region and forms a broad peak around 35 K. At higher temperatures above 20 OK, 13 C-NMR spectra are single lines because all of 13 C sites are crystallographically equivalent. Below 200 K, however, the spectra get split into two lines with different shifts and width. Since the shift is proportional to the local electron density of LUMO at the 13 C site. This line separation in the paramagnetic state indicates disproportionation of electron density. This result is an evidence of 4 kF CDW with the two fold charge modulation along the c axis. It is emphasized that the CDW in this system is the charge modulation type rather than the lattice modulation type, which is widely observed in many organic systems with quarter filled band. The 4 kF CDW leads a quarter filling in electronic band to a half filling. Thus, the insulating state of DI-Ag is understood as Mott insulator by the large Coulomb repulsion, U. At 5. 5 K, 1 H-NMR relaxation rate, 1 T 1 - 1, forms a peak anomaly and the spectral width abruptly become broadened as shown in Fig. 2. These evidence an antiferromagnetic ordering of the spins at this temperature. The ground state of the Ag salt of DI-DCNQI is antiferromagnetic. The DI-Ag is considered as a nearly pure π electron system like the DMe-Ag. The magnetism of the DI-Ag is sharp contrast to the non magnetic groundstate in the DMe-Ag. The DI-Ag is the first case in the DCNQI-M system that them electrons are responsible for antiferromagnetic ground state. The difference of the ground states between the two systems are attributable to the difference of the dimensionality of the electronic states. In fact, from estimation of the transfer integral by the band calculation, the DI-system is known to be more three-dimensional than the DMe-system. (DI-DCNQI) 2 Cu The DI-Cu remains metallic down to low temperatures as DMe-Cu does. There is no sign of 4 kv CDW in NMR spectra, which remains single line in whole temperature range. In Fig. 3, the spectral shift of 13 C- and 1 H-NMR, 13 K(square) and 1 K(circle) from the line position of neutral DI-DCNQI molecule is shown in comparison with χ (cross). Both of 13 K and 1 K form broad peaks like χ. However, {{it should be noted that}} the peak temperature of 1 K is lower than that of χ while the peak temperature of 13 K is slightly higher than that. The overall temperature dependence of χ is in between the two profiles. Since K probes the local spin susceptibility, this fact is considered as a microscopic evidence that the electronic structure consists of several bands with different characters, which is believed to come from hybridization of the π and d orbitals, 1 H-NMR detects the electrons of π-band preferentially, while 13 C-NMR at the cyano group coordinated to the Cu ions can probe the d-electrons through the off-site core polarization as well as the π electrons. 2. Carrier Doping to (DMe-DCNQI) 2 Li From the resistivity measurements of several alloy systems with different Cu contents, it was found that the systems up to x～ 30 % undergo the metal-insulator transition at low temperatures while the systems with x> 50 % are metallic in the whole temperature range investigated. Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of χ for typical alloy systems. A systematic change of behavior with the doping content is observed. The 13 C (in the cyano group) nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, 13 T 1 - 1, is shown in Fig. 5. For x 50 %, (13 T 1 T) - 1 does not exhibit any anomaly but converges into about 0. 03 sec- 1 K- 1 in the low-temperature limit. They show positive temperature dependence which have a clear correlation with the doping content. This is an indication that the doping causes some change in the electronic states, particularly in excitation spectrum visualized in higher temperature region...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. To {{characterize}} the mechanical {{properties of the}} contracting left ventricle, we studied the <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> left ventricular systolic pressure following step-like perturbations (± 3 ml) in ventricular volume, using an isovolumically beating, isolated canine heart preparation. Three mechanical properties (elasticity, resistance, and a deactivation effect) were identified. The elastic property differs from the traditional parallel and series elastic elements; it is a time-varying elasticity that includes active and passive effects of volume changes. Furthermore, {{it could not be}} represented by a simple time-varying elasticity, but required a second factor to express the dependence of end-systolic elasticity on the timing of the volume step. This effect was represented by a "volume influence factor, " which may arise from length-dependent activation. The resistive property appeared to be related to force-velocity behavior of the myocardium. Each mechanical property reacted characteristically to steady state <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ventricular <b>filling</b> volume or contractile state produced by dobutamine (2 - 13 jug/min). Our findings indicate that elasticity was the property most sensitive to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> contractile state; these changes increased peak isovolumetric pressure 54 % on average, and raised elastic stiffness 40 % above control (which was 5. 1 mm Hg/ml). <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> ventricular <b>filling</b> volume only prolonged, but did not alter, the level of elastic stiffness attained at peak pressure...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{positive}} end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on right ventricular (RV) function in humans is complex. Previous {{studies have been}} limited in their interpretation by not defining either pericardial pressure (Ppc) or RV volumes. Accordingly, we measured RV volumes and pressures and Ppc as PEEP was increased from zero to 15 cm H 2 O in 12 patients after thoracotomy, using a pulmonary arterial catheter equipped with a rapid responding thermistor that allowed measurement of RV ejection fraction (ef), while Ppc was measured via a pericardial balloon catheter. RV end-diastolic volume (EDV) was estimated as the ratio of stroke volume (SV) to RVef, whereas RV end-systolic volume (ESV) was estimated as RV EDV-SV. Right atrial pressure (Pra) was defined as end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary arterial pressures (Ppa), both peak and mean, were used as end-systolic pressures. PEEP increased Ppc, Pra, and lung compliance (Cl). Cardiac output also decreased but not significantly. Neither mean nor peak systolic Ppa, nor RVef was significantly altered by PEEP. There was no relation between either RV filling pressure (Pra-Ppc) and EDV or the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> RV <b>filling</b> pressure and EDV, although EDV varied significantly as PEEP varied for individuals (p < 0. 05). Similarly, there was no relation between Ppa and ESV when either mean or peak Ppa values relative to Ppc were used. The relations between EDV and both SV and RVef were weak (r = 0. 54 and 0. 55, respectively). RVef varied inversely with ESV (r = - 0. 77), although it showed no relation to transmural peak Ppa (r = 0. 28). Both absolute and relative <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> EDV corresponded closely with respective ESV values (r = 0. 94). For individuals, decreases in RVef, SV, and RV filling pressure were associated with increases in CI (p < 0. 01). We conclude that EDV varies independently of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure, and that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ESV occur independently of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> ejection pressure. These data {{can be explained by}} assuming that the RV shape changes can dissociate <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> RV EDV from <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> RV wall stress (preload). Thus, <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> RV EDV may or may not alter SV but should proportionately change ESV to a degree dependent on ejection pressure and contractility...|$|R

These results indicate that <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> rapid <b>filling</b> angle have a close relationship with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and variation of rapid filling interval are correlated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and variation of rapid filling interval are correlated with <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> cardiac output...|$|R
40|$|TO THE EDITOR: Zhang et al. (6) elegantly {{discuss the}} concept of diastasis (static {{equilibrium}} volume) and diastolic suction and address the idea that diastasis provides a measure of ventricular equilibrium. While this definition provides a very useful work-ing model, one must also consider differences between early diastolic filling and diastolic suction when examining ventric-ular function. Inasmuch {{as it is the}} filling pressure and diastolic suction that create the atrial-ventricular pressure gradient at the mitral valve that results <b>in</b> early diastolic <b>filling,</b> and ultimately an equilibrium volume (4), {{the concept of}} using a measure of diastasis to determine diastolic suction may only apply if filling pressure is zero. Any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> blood volume, such as seen with moderate exercise training or following bed rest/spaceflight, will alter atrial pressure and the atrial-ventricular pressure gradient, and, as such, will alter the equilibrium volume (2, 3, 5). Thus <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling</b> pressure may manifest as an increase in diastolic suction if observations are made using static equilib-rium volumes. Furthermore, transition from upright to supine posture will change right atrial pressure (5). This is particularly relevant as many activities are performed in an upright posi-tion, while M-mode echo measuring the static equilibrium volume is made in the supine position. While it is clear the method of Zhang et al. can be effective in examining early diastolic filling, methods such as MRI tagging that directly examine the ability of the left ventricle to relax under a variety of conditions may provide a more precise measurement when filling pressure and/or blood volume is changing (1) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo examine cost {{responsiveness}} {{and total}} {{costs associated with}} a simulated “value-based” insurance design for statin therapy in a Medicare population with diabetes. MethodsFour-year panels were constructed from the 1997 - 2005 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey selected by self-report or claims-based diagnoses of diabetes in year 1 and use of statins in year 2 (N = 899). We computed the number of 30 -day statin prescription fills, out-of-pocket and third-party drug costs, and Medicare Part A and Part B spending. Multivariate ordinary least squares regression models predicted statin fills {{as a function of}} out-of-pocket costs, and a generalized linear model with log link predicted Medicare spending as a function of number of fills, controlling for baseline characteristics. Estimated coefficients were used to simulate <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>fills</b> associated with co-payment caps from $ 25 to $ 1 and to compute <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> third-party payments and Medicare cost offsets associated with incremental fills. Analyses were stratified by patient cardiovascular event risk. ResultsA simulated out-of-pocket price of $ 25 [$ 1] increased plan drug spending by $ 340 [$ 794] and generated Medicare Part A/B savings of $ 262 [$ 531]; savings for high-risk patients were $ 558 [$ 1193], generating a net saving of $ 249 [$ 415]. ConclusionsReducing statin co-payments for Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes resulted in modestly increased use and reduced medical spending. The value-based insurance design simulation strategy met financial feasibility criteria but only for higher-risk patients...|$|R
40|$|Background. Beat-to-beat {{variations}} in the pulse during atrial fibrillation (AF) have conventionally been attributed to time-dependent <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>filling.</b> We have explored {{the possibility that they}} are dependent on the intrinsic myocardial interval force relation. Methods and Results. Left ventricular (LV) contractility (maximum rate of rise of pressure, LV dP/dtm,c) and ascending aortic blood velocity were measured during cardiac catheterization in 15 patients with AF. Beats preceded by an interval of less than 500 msec were excluded from analysis to reduce the confounding influence of incomplete mechanical restitution. The LV dP/dtm,,, was then related to the prepreceding interval. An inverse relation consistent with postextrasystolic potentiation was obtained in all 15 patients (Spearman's rank correlations,- 0. 56 to- 0. 86; p c 0. 0001). This relation was confirmed in three patients during pacing that overrode theAF and introduced single-interval {{variations in}}to steady-state pacing. The ECG sequences from six of the AF patients were used to drive isometrically contracting guinea pig papillary muscle and human right ventricular tissue (n= 7); the same inverse relation was demonstrated. On a beat-by-beat basis, the maximum rate of rise of force in the isolated muscle correlated well with LV dP/dtm,,, in the patients (r= 0. 50 - 0. 86, p<O. 0001). The relation of the integral of aortic velocity (AVI, proportional to stroke volume) to prepreceding interval was also inverse, whereas important correlation...|$|R

40|$|Finite element {{modeling}} {{is conducted}} {{to understand the}} factors that govern the performance of thermal interface pastes of controlled thickness between copper surfaces of controlled roughness. Carbon black paste is lower in thickness than metal particle paste, so it shows better performance. The performance of both pastes is more influenced by the paste-copper interfacial conductance than by the paste thermal conductivity. The effects of pressure, paste thickness, and copper surface roughness on performance are mainly due to the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> fractional <b>filling</b> of the valleys in the copper surface topog-raphy. Reasonable agreement is found between modeling and experimental results.

It {{has been observed}} that unlike the case of symmetric grain boundaries, the capacitance-voltage characteristics measured at high frequency, depend upon the polarity of the applied dc voltage.

Based on this, capacitance-voltage characteristics of grain boundaries have been calculated. Carrier trapping and emission by the grain boundary states have been considered to calculate the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>filled</b> trap state density due to the applied bias.

40|$|The {{electrodeposited}} Cu film morphology on thin physical vapor deposited (PVD) Cu seed {{for various}} conditions and correlation with Cu fill of dual Damascene structures is discussed. Thinner PVD Cu seed on Ta yields isolated electrodeposited Cu particles, while smooth plated films are obtained for thicker seed. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> suppressor additive and virgin makeup solution (VMS) concentrations {{have a limited}} impact on the morphology of Cu electrodeposited on thin Cu seed. Increased seed to plate queue time appears to lead to coarser, more isolated deposited Cu particles. <b>Changes</b> <b>in</b> Cu <b>fill</b> performance of dual Damascene structures having a 28 nm critical dimension (CD) were consistent with blanket wafer results for seed to plate queue times, but less so for <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> suppressor and VMS.

30|$|We did observe an {{increase}} in AVDSF which {{could be interpreted as}} {{an increase}} in dead space. This is somewhat contradictory to the finding of an improved PaO 2 /FiO 2 {{in the presence of a}} fixed FiO 2 which could be contemplated as a proxy for reduced shunt. There is no easy explanation for the increased AVDSF, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe PARDS. As discussed earlier, we did not find a decrease <b>in</b> EELV or <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> regional <b>filling</b> characteristics suggestive for atelectasis, but this cannot be ruled out. It may also be speculated that before introducing NMB spontaneous efforts of the patient contributed to alveolar ventilation. Supportive for this is the observation that pCO 2 increased after introduction of NMB (Table  2). Future studies are needed examining the effects of NMB on pulmonary circulation stratifying for differences in ARDS severity.|$|R
