25|$|Nicolas is {{intrigued}} by Lestat, and requests {{to speak to}} him privately so that Lestat <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how he achieved the impossible. Lestat is not interested until he learns from his mother that Nicolas, like him, is a rebel. He has returned to the village because he is in disgrace: he was sent to Paris to study law at the Sorbonne, but instead {{fell in love with the}} violin, abandoned his studies and sold his textbooks to take lessons from Mozart.

500|$|The {{narrative}} {{begins in}} 2047. Mikako is apparently {{alone in a}} hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet. [...] She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject [...] "I am here", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown {{at the beginning of}} the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> she loves him.|$|E

Harry escapes and meets Lisa Garland, a nurse injured in a crash, and escorts her to her home. At her request, Harry gives Lisa pills for her headache, and returns to find her either dead or dying, depending on in-game actions taken by the player. Finding him next to Lisa's corpse, Cybil attempts to arrest him, but is frozen as the Nightmare emerges around them. Harry escapes to Cheryl's home, where he finds an older Dahlia who claims to be his wife and tells him that Cheryl is at the lighthouse. Harry enters the Nightmare, escapes it, and eventually gets a ride from Michelle. Harry finds a young-again Dahlia aboard a boat at a lakeside harbour, who sets the course for the lighthouse and seduces him. Harry wakes, finds an aged Dahlia and the environment covered in ice, and crosses the now-frozen lake but falls {{into the water and}} passes out. Harry is dragged ashore near the lighthouse by Cybil, who confronts him with the news that Harry Mason died eighteen years ago in a car accident. As Harry proceeds, he finds [...] "the lighthouse" [...] is the name of Dr. Kaufmann's counseling clinic: the patient in the therapy session is an adult Cheryl, who is in denial over her father's death. Harry enters the office and Cheryl either reconciles herself to his death or continues to cling to her fantasy father.|$|E

2500|$|Mississauga Mayor Hazel McCallion {{went further}} by issuing a {{challenge}} to Flaherty to publicly debate the need for permanent federal funding for the repair and upkeep of municipal roads and bridges. McCallion said [...] "Flaherty has stated in the media {{that some of the}} municipalities have not kept up with infrastructure and did not establish adequate reserves. Well, I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he is dead wrong. The facts are that Mississauga has carefully set aside reserves for infrastructure for years." [...] McCallion noted that cities are trying to maintain 58 per cent of public infrastructure with eight cents of every tax dollar. Flaherty did not accept Hazel McCallion's offer to debate.|$|E

[...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> as far as how to run the ball. ...
