5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red gleam before returning to normal.|$|E
5|$|Sadler and {{his wife}} moved into an Art Nouveau-style house—the first steel-frame {{residence}} in Chicago—on Diversey Parkway in 1912. The couple operated their medical practice in the building. He {{was a member of}} the American Association for the Advancement of Science and of medical associations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Pathological Society, and the American College of Surgeons. Sadler was also a member of the faculty of McCormick Theological Seminary, and taught pastoral psychology. He argued that pastors should be educated in basic psychiatry so they <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> symptoms of mental illness in congregants. His students later recalled him as an engaging and humorous public speaker.|$|E
25|$|The Associated Press {{reported}} in 1986 that sixty students at California State University, Fullerton {{of a group}} of 100 <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> Erica Kane but not historical figures such as Alexander Hamilton, Geoffrey Chaucer and Desmond Tutu when asked by English instructor Judith Remy Leder.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks would {{describe}} water as robust, heavy or light, dry, acidic, pungent, wine-like, etc. One {{of the comic}} poet Antiphanes's characters claimed that he <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> Attic water by taste alone. Athenaeus states {{that a number of}} philosophers had a reputation for drinking nothing but water, a habit combined with a vegetarian diet (cf.below). Milk, usually goats' milk, was not widely consumed, being considered barbaric.|$|E
25|$|The FDIC {{announced}} its intent, on September 29, 2009, {{to assess the}} banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums {{in an effort to}} avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, {{at the time of the}} assessment.|$|E
500|$|Arnold became President at {{a crucial}} time in Rhode Island's history. [...] Tremendous {{political}} change was occurring in England, and this resulted in significant changes and opportunities for the little Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, which was constantly being harassed by its larger neighbors Massachusetts and Connecticut. [...] Oliver Cromwell had been ruling in England since the overthrow and execution of King Charles I in 1649, but his death in 1658 marked {{the restoration of the}} monarchy, and Charles II ascended to the throne. [...] The Colony of Rhode Island was quick to adjust to the new political reality, and the General Court of Commissioners met at Warwick on 18 October 1660 where two letters were read, one from Dr. Clarke telling of the Restoration, and one from His Majesty, containing the royal declaration and proclamation. [...] Leaders in the colony set aside a special day of proclamation so that the colonists <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> the new king.|$|E

500|$|Robert Rodriguez {{was offered}} the chance to direct, but turned down the offer due to his {{commitment}} on The Faculty, despite liking Smith's script. Smith originally suggested Tim Burton to direct his script, and Burton signed on with a pay-or-play contract of $5million. Warner Bros. originally planned on a theatrical release date for summer 1998, the 60th anniversary of the character's debut in Action Comics. Nicolas Cage, a comic book fan, signed on as Superman with a $20million pay-or-play contract, believing he could [...] "reconceive the character." [...] Peters felt Cage could [...] "convince audiences he [...] came from outer space." [...] Burton explained Cage's casting would be [...] "the first time you would believe that nobody <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> Clark Kent as Superman, he [...] could physically change his persona." [...] Kevin Spacey was approached {{for the role of}} Lex Luthor, while Christopher Walken was Burton's choice for Brainiac, a role also considered for Jim Carrey and Gary Oldman. Sandra Bullock, Courteney Cox and Julianne Moore had been approached for Lois Lane, while Chris Rock was cast as Jimmy Olsen. Michael Keaton confirmed his involvement, but when asked if he would be reprising his role as Batman from Burton's Batman films, he would only reply, [...] "Not exactly." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Karate Champ and Yie Ar Kung Fu later {{provided}} {{a template for}} Capcom's Street Fighter in 1987. Street Fighter found its own niche in the gaming world, partially because many arcade game developers in the 1980s focused more on producing beat-em-ups and shoot 'em ups. Part of the game's appeal {{was the use of}} special moves that could only be discovered by experimenting with the game controls, which created a sense of mystique and invited players to practice the game, although similar controller motions used for grappling maneuvers in the earlier Brian Jacks Uchi Mata were deemed too difficult. Following Street Fighter's lead, the use of command-based hidden moves began to pervade other games in the rising fighting game genre. Street Fighter also introduced other staples of the genre, including the blocking technique as well as the ability for a challenger to jump in and initiate a match against a player at any time. The game also introduced pressure-sensitive controls that determine the strength of an attack, though due to causing damaged arcade cabinets, Capcom replaced it soon after with a six-button control scheme offering light, medium and hard punches and kicks, which became another staple of the genre. In 1988, Home Data released Reikai Dōshi: Chinese Exorcist, also known as Last Apostle Puppet Show, the first fighting game to use digitized sprites and motion capture animation. Meanwhile, home game consoles largely ignored the genre. [...] was one of few releases for the Sega Genesis but was not as popular as games in other genres. Technical challenges limited the popularity of early fighting games. Programmers had difficulty producing a game that <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> the fast motions of a joystick, and so players had difficulty executing special moves with any accuracy.|$|E
500|$|While {{the first}} act of WALL-E [...] "fell out of the sky" [...] for Stanton, he had {{originally}} wanted aliens to plant EVE to explore Earth {{and the rest of}} the film was different. When WALL-E comes to the Axiom, he incites a Spartacus-style rebellion by the robots against the remnants of the human race, which were cruel alien Gels (completely devolved, gelatinous, boneless, legless, see-through, green creatures that resemble Jell-O). James Hicks, a physiologist, mentioned to Stanton the concept of atrophy and the effects prolonged weightlessness would have on humans living in space for an inordinately extended time period. Therefore, this was the inspiration of the humans degenerating into the alien Gels, and their ancestry would have been revealed in a Planet of the Apes-style ending. The Gels also spoke a made-up gibberish language, but Stanton scrapped this idea because he thought it would be too complicated for the audience to understand and they could easily be driven off from the storyline. The Gels had a royal family, who host a dance in a castle on a lake in the back of the ship, and the Axiom curled up into a ball when returning to Earth in this incarnation of the story. Stanton decided this was too bizarre and unengaging, and conceived humanity as [...] "big babies". Stanton developed the metaphorical theme of the humans learning to stand again and [...] "grow up", wanting WALL-E and EVE's relationship to inspire humanity because he felt few films explore how utopian societies come to exist. The process of depicting the descendants of humanity as the way they appear in the movie was slow. Stanton first decided to put a nose and ears on the Gels so the audience <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> them. Eventually, fingers, legs, clothes, and other characteristics were added until they arrived at the concept of being fetus-like to allow the audience to see themselves in the characters.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} Credere e conoscere, {{published}} {{shortly before his}} death, Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the former Archbishop of Milan, set out his disagreement with opposition by Catholics to homosexual civil unions: [...] "I disagree with the positions {{of those in the}} Church, that take issue with civil unions ... It is not bad, instead of casual sex between men, that two people have a certain stability". He said that the [...] "state <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> them". Although he stated his belief that [...] "the homosexual couple, as such, can never be totally equated to a marriage", he also said that he could understand (although not necessarily approve of) gay pride parades when they support the need for self-affirmation.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{exhibits}} {{were introduced}} into {{evidence in the}} opening days of the trial, including 285 bones and skulls determined as belonging to young men under 20 years of age which had been retrieved from the Leine River, the bucket into which he had stored and transported human remains, and the extensively bloodstained camp bed upon which he had killed many of the victims at his Rote Reihe address. As had been the case when earlier asked whether he <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> the photographs of any of his victims, Haarmann's demeanour became dismissive upon the introduction of these exhibits; he denied any of the skulls introduced into evidence had belonged to his victims, stating he had [...] "mashed" [...] the skulls of his victims, and had thrown only one undamaged skull into the river.|$|E

In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage <b>could</b> be <b>recognized</b> under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding on the courts and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{unlikely}} any Native American recognized Custer {{during or after}} the battle. Michno summarizes: [...] "Shave Elk said 'We did not suspect that we were fighting Custer and did not recognize him either alive or dead.' Wooden Leg said no one <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> any enemy during the fight, for they were too far away. The Cheyennes {{did not even know}} a man named Custer was in the fight until weeks later. Antelope said none knew of Custer being at the fight until they later learned of it at the agencies. Thomas Marquis learned from his interviews that no Indian knew Custer was at the Little Bighorn fight until months later. Many Cheyennes were not even aware that other members of the Custer family had been in the fight until 1922, when, Marquis said, he himself first informed them of that fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Naked Sun, Elijah Baley {{points out}} that the Laws had been {{deliberately}} misrepresented because robots could unknowingly break any of them. He restated the first law as [...] "A robot may do nothing that, to its knowledge, will harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm." [...] This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he {{points out that}} a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot <b>could</b> <b>recognize</b> that its actions would lead to harming a human being. The Naked Sun complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2014, Iraqi Kurdistan is {{in dispute}} with the Federal Iraqi {{government}} {{on the issues of}} territorial control, export of oil and budget distribution and is functioning largely outside Baghdad's control. With the escalation of the Iraqi crisis and fears of Iraq's collapse, Kurds have increasingly debated the issue of independence. During the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, Iraqi Kurdistan seized the city of Kirkuk and the surrounding area, as well as most of the disputed territories in Northern Iraq. On 1 July 2014, Masoud Barzani announced that [...] "Iraq's Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months."
