Despite the game's controlling body agreeing to it, the Australian Cricket Board vetoed it {{on the grounds that it}} might lead to umpires being quizzed by teams after every game and meant that the throwing controversy would continue into the World Series Cup during the <b>coming</b> <b>week.</b> The Sri Lankans were disappointed they did not get an explanation and decided they would continue playing their bowler in matches not umpired by Hair and wanted to know whether other umpires would support or reject Hair's judgement.|$|E

500|$|In September 2008 {{representatives from}} Hawkhurst, Goudhurst, Horsmonden and Paddock Wood Parish Councils met {{to discuss the}} {{possibility}} of converting {{all or part of}} the former line into a trail which could be used by cyclists and walkers. The proposal was supported by Kent County Council and a [...] section between Hawkhurst and Goudhurst has been identified as being easily convertible into a trail. The remainder to Paddock Wood is said to be [...] "more difficult but not impossible". Horsmonden Parish Council has declined to participate in the scheme on the basis that any trail would not be able to follow the former railway alignment in its area due to private ownerships and in-filled sections. On 10 June 2011, Kent County Council organised a walk of the trackbed from Gills Green to demonstrate the work that would be needed to convert the trackbed for use by walkers and cyclists. The Kent and Sussex Courier reported that the project was keenly supported by all parish councils involved except for Horsmonden. The scheme was initially suggested by Hawkhurst Community Partnership. The proposed cycleway will be known as The Hop Pickers' Line should it be constructed. On 15 July 2011, it was reported that an application for a £1,000,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund was to be made in the <b>coming</b> <b>week,</b> with the result of the application being known in September 2011. In March 2013, it was reported that a decision from the Heritage Lottery Fund was still awaited.|$|E
500|$|With Rolling Stone, Clemons {{described}} how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga. In January 2011, Clemons was putting together an exercise machine in his Florida house {{when his wife}} told him that Gaga's representatives were on the phone, and {{they wanted him to}} play on her upcoming album. Since the call was on a Friday, Clemons replied that {{he would be able to}} record it on the <b>coming</b> <b>week,</b> but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself. After accepting her request, Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight. Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks, one of them being [...] "Hair". Before Clemons started work on the song, she explained the lyrics to him. [...] "It made so much sense," [...] he said. [...] "It's a story about growing up." [...] She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song, saying [...] "'We'll put the tape on and you just play. Play from your heart. Play what you feel.'". The recording was finished by 3:00 am, after a few takes. Clemons added that he was surprised for [...] "getting paid for this. I would have done it for free. I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money." [...] According to the sheet music [...] published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is written in the time signature of common time. It is composed in the key of F major, with a tempo of 135 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span from F3 to F5, and the song follows a basic sequence of F–C–Dm–B as its chord progression.|$|E

After round 10, Cotto started boxing on the outside and decided to settle for a decision win, he explained in the post-fight, [...] "I think I did my best and I'm happy with my performance.

2500|$|The {{cyclical}} {{place of}} the goddess Candelifera, [...] "She who bears the candle," [...] is uncertain. It is sometimes thought that she provides an artificial light for labor that occurs at night. A long labor was considered likely for first-time mothers, so at least {{a part of the}} birthing process would occur at night. According to Plutarch, light symbolizes birth, but the candle may have been thought of as less a symbol than an actual kindling of life, or a magic equivalent {{to the life of the}} infant. [...] Candelifera may also be the nursery light kept burning against spirits of darkness that would threaten the infant in the <b>coming</b> <b>week.</b> Even in the Christian era, lamps were lit in nurseries to illuminate sacred images and drive away child-snatching demons such as the Gello.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{forbidden}} {{to celebrate the}} full Divine Liturgy on weekdays during Great Lent. For this reason, the faithful receive the reserved Mysteries on Wednesdays, Fridays, and feast days in a service known as the Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts. This Liturgy is also served on {{the first three days}} of Holy Week (but not on Good Friday). [...] On the previous Sunday, during the Divine Liturgy the priest will have consecrated an extra Lamb for each Presanctified Liturgy that will be served in the <b>coming</b> <b>week.</b> [...] He then moistens the extra Lambs with the Blood of Christ, just as he did for the Communion of the sick, except he does not cut the Lambs into small pieces. [...] The Lamb will be cut and distributed to the clergy and faithful during the Presanctified Liturgy. During the Great Entrance at the Presanctified Liturgy, the Mysteries are carried in a silent procession, as all prostrate themselves in adoration.|$|E
