40|$|The {{manuscript}} “IgE accelerates {{in vitro}} development of mast cells and modifies their phenotype ” {{was selected as}} a Pivotal Advance because of its unique focus on monomeric IgEs and the mechanisms via which they promote mast cell growth and differentiation. Here, Dr. Kawakami and col-leagues demonstrate that IgEs, particularly highly cytokin-ergic IgEs, stimulate mast cell growth and promote matura-tion in association with augmented production of proteases and TNF-. Dr. Kawakami, before we begin, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a bit more about highly cytokinergic (HC) IgEs and poorly cytokinergic (PC) IgEs?

40|$|In this manuscript, {{you report}} that CD 163 is {{released}} from monocytes {{in response to}} selective activation of cell surface TLRs 2, 4, and 5. This discovery reveals the broad outreach of TLR activation, which includes hematologic, metabolic, as well as immunologic consequences. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more about your interest in this subject? Paul Guyre: I have a long-term interest in the physiology, func-tion, and responses of monocytes and macrophages, {{which has been a}} major research focus since my postdoctoral fellowship with Dr. Allan Munck, who first discovered glucocorticoid receptors. My work initially gravitated toward understanding how glucocor-ticoids and cytokines regulate Fc receptors for IgG [1], and this led to our discovery of the glucocorticoid-induced macrophage...|$|R
40|$|The {{manuscript}} “Inhibition of MyD 88 dimerization and re-cruitment of IRAK 1 and IRAK 4 for a novel peptidomimetic compound ” {{was selected}} as a Pivotal Advance because it provides an initial characterization of ST 2825, an intriguing heptapeptide analog specifically designed to inhibit MyD 88 dimerization, and via this mechanism, to control TLR 9 medi-ated inflammatory responses. Dr. Sette, {{early on in the}} manuscript, you describe a process by which a series of molecules were synthesized and screened for anti-MyD 88 activity, yielding ST 2825. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> a bit more about how this came about?

Her appointment {{was part of a}} multi-pronged initiative by the Nixon Administration following a press conference on February 6, 1969. During this press conference, Vera Glaser, a reporter for the North American Newspaper Alliance, asked President Nixon, “Mr. President, in staffing your administration, you have so far made about 200 high-level Cabinet and other policy position appointments, and of these only three have gone to women. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> sir, whether we can expect a more equitable recognition of women’s abilities, {{or are we going to}} remain a lost sex?” ...|$|R

40|$|CXCR 4 -induced Chemotaxis of T cells ” was {{selected}} as a Pivotal Advance {{because it is the}} first to propose a molecular mechanism via which a Slit /Robo (Roundabout receptor) com-plex inhibits leukocyte chemotaxis. Specifically, in this manu-script, Dr. Ganju and colleagues demonstrate that the Slit/Robo complex inhibits Akt phosphorylation and Rac activation that result from the interaction of the chemokine SDF- 1 (CXCL 12) with its seven-transmembrane receptor, CXCR 4. The Slit li-gands and Robo receptors, originally identified as modulators of neuronal migration, have more recently been characterized as inhibitors of specific chemokine-mediated inflammatory re-sponses [1].
