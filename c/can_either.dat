5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a protective coat of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
5000|$|If ę is {{the final}} letter of a word orfollowed by either l or ł, some Poles will {{pronounce}} it simply as [...] For example, będę ("I will (be)") <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> [...] or , and dziękuję ("thank you") <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> [...] or [...]|$|R

5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Damage from {{enemies to}} the player's {{characters}} affect an endurance and health pool. While endurance regenerates after combat, health {{can only be}} restored by resting. The party <b>can</b> <b>either</b> set up camp, or rest in an inn. If a character in the party has their endurance drained, they are knocked out {{until the end of}} combat. If a companion has their health reduced to zero they die permanently.|$|E
5|$|If the PCMR submits {{an adverse}} report, Parliament <b>can</b> <b>either</b> make {{amendments}} to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs.

5000|$|The words {{diaphoresis}} and hidrosis both <b>can</b> mean <b>either</b> perspiration (in which {{sense they}} are synonymous with sweating) or excessive perspiration (in which sense they <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> synonymous with hyperhidrosis or differentiable from it only by clinical criteria involved in narrow specialist senses of the words).|$|R
25|$|NAD-BD - <b>can</b> bind <b>either</b> NAD+ or NADP+.|$|R
5|$|It {{can also}} enter as {{dissolved}} organic carbon through rivers and is converted by photosynthetic organisms into organic carbon. This <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells and bones as calcium carbonate. It circulates in this layer {{for long periods of}} time before either being deposited as sediment or being returned to surface waters through thermohaline circulation.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a high voltage, three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system users <b>can</b> <b>either</b> {{adapt to}} {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
50|$|TAA {{strategies}} <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> discretionary or systematic.|$|R
5000|$|Reactions <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> {{ring-opening}} or ring-closing (electrocyclization).|$|R
50|$|The low-resistance path <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> {{localized}} (filamentary) or homogeneous. Both effects <b>can</b> occur <b>either</b> {{throughout the}} entire distance between the electrodes or only in proximity {{to one of the}} electrodes. Filamentary and homogenous switching effects can be distinguished by measuring the area dependence of the low-resistance state.|$|R
5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} opening in the body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E
5|$|Pussy Riot's {{performances}} <b>can</b> <b>either</b> {{be called}} dissident art or political action that engages art forms. Either way, our performances are {{a kind of}} civic activity amidst the repressions of a corporate political system that directs its power against basic human rights and civil and political liberties.|$|E
5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form oxaloacetate. This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of oxaloacetate in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5000|$|Corporation: The {{owners of}} a {{corporation}} have limited liability and the business has a separate legal personality from its owners. Corporations <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> government-owned or privately owned. They <b>can</b> organize <b>either</b> for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect {{a board of directors}} to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation <b>can</b> be <b>either</b> privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{character}} creation screen players choose what class {{they would like}} to play as. Beginning classes include Swordsman, Mage, Thief, and Scout. The Korean servers also include a robot-riding Machine class. New players begin on a map called Tutorial, as the name states, it explains to the player basic game commands. Further class progression is only allowed within the scope of the class chosen at character creation. The only time that the classes split again is during the first class advancement where each Swordsman, Mage, Thief, or Scout, must choose between two [...] "sub-classes". A Swordsman <b>can</b> become <b>either</b> a Knight or Warrior. A Mage <b>can</b> become <b>either</b> a Priest or a Wizard. A Thief <b>can</b> become <b>either</b> a Rogue or Ninja, and a Scout <b>can</b> become <b>either</b> an Archer or Gunner.|$|R

5|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery syndrome (SMA) is {{an extremely}} rare life-threatening condition that <b>can</b> <b>either</b> be congenital and chronic, or induced and acute. SMA Syndrome is characterised by compression of the duodenum between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, and maywhen congenitalresult from a short suspensory muscle. One surgical treatment is Strong's operation, which involves cutting the suspensory muscle, though this is not often carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dawn of Mana {{is called the}} Mono system, based around the Havok physic engine. Almost all objects in the game, {{including}} enemies, are moveable, allowing Keldric to throw objects at enemies, or even throw other monsters. Keldric <b>can</b> <b>either</b> throw objects in the direction he is facing, or can target a specific enemy or object to aim at them. When something is thrown near an enemy, they Panic, resulting in a counter over their head that counts down to zero to end the Panic. While panicked, enemies take more damage from attacks and spells. Defeating enemies when they are panicked gives the player two types of medals, which <b>can</b> <b>either</b> boost the player's health and attack damage, or mana and magic damage. Throwing multiple objects can Panic enemies more; when the Panic meter is greater than 99 the player can receive better medals. Defeating enemies also grants experience points, which raise Keldric and Faye's level up {{to a maximum of}} four, granting higher health, mana, and damage, and granting new spells and attacks. In addition to being throwable, many objects in the game are also destructible.|$|E
5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it <b>can</b> <b>either</b> {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running animal {{to proceed with}} an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, or try to intimidate it into running.|$|E
