Interspersed heating reduced the lives to initiate and grow cracks to 2 mm and this is attributed to the softening of strain hardened material at the crack tip, but no effect was observed for longer crack lengths.

40|$|Today, {{intricate}} {{problems of}} surface treatment {{can be solved}} through precision cladding using advanced laser technology. Metallic and carbidic coatings have been produced with high power lasers for years, and current investigations show that laser cladding is also a promising technique {{for the production of}} dense and precisely localized ceramic layers. In the present work, powders based on Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 were used to <b>clad</b> <b>aluminium</b> light alloys. The compact layers are up to 1 mm thick and show a non-porous cast structure as well as a homogeneous network of vertical cracks. The high adhesive strength is due to several chemical and mechanical bonding mechanisms and may exceed that of plasma-sprayed coatings. Compared to thermal spray techniques, the material deposition is strictly focused onto small functional areas of the workpiece. Thus, being a precision technique, laser cladding is not recommended for large-area coatings. Examples of applications are filigree parts of pump casings...|$|E

Cerium-based {{conversion}} coatings {{are being}} investigated as alternatives to chromating treatments for the corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys {{because of the}} environmentally unfriendly nature of the chromating process. This study investigates the surface film composition, structure and corrosion performance following a two-step surface treatment for an AA 2024 -T 3 <b>clad</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy. The two-step treatment comprised of an initial cerium conversion process involving immersion in an aqueous solution containing Ce 3 + ions at 75 °C followed by immersion in a propylene glycol solution at 75 °C. The coating surface morphology, composition and structure have been studied using SEM, XPS, Auger spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, while corrosion resistance was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The coating formed by the two-step treatment is an interconnecting fibrous (pseudo) boehmite layer with the incorporation of Ce 3 + in the film. This two step treatment coating exhibits high impedance compared with the coatings formed through exposure to just stage 1 or stage 2 of the two-step treatment and shows good potential for improved corrosion protection...|$|E
40|$|Fractographic {{observations}} on fatigue tested 2024 T 3 <b>clad</b> <b>aluminium</b> riveted lap-splice joints indicate oblique fronts {{after the initial}} surface or corner crack at a rivet hole has penetrated through the sheet thichness. No stress intensity factor solutions are available for this geometry subjected to remote biaxial tension, remote bending, rivet loading, and rivet interference, which are typical for a pressurized fuselage of a transport aircraft. However, comparisons are made with solutions from the literature for remote tension and bending. To reduce model generation time for each crack geometry, one finite element mesh is used to generate a model for each crack geometry for which a stress intensity factor solution is desired. In using this procedure, the original orthogonal mesh, a mesh where all of the crack plane elements are orthogonal to one another, is modified to accommodate the new crack geometries; therefore, maintaining an orthogonal crack-front mesh is not possible. The validity of the three dimensional Virtual Crack Closure Technique, 30 VCCT, with non orthogonal finite element meshes for calculating mode I stress intensity factors is assessed. Comparisons are made to existing two and three dimensional stress intensity factor solutions obtained using conformal mapping, boundary collocation, and finite element analysis. Given a sufficiently fine mess, the 30 VCCT result is practically invariant to mesh pattern. Using the 30 VCCT with a non orthogonal mesh, a cursory sensitivity study is accomplished to asses {{the effect of the}} crack profile of a through crack on the stress intensity factor. If a through crack with an oblique elliptical shape is approximated as a straight crack, the stress intensity factors are nearly the same for remote tension but not for remote bending.

40|$|During {{manufacture}} and maintenance the fuselage skin of aircraft {{are susceptible to}} damage {{in the form of}} scratches. Normally not considered to be of major concern to aircraft structural integrity some airlines discovered fatigue cracks had initiated at the root of scratches. Crack propagation was in the through thickness direction and if left untreated could cause rapid decompression of the passenger cabin. Standard repair methodology requires patches be riveted around scratch damage and in extreme cases could require entire replacement of affected skin panels. Laser shock peening (LSP) is an emerging surface treatment that has been shown to improve fatigue performance of safety critical components by inducing a surface layer of compressive residual stress. In this work LSP was applied along the scratch damage in an effort to restore pristine fatigue performance. The aim of the project was to model the effect on fatigue crack growth rate of residual stress fields induced via LSP and to validate predictions by comparison to experimental test results. The scratches were recreated under controlled laboratory conditions using a diamond tipped tool. This process allowed creation of reproducible V shaped scribes to controlled depth, wall angle and root radius. Scribes of depth 50 and 150 μm with root radius 5 μm were created in dogbone shaped samples of 2 mm thick 2024 ‐T 351 <b>clad</b> <b>aluminium.</b> Samples were tested in fatigue at an R = 0. 1 and maximum stress of 200 MPa. The scribe damage reduced fatigue life compared to the pristine material by a factor of 22. Scribed samples were processed using LSP treatment from different providers that created known residual stress fields in the material. The fatigue life of scribed samples after peening varied from a further decrease to a 13 times increase dependent on the residual stress field induced. An elastic‐plastic crack closure based finite element model was created to determine the effect on stress intensity factor and stress ratio of residual stress. Fatigue lives calculated were within a factor of 2 of experimental lives. It was predicted that crack closure was present during up to 80 % of the applied load cycle due to the compressive residual stress field. However plasticity induced crack closure actually reduced after peening because the compressive residual stress field induced a smaller plastic zone at the crack tip and hence reduced the plastic wake. A residual stress based fatigue life sensitivity study was performed to optimise the profile of the residual stress field for improved fatigue performance. The required profile was created in test samples using LSP. The fatigue life of peened samples increased by a factor of up to 15 however pristine life was not fully recovered. A restriction imposed by the industrial application was peening applied to one face only. This created an unbalanced stress field that resulted in sample distortion to maintain equilibrium. The distortion induced out of plane bending stresses during testing and caused premature crack initiation on the unpeened face. However using interrupted fatigue tests it was found that although crack initiation also occurred {{at the root of the}} scribes the cracks were arrested after 24 μm of propagation. This was consistent with the findings of the crack growth prediction model...|$|E
