40|$|Throughout {{the first}} {{century and a half}} of our nation’s history, federal courts treated equity as a type of general law. They applied a uniform, {{freestanding}} body of principles derived from the English Court of Chancery to all equitable issues that came before them, regardless of whether a case arose under federal or state law. In 1945, in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, the United States Supreme Court held that, notwithstanding the changes wrought by the Erie Doctrine, federal courts may continue to rely on these traditional principles of equity to determine the availability <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief,</b> such as injunctions, even in cases arising under state law. This so-called “equitable remedial rights doctrine” is based on an anachronistic misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} federal equity power. Equity should not be understood as a single, independent body of principles that a federal court must apply in all cases that come before it. Rather, a federal court’s power to impose an equitable remedy stems, if at all, from the legal authority that establishes the underlying right. For state-law claims, a federal court must apply state statutes and precedents—not uniform, centrally devised federal standards—to determine the availability <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief.</b> The manner in which state-created rights are protected is as much a matter of substantive state policy as a state’s initial creation and allocation of those rights. When adjudicating a federal statutory claim, the underlying federal statute itself governs the availability <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> relief; a federal court may presume Congress intended that traditional equitable principles apply as a matter of statutory interpretation, unless the statute’s text or legislative history contains a clear statement to the contrary. Finally, for constitutional claims, federal courts may apply traditional equitable principles as a matter of constitutional common law, unless Congress displaces them with a valid alternative remedial scheme...|$|R

25|$|Judge Pine {{began the}} hearing on schedule. The steel {{companies}} {{focused on the}} issue <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief.</b> The employers' attorneys pointed out {{that they could not}} make a claim for relief if the courts found the seizure illegal. Additionally, the Federal Tort Claims Act required the government to give its consent to be sued for relief, and this the government had not done. Judge Pine pressed the steel company attorneys to address the constitutional issue, which the government had strongly emphasized in its briefs. Most of the company attorneys seemed shocked by Pine's request, and were unable to address the issue. But Charles Tuttle, counsel for Armco Steel, squarely argued the issue. In his counter-argument the following day, Baldridge claimed that the courts had no authority to enjoin the President of the United States and then argued that the court should ignore the constitutional issue if it could decide the case on grounds of equity. Baldridge relied heavily on Ex parte Merryman 17 F. Cas. 144 (1861), Mississippi v. Johnson 71 U.S. 475 (1866), In re Debs 158 U.S. 564 (1895) and United States v.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} trace the {{evolution}} of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against the forfeiture of leases from the early 17 th century cases through {{to the present day}} in the United Kingdom jurisdiction. Although the celebrated case of Sanders v Pope, decided in 1806, marked a trend towards a more flexible (discretionary) approach to <b>equitable</b> <b>relief,</b> this was to be short lived following Lord Eldon’s judgment in Hill v Barclay in 1811 declining to grant relief against forfeiture of a lease for a wilful breach of covenant not involving the failure to pay rent even where the same was capable of adequate compensation. This remained the position until 1973, when the House of Lords in Shiloh Spinners Ltd v Harding took the opportunity to review the whole question of the scope of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against forfeitures. What emerged was a principled approach to the grant <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> which was not limited to the two orthodox heads of relief: (a) where the right to forfeit was inserted by way of security for the payment of rent and (b) where the breach had been occasioned by fraud, accident, mistake or surprise. The Shiloh ruling {{paved the way for the}} granting of relief for breaches of other covenants in the same way as that in the case of rent, namely, to prevent a forfeiture where the landlord may be adequately compensated and receive proper undertakings as to future performance, so that the forfeiture clause is merely security to achieve these results. The article also examines the current scope of equity’s jurisdiction to relieve against forfeiture given that the court’s statutory power to grant relief has been gradually extended in the landlord and tenant context from the single case of non-payment of rent till it has reached its present dimensions of a broadly based jurisdiction to relieve against virtually all forms of default by the tenant, sub-tenant or mortgagee. What emerges is a more limited, but no less significant, equitable power to grant relief outside the court’s statutory jurisdiction. In jurisprudential terms, it is argued, equity’s ability to prevent the unconscionable exercise of legal rights remains at the heart of our common law tradition...|$|R
40|$|In June of 2009, the 111 th Congress {{was asked}} again to {{consider}} the Breastfeeding Promotion Act. During that year, {{for the first time}} in history, the Senate also took up consideration of the issue, and the President of the United States signed into legislation a portion of the Act as included in a healthcare bill. The Breastfeeding Promotion Act is meant to protect a woman’s right to breastfeed in the workplace. The Act accomplishes this goal by: amending the Civil Rights Act to ensure that breastfeeding will be considered a protected act in the workplace, amending the Fair Labor Standards Act to require large employers to provide space and time for breastfeeding when it is reasonable to do so, and providing a tax credit to businesses that adopt workplace friendly breastfeeding support measures. This Note examines the benefits of breastfeeding, why breastfeeding is an issue in the workplace, and which portions of the Breastfeeding Promotion Act sufficiently respond to the issues women face without unnecessary governmental interference. This Note will also discuss the ways in which the Act goes too far and would impose a burden on society that likely does not match the benefits to be gained from its provisions. Namely, this Note will conclude that the tax credit provisions suggested in the Breastfeeding Promotion Act would impose too great a financial burden on the American taxpayers in light of the inconclusive nature of many breastfeeding studies. This Note concludes that the appropriate measure for workplace breastfeeding support is exactly as it stands—federal support in the form <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> for those obstructing a woman 2 ̆ 7 s right to breastfeed, with financial support left to an employer 2 ̆ 7 s individual discretion...|$|R

We have generally been much less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights. ...

40|$|The {{standard}} for granting preliminary injunctions {{in some states}} {{is not the same}} as the preliminary injunction standard that is followed in the federal district courts in the federal circuit where the state is located. For example, the interlocutory injunction standard in Georgia’s superior courts is not as demanding as the preliminary injunction standard in Georgia’s federal courts. Although state and federal courts in Georgia consider four similar factors in deciding whether to grant or deny provisional injunctive relief, a balancing or sliding scale approach can be used in Georgia’s courts; the moving party need not prove all four of the factors. In contrast, the Eleventh Circuit insists that the plaintiff must clearly establish the burden of persuasion on each of the four elements. This difference between the preliminary injunction standards followed in a state’s courts and the federal courts in that state implicates the principles announced in Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins and that venerable decision’s progeny. Specifically, should a federal district court in Georgia apply the Eleventh Circuit’s standard in a diversity case or does the Erie doctrine require it to apply Georgia’s {{standard for}} interlocutory injunctions. It is reasonable to assume that a plaintiff seeking to enjoin particular conduct by a diverse defendant would prefer the Georgia standard and forum shop by filing his or her claim in a Georgia superior court, and that the diverse defendant would, in turn, remove the case to federal district court if possible. Also, it is conceivable, given the discrepancy between the standards, that there could be a difference in outcome on the grant or denial of provisional injunctive relief depending on which standard is applied, with the plaintiff favoring Georgia’s interlocutory injunction standard because it is not as demanding as the Eleventh Circuit’s standard. Notwithstanding the possibility of forum shopping and different outcomes on the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, this article concludes that a federal district court should apply its circuit’s standard, not the forum state’s standard. This conclusion is not justified by saying Federal Rule 65 (a) is on point and controls, or because the choice of the appropriate standard is simply a matter of procedure. Rather, it is justified by analyzing and weighing the several factors that were announced by the U. S. Supreme Court in Hanna v. Plumer and Byrd v. Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative for the typical unguided Erie choice. Of the these factors the most important are that the differences between the standards do not cause litigant inequality, that the forum state’s and the federal circuit’s interests in the grant or denial <b>of</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> are not at odds but congruent, and that the grant or denial <b>of</b> this interim <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> is provisional and not a final adjudication on the merits <b>of</b> the plaintiff’s <b>claim.</b> Moreover, given the similarity of the four criteria weighed by the respective courts, there is a good chance that the state court and a federal district court in the forum state would, on the same set of facts, enter substantially similar orders on a plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction...|$|R

40|$|Although American {{common law}} allows punitive damages for {{reckless}} or intentional torts, it will neither allow {{a jury to}} assess punitive damages for breach of contract nor permit enforcement of a contractual damages clause that is deemed to be punitive. This approach is rooted in an early Chancery practice <b>of</b> granting <b>equitable</b> <b>relief</b> from oppressive penal bonds and has been more recently justified {{as a means of}} facilitating efficient breach. Economic efficiency, however, can be accomplished even if punitive damages could be assessed for intentional breach, because the parties would have an incentive to negotiate a release from the first contract to enable both to share in the surplus offered by an intervening contractual opportunity. Moreover, negotiation of an enforceable penalty clause would allow some parties to maximize their utility by exchanging a signal of assurance of performance for a premium fee. Additionally, the French experience invites a fresh look, because – although it generally disallows punitive damages of a judicial origin for any civil wrong, tort or breach of contract [...] it honors freedom of contract and the autonomy of the parties by enforcing a contractual penalty clause (although the court may reduce an excessive contractual penalty). Taking a cue from the French approach, American courts and legislatures should reconsider their refusal to sanction freely negotiated penalty clauses and enforce them {{to the extent that they}} permit the parties to maximize their collective utility...|$|R

It then analyzes the 2006 US Supreme Court decision, eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange, L. L. C., 547 US 388 (2006), which reversed a prevailing general rule in US jurisprudence that courts will issue permanent injunctions against patent infringement absent exceptional circumstances, and held that the existence of an IP infringement itself did not necessarily entitle the right-holder to an injunction. The author places the eBay decision’s restoration of flexibility and discretion to trial court judges in regard to injunctive relief in an international context by showing that the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is likewise flexible, and pointing to the possible lessons in terms of policy choices that post-eBay jurisprudence in the US may offer the law-makers and the judiciary in developing countries in balancing the right-holders’ interest and public interest when deciding to grant an injunction. These policy choices include the amount of compensation considered to be fair and adequate for different types of intellectual property right-holders; the costs of judicial supervision of injunctive remedies and concerns that such remedies may excessively empower right holders; the potential for injunctive remedies to deter legitimate challenges to the validity of asserted rights; and the public interests that warrant authorizing prospective infringement.
