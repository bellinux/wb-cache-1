This work {{was carried out}} to improve the dissolution rate of etodolac using three carriers of known potential to improve solubility and hence dissolution rate of poorly soluble drugs through coevaporation technique. The polymeric surfactant inutec, 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and tromethamine were used at three different drug/carrier ratios.

DSC of coevaporates at 1 : 5 drug/carrier ratio providing the fastest dissolution rate suggested loss of ET crystallinity which was further confirmed by X-ray diffraction.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify possible test procedures for the evaluation of the strength of <b>chewable</b> <b>tablets</b> with respect to prevention of damage to teeth or mandibular joints when tablets are consumed. Diametral compression and flexure tests were employed to evaluate the strength of commercial samples from five manufacturers of <b>chewable</b> vitamin C <b>tablets.</b> Weibull analysis was used to assess the brittleness of these tablets. The tablets had a lower tensile strength value when determined by the diametral compression test compared to the flexure test ratio which ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 4. The value for the Weibull modulus ranged from 5 to 16, indicating an appreciable degree of brittleness of the samples. Relating the values for the mechanical strength to suggested practical values for the prevention of damage to the teeth or the mandibular joints indicated that most tablets exceeded these values. The flexure test reflects the practical situation closest, and a limiting tensile strength value of 2 MPa should not be exceeded for <b>chewable</b> <b>tablets.</b> The tablet batches tested were also characterized by a large batch-to-batch variability, suggesting uncontrolled manufacturing procedures.

40|$|Background: Montelukast (MT) is a {{leukotriene}} D 4 antagonist. It is {{an effective}} and safe medicine for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic asthma. It {{is also used to}} prevent acute exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and as a symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of two drug products: generic MT 5 mg <b>chewable</b> <b>tablets</b> versus the branded drug Singulair® pediatric 5 mg <b>chewable</b> <b>tablets</b> among Mediterranean volunteers. Methods: An open-label, randomized two-period crossover BE design was conducted in 32 healthy male volunteers with a 9 -day washout period between doses and under fasting conditions. The drug concentrations in plasma were quantified by using a newly developed and fully validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental model. The ratio for generic/branded tablets using geometric least squares means was calculated for both the MT products. Results: The relationship between concentration and peak area ratio was found to be linear within the range 6. 098 – 365. 855 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (R 2) was always greater than 0. 99 during the course of the validation. Statistical comparison of the main pharmacokinetic parameters showed no significant difference between the generic and branded products. The point estimates (ratios of geometric means) were 101. 2 %, 101. 6 %, and 98. 11 % for area under the curve (AUC) 0 →last, AUC 0 →inf, and Cmax, respectively.

Methods: Patients were recruited from 3 osteoporosis units and university hospitals in Brussels, Liege, and Ghent, Belgium. Adult patients at risk for calcium and vitamin D deficiencies were enrolled. The study drugs included 2 formulations of a dietary supplement containing a combination of calcium plus vitamin D- 3 : chewable tablets (calcium carbonate, 1250 mg; vitamin D- 3, 400 IU) (A) and effervescent powder (calcium carbonate, 1250 mg; vitamin D- 3, 440 IU) (B).

40|$|The cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC 4, LTD 4, and LTE 4, play an {{integral}} {{role in the}} pathophysiology of asthma. Acting via the type 1 leukotriene (CysLT 1) receptor, these proinflammatory mediators have numerous effects in the lungs, including decreased activity of respiratory cilia, increased mucus secretion, increased venopermeability, and promotion of eosinophil migration into airway mucosa. Blocking studies show that Cys-LTs are pivotal mediators in the pathophysiology of asthma. Cys-LTs are key components in the early and late allergic airway response and also contribute to bronchial obstruction after exercise and hyperventilation of cold, dry air in asthmatics. Effects of the cysteinyl leukotrienes are blocked by leukotriene receptor antagonists; these agents inhibit bronchoconstriction in normal subjects provoked with inhaled cysteinyl leukotrienes, {{as well as in}} patients with asthma undergoing allergen, exercise, cold air, or aspirin challenge. Montelukast is a potent and selective blocker of the CysLT 1 receptor.
