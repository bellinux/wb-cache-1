50|$|One {{review of}} the CJP data showed that jurors who were asked a {{hypothetical}} question regarding how much certain <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> would influence their sentencing decisions were true, 56.2 percent of the jurors would consider a lesser sentence than death if a history of mental illness was presented as a <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor</b> and 73.6 percent would do so if evidence of mental retardation were presented. However, another {{review of the}} data showed {{the race of the}} victim had a substantial effect on jury failure to find <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors.</b> If the victim were white there was more failure to find <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court {{held that}} all {{relevant}} <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> {{must be considered}} in the penalty phase of a death penalty case. It is not sufficient to allow the defendant to present <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> during the trial if those factors are not considered in the sentencing. If the jury is not instructed to consider all relevant <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> the defendant's Eighth Amendment rights are violated as failure to do so constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that Tennard's IQ was a relevant <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor,</b> and that the sentencing jury should have been made to consider it for the purposes of mitigation.|$|R
50|$|Thus {{the court}} struck down jury {{instructions}} in {{death penalty cases}} that do not ask about <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> including {{a consideration of the}} defendant's social, medical, and psychological history, saying that the jury must be instructed to consider <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> even when answering unrelated questions. This ruling suggests that an expanded explanation including these factors be given in the jury instructions to insure the jury weighs all the <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The United States Supreme Court (in Penry v. Lynaugh) and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (in Bigby v.

This ruling suggests specific explanations to the jury are necessary to weigh <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors.</b>|$|R

40|$|My aim in {{this thesis}} is to examine whether there are some <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> i. e. reasons to punish an {{offender}} less for his crime than an otherwise similar offender (other than that the offender suffered from mental disorder or disturbance {{or other forms of}} irrationality at the time of offence), that are more applicable to socially deprived offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders. I will answer the thesis question through a critical examination of twelve arguments for claiming that there is a <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor</b> that is more applicable to socially deprived offenders, each proposing a different <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor.</b> My conclusions are as follows: (1) Most of the arguments that I examine fail, i. e. they either fail to highlight a genuine <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor,</b> or we do not have much evidence that the <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor</b> highlighted by the argument has a greater applicability to socially deprived offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders. (2) However, one argument, which can be called the no violation of natural duties argument, is successful. (3) Moreover, the improvement of the worst off argument, an argument that is not often discussed in the literature, is particularly noteworthy. If my discussion about that argument is correct, then even if, as I will argue, the <b>mitigating</b> <b>factor</b> highlighted by that argument may not be more applicable to socially deprived offenders than to non-socially deprived offenders, the remaining parts of that argument would still have profound influence on punishment in our unjust societies. </p...|$|R

30|$|The Australian {{system has}} greater scope for {{consideration}} of individual circumstances and <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors,</b> {{since most of}} the cancellation decisions require an exercise of discretion by the decision-maker. In particular, where the decision to cancel is made by a delegate of the Minister, the decision-maker must take into account mitigating circumstances of the individual against any risk that the person may pose to the Australian community. Even so, {{it is by no means}} clear that <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> have been applied in a consistent and fair manner in exercising the discretion to cancel in the past (Nethery, 2012). Further, while there appears to be some scope for the judiciary to review cancellation decisions in Australia, these avenues are limited due to the wide scope of the discretionary powers. In contrast, in the United States, once a person has been convicted of an ‘aggravated felony’, there is no room for <b>mitigating</b> <b>factors</b> against the deportation to be considered by the judiciary.
