5|$|As the United States was {{initiating}} the Marshall Plan, Kennan and the Truman administration {{hoped that the}} Soviet Union's rejection of Marshall aid would strain its relations with its Communist allies in Eastern Europe. Kennan initiated a series of efforts to exploit the schism between the Soviets and Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia. Kennan proposed conducting <b>covert</b> <b>action</b> in the Balkans to further decrease Moscow's influence.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{is remembered}} in the CIA {{as its first}} {{successful}} Director of Central Intelligence, {{and one of its}} most effective, who redefined its structure and mission. The CIA's expansive <b>covert</b> <b>action</b> program remained the responsibility of Frank Wisner's quasi-independent Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), but Smith began to bring OPC under the DCI's control. In early January 1951 he made Allen Dulles the first Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), to supervise both OPC and the CIA's separate espionage organization, the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Not until January 1952 were all intelligence functions consolidated under a Deputy Director for Intelligence (DDI). Wisner succeeded Dulles as DDP in August 1951, and it took until August 1952 to merge the OSO and the OPC, each of which had its own culture, methods, and pay scales, into an effective, single directorate.|$|E

25|$|The CIA had {{different}} demands placed on {{it by the}} different bodies overseeing it. Truman wanted a centralized group to organize the information that reached him, the Department of Defense wanted military intelligence and <b>covert</b> <b>action,</b> and the State Department wanted to create global political change favorable to the US. Thus the two areas {{of responsibility for the}} CIA were <b>covert</b> <b>action</b> and covert intelligence. One of the main targets for intelligence gathering was the Soviet Union, which had also been a priority of the CIA's predecessors.|$|E
5000|$|Enacted on September 21, 1980, The Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980 {{provided}} that the heads of intelligence agencies would keep the oversight committees [...] "fully and currently informed" [...] of their activities including [...] "any significant anticipated intelligence activity."

40|$|Does {{the revelation}} of <b>covert</b> <b>actions</b> affect a leader’s popularity? The primary {{purpose of this study}} is to {{investigate}} whether such effect exists and, if yes, to determine the extent to which it has an influence on the U. S. President’s popularity. This thesis consists of preliminary case classification part, from which I proceed to my qualitative studies of the matter. The case classification part consists of 16 cases of U. S. <b>covert</b> <b>actions</b> during the Cold War period. I classify my cases based on whether they have been exposed or not, as well as I look whether their exposure had an effect on the U. S. President’s popularity. If there was an effect, I further differentiate them depending on their regime type. This procedure helped me to select my two in-depth case studies. I have conducted two in-depth case studies of U. S. <b>covert</b> <b>actions</b> in Chile (1970 - 73) and Nicaragua (1980 s). Throughout the case studies, I have examined the effect of exposure on popularity in the following dimensions: media coverage, congressional investigations, presidential approval ratings, and election results. Based on the results of case studies, it is concluded that the disclosure of <b>covert</b> <b>actions</b> had a less significant effect that lasted on a temporary basis and did not have a major impact in a longer perspective. Overall, this study advances our understanding of causal mechanisms that shape the effect of covert actions’ exposure in influencing a U. S. President’s popularity...|$|R

25|$|After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Hunt was re-assigned as Executive Assistant to Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Allen Dulles.

25|$|DI McCone had {{statutory}} {{control over}} all intelligence committees, but in reality, {{but the military}} had near total control of the DIA, the NRO, the NSA, and many other aspects.

25|$|Unlike the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), {{which is}} a {{domestic}} security service, the CIA has no law enforcement function and is mainly focused on overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. Though {{it is not the}} only U.S. government agency specializing in HUMINT, the CIA serves as the national manager for coordination of HUMINT activities across the US intelligence community. Moreover, the CIA is the only agency authorized by law to carry out and oversee <b>covert</b> <b>action</b> at the behest of the President. It exerts foreign political influence through its tactical divisions, such as the Special Activities Division.|$|E

The CIA was the successor organization of the OSS. Hunt became the OPC Station Chief in Mexico City in 1950, and recruited and supervised William F. Buckley Jr., who worked in Hunt's OPC Station in Mexico during the period 1951–1952. Buckley and Hunt remained lifelong friends and Buckley became godfather to Hunt's first three children.|$|E

The Inspector General of the CIA investigated the Bay of Pigs. His conclusion was that there was a need to drastically improve the organization and management of the CIA.

25|$|The coup {{was carried}} out by the U.S. {{administration}} of Dwight D.

Much of the money was channeled through the pro-Shah Ayatollah Mohammad Behbahani, who drew many religious masses to the plot. Ayatollah Kashani had completely turned on Mossadegh and supported the Shah, by this point.|$|E

This Directorate was created in an attempt to end years of rivalry over influence, philosophy and budget between the United States Department of Defense (DOD) and the CIA.
