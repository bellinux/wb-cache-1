The reward for {{being part of}} a group, society, and even the world through a P2P network {{is one of the greatest}} benefits that a modern common-pool resource can provide.The ability to connect and create with people from different cultures, ethnicities, and beliefs is something thought to be impossible 100 years ago. Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place the computer in a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E

50|$|Rehearsals {{are also}} used to teach {{ensemble}} members about music history and basic performance practice, {{so that they can}} learn the different playing styles and tones used in music from different eras.

Amateur choirs use rehearsals to build choral singing skills, such as singing with a good ensemble and with solid intonation and vocal tone. Amateur groups are much more likely than professional groups to hold sectional rehearsals. Another difference between rehearsals in an amateur orchestra and a professional orchestra is the number of rehearsals. A community orchestra or university ensemble may have ten or even fifteen rehearsals over several months to prepare a major symphony; a professional orchestra might prepare that same symphony in two rehearsals over two days.|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He read up on psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

The A.V.

VanDerWerff also felt that a monologue delivered by O'Quinn {{was an example of}} Morgan and Wong's best writing, and that the actor's delivery was the key to keeping the scene serious in tone. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, noting that it [...] "starts Season 2 off in high style". Gibron found that the episode [...] "has a nice sense of internal adventure to it, giving us a <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> more about our main players while setting the groundwork for some certified surreality to come". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Beginning and the End" [...] two-and-a-half stars out of five.
