5|$|The UK Independence Party (UKIP) <b>candidate</b> {{was chosen}} via a {{selection}} committee, unlike previous mayoral <b>candidate</b> selections {{that had been}} made by London-based party members. The supposed favourite for selection among party members was Suzanne Evans, UKIP Deputy Chairman, former Interim Leader, Welfare Spokesman and <b>candidate</b> for Shrewsbury and Atcham in the 2015 general election. Press such as The Spectator speculated that the decision had been moved to a committee to allow for the selection of national party leader Nigel Farage's preferred <b>candidate,</b> Peter Whittle, Culture Spokesman and <b>candidate</b> for Eltham in the 2015 general election. UKIP claimed that the changed selection process was intended to produce a <b>candidate</b> with the potential for receiving the most votes. Whittle was eventually selected, and announced as the <b>candidate</b> at the UKIP party conference on 26 September 2015.

Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's <b>candidate</b> and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised.

Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise <b>candidate</b> would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise <b>candidate,</b> but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular <b>candidate.</b> After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise <b>candidate,</b> but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E
