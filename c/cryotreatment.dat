40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} to {{investigate}} the wear behavior of carburized JIS SNCM 415 Ni-Cr-Mo steel being cryotreated and followed by carbide spray coating for achieving improvement in wear resistance. Comparative specimens of JIS SNCM 439 steel were quenched and tempered to 45 HRC to obtain a similar surface condition as the carburized JIS SNCM 415 samples. The thickness of WC/Co coatings of 125 µm was deposited {{with the use of}} high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) process. The microhardness of the WC/Co coatings has been found to achieve 1025 ± 75 HV. A series of wear tests have been carried out on steel samples subjected to various conditions under 95. 9 N with 180 rpm on a dry block-on-roller tester. From the result of 12 hr wear tests, the mass loss of carburized SNCM 415 steel through <b>cryotreatment</b> was 0. 025 g improved from 0. 05 g of steel without <b>cryotreatment.</b> In addition, the mass loss of carburized SNCM 415 specimen under <b>cryotreatment</b> and HVOF process was further decreased from 0. 025 g to 0. 002 g. The mass loss of comparative JIS SNCM 439 steel coated by the HVOF process was decreased to 0. 002 g from 0. 045 g of steel without coating. The results clearly establish that <b>cryotreatment</b> and HVOF process significantly improve the surface hardness and wear resistance of carburized JIS SNCM 415 steel...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} effect of {{cryogenic}} treatment on mechanical properties of cold work tool steels at various combination of heat treatment cycle (process sequence) are studied. The material selected for these processes are AISI D 2 and D 3. Cryogenic treatment is commonly referred as <b>cryotreatment,</b> is an add-on process {{to the conventional}} heat treatment of tool steel. Cryogenic treatment improves hardness, microstructure of metal (retained austenite to marten site), dimensional stability and decreases residual stresses. The effects of these process sequences of <b>cryotreatment</b> on properties of tool steel were studied by conducting some laboratory tests.

40|$|The embryogenic cell {{suspension}} culture of Gentiana cruciata, cryopreserved by the encapsulation/dehydration method, survived both short- (48  h) and long-term (1. 5  years) cryostorage {{with more than}} 80 % viability. To assess the influence of <b>cryotreatments</b> on the embryogenic potential, a proembryogenic mass was encapsulated and exposed to the following treatments: (1) osmotic dehydration (OD), (2) OD + air desiccation (AD) and (3) OD + AD + cryostorage (LN). The somatic embryogenesis efficiency increased ten times after osmotic dehydration. The AD and LN <b>cryotreatments</b> did not cause any significant alterations in somatic embryo production. We monitored the (epi) genetic stability of 288 regenerants derived from: non-cryotreated, short-term, and long-term cryostored tissue using metAFLP markers and ten primer combinations. Changes in the sequence and DNA methylation levels were studied by subjecting the DNA to digestion with two pairs of isoschisomer restriction enzymes (KpnI/MseI and Acc 65 I/MseI). Two new AFLP unique DNA fragments at the DNA sequence level, with no differences at the methylation level, were found between regenerants derived from cryopreserved tissue, compared with the non-cryotreated controls. The Acc 65 I/MseI methylation levels for the three groups of regenerants were not significantly different. Cluster analysis was capable of identifying a number of sub-clusters. Only one of the sub-clusters comprises almost all regenerants derived from non-cryotreated and short-term cryostored tissue. Plantlets derived from long-term cryostored tissue were grouped into separate clusters. The observed AFLP alterations {{did not appear to}} be associated with the use of cryopreservation, but were probably related to the process of in vitro culture...|$|R
40|$|Background We {{previously}} reported a limb-salvage technique by treating tumor-bearing bone with liquid nitrogen. We also reported systemic antitumor immunity was enhanced by <b>cryotreatment</b> in a murine osteosarcoma (LM 8) model. We therefore combined the <b>cryotreatment</b> of tumor with dendritic cells to promote tumor-specific immune responses. Questions/purposes We determined whether our technique could enhance systemic immune response and inhibit metastatic tumor growth in a murine osteosarcoma model. Materials and Methods To evaluate {{activation of the}} immune response, we prepared six groups of C 3 H mice (80 mice total) : (1) excision only, (2) dendritic cells without reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor, (3) reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor alone, (4) dendritic cells combined with reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor, (5) dendritic cells exposed to cryotreated tumor lysates without reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor, and (6) dendritic cells exposed to cryotreated tumor lysates with reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor. We then compared and verified the activation state of each group's antitumor immunity. Results Mice that received dendritic cells exposed to cryotreated tumor lysates with reimplantation of the cryotreated primary tumor group had high serum interferon γ, reduced pulmonary metastases, and increased numbers of CD 8 (+) T lymphocytes in the metastatic areas. Conclusions Combining tumor <b>cryotreatment</b> with dendritic cells enhanced systemic immune responses and inhibited metastatic tumor growth.

40|$|Several {{new methods}} have {{recently}} been developed {{for the treatment of}} malignant bone and soft-tissue tumors, and many of these targeted therapies have yielded promising initial results in clinical settings.

40|$|Disc brakes are {{invariably}} used {{in all the}} automobiles {{either to}} reduce the rotational speed of the wheel or to hold the vehicle stationary. During the braking action, the kinetic energy is converted into heat which can result in high temperatures resulting in fading of brake effects. Brake discs produced out of martensite stainless steel (SS 410) are expected to exhibit high wear resistance properties with low value of coefficient of friction. These factors increase the useful life of the brake discs with minimal possibilities of brake fade. To {{study the effects of}} cryogenic treatment on the wear behaviour, two types of brake discs were cryotreated at 98 K for 8 and 24 hours in a specially developed <b>cryotreatment</b> system using liquid nitrogen. Wear properties of the untreated and cryotreated test specimens were experimentally determined using the pin on disc type tribometer (ASTM G 99 - 95). Similarly, the Rockwell hardness (HRC) of the specimens were tested in a hardness tester in accordance with ASTM E 18. In this paper, the effects of <b>cryotreatment</b> on the wear and hardness properties of untreated and cryotreated brake discs are presented.

40|$|Koala sperm {{mitochondria}} {{were examined}} by cryomicroscopy using the fluorescent probe JC- 1, which distinguishes high (red) and low (green) mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). At normal body temperature, similar to 70 % of live and untreated spermatozoa exhibited high MMP whereas < 3 % of live untreated spermatozoa exhibited low potential. A third class, in which single midpieces contained mixed mitochondrial populations, was also detected. Heterogeneity was {{noted in the}} level of MMP between individual koalas, individual spermatozoa and even between mitochondrial gyres within single midpieces. MMP of the live sperm population was not significantly affected by glycerol but was suppressed by freezing and thawing treatments. After thawing, MMP declined significantly during rewarming, especially as the temperature increased from 5 to 35 degrees C. The distribution of the ganglioside GM 1 was examined using fluorescent- labelled cholera toxin B. In fresh, untreated koala spermatozoa GM 1 was detected on the head and midpiece, but not on the principal piece. No significant redistribution of GM 1 was observed after chilling and <b>cryotreatment.</b> Phosphatidylserine translocation across the plasma membrane was examined using fluorescent- labelled annexin V. Few fresh spermatozoa exhibited phosphatidylserine translocation (similar to 1 %); this was not increased by chilling or cryopreservation, thus implying that <b>cryotreatment</b> had little effect on plasma membrane lipid asymmetry...|$|E
40|$|The {{integral}} {{diaphragm pressure}} transducers machined out of precipitation hardened martensite stainless steel (APX 4) {{are widely used}} for propellant pressure measurements in space applications. These transducers are expected to exhibit dimensional stability and linearity for their entire useful life. These vital factors are very critical for the reliable performance and dependability of the pressure transducers. However, these transducers invariably develop internal stresses during various stages of machining. These stresses have an adverse effect {{on the performance of}} the transducers causing deviation from linearity. In order to eliminate these possibilities, it was planned to cryotreat the machined transducers to improve both the long-term linearity and dimensional stability. To study these effects, an experimental <b>cryotreatment</b> unit was designed and developed based on the concept of indirect cooling using the concept of cold nitrogen gas forced closed loop convection currents. The system has the capability of cryotreating large number of samples for varied rates of cooling, soaking and warm-up. After obtaining the initial levels of residual stress and retained austenite using X-ray diffraction techniques, the pressure transducers were cryotreated at 98 K for 36 h. Immediately after <b>cryotreatment,</b> the transducers were tempered at 510 degrees C for 3 h in vacuum furnace. Results after cryo treatment clearly indicated significant reduction in residual stress levels and conversion of retained austenite to martensite. These changes have brought in improvements in long term zero drift and dimensional stability. The cryotreated pressure transducers have been incorporated for actual space applications.

A series of corrosion rate tests have been carried out to cryotreated samples. The specimen were divided into two groups, the first group was subjected to conventional heat treatment process at a temperature of 950 0 C for about 1 hour and the other group was subjected to deep cryogenic treatment for about 36 hours at a temperature of- 193 0 C, followed by tempering at 150 0 C for about 1 hour to both the groups.

40|$|The {{effects of}} destabilization {{treatment}} and destabilization followed by cryogenic treatment {{have been evaluated}} on the microstructural evolution and sand-water slurry erosion behavior of Cr-Mn-Cu white cast irons. The phase transformations after the destabilization and <b>cryotreatment</b> have been characterized by bulk hardness measurement, optical and scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis. The static corrosion rate has been measured in tap water (with pH= 7) and the erosion-corrosion behavior has been studied by slurry pot tester using sand-water slurry. The test {{results indicate that the}} cryogenic treatment has a significant effect in minimizing the as-cast retained austenite content and transforming into martensitic and bainitic matrix embedded with ultra-fine M 7 C 3 alloy carbides. In contrast, by conventional destabilization treatment retained austenite in the matrix are not fully eliminated. The slurry erosive wear resistance has been compared with reference to destabilized and cryotreated high chromium iron samples which are commonly employed for such applications. The cryotreated Cr-Mn-Cu irons have exhibited a comparable erosive wear performance to those of high chromium irons. Higher hardness combined with improved corrosion resistance result in better slurry erosion resistance...|$|E
40|$|Cryotherapy is a {{prospective}} green method for malignant tumor treatment. At low temperature, the cell viability relates with the cooling rate, temperature threshold, freezing interface, {{as well as}} ice formation. In clinical applications, the growth of ice ball must reach a suitable size as cells could not be all killed at the ice periphery. The cell death ratio at the ice periphery {{is important for the}} control of the freezing destruction. The mechanisms of cryoinjury around the ice periphery need thorough understanding. In this paper, a primary freeze-thaw control was carried out in a cell culture microchip. A series of directional freezing processes and cell responses was tested and discussed. The temperature in the microchip was manipulated by a thermoelectric cooler. The necrotic and apoptotic cells under different <b>cryotreatment</b> (duration of the freezing process, freeze-thaw cycle, postculture, etc.) were stained and distinguished by propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -Annexin V. The location of the ice front was recorded and a cell death boundary which was different from the ice front was observed.

The effect of the combination treatment with dendritic cells and antitransforming growth factor-b (anti-TGF-b) antibody on the elimination of regulatory T cells and the inhibition of tumor growth was investigated. Questions/purposes The effects of the combination treatment with dendritic cells and anti-TGF-b antibody on the enhancement of systemic immune responses and inhi-bition of metastatic tumor growth were investigated in a murine osteosarcoma (LM 8) model. Materials and Methods To evaluate activation of the immune response, we established the following three groups of C 3 H mice (60 mice total) : (1) excision only; (2) tumor excision and administration of anti-TGF-b anti-body; and (3) tumor excision and administration of dendritic cells exposed to cryotreated tumor lysates with anti-TGF-b antibody. Results The mice that received dendritic cells exposed to cryotreated tumor lysates with anti-TGF-b antibody showed increased numbers of CD 8 (+) T lymphocytes, reduced regulatory T lymphocytes in the metastatic lesion, and inhibition of metastatic growth.

40|$|Although {{cryosurgery}} {{has been}} shown to be effective in managing advanced malignant bronchial tumours, there is very little in the literature describing its use with benign lesions. In this study, we retrospectively assessed the effectiveness of cryosurgery in the management of non-malignant endobronchial lesions. Between 1995 and 1999, 20 patients with benign tumours and non-neoplastic lesions of the tracheo-bronchial tree were treated with endobronchial cryosurgery. The procedures were performed under general anaesthesia, using specifically designed cryoprobes. The patients were assessed clinically, radiologically and by respiratory function tests before and after each <b>cryotreatment.</b> Over the 5 -year period, each patient received a mean 2. 6 (range 1 – 9) cryo-applications, with no peri-operative deaths. All patients described a subjective improvement in at least one of their symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, stridor, chest pain or dyspnoea) following cryosurgery and 75 % of patients improved in all symptoms. Following surgery, both forced expiratory volume in 1 s (2. 23 ^ 0. 27 vs. 1. 98 ^ 0. 25 l, P, 0 : 05) and forced vital capacity (2. 86 ^ 0. 33 vs. 2. 62 ^ 0. 30 l, P, 0 : 01) improved significantly. In conclusion, cryosurgery can provide effective symptomatic control in patients with non-malignant endobronchial lesions, the majority of whom are discharged on the day of surgery.

40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB and aimed {{to optimize the}} effect of shot peening {{in order to increase}} the bending fatigue limit of planetary gears. In this project three parameters affecting the performance of the shot peening were examined in more detail, specifically the hardness of the shot peening media, the hardness of the material and the amount retained austenite. Shot peening and measurements were performed on carburized gears consisting of ss 92506 steel. In order to find out how the fatigue limit is affected by the material hardness, a number of gears were tempered whereas other remained untempered. Similarly the retained austenite content was altered in some of the gears with a <b>cryotreatment.</b> The shot peening of these gears {{was performed}} by dual shot peening using media of two different hardness. The fatigue limit was evaluated by a servo hydraulic material testing machine. The results show that the fatigue limit is enhanced when the shot peening was performed with hard media. This was expected since the harder media can cause larger plastic deformation in the material giving rise to larger compressive residual stresses which is known to increase the fatigue limit. The fatigue limit was also improved for samples with lower surface hardness. The amount of retained austenite does not seem to affect the fatigue limit for samples shot peened with media of sufficient hardness in order to cause adequate plastic deformation. The surface roughness remained unchanged for samples shot peened by different media, which indicates that this parameter should not hinder a change of media...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Patients with tracheobronchial tumor are too frail for curative surgical treatment, {{and the original}} sites are unsuitable for radical resection. They always suffered from dyspnea, hymoptosis, obstructive pneumonia, and fever. Airway obstruction has a strong bad impact {{on the quality of}} life, and is the main cause of respiratory failure and death. An effective method of palliative is very important. We choose fibro-bronchoscopic cryosurgery for destruction of endobronchial tumors and analyze the outcomes. Methods Clinical records of 126 cases who under went endobronchoscopic cryosurgery were reviewed retrospectively from August 2004 to February 2014. Techniques and survival outcomes were analyzed. The precise position and length of the cryosurgery was evaluated through three dimension chest computed tomography (CT) and reconstruction of trachea and bronchus. Local infiltration and general intravenous anesthesia are two options before surgical procedure. Endobronchial tumor was removed by combining two methods of “Cryo-Resecion” and “Cryo-Melt”. Bronchoscopic examination was rechecked 2 weeks later to evaluate if it is necessary to redo the endobronchoscopic cryosurgery. Results The symptoms of cough, short of breath, and hemoptysis were alleviated to different extend. The rate of dramatically improved and partial improved were 65. 1 % and 77. 0 % respectively. The mortality is 0. 79 %. Postoperative Complications included 2 cases of airway bleeding, 4 cases of bronchial stenosis, 2 cases of trachea burning injury, 2 cases of tracheomalacia, and 3 cases of atrium fibrillation. The median survival is 14 months, 1 -, 2 -, 3 -yr survival rates were 58. 6 %, 24. 2 %, and 12. 2 % respectively, based on Kaplan-Meier estimates. Conclusion Endobronchial cryosurgery is an easy and effective minimally invasive choice for controlling and releasing the airway obstructive symptoms resulting from the trachea or bronchial tumors. Besides, the problem of difficult endotracheal intubation could be resolved after removing the tracheal tumor with the benefit of <b>cryotreatment.</b> Some patients could get the chance for further treatment or radical resection. Therefore, the patients’ quality of life could be improved and the lifetime could be prolonged...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} the prognostic importance of different patient and tumor characteristics in cryotherapy for liver metastases from colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatic cryotherapy {{has been used}} as a treatment of nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer in almost 1000 patients worldwide, and its safety and efficacy are well established. However, tumor eventually recurs in most patients and they die of their disease. The knowledge of prognostic factors would allow the selection of patients who are more likely to benefit from this treatment and patients who may need additional treatment. METHODS: Between April 1990 and May 1997, 195 patients were treated with hepatic cryotherapy. Out of this group, the authors identified 116 patients with colorectal cancer who received cryotherapy for ablation of liver metastases. Survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, using the log-rank test for univariate analysis for significance of possible prognostic factors. For multivariate analysis, a Cox regression was used. RESULTS: One patient (0. 9 %) died of postoperative myocardial infarction. The total perioperative morbidity rate was 27. 6 %. Median survival and the 5 -year survival rate were 26 months and 13. 4 %. The following factors were identified as independently associated with a favorable outcome: low presurgical serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), small (< or = 3 cm) diameter of cryoablated metastases, absence of untreated extrahepatic disease at laparotomy, absence of nodal involvement at primary resection, complete <b>cryotreatment,</b> synchronous development of liver metastases, and good or moderate differentiation of the primary tumor. Although univariate analysis suggested a favorable prognosis in patients who did not receive blood transfusion during surgery and patients younger than 51 years, this was not confirmed in multivariate analysis. In addition, normalization of the serum CEA level after treatment was an important prognostic marker in the subgroup of patients with elevated serum CEA levels before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic cryotherapy is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with nonresectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer, with promising results regarding survival. The prognostic factors established in this series may allow better patient selection to improve the outcome in suitable patients...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{horticulture}} {{involves the}} development of new germlines {{that may or may not}} be suitable commercially depending on various features exhibited by the plants. A l l such varieties may contain useful genotypes for use in future germline developments and so it would be advantageous if samples of each of these could be kept indefinitely. However, due to space constraints commercial growers such as Whetman Pinks Ltd. are unable to do this. The possibility of using cryostorage to preserve the germplasm of Dianthus pinks was investigated. Meristemic shoot-tip tissue was used because of evidence suggesting that it is genetically stable and for the ability to eliminate viruses. Four cryoprotectants were selected (sucrose, glycerol, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), and mannitol) and investigated using high and low concentrations of each, followed by either a one-step freezing treatment (fast cooling involving a direct plunge into liquid nitrogen) or one of two different two-step freezing treatments (slow-cooling). The most successful combination of cryoprotectant and freezing treatment was determined to be sucrose at a concentration of 30 % followed by a two-step freezing process by which tissues are cooled to - 20 °C before being plunged directly into liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C). Viability staining with trypan blue suggests that this protocol encourages approximately a 90 % post-thaw survival rate in shoot-tip tissues. In order to determine the true viability of the tissues after <b>cryotreatment,</b> the shoot-tips needed to be placed into tissue culture and their growth measured over a number of weeks. Due to time constraints on this project and an initial failure to develop suitable growth media, tissue culture could not be used here. The results of this investigation suggest that cryopreservation could be a suitable option for the long-term ex situ storage of Dianthus pink germplasm. However, only one variety of Dianthus pink was used in this investigation and the protocol developed here can only be considered suitable for this one variety. Future investigations will need to determine the most suitable protocols for each individual variety before the commercial use of cryopreservation as a method of storing all Dianthus pink germlines can be considered a viable option.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the studies described in this thesis was to improve the cryopreservation success of koala spermatozoa {{for the purpose of}} establishing a genome resource bank for this species. A defining feature of the studies in this thesis was the implementation of an organelle-specific approach to better understand the causes of koala sperm cryo-injury. The functional attributes of spermatozoa, such as mitochondrial function, plasma membrane fluidity, membrane lipid asymmetry and DNA integrity were assessed as an indication of cryo-injury. Sperm mitochondrial function and plasma membrane integrity were examined by cryomicroscopy using the fluorescent probes JC- 1 and propidium iodide (PI) respectively in a dual staining technique. Cooling and re-warming koala spermatozoa were more detrimental to mitochondrial function than to plasma membrane integrity. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was suppressed by freezing and thawing treatments; after thawing, MMP declined significantly during rewarming (from 5 ºC to 35 ºC). The distribution of GM 1 ganglioside was examined using fluorescent-labelled cholera toxin B. No significant redistribution of GM 1 was observed after chilling or <b>cryotreatment.</b> The externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) was examined using fluorescent-labelled annexin V. There was no significant increase in translocation of PS after chilling or cryopreservation. These observations imply that <b>cryotreatment</b> had little effect on plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Koala spermatozoa were incubated in a range of anisotonic media to investigate whether nuclear swelling was caused by osmotic flux during the cryopreservation process. Although the most hypotonic solution tested (64 mOsm/kg) induced the highest incidence of nuclear relaxation (mean ± SEM; 12 ± 3 %), this was not as severe as that previously documented following cryopreservation. Chromatin relaxation is a phenomenon observed in koala spermatozoa, where the sperm nucleus expands due to the result of structural changes in the natural conformation of the sperm DNA/protamine complex. DNA fragmentation was not a primary cause of cryopreservation-induced sperm chromatin relaxation, although in situ nick translation of putative DNA breaks indicated that these increased as the sperm head became progressively more relaxed. Using a Sperm Chromatin Dispersion test (SCDt) specifically developed and validated for koala spermatozoa, a continuum of nuclear morphotypes was observed, ranging from no apparent DNA fragmentation to spermatozoa with highly dispersed and degraded chromatin. A double comet assay was also developed to investigate DNA fragmentation in the koala spermatozoa. Conducted under neutral followed by alkaline conditions, this assay was able to differentiate between single- (SSB) and double-stranded (DSB) DNA damage in an effort to refine the interpretation of DNA damage in mature koala spermatozoa; the majority of the koala spermatozoa had nuclei with DNA abasic-like residues. The ubiquity of these residues suggested that constitutive alkali-labile sites are part of the structural configuration of the koala sperm nucleus. Spermatozoa with “true” DNA fragmentation exhibited a continuum of comet morphologies, ranging from a more severe form of alkaline-susceptible DNA, to nuclei that exhibited both SSB and DSB. Swelling of koala sperm chromatin following cryopreservation has largely been attributed to the absence of inter-molecular disulphide cross-linkages in the marsupial sperm nucleus. Fish spermatozoa also lack disulphide bonds within their chromatin, but nevertheless, have been successfully cryopreserved. To examine the hypothesis that the cryoprotectants used for fish sperm cryopreservation will confer a similar degree of protection on koala spermatozoa, various concentrations of five cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and dimethylacetamide) were evaluated. Each treatment was compared against an established koala sperm cryopreservation protocol that uses 14 % glycerol. Dimethylacetamide at a concentration of 12. 5 % (v/v) was found to be comparable to glycerol in the successful cryopreservation of koala spermatozoa although high inter-male variability was observed. However, when the new protocol was subsequently validated for a larger population of captive koalas (n = 22), glycerol emerged the better cryoprotectant with respect to all sperm viability parameters assessed except for that of the incidence of chromatin relaxation, which was not affected by the cryoprotectant. Significant difference was also observed in the post-thaw survival of spermatozoa from different animals, which was independent of pre-freeze semen quality. Based on post-thaw semen viability parameters, the koalas could be divided into two distinct groups, where one group had significantly higher sperm viability compared to the other group, regardless of cryoprotectant used. Positive correlation between motility and MMP was observed before and after cryopreservation. However, cryopreservation significantly reduced the dependency between these variables (P < 0. 001), suggesting that cryopreservation reduced the dependency between mitochondrial function and motility...|$|E
