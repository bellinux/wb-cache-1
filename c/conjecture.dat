5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan <b>conjecture,</b> there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this <b>conjecture</b> with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan <b>conjecture</b> is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E

25|$|A third type of conjectures {{concerns}} {{aspects of}} the distribution of primes. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many twin primes, pairs of primes with difference 2 (twin prime <b>conjecture).</b> Polignac's <b>conjecture</b> is a strengthening of that <b>conjecture,</b> it states that for every positive integer n, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by2n. It is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the formn2+1. These conjectures are special cases of the broad Schinzel's hypothesis H. Brocard's <b>conjecture</b> says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2.

5000|$|One of the {{exceptions}} is furnished by three <b>conjectures</b> made by André Weil {{during the late}} 1940s (the Weil <b>conjectures).</b> In the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory and the links between the two, the Weil <b>conjectures</b> were very important [...] The first of the Weil <b>conjectures</b> was proved by Bernard Dwork, and a completely different proof {{of the first two}} <b>conjectures</b> via l-adic cohomology was given by Alexander Grothendieck. The last and deepest of the Weil <b>conjectures</b> (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) was proven by Pierre Deligne. Both Grothendieck and Deligne were awarded the Fields medal. However, the Weil <b>conjectures</b> in their scope are more like a single Hilbert problem, and Weil never intended them as a programme for all mathematics. This is somewhat ironic, since arguably Weil was the mathematician of the 1940s and 1950s who best played the Hilbert role, being conversant with nearly all areas of (theoretical) mathematics and having figured importantly in the development of many of them.|$|R
