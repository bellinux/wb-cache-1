The play was shown in five different cities in 2006 and received warmly. Also in 2006, Sarumpaet organised the seventh triannual Women's Playwright International Conference in Bali.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and the President).

McIntosh recommended that this work be focused on Cambodia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Philippines, and Thailand because these countries are particularly vulnerable to Canadian traffickers. He also recommended focusing on these countries because Canadians have been caught participating in child sex tourism there; McIntosh made specific reference to the cases of Kenneth Klassen and Donald Bakker.|$|E

After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie {{returned}} in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him. The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003). Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone, and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.|$|E
50|$|Sierra Leone is a source, transit, and {{destination}} country for <b>children</b> and women <b>trafficked</b> {{for the purposes}} of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation. Trafficking within the country is more prevalent than transnational trafficking and the majority of victims are children. Within the country, women and <b>children</b> are <b>trafficked</b> from rural provinces to towns and mining areas for domestic servitude, sexual exploitation, and forced labor in diamond mines, petty trading, petty crime, and for forced begging. Women and children may also be trafficked for forced labor in agriculture and the fishing industry. Transnationally, Sierra Leonean women and <b>children</b> are <b>trafficked</b> to other West African countries, notably Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and The Gambia for the same purposes listed above and to North Africa, the Middle East, and Western Europe for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation. Sierra Leone is a {{destination country}} for <b>children</b> <b>trafficked</b> from Nigeria and possibly from Liberia and Guinea for forced begging, forced labor in mines and as porters, and for sexual exploitation. There have also been cases of <b>children</b> <b>trafficked</b> from refugee communities in Sierra Leone.|$|R

25|$|The complex {{definition}} of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> {{and the differences}} in national laws and interpretations makes the identification of child victims of trafficking challenging.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to obtain reliable estimates concerning {{the number of children}} trafficked each year, primarily due to the covert and criminal nature of this practice. It often takes years to gather and compile estimates regarding <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> and, as a result, data can seem both inadequate and outdated. This process of gathering data is only {{complicated by the fact that}} very few countries publish national estimates of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking.</b> As a result, the available statistics are widely thought to underestimate the actual scope of the problem.|$|E

25|$|In general, <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> {{takes place}} in three stages: recruitment, movement, and exploitation. Recruitment occurs {{when a child is}} {{approached}} by a recruiter, or in some cases, directly approaches a recruiter themselves. Recruitment is initiated in many different ways: adolescents may be under pressure to contribute to their families, children may be kidnapped or abducted into trafficking, or families may be trafficked together. Then, movement will occur - locally, regionally, and/or internationally - through a variety of transportation types, including by car, train, boat, or foot. Ultimately, the final goal of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> is exploitation, whereby traffickers use the services of children to garner illegal profit. Exploitation can take place in a variety of forms, including forced labor, sexual exploitation, and child begging, among other practices.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{throughout}} Europe {{have identified}} risks that make children vulnerable to exploitation {{that are also}} causes and contributing factors of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking.</b> These include social and economic marginalisation, dysfunctional family backgrounds, experiences of neglect, abuse or violence within the family or in institutions, exploitative relationships, gender-based violence and discrimination, experiences of living or working on the streets, precarious and irregular migration situations, aspirations to work and to earn money and limited opportunities to enter or remain in school, vocational training or regular employment. As the efforts of national governments to improve social safety nets can lessen many of these risks, <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> is considered not only a result of criminal activities but also as indicating weaknesses in the national government's ability to effectively safeguard children’s rights to a safe and healthy development.|$|E

5000|$|The United States Department of State {{issued a}} report in 2006 on human rights {{violations}} in Moldova stating:"The country was a major country of origin for women and <b>children</b> <b>trafficked</b> abroad for forced prostitution and men and <b>children</b> who were <b>trafficked</b> to Russia and neighboring countries for forced labor and begging. The country was also a transit country for victims trafficked from Ukraine to Romania. Women and girls were trafficked to Turkey, Cyprus, Italy, Hungary, and the Balkan countries for prostitution. NGOs reported recent cases of victims trafficked to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan. Women and girls reportedly were trafficked to Italy and Greece through Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and Albania. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), victims have increasingly been directed to Asia, Russia, Turkey, Western Europe, and the Middle East.

25|$|On a {{national}} level, economic development is severely hindered {{by the lack}} of education of trafficked children; this results in a major loss of potentially productive future workers. Children who are able to successfully return to their families often pose a significant financial burden, due to their lack of education, and the illnesses and injuries they may have incurred during trafficking work. There are major costs associated with the rehabilitation of these trafficked children, so that they are able to successfully participate in their communities. Furthermore, the persistence of <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> indicates the presence of sustained criminal activity and criminal networks, which, in most cases, are also associated with drugs and violence. As a result, UN.GIFT has cited <b>child</b> <b>trafficking</b> as a significant indicator of national and global security threats.|$|E
