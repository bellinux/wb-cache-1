As main contribution, the inertia <b>of</b> the <b>vehicles</b> {{is taken}} into account to enable on-board energy optimization for crossing. In such a way, heavier vehicles that need more energy and time for acceleration or breaking are given an indirect priority at intersections. The proposed decentralized coordination scheme <b>of</b> autonomous <b>vehicles</b> at intersection is compared with an optimal centralized coordination approach and traditional <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> manned <b>vehicles</b> at intersection with traffic lights. The proposed decentralized coordination scheme shows a significant improvement in energy consumption and in motion smoothness compared to traditional crossing.

40|$|Abstract — We propose an {{algorithm}} {{that provides}} for safer and faster <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> at intersections {{without the need}} for stopping. The present traffic control system is quite static. A vehicle must wait at the intersection for a ‘go ’ signal even if there is no conflicting traffic flow. We propose a system in which all approaching vehicles towards an intersection will be taken care by dynamically assigning time slots for their passage without any conflict at the junction. A vehicle thus need not wait at junction and move at a controlled speed for crossing the intersection in an interleaved manner. A system built on such an algorithm will involve a controller for the intersection to which all vehicles can communicate. This controller will manipulate the vehicle by considering the other vehicles in its vicinity...|$|E
40|$|The main {{ambition}} {{of this paper}} is to give an overview of the development of methods and algorithms for an energy-efficient (fuel saving) operation of vehicle power trains. At first general influencing factors of the vehicle’s energy efficiency are analyzed. Beside conventional development objectives like lightweight construction, combustion engine efficiency, air drag reduction two newly considered main energy efficiency influencing factors are the driver behavior and the power train control/ balancing (of hybrid vehicles). Those two factors are investigated within different research projects at the Vehicle Mechatronics Department at Dresden University of Technology. One project presented in this paper aims to develop a prototype driver assistance information system for a fuel-efficient and safe approaching and <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> at traffic light controlled intersections by influencing/ informing the driver (chapter 3).

40|$|Yellow and all-red {{intervals}} {{are intended}} as a margin of safety.

Thus some traffic patterns may not need the full designed intervals’ durations as a safety margin; while at other times, they are not sufficient due mainly to drivers trying to avoid to stop at red lights. The challenge for traffic engineers is to minimize the intersection delay {{and at the same time}} maximize intersection safety. A methodology for providing variable length yellow and all-red intervals, based on traffic responsive sensors and logical commands, is outlined. The methodology stresses that safety is improved at some cases over the designed fixed yellow and all-red intervals, but never compromised lower than the default fixed yellow and all-red intervals. In addition, delay is reduced for various traffic patterns. Adhering to traffic agencies standards and regulations is addressed, not only to outline the practical limitations, but also to introduce discussion for potential positive change...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTraffic Rotary at road intersections {{is special}} form of grade change of lanes to {{channelize}} movement of vehicles {{in one direction}} around a central traffic island. With rapid growth of traffic it is experienced that widening of roads and providing flyovers have become imperative to overcome major conflicts at intersections such as collision between through and right- turn movements. In this way, major conflicts are converted into milder conflicts like merging and diverging. The vehicles entering the rotary are gently forced to move in a clockwise direction. They then weave out of the rotary to the desired direction. The <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> is avoided by allowing all vehicles to merge into a stream around the rotary and then to diverge out to the desired radiating road. Thus the crossing conflicts eliminate and convert into weaving manoeuvre or a merging operation from right and a diverging operation to the left. In this paper, designing rotaries at road intersections is discussed and a software package is developed {{to be used in}} road works...|$|E
40|$|Road intersections are {{considered}} to be serious bottlenecks of urban transportation. According to the U. S., European, and global statistics, intersection-related crashes, with fatal outcome, represent approximately 20 percent of all traffic fatalities. More than 44 % of all reported crashes in the U. S. occur within intersection areas, which, in turn, lead to 8, 500 fatalities and approximately 1 million injuries every year [1]. Furthermore, the impact of road intersections on traffic delays leads to enormous waste of human and natural resources. Statistics collected by FHWA in 2011 urban mobility report states that the average intersection delay endured by a commuter is 34 hours every year. The cost of this wasted time and related fuel consumption at intersection congestions is over $ 101 billion a year [2]. Therefore, it is critical to address these safety and throughput concerns as one of the main challenges for manual as well as autonomous driving through intersections. This dissertation studies the problem of managing traffic through intersections, and develops new decentralized, reliable and efficient active safety methods to provide safe and efficient passage through intersections and roundabouts. Our cyber-physical framework called STIP (Spatio-Temporal Intersection Protocols) incorporates a fusion of vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications and vehicle-resident sensing to enable co-operative driving of autonomous and manually-driven vehicles at intersections. The proposed system allows vehicles to traverse safely by avoiding vehicle collisions at intersections, and significantly increase traffic throughput. The STIP framework includes a family of distributed protocols and covers the following two main traffic environments, categorized based on the market penetration of autonomous vehicles: (1) Homogeneous Traffic: autonomous vehicles only, (2) Heterogeneous Traffic: mix of human-driven and autonomous vehicles. For the homogeneous traffic category, we introduce two sets of intersection protocols: (1) V 2 V-Intersection Protocols, which rely on V 2 V communications and localization to avoid vehicle collisions at intersections by controlling and navigating them within the intersection area. Autonomous vehicles approaching an intersection use DSRC to periodically broadcast information such as position, heading and intersection crossing intentions to other vehicles. The vehicles then decide among themselves regarding who crosses first, who goes next and who waits. (2) Synchronized movement-intersection protocols, which are designed to increase the parallelism at intersections by allowing the concurrent <b>crossing</b> <b>of</b> <b>vehicles</b> arriving from all directions. This method enforces synchronized and staggered arrival of vehicles at intersections. This method allows vehicles to cross the intersection without stopping or slowing down, and maximizes the capacity utilization of the intersection space. In case of the heterogeneous traffic category, in order to enable the safe co-existence of manually-driven and autonomous vehicles at intersections, we propose a set of communication-based and perception-based protocols, leveraging a fusion of V 2 V, V 2 I and on-board sensor systems such as cameras, radars and lidars. In this dissertation, we formally prove the deadlock-freedom property of our family of intersection protocols, and study the effects of packet loss on our V 2 V intersection protocols and measure the reliability of these protocols in the presence of channel impairments. We also measure the impact of position inaccuracy of commonly-used GPS devices on our V 2 V-intersection protocols and incorporate required modifications to guarantee their safety and efficiency despite these impairments. Additionally, we study sensor inaccuracy and occlusion’s impact on our perception-based intersection protocols, and propose simple solutions to deal with these shortcomings. The functionality of our methods is evaluated using our vehicular networks emulator-simulator, called AutoSim. Our results indicate that our proposed STIPs provide both safe passage through the intersection and significantly decrease the delay at the intersection by increasing the concurrency. Specifically, one of our V 2 V-intersection protocols yields over 87 % overall performance improvement over the common traffic light signalized intersections. Throughput increases are even more significant in the case of our synchronized movement intersection protocols, as intersection delays are reduced up to 96 % compared to the common traffic light signalized intersections, and the optimal intersection capacity utilization of 100 % is achieved in certain cases...|$|E
