5|$|Wholesale {{reform of}} Oxford {{examinations}} {{began in the}} late eighteenth century, proposed by, among others, Brasenose's John Napleton in his pamphlet Considerations on the Public Exercises for the First and Second Degrees in the University of Oxford. It was <b>Cleaver</b> and his successor Frodsham Hodson that would continue the reforms and apply them to Brasenose itself. <b>Cleaver</b> was from the minor gentry and set out from the start to make Brasenose the place of rich men. Unable to secure the librarianship of the Bodleian whilst fellow, he had instead become tutor to his patron George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham – a position which he used to lead two of the Duke's sons {{and other members of the}} family to Brasenose; the sons' uncle, Baron Grenville, became the University's Chancellor. Under his leadership into the early nineteenth century, numbers improved dramatically and so did the class of people coming: Brasenose began to be dominated by gentlemen like the Egertons, the Grenvilles, and of Richard Rainshaw Rothwell I. Its income over doubled between 1790 and 1810 to £9,200 per annum, with the college maintaining its links to the north-west. Among the other acquisitions of <b>Cleaver</b> was the services of Hodson, a Liverpudlian.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson {{walked into}} the National Gallery and {{attacked}} Velázquez's canvas with a meat <b>cleaver.</b> Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ascent of}} Mount Adams was in 1854 by Andrew Glenn Aiken, Edward Jay Allen, and Andrew J. Burge. While most sources list the {{aforementioned}} names, {{at least one}} substitutes Colonel Benjamin Franklin Shaw for Andrew Burge. Their route was likely up the North <b>Cleaver</b> because that summer they were improving a newly designated military road that passes through Naches Pass, which is {{to the north of}} Adams.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} rugby player from the Rhondda {{of the later}} half of the 20th century is Cliff Morgan. Morgan was born in Trebanog, and gained 29 caps for Wales, four for the British Lions {{and was one of}} the inaugural inductees of the International Rugby Hall of Fame. Another notable player is Billy <b>Cleaver</b> from Treorchy, a member of the 1950 Grand Slam winning team.|$|E
50|$|Outside of Africa where <b>cleavers</b> {{were most}} abundant, <b>cleavers</b> have {{appeared}} in Southwestern Europe. In these regions, they are more abundant than hand axes where raw material occurs {{in the form of}} large quartzite cobbles that do not need extensive decortication and shaping prior to the removal of large flakes. <b>Cleavers</b> can also be found made out of different raw materials such as flint or limestone, but these are not nearly as common.|$|R

5|$|Three {{prominent}} ridges {{descend from}} {{the east side of}} the mountain. The Ridge of Wonders is furthest south and ends at an area away from the mountain called The Island. Battlement Ridge is very rugged and descends from high on the mountain. The furthest ridge north on the east side, Victory Ridge, descends from a lower elevation on the mountain than Battlement Ridge beneath the precipitous Roosevelt Cliff. Lava Ridge, starting at about the same location as the North <b>Cleaver,</b> descends slightly east of north.|$|E
5|$|M-24 {{continues}} {{north from}} Lapeer running west of Barnes Lake {{and east of}} the community of Columbiaville just south of the M-90 junction. South of the Tuscola County line, the trunkline passes the Greenbriar Golf Club and crosses the Pere Marquette Railroad before turning west along Saginaw Road into the community of Mayville and turning north along Mertz Road. South of Caro, M-24 meets M-46. Once past Frank Street in Caro, M-24 becomes Ellington Street. M-24 then comes to meet M-81 in Caro, where the highway becomes <b>Cleaver</b> Road. M-24 then jogs west along Biebel Road and then north along Unionville Road past a junction with M-138 to end in Unionville at M-25.|$|E
5|$|Taborn {{studied at}} the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor from 1988. He auditioned for the jazz program in the university's School of Music, but joined the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Taborn met drummer Gerald <b>Cleaver</b> soon after {{arriving}} at university, and they established an electronic group, the Tracey Science Quartet. Taborn also played with Marcus Belgrave and Wendell Harrison. While still a university student, he became known for his membership of saxophonist James Carter's band, where he contributed {{to a series of}} albums, beginning with JC on the Set, which was recorded in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{in other}} winter disciplines, Australia {{started in the}} upper half of the field in the moguls; Nicholas <b>Cleaver</b> and Adrian Costa placed 11th and 14th out of 47 {{competitors}} in 1992. Since then, the results deteriorated into {{the lower half of the}} rankings, until 2006, when Canadian-born Dale Begg-Smith won gold and four Australians qualified for the 35-man competition. Manuela Berchtold, the only female Australian representative in 2006, came 14th out of 30 competitors. In 2010, Begg-Smith won silver, while two other moguls racers, one male and one female, were outside the top half and did not pass the first round.|$|E
5|$|When Blake {{finds the}} bodies, he calls Nelson, who {{comes out to}} {{identify}} them. After Blake angrily demands an explanation, Nelson reluctantly reveals West's condition. Nelson believes West is somehow getting stronger the more his body decomposes. Back at Nelson's house, West attacks and kills Perry, although Judy is not harmed. Nelson and Blake arrive just as West escapes. West then stumbles upon {{the home of a}} married couple (played by Jonathan Demme and Janus Blythe). West kills the man and attacks his wife, but she drives him away after chopping his arm off with a <b>cleaver.</b> Blake receives a call about the attack and takes Nelson with him to investigate. They follow West to a giant power plant, and then up several flights of outside stairways.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His range was prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge <b>Cleaver,</b> arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cleavers</b> are {{primarily}} used for cutting through thin or soft bones and sinew. With a chicken, for example, {{it can be}} used to chop through the bird's thin bones or to separate ribs. <b>Cleavers</b> can also be used in preparation of hard vegetables and other foods, such as squash, where a thin slicing blade runs the risk of shattering.|$|R

5|$|Humans {{entered the}} Americas through Beringia, and {{evidence}} documents {{their interactions with}} Columbian mammoths. Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 years ago to produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old <b>cleaver</b> choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy would almost certainly cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect <b>Cleaver</b> Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E
5|$|In June 1872, G.M. Shoop, a {{businessman}} from Danville bought 28 {{acres of land}} on the site that would become the Mountain Grove Campground. He reported this purchase in a meeting held on June 20, 1872 in Columbia County {{with a group of}} Methodists, including several ministers. In this meeting, an executive committee was appointed to arrange the camp meeting. The executive committee included Reverend S. Creighton, Reverend S. Barnes (the chairman), H.E. Sutherland (the secretary), Reverend B.P. King, Reverend E.T. Schwartz, M. Hartman, J.W. <b>Cleaver,</b> J.W. Eyer, and G.M. Shoop himself. Shoop intended to give the land to a local camp meeting organization once one existed. This idea was well received by the district superintendent of the Methodist Church. A committee consisting of four pastors and five lay leaders was subsequently created for the camp meeting site. Craig Newton, a history professor at what would become the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, stated that the site purchased by Shoop would be an ideal location for a camp meeting site.|$|E

Upon {{coming out of}} it she pleads with her sister to go after John, sensing that {{something}} terrible is about to happen, but Wendy is unable to catch up with him. Meanwhile, John catches another glimpse of the mysterious figure in red and this time pursues it. He corners the elusive figure in a deserted palazzo and approaches it, believing it to be a child. Instead, it is revealed to be a hideous female dwarf, and while John is frozen in terror the dwarf pulls out a meat <b>cleaver</b> and cuts his throat. As the life drains from him, John realises too late that the strange sightings he has been experiencing were premonitions of his own murder and funeral.|$|E
5|$|The post-1785 period {{would see}} {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} of the college under Principal William <b>Cleaver.</b> The college began to be populated by gentlemen, its income doubling between 1790 and 1810, and academic success considerable. Efforts to reconstruct Brasenose were not completed, however, until {{the second half of}} the century with the addition of New Quad between 1886 and 1911. Brasenose's financial position remained secure, although under the tenure of Principal Edward Hartopp Cradock Brasenose's academic record waned greatly, with much of its success focussed on sports– where it excelled most notably in cricket and rowing. The mid-Century Royal Commissions were navigated– although they were opposed in form, their recommendations welcomed including the submission of accounts. The election of Charles Buller Heberden as Principal in 1889 led to a reversal in Brasenose's academic failures, although its sporting performance suffered. Heberden was the first lay Principal, presiding over an increasingly secular college, opening up the library to undergraduates, instituting an entrance exam for the first time and accepting Rhodes scholarships.|$|E
5|$|The second-oldest mill {{in what is}} now Columbia County {{was built}} in a gorge on Roaring Creek, near its mouth, in the 1780s. This mill was known as the <b>Cleaver</b> Mill. A second mill, which was similar to the first, was later {{constructed}} at the site. John Hauch constructed a furnace on the creek in 1816. It was the first furnace in the area. The first iron furnace in Montour County was built near the creek's mouth in 1839 or 1840. The furnace was known as the Roaring Creek Anthracite Water Power Furnace. It was altered in 1854. In 1856, the furnace produced 2350 tons of iron from ore on Montour Ridge, despite low water. The only post office in Mayberry Township up to 1915 was built {{at the mouth of the}} creek in 1895. It was known as Howelsville, after W.B. Howell, its first postmaster.|$|E
