50|$|In 2006 {{catastrophe}} struck. The fair {{was again}} {{planned to be}} in a tent in Grant Park. Construction had been visibly slow, {{but it was not until}} the evening of Tuesday, April 25—two days before the fair was scheduled to open—that the news came out that Art Chicago was in trouble. There was a dispute between Blackman and the <b>contractors,</b> with Blackman <b>claiming</b> that the flooring was unacceptable and the <b>contractors</b> <b>claiming</b> bounced checks. Blackman appears to have tried to arrange quick financing, including offering to sell his business the Friday before. Embarrassingly, several international art dealers were turned away from the tent, where they had arrived to set up their exhibits. Mayor Daley, through a spokeswoman, expressed annoyance and disappointment. An attempt to quickly reorganize the fair on Navy Pier fell through.|$|R
50|$|Taylor were {{nominated}} subcontractors to Trentham. They {{also had a}} contract with the employer (collateral contract) whereby they warranted due performance of the subcontract works so that the main contractors should not become entitled to an extension of time. The employer paid Trentham only £7,526 against an interim certificate of £22,101. The amount withheld was the balance payable to the subcontractors after deduction of the main <b>contractor's</b> <b>claim</b> against them for delay. It was held that the employer was not entitled to withhold the money as the contract between the employer and the subcontractor was res inter alios acta.|$|R

By 29 August 1990, the contractor had completed all work in terms of the contract. A certificate of completion was issued on 27 August specifying a sum of money that was to be retained by the employer government against defective work and for maintenance for a period of one year. At the expiry of this period, 27 August 1991, subject to any defect being repaired, the <b>contractor's</b> <b>claim</b> for payment of the retention money would become enforceable.|$|R
5000|$|The Army Corps of Engineers {{signed a}} {{contract}} with G.L. Christian and Associates to build 2,000 housing units for soldiers at Fort Polk, Louisiana, under the [...] "Capehart Act". Fort Polk was deactivated by the Department of the Army in 1958, and the $32.9 million construction contract was terminated by the Corps of Engineers on February 5, 1958. The contractor responded to the cancellation by submitting claims for costs incurred, settlement expenses, and lost profits. The Dept. of the Army attempted to settle these claims in accordance with the standard “termination for convenience of the government” clause outlined in the Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR). Under this clause, the <b>contractor</b> could <b>claim</b> a profit allowance for work it already had performed, but not for anticipated profits. However, the company argued that because the Army had failed to include this termination for convenience clause in the contract, the Army's cancellation of the project constituted a breach of contract. The <b>contractor</b> <b>claimed</b> that it thus was entitled to common-law damages for breach, including anticipated profits.|$|R

The {{objective of this}} treatise is to investigate how effective the four accepted standard form construction contracts in the South African construction industry (i. e. JBCC PBA; NEC 1, 2 / 3; GCC and FIDIC) are in dealing with contract variations and contractors' claims by comparing the type of provisions they provide the contracting parties, supplemented with information from guidance textbooks dealing with the various standard form construction contracts and textbooks on construction claims.

The law represented an effort by the government to respond to entrenched fraud in cases where the official Justice Department was reluctant to prosecute fraud cases.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} investigates {{the perception of}} general contractors of affordable rehabilitation housing projects {{in the state of}} Texas. This study was carried out in collaboration with a corporation that is working on affordable rehabilitation housing in the state of Texas. For the purpose of maintaining anonymity, this organization is referred to as ?Corporation X?. To evaluate the perceptions of the general contractors involved in affordable rehabilitation housing with Corporation X, face-to-face or Skype interviews were carried out. The results showed positive aspects, as well as attributes to be improved, from the general contractors? perspective. Although the contractors do not expect a sizable return on investment, their morale is high due to the satisfaction they feel knowing they are helping underprivileged communities. The cost constraint compounded by the poor existing condition of the houses challenge the ability of general contractors to attain quality standards. However, the general <b>contractors</b> <b>claim</b> they maintain work with high standards of safety and so have not experienced accidents on these sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of unforeseen, extreme weather in construction works usually impacts productivity, causes significant project delays and constitutes a frequent source of <b>contractor’s</b> <b>claims.</b> However, construction practitioners cannot count on sound methods for mediating when weather-related claims arise, nor harnessing the {{influence of}} weather variability in construction projects. Building on the few most recent quantitative studies identifying those key weather agents and levels of intensity that affect some standard building construction activities, a new stochastic model that processes and replicates the spatio-temporal variability of combined weather variables is proposed. This model can help anticipate weather-related project duration variability; improving construction productivity by selecting the best project start date; and objectively evaluating weather-related claims. A two-building construction case study using different Spanish locations is used to demonstrate the model. The results showed that ignoring {{the influence of}} weather can lead to an extension of 5 - 20 % longer project duration compared to planned...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} uses of Project Labor Agreements in the U.S. {{date back}} to several dam projects in the 1930s, including the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington, the Shasta Dam in California and the Hoover Dam in Nevada. Modern PLAs particularly developed from those used in construction carried out during World War II, a period when skilled labor was in demand, construction unions controlled 87% of the national market and government spending on construction had increased significantly over {{a short period of}} time. These early PLAs focused on establishing standard rates of pay and preventing work stoppages. PLA projects that followed included Cape Canaveral in the 1960s, Disney World from 1967-71 and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from 1973-77. During this period and subsequently, the unionized share of the construction industry precipitously declined as construction users sought more open competition. By the 1980s, nonunion <b>contractors</b> <b>claimed</b> in excess of 80% of the construction work, {{in a wide variety of}} trades, with some variation in different parts of the country.|$|R

40|$|Workers’ {{compensation}} {{insurance is}} imperative for construction projects {{to safeguard the}} interests of workers and contractors. The commitment of insurers under this insurance is extremely broad. They must therefore accomplish rigorous risk and market assessments to decide optimal premiums. General insurers in Singapore have been experiencing detrimental loss-ratios in this business {{due to the lack}} of a proper framework that encompasses all the critical variables. The purpose of this study is to identify and explore the critical variables for premium-rating of construction workers’ compensation insurance. An extensive literature review helped identify 17 variables that may influence premium rates. An interview questionnaire survey and subsequently a statistical analysis of the survey data were carried out to identify the critical variables. Eight variables were found significant for insurers for premium-rating including: wage roll, project hazards, project safety, <b>contractor’s</b> <b>claims</b> history, insurer’s overhead costs, insurer’s corporate objectives, competition, and investment income from underwritten premiums. The findings of this study can be used by insurance companies in their risk assessment and premium-rating exercises...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 intermediaries {{involved in the}} administration of insurance policies, specifically 2 ̆ 2 downstream 2 ̆ 2 intermediaries, who are engaged {{in the administration of}} insurance claims.

Unless provided otherwise by an Agency FAR Supplement, a <b>contractor</b> may assert <b>claim</b> to copyright in scientific and technical articles based on or containing data first produced {{in the performance of}} a contract and published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings, or the like. The express written permission of the Contracting Officer is required before the contractor may assert or enforce the copyright in all other works first produced in the performance of a contract. However, if a contract includes Alternate IV of the clause, the Contracting Officer's approval is not required to assert claim to copyright. Whenever the <b>contractor</b> asserts <b>claim</b> to copyright in works other than computer software, the government, and others acting on its behalf, are granted a license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute, perform and display the copyrighted work.

The most common allegation is that the CIA influenced Kerr's decision to dismiss Whitlam. In 1966 Kerr had joined the Association for Cultural Freedom, a conservative group that was later revealed to have received CIA funding. Christopher Boyce, who was convicted for spying for the Soviet Union while an employee for a CIA <b>contractor,</b> <b>claimed</b> that the CIA wanted Whitlam removed from office because he threatened to close US military bases in Australia, including Pine Gap.

40|$|The United States government’s differing {{conditions}} clause poses extensive {{legal and}} financial risk. This contract clause addresses Type I and Type II unforeseen conditions. A Type I condition {{occurs when a}} latent physical condition materially differs from that condition indicated in the bidding documents. A Type II condition exists when an unknown physical condition has an unusual nature different from that condition generally encountered and naturally inhering in the contract work. The occurrence of either provides a contractor with the contractual right to file a claim for equitable contract adjustment. A contractor desiring to prevail, regarding a Type I claim, must properly comply with the Weeks Dredging proof elements. Chi‐square statistical results, for 143 Type I differing conditions claims, provide empirical evidence that 79 % of the contractors receive a disfavourable court award when challenging the United States government. Forty‐four per cent of the reported cases cite the Weeks Dredging proof element, contractor did not act as a reasonably prudent contractor, {{as a basis for}} denying a <b>contractor’s</b> <b>claim</b> for equitable adjustment.
