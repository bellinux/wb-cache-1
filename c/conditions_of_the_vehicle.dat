40|$|Abstract — Currently, {{vehicles}} are often equipped with {{active safety systems}} {{to reduce the risk}} of accidents, many of which occur in the urban environments. The most popular include Antilock Braking Systems (ABS), Traction Control and Stability Control. All these systems employ different types of sensors to constantly monitor the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> and respond in an emergency situation. In this paper the use of ultrasonic sensors in safety systems for controlling the speed of a vehicle is proposed. An intelligent mechatronic system includes an ultrasonic wave emitter provided on the front portion of a car producing and emitting ultrasonic waves frontward in a predetermined distance. An ultrasonic receiver is also placed on the front portion of the car operatively receiving a reflective ultrasonic wave signal. The reflected wave (detected pulse) gives the distance between the obstacle and the vehicle. Then a microcontroller is used to control the speed of the vehicle based on the detection pulse information to push the brake pedal and apply brake to the car stupendously for safety purpose...|$|E
40|$|Centre {{of gravity}} (CG) {{is one of}} the {{significant}} parameters of vehicle mass property related to vehicle handling. Position of CG in each direction (longitudinal, lateral and vertical) affects stability of the vehicle eventually. Change in CG position depends on different architectural arrangements of drive train and sub-systems which affect mass distribution of the vehicle. Being zero-emission technology, rapid commercialization of electric vehicle (EV) requires more emphasis on production of new automobiles and retrofitting as well. In case of retrofitting, placement of all EV drive train and other sub-systems requires both static and dynamic analysis for change in CG position due to different mass distributions. In this paper, analysis has been conducted by MATLAB SIMULINK based vehicle model to demonstrate effect of CG in vehicle maneuvering. Outcome of this investigation indicates the evaluation of different retrofitted EV architectures considering different mass distributions under the constraint of vehicle mass and dimension.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of a multi-span non-uniform continuous bridge under a moving vehicle is studied by considering the effect of interaction between the structure, the road surface roughness and the vehicle. The bridge is modeled as a multi-span continuous Benoulli–Euler beam with non-uniform cross-section on linear spring supports with large stiffness. The vehicle is modeled {{as a group of}} moving loads at a fixed spacing. Numerical simulation and laboratory tests were performed on a single-span and a two-span beam. The first span is found to exhibit smaller dynamic responses compared with the other spans for both constant speed vehicle and with vehicle braking due to the smaller initial <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> at entry of the span. Braking of the vehicle generates excitation forces covering a wide range of frequencies and this requires a large number of vibration modes for an accurate prediction on the responses. Since braking in one span would create response in different spans, a more correct definition of impact factor with vehicle braking should be based on a comparison of the maximum dynamic and static responses at the same span in which braking occurs.

A numerical model of the body was also developed, and an unit pressure was applied on different zones of it, calculating the correspondent strains in the strain gauges locations and determining in this way the influence coefficients. The pressure distribution was then evaluated by minimizing the differences between the so calculated strains and those experimentally measured: it shows different profiles, depending on the refuse type.

This work describes {{the development of a}} scaled AGV, using fast prototyping techniques, both for the design of the mechanical components and the development of the vehicle control system. The scaled AGV is used as a scaled demonstrator to verify the feasibility of an anti-capsize controller. Capsize is a typical problem that have to be avoided on industrial vehicles, forklifts and moving lifter where heavy and partially unknown loads have to be moved using vehicles with a design that privilege manoeuvrability and small costs against stability. The AGV is a three wheeled differential drive mobile robot, with front motorized wheels, driven by speed-controlled drivers. The vehicle is controlled through a Texas Instrument C 2000 controller, programmable by using Matlab-Simulink Embedded Coder™. Forces exchanged between the wheels and the ground are monitored using low cost load cells. MEMS three-axial accelerometers and gyros are used to detect inertial loads and to estimate the vehicle pose and, through a proper filtering, the ground slope.

40|$|The {{stability}} of industrial vehicles, such as forklifts and lifters, {{is very important}} from a safety point of view: these vehicles are subjected to variable loading conditions and their design is often optimized to privilege handling in narrow spaces, instead of stability. To study in deep the problem of vehicle capsize prevention, the authors developed a scaled AGV (Automated Guided Vehicle). It is a three wheeled differential drive mobile robot, with front motorized wheels, driven by speed-controlled drivers. The position of the wheels and the loads can be easily modified to simulate different vehicle configurations and operating scenarios. The vehicle is controlled with a Texas Instrument C 2000 controller, programmable through Matlab-Simulink Embedded Coder™. In addition, the forces exchanged among the wheels and the ground are monitored using low cost load cells, with miniaturized amplification stages.

40|$|Moan&# 39; {{noise in}} a vehicle is known to cause {{discomfort}} and anxiety to passengers. This abnormal noise is generated by a stick-slip phenomenon between the brake pad and the disc during breaking. The exciting force from the brake system is transmitted to a coupled torsion beam axle module through the brake pad, the caliper and an extra bracket. In this study, moan noise is reproduced during the vehicle&# 39;s operating test, and {{the parts of the}} coupled torsion beam axle module generating moan noise are identified. Further, it is verified that the resonance of the coupled torsion beam axle module due to the exciting force of the brake system is the main cause of moan noise. Coherence analysis and transfer path analysis were conducted to identify how the vibrations from the coupled torsion beam axle module are related to moan noise in the passenger compartments of vehicles. In the coherence analysis, the vibration accelerations of the brake pad, the caliper, the spindle bracket, the trailing arm and the V-beam are set as the inputs, and the output is the noise at the driver&# 39;s ear level. In terms of the frequency response, the results from a modal analysis of the coupled torsion beam axle module under the vehicle&# 39;s test conditions agreed well with those from a finite element modal analysis in which the boundary <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> were taken into consideration.

40|$|Physically the {{conventional}} beamforming method (CBF) {{is based on}} a decomposition of the incident wave field into plane or spherical elementary waves whose relative phases are interpreted to mean that the directions of incidence and source locations can be identified and classified. A central assumption of the CBF is its application in the acoustic free field. This assumption is particularly invalid in confined spaces such as a vehicle interior, in which to a certain frequency range (below the Schroeder frequency) modal influences dominate the sound field. Under these conditions the CBF only shows a poor localization ability; up to a complete localization failure. However, to apply beamforming under these conditions and in this frequency range, in this thesis two approaches are being pursued in parallel to minimize the room acoustic influences on the Beamforming and thus improve the localization result particularly in a vehicle interior. A first approach is based on the pre-processing of cross-spectral matrix (CSM) using the so-called generalized cross-correlation. A second approach uses “macro modeling” to approximate the pole frequencies of the room transfer functions. Based on the determined pole frequencies an inverse filter is automatically generated, which also applied to the CSM minimizes modal influences before the actual beamforming. Both approaches are as well discussed theoretically as practically examined and evaluated in consecutive steps. For this purpose, based on principle studies on defined reflection surfaces, the behavior of both approaches inside a scale model room are shown, analyzed and evaluated. Subsequently, both approaches are evaluated under the real <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> interior. A digression regarding the combination of beamforming with arbitrary transfer functions for the further development of the beamforming beyond the free field assumption concludes the investigation work. Finally, this thesis is concluded by the chapter “Zusammenfassung und Ausblick”...|$|E
