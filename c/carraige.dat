50|$|Around 1850, {{a station}} stop was {{established}} on land donated by Joseph Mallinson, a <b>carraige</b> painter who owned {{much of the}} land in the area. This depot was named Allendale in honor of the surveyor of the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad. Mallinson himself used the land donation as a ploy to get the railroad to establish a station at the location. While a community began to grow around the Allendale depot, the depot fell into disrepair by 1857 and the New York, Lake Erie and Western Railroad abandoned service to the location as a result. By 1859, the depot was described as being abandoned and left for ruin. Mallinson spent time in 1859 making the station look better and returning service to the area. A freight station was constructed that year and by the next year, 1860, a new depot was constructed by the railroad at Allendale with gravel construction.|$|E

Purchase, Rittershofer, 1960 Lesser Ury (1861 - 1931) settled in Berlin in 1887, after many years {{traveling}} and study all over Europe. His initial friendship with Max Liebermann soon turned into bitter hostility that was to last {{for the better part}} of their lives. As a result, Liebermann saw to it that Ury was not invited to become a member of the Berlin Secession. This ended in 1911, when Corinth became the Secession president. His work received long overdue national recognition a retrospective show presented by Paul Cassirer in 1916. Ury was among the few German artists who made pastel painting popular in Germany. But foremost, Ury has been celebrated as the painter of his adopted hometown, Berlin. He died in 1931, almost penniless, and was buried in the honorary section of the Jewish cemetery at Weißensee.

HALLETT [Transcription begins]: Teusday [sic] 1230 Dear Mom, Well honey, I had {{my first}} flight yesterday, boy it’s really sharp. That ship handles like a baby <b>carraige</b> [sic]. I was only up 18 minutes, but I did some turns, and then climbed up to 3500 ’ for a spin. In that open cockpit you really know you’re flying. You can hear the angels singing up there. Happy fourth of July! Today we get open post after the parade at 1400, until 2230. We also get open post {{tomorrow}} night, and Thursday night, because Sqdrn A was the best on the post, sharp eh? What’s all this business about Judy and hysterics? Holy cow flop honey, I’m in no trouble, as you put it, you know damn well that if I was I’d tell you. I just dropped Judy a line, seeing that she was sick and all and told her I was thinking about her and similar “pecker-talk. ” Women; phooey, they’re beyond me. Tomorrow I really start flying and the chewin’ will start. These instructors really chew, too. They chew your ass around the outside and let the middle drop out, fun for the kiddies! Yesterday I took my first test in Engines, I got 90 in it. I was trying for 100, but I made some foolish mistake. Tomorrow I get my first test in Theory of Flight. I don’t take code anymore, but will take it up in Basic again, if I get that far. Ed Conway, my old buddy from Maxwell, came here with me. He’s in my bay, he sleeps under me. He’s a swell guy, {{we have a lot}} in common. He reminds me of Bill Weigle. Gosh I wonder where old Bill is now. Probably a hot pilot somewhere. I just went out with Ed, and Dug and took some pictures in the goggles and helmet I fly in, they ought to be sharp. Listen honey, don’t you worry about that money situation, you just go down to that Doctor, I’m not kiddin’ now you do it. I’m pulling in 75 a month now, so if you need money, just tell me honey. You need it more than I do. I love you with all my heart. Give my love to all. Your devoted son, Judd P. S. —B. U. means Base Unit. [Transcription ends...|$|E
