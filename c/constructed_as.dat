5|$|Much {{of what is}} now MD291 was <b>constructed</b> <b>as</b> two {{different}} highways. MD291 proper ran from MD290 near Chesterville through Millington to the Delaware state line. MD447 connected US213 in Chestertown and MD290 in Chesterville, using MD291's current corridor from Chestertown to Morgnec and a more northerly path from Morgnec to Chesterville. MD291 was <b>constructed</b> <b>as</b> a concrete road from Millington to the Delaware state line in 1929 and 1930; the portion of River Road on which MD290 runs concurrently with MD291 was paved in concrete in the same time span. The concrete highway was extended west from Millington to Mills Branch in two sections, the eastern part completed in 1933 and the western segment built in 1934 and 1935. Kent County included the portion of River Road between MD290 and Mills Branch as its top priority in the post-war construction program; that segment was surfaced and brought into the state highway system as an extension of MD291 in 1946.|$|E
