5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{the only}} Jewish–Christian gospel which the Church Fathers refer to by name. The {{language}} of composition {{is thought to be}} Greek. The provenance has been associated with Egypt; it probably began circulating in Alexandria, Egypt in {{the first decades of the}} 2nd century and was used by Greek-speaking Jewish–Christian communities there. The communities to which they belonged were traditional, <b>conservative</b> <b>Christians</b> who followed the teaching of the primitive Christian church in Jerusalem, integrating their understanding of Jesus with strict observance of Jewish customs and law, which they regarded as essential to salvation. Despite this, the gospel displays no connection with other Jewish–Christian literature, nor does it appear to be based on the Gospel of Matthew or the other canonical gospels of what is now orthodox Christianity. Instead, it seems to be taken from alternative oral forms of the same underlying traditions. Some of the fragments suggest a syncretic gnostic influence, while others support close ties to traditional Jewish Wisdom literature.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Pat Robertson founded the Christian Coalition of America, {{building}} from his 1988 presidential run, with Republican activist Ralph Reed, {{who became the}} spokesman for the Coalition. In 1992, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, began producing voter guides, which it distributed to <b>conservative</b> <b>Christian</b> churches, both Protestant and Catholic, with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Under the leadership of Reed and Robertson, the Coalition quickly became the most prominent voice in the <b>conservative</b> <b>Christian</b> movement, its influence culminating with an effort to support the election of a <b>conservative</b> <b>Christian</b> to the presidency in 1996. In addition, they have talked encouraged the convergence of <b>conservative</b> <b>Christian</b> ideology with political issues, such as healthcare, the economy, education and crime.|$|R

25|$|Many modern Christians {{are united}} in the {{condemnation}} of slavery as wrong {{and contrary to}} God's will.

Full adherents to reconstructionism are few and marginalized among <b>conservative</b> <b>Christians.</b> With these exceptions, all Christian faith groups now condemn slavery, and see the practice as incompatible with basic Christian principles.|$|E

At the same time, the white population of the area fell by 7.5% while the percentage of ethnic minority inhabitants rose to 20% of Rutherford County's population.|$|E

25|$|When Charles Darwin {{published}} On the Origin of Species in 1859, many liberal Christians accepted evolution {{provided it}} was reconciled with divine design. The clergymen Charles Kingsley and Frederick Temple, both <b>conservative</b> <b>Christians</b> in the Church of England, promoted {{a theology of}} creation as an indirect process controlled by divine laws. Some strict Calvinists welcomed the idea of natural selection, as it did not entail inevitable progress and humanity {{could be seen as}} a fallen race needing salvation. Aubrey Moore also accepted the theory of natural selection, incorporating it into his Christian beliefs as merely the way God worked. Darwin's friend Asa Gray defended natural selection as compatible with design.|$|E

[...] Moral philosopher Douglas Groothuis says Satin's vision is unsound because it lacks an absolute standard of good and evil.

[...] Political scientist Michael Cummings takes issue {{with the idea that}} consciousness is ultimately determining. [...] Science-and-society professor David Hess rejects the idea that economic class analysis should give way to psychocultural class analysis.

500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for <b>conservative</b> <b>Christians,</b> {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the best thing to happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".|$|E
