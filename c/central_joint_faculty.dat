40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study was to better understand how institutional infrastructures influence the experience of <b>faculty</b> holding <b>joint</b> appointments by exploring this phenomenon in three U. S. schools of public health. The data for this research were collected through interviews with <b>joint</b> <b>faculty</b> as well as key administrators {{at each of the}} three sites. Observations from site visits as well as institutional documents were also used as part of the case study design. Institutional documents included accreditation self-study reports, institutional bylaws and policies, websites, and strategic plans. ^ Analysis of the case studies suggests {{that it is not a}} specific administrative infrastructure per se that prevents problems associated with joint appointments and/or promotes faculty satisfaction; rather, what matters is how the infrastructure aligns with organizational culture. In addition to looking inward to institutional culture, the study also suggests that schools should 1) foster strong <b>faculty</b> mentoring for <b>joint</b> <b>faculty,</b> 2) prioritize institutional transparency around joint appointment decision-making, 3) value and appreciate the unique arrangements and contributions of <b>joint</b> <b>faculty</b> and 4) recognize that place in career may influence <b>joint</b> <b>faculty</b> experience.

30|$|The {{third group}} of joint designs, called J 3 s and J 3 r for the {{variants}} using square-based and round-based members respectively, and presented in Fig.  2 c, consists {{of having a}} <b>central</b> <b>joint</b> piece that completely surrounds the members and is adhesively bonded to them, similarly to the lugged steel frame construction used to build bicycle frames. The main advantage of these joint designs {{is that they can}} be used for three-dimensional trusses, since there is no restriction due to the flat nature of the <b>central</b> <b>joint</b> piece as there is in the two previous joint designs. Furthermore, if the material selected for the <b>central</b> <b>joint</b> is isotropic, it could mitigate the issues related to out-of-plane stresses that can arise in three-dimensional structures and be problematic for fiber-reinforced components. It is expected that these joint designs are stronger than the J 1 and J 2 designs, due to the adhesive overlap completely surrounding the members.|$|R
