5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans for rebuilding the <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classical formal model, but progress was slow and houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|San Francisco {{was founded}} on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain {{established}} Presidio of San Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, all named for St. Francis of Assisi.

5|$|The city is, and {{has been}} for centuries, the main hub of {{transportation}} for the Podlaskie Voivodeship and the entire northeastern section of Poland. It is a major <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> European Union roadways (Via Baltica) and railways (Rail Baltica) to the Baltic Republics and Finland.

5|$|The {{construction}} of a fortified <b>city</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sciberras Peninsula was first proposed in 1524, when the Order of St. John sent a commission to inspect the Maltese Islands. Back then, the only fortification on the peninsula was a militia watchtower built by the Aragonese in 1488. The tower was strengthened in 1533, but the proposed city was not built since the Order focused on building the fortifications of Birgu, which had become their base.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Houston Ship Channel in 1915 further {{challenged}} the port city.
