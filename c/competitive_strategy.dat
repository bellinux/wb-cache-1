The paper designed a mail-survey that was sent to senior executives, which resulted in 189 usable surveys. Data were analysed using partial least squares (PLS) to test the hypotheses. The findings show that both <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> influence RMO and PMO, which then influence firm performance. However, the results show that differentiation strategy has a stronger influence on RMO and PMO than cost-leadership strategy, and that PMO has a stronger influence on performance than RMO. The study examined one set of capabilities (RMO and PMO); research opportunities exist for identifying other firm capabilities (e. g. organisational learning) and their relationships with <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies.</b> Strategy implementation is a valid route to firm performance. Therefore, marketing managers must simultaneously develop <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and RMO and PMO to obtain increased firm performance outcomes.

This is especially true in the specific context of small firms (SFs), despite the fact that their knowledge-based resources are more important than their property-based resources. This study aims to investigate, through a quali-quantitative analysis carried out on a sample of SFs in northeast Italy, the alignment between knowledge <b>strategies</b> and <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies.</b> We have identified two types of <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> pursued by SFs, i. e. human resource-based (HR-based) and product and customer service quality-based (PCSQ-based).

40|$|Increased {{globalisation}} process {{since the}} conclusion of the Uruguay multilateral trade agreement in 1994 has bought about greater competition in the marketplace and renewed interest in competition theory and empirical work on firm performance. This gives rise to a huge number of theories, frameworks and empirical studies just to describe the relationship between some potential explanatory variables and firm performance. Traditionally, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) confine their activities to the region of their presence, and {{the fact that most of}} them remain in their national boundaries. Thus, a majority of the actors in less developed countries give little emphasis on some core <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> in order to survive in such a globalised world. Despite this case, SMEs of different countries may give different emphases on <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and as a result of this they may perform differently. Due to the hardly found empirical studies of the past, this study compares <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and performance of Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs. A self administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 386 SMEs in Malaysia and Indonesia. Using an independent-samples t-test, this study found that <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and firm performance were significantly different between Malaysian and Indonesian SMEs. Mean scores show that the Malaysian SMEs gave more emphasis on firm management and human resource management; whilst the Indonesian SMEs emphasized more on marketing and global orientation. The outward-oriented emphasis of the latter on <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> enabled them to outperform the Malaysian SMEs in nearly all organizational and market performance indicators. The findings in this study prove that firm and human resource managements may be important, but the emphasis on these two <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> is inadequate to enhance performance in the increasingly globalised world...|$|R
40|$|This book {{examines}} how firms {{adapt to the}} pressures of increasing international competition by testing both the arguments on ‘strategy specialization’ proposed in the competitiveness literature in general, and those offered by contributors to the ‘varieties of capitalism’ debate in particular. If different economies are characterized by distinct institutional arrangements — successful firms would be the ones that exploit their comparative advantages and specialize in the <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> facilitated by national institutions. The book begins with an assessment of how many pharmaceutical firms in Germany, Italy, and the UK pursue strategies facilitated by national institutions governing financial markets, antitrust activities, and the labour market. Quantitative analyses reveal that deviant firms, competing through institutionally unsupported strategies, outnumber conforming firms by far. Not only does this finding {{run counter to the}} expectations of the competitiveness literature, it brings up a whole new line of inquiry. How can firms compete through strategies that are not supported by national institutions? To address this question, the book combines quantitative analyses with qualitative insights, showing that firms do not necessarily exploit comparative institutional advantages, but that they can successfully circumvent institutional constraints. International markets and individual collaboration on a contractual basis allow firms to compete despite comparative institutional disadvantages. These findings suggest that trade liberalization tends to foster strategy diversification rather than strategy specialization, depending on the inventiveness of entrepreneurs in developing individual approaches toward competing.

40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of globalization in telecommunication companies has greatly increased {{the level of}} competition in the industry and {{they are forced to}} be competitive to survive. Different types of strategies are put in place in order to be profitable and <b>competitive.</b> All these <b>strategies</b> are directed to attract, retain and maintain customers for continuous profitability. However, majority of them hardly measure the impact of their strategic innovation on their customers. The paper seeks to explore the {{influence of}} <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> embarked upon by selected telecommunication companies in Nigeria on their performance. The paper also examines how <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> could be implemented for improved customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. Three null hypotheses were postulated to test the relationship between lower prices and customer satisfaction, uninterrupted trunk services and customer loyalty, and customer complaint handling and retention. Only customers using telephone service were selected as respondents from Lagos State. The state was stratified in to 20 local government council area and questionnaires were distributed to 125 respondents in each of them. The completion rate of the questionnaire in each of them is between 103 and 110. Survey research design was adopted to carry out the study. A structured questionnaire was designed and validated through the construct validity and tested for confirmation using the KMO measure of sampling adequacy. It was also made reliable using Cronbach’s Alpha test. From the study, findings revealed relationship between <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> and customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty. The findings revealed that there is a relationship between <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies,</b> its constituents and performance of telecommunication companies. It is recommended that universal mobile telecommunication services (UMTS) operators should adopt the culture of <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> since it can impact on their performance for achieving competitive advantage...|$|R
40|$|We {{define a}} class of duopolistic “competitive games ” (including Bertrand and Cournot competition, public–good games, and rent–seeking contests) {{and apply it to}} define a dynamic game where {{deviations}} to increasingly <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> are irreversible. There is generally a unique profile of equilibrium payoffs that Pareto dominates the stage game Nash payoffs, and {{in a wide range of}} circumstances, this payoff profile is even unique overall. Moreover, we define a generalized repeated game where deviations to increasingly <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> can be made irreversible by the respective player. Under comparably mild assumptions, we find that the sets of equilibria are payoff–equivalent in both kinds of games. Thus, it is irrelevant whether deviations to <b>competitive</b> <b>strategies</b> are irreversible or can be made irreversible. Fi-nally, we define a perturbed infinitely repeated game, where opportunities to restricts one’s strategies occur with arbitrarily small probabilities, and extend the above equiv-alence (without strengthening the assumptions) ...|$|R
