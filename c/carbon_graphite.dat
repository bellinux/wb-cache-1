5|$|Atomic carbon {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous <b>carbon,</b> <b>graphite,</b> and diamond. Once considered exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite (questionable), glassy carbon, carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne).|$|E
5|$|Carbon is ordinarily {{classified}} as a nonmetal but has some metallic properties and is occasionally {{classified as}} a metalloid. Hexagonal graphitic <b>carbon</b> (<b>graphite)</b> is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope of carbon under ambient conditions.

25|$|The {{components}} of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of standard size, and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used {{through most of the}} 20th century until first metal and then composites of <b>carbon</b> <b>graphite,</b> ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.|$|E
25|$|Fly rods are, {{in modern}} manufacture, almost always {{built out of}} <b>carbon</b> <b>{{graphite}}.</b> The graphite fibres are laid down in increasingly sophisticated patterns to keep the rod from flattening when stressed (usually referred to as hoop strength). The rod tapers {{from one end to}} the other and the degree of taper determines how much of the rod flexes when stressed. The larger amount of the rod that flexes the 'slower' the rod. Slower rods are easier to cast, create lighter presentations but create a wider loop on the forward cast that reduces casting distance and is subject to the effects of wind. Furthermore, the process of wrapping graphite fibre sheets to build a rod creates imperfections that result in rod twist during casting. Rod twist is minimized by orienting the rod guides along the side of the rod with the most 'give'. This is done by flexing the rod and feeling for the point of most give or by using computerized rod testing.|$|E
