25|$|Red-fleshed peaches {{are rich}} in anthocyanins, {{particularly}} cyanidin glucosides in six peach and six nectarine cultivars and malvin glycosides in <b>clingstone</b> peaches.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of {{peach and}} {{nectarine}} cultivars are known. These are classified into two categories—the freestones and the clingstones. Freestones are those whose flesh separates readily from the pit. Clingstones are those whose flesh clings tightly to the pit. Some cultivars are partially freestone and <b>clingstone,</b> so are called semifree. Freestone types are preferred for eating fresh, while <b>clingstone</b> types are for canning. The fruit flesh may be creamy white to deep yellow; the hue and {{shade of the}} color depends on the cultivar.|$|E
25|$|Total {{polyphenols}} in mg per 100g {{of fresh}} weight were 14–102 in white-flesh nectarines, 18–54 in yellow-flesh nectarines, 28–111 in white-flesh peaches, and 21–61mg per 100g in yellow-flesh peaches. The major phenolic compounds identified in peach are chlorogenic acid, catechins and epicatechins, with other compounds, identified by HPLC, including gallic acid and ellagic acid. Rutin and isoquercetin {{are the primary}} flavonols found in <b>clingstone</b> peaches.|$|E
25|$|Cultivated peaches {{are divided}} into <b>clingstones</b> and freestones, {{depending}} on whether the flesh sticks to the stone or not; both can have either white or yellow flesh. Peaches with white flesh typically are very sweet with little acidity, while yellow-fleshed peaches typically have an acidic tang coupled with sweetness, though this also varies greatly. Both colors often have some red on their skin. Low-acid white-fleshed peaches are the most popular kinds in China, Japan, and neighbouring Asian countries, while Europeans and North Americans have historically favoured the acidic, yellow-fleshed cultivars.|$|R
60|$|The {{varieties}} of the peach and the nectarine {{run in parallel}} lines. In both classes the kinds differ {{from each other in}} the flesh of the fruit being white, red, or yellow; in being <b>clingstones</b> or freestones; in the flowers being large or small, with certain other characteristic differences; and in the leaves being serrated without glands, or crenated and furnished with globose or reniform glands. (10/55. 'Catalogue of Fruit in Garden of Hort. Soc.' 1842 page 105.) We can hardly account for this parallelism by supposing that each variety of the nectarine is descended from a corresponding variety of the peach; for though our nectarines are certainly the descendants of several kinds of peaches, yet a large number are the descendants of other nectarines, and they vary so much when thus reproduced that we can scarcely admit the above explanation.|$|R
6000|$|Hence it may {{be worth}} while to give all the {{evidence}} {{on the origin of}} the nectarine. The facts in themselves are curious, and will hereafter have to be referred to when the important subject of bud-variation is discussed. It is asserted (10/37. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 394.) that the Boston nectarine was produced from a peach-stone, and this nectarine reproduced itself by seed. (10/38. Downing's 'Fruit Trees' page 502.) Mr. Rivers states (10/39. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1195.) that from stones of three distinct varieties of the peach he raised three varieties of nectarine; and in one of these cases no nectarine grew near the parent peach-tree. In another instance Mr. Rivers raised a nectarine from a peach, and in the succeeding generation another nectarine from this nectarine. (10/40. 'Journal of Horticulture' February 5, 1866 page 102.) Other such instances have been communicated to me, but they need not be given. Of the converse case, namely, of nectarine-stones yielding peach-trees (both free and <b>clingstones),</b> we have six undoubted instances recorded by Mr. Rivers; and in two of these instances the parent nectarines had been seedlings from other nectarines. (10/41. Mr. Rivers in 'Gardener's 'Chronicle' 1859 page 774, 1862 page 1195; 1865 page 1059; and 'Journal of Hort.' 1866 page 102.) ...|$|R
25|$|As with peaches, {{nectarines}} can {{be white}} or yellow, and <b>clingstone</b> or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and sweeter than peaches, but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish {{than those of}} peaches, contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than peaches.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, 96.4% of Mississippi {{residents}} {{five years}} old and older spoke only English in the home, a decrease from 97.2% in 1990. English is largely Southern American English, with some South Midland speech in northern and eastern Mississippi. There is a common absence of final /r/ and the lengthening and weakening of the diphthongs /aɪ/ and /ɔɪ/ as in 'ride' and 'oil'. South Midland terms in northern Mississippi include: tow sack (burlap bag), dog irons (andirons), plum peach (<b>clingstone</b> peach), snake doctor (dragonfly), and stone wall (rock fence).|$|E
2500|$|... 95.1% of all Alabama {{residents}} {{five years}} old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly Southern, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken {{across the border from}} Tennessee. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird.' In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb.' Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (<b>clingstone),</b> French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).|$|E
60|$|Again, as I {{hear from}} Mr. Rivers, the double-flowering Chinese peaches {{resemble}} almonds in their manner {{of growth and}} in their flowers; the fruit is much elongated and flattened, with the flesh both bitter and sweet, but not uneatable, and {{it is said to}} be of better quality in China. From this stage one small step leads us to such inferior peaches as are occasionally raised from seed. For instance, Mr. Rivers sowed a number of peach-stones imported from the United States, where they are collected for raising stocks, and some of the trees raised by him produced peaches which were very like almonds in appearance, being small and hard, with the pulp not softening till very late in the autumn. Van Mons (10/28. Quoted in 'Journal de La Soc. Imp. d'Horticulture' 1855 page 238.) also states that he once raised from a peach-stone a peach having the aspect of a wild tree, with fruit like that of the almond. From inferior peaches, such as these just described, we may pass by small transitions, through <b>clingstones</b> of poor quality, to our best and most melting kinds. From this gradation, from the cases of sudden variation above recorded, and {{from the fact that the}} peach has not been found wild, it seems to me by far the most probable view, that the peach is the descendant of the almond, improved and modified in a marvellous manner.|$|R
2500|$|The Fredericksburg-Stonewall {{area has}} become known as the Peach Capital of Texas. and Benjamin Lester Enderle is known as the Father of the Hill Country Peach Industry. He was Gillespie County Surveyor and a math and science teacher at Fredericksburg High School when he planted five peach trees and began selling the fruit in 1921. Enderle worked to develop the Hale, Burbank, Elberta, and Stark varieties. He began {{marketing}} them through the H-E-B grocery chain, and eventually had 5,000 producing peach trees on [...] Growers claim the taste is due to the area having the right combination of elevation, sandy soil, and climate to produce flavorful <b>clingstone</b> and freestone peaches. The fruit ripens May–August, and consumers can either buy picked fruit, or pick their own.|$|E
60|$|At Radford in Devonshire (10/44. Loudon's 'Gardener's Mag.' 1826 volume 1. page 471.) a <b>clingstone</b> peach, {{purchased}} as the Chancellor, {{was planted}} in 1815, and in 1824, after having previously produced peaches alone, bore on one branch twelve nectarines; in 1825 the same branch yielded twenty-six nectarines, and in 1826 thirty-six nectarines, together with eighteen peaches. One of the peaches {{was almost as}} smooth on one side as a nectarine. The nectarines were as dark as, but smaller than, the Elruge.|$|E
6000|$|Whether or not {{the peach}} has {{proceeded}} from the almond, it has certainly given rise to nectarines, or smooth peaches, {{as they are called}} by the French. Most of the varieties, both of the peach and nectarine, reproduce themselves truly by seed. Gallesio (10/29. 'Teoria della Riproduzione Vegetale' 1816 page 86.) says he has verified this with respect to eight races of the peach. Mr. Rivers (10/30. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1195.) has given some striking instances from his own experience, and it is notorious that good peaches are constantly raised in North America from seed. Many of the American sub-varieties come true or nearly true to their kind, such as the white-blossom, several of the yellow-fruited freestone peaches, the blood <b>clingstone,</b> the heath, and the lemon <b>clingstone.</b> On the other hand, a <b>clingstone</b> peach has been known to give rise to a freestone. (10/31. Mr. Rivers 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1859 page 774.) In England it has been noticed that seedlings inherit from their parents flowers of the same size and colour. Some characters, however, contrary to what might have been expected, often are not inherited; such as the presence and form of the glands on the leaves. (10/32. Downing 'The Fruits of America' 1845 pages 475, 489, 492, 494, 496. See also F. Michaux 'Travels in N. America' English translation page 228. For similar cases in France see Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 97.) With respect to nectarines, both cling and freestones are known in North America to reproduce themselves by seed. (10/33. Brickell 'Nat. Hist. of N. Carolina' page 102 and Downing 'Fruit Trees' page 505.) In England the new white nectarine was a seedling of the old white, and Mr. Rivers (10/34. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1862 page 1196.) has recorded several similar cases. From this strong tendency to inheritance, which both peach and nectarine trees exhibit,--from certain slight constitutional differences (10/35. The peach and nectarine do not succeed equally well in the some soil: see Lindley 'Horticulture' page 351.) in their nature,--and from the great difference in their fruit both in appearance and flavour, it is not surprising, notwithstanding that the trees differ in no other respects and cannot even be distinguished, as I am informed by Mr. Rivers, whilst young, that they have been ranked by some authors as specifically distinct. Gallesio does not doubt that they are distinct; even Alph. De Candolle does not appear perfectly assured of their specific identity: and an eminent botanist has quite recently (10/36. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 1859 page 97.) maintained that the nectarine [...] "probably constitutes a distinct species." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{varieties}} of the peach have largely increased in number since the Christian era, when {{from two to}} five varieties were known (10/56. Dr. A. Targioni-Tozzetti 'Journal Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 167. Alph. de Candolle 'Geograph. Bot.' page 885.) and the nectarine was unknown. At the present time, besides many varieties said to exist in China, Downing describes, in the United States, seventy-nine native and imported {{varieties of}} the peach; {{and a few years}} ago Lindley (10/57. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 5 page 554. See also Carriere 'Description et Class. des Varietes de Pechers.') enumerated one hundred and sixty-four varieties of the peach and nectarine grown in England. I have already indicated the chief points of difference between the several varieties. Nectarines, even when produced from distinct kinds of peaches, always possess their own peculiar flavour, and are smooth and small. <b>Clingstone</b> and freestone peaches, which differ in the ripe flesh either firmly adhering to the stone, or easily separating from it, also differ in the character of the stone itself; that of the freestones or melters being more deeply fissured, with the sides of the fissures smoother than in clingstones. In the various kinds the flowers differ not only in size, but in the larger flowers the petals are differently shaped, more imbricated, generally red in the centre and pale towards the margin: whereas in the smaller flowers the margin of the petal is usually more darkly coloured. One variety has nearly white flowers. The leaves are more or less serrated, and are either destitute of glands, or have globose or reniform glands (10/58. Loudon's 'Encyclop. of Gardening' page 907.) and some few peaches, such as the Brugnen, bear on the same tree both globular and kidney-shaped glands. (10/59. M. Carriere in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154.) According to Robertson (10/60. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 3 page 332. See also 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 271 to same effect. Also 'Journal of Horticulture' September 26, 1865 page 254.) the trees with glandular leaves are liable to blister, but not in any great degree to mildew; whilst the non-glandular trees are more subject to curl, to mildew, and to the attacks of aphides. The varieties differ in the period of their maturity, in the fruit keeping well, and in hardiness,--the latter circumstance being especially attended to in the United States. Certain varieties, such as the Bellegarde, stand forcing in hot-houses better than other varieties. The flat-peach of China is the most remarkable of all the varieties; it is so much depressed towards the summit, that the stone is here covered only by roughened skin and not by a fleshy layer. (10/61. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 4 page 512.) Another Chinese variety, called the Honey-peach, is remarkable from the fruit terminating in a long sharp point; its leaves are glandless and widely dentate. (10/62. 'Journal of Horticulture' September 8, 1853 page 188.) The Emperor of Russia peach is a third singular variety, having deeply double-serrated leaves; the fruit is deeply cleft with one-half projecting considerably beyond the other: it originated in America, and its seedlings inherit similar leaves. (10/63. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 6 page 412.) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Clingstone</b> {{refers to}} a drupe having a stone which cannot easily {{be removed from the}} flesh. The flesh is {{attached}} strongly to the stone and must be cut to free the stone. <b>Clingstone</b> varieties of fruits in the genus Prunus are preferred as table fruit and for jams, because the flesh of <b>clingstone</b> fruits tends to be more tender and juicy throughout.|$|E

50|$|The peach is {{indigenous}} to China, with its historical records traced from fossil stones in Wu County in Jiangsu province, during archaeological excavations.
