60|$|On the {{syenitic}} ridge, {{which forms}} the southern boundary of Herradura Bay and Plain, I found the Concholepas and Turritella cingulata (mostly in fragments), {{at the height}} of 242 feet above the sea. I could not have told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by man, if I had not found one very small mass of them cemented together in a friable <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff.</b> I mention this fact more particularly, because I carefully looked, in many apparently favourable spots, at lesser heights on the side of this ridge, and could not find even the smallest fragment of a shell. This is only one instance out of many, proving that the absence of sea-shells on the surface, though in many respects inexplicable, is an argument of very little weight in opposition to other evidence on the recent elevation of the land. The highest point in this neighbourhood at which I found upraised shells of existing species was on an inland calcareous plain, {{at the height of}} 252 feet above the sea.|$|E
6000|$|The basin-like plains at {{the foot}} of the Cordillera are in several respects remarkable; that on which the capital of Chile stands is fifteen miles in width, in an east and west line, and of much greater length in a north and south line; it stands 1,750 feet above the sea; its surface appears smooth, but really falls and rises in wide gentle undulations, the hollows {{corresponding}} with the main valleys of the Cordillera: the striking manner in which it abruptly comes up to the foot of this great range has been remarked by every author since the time of Molina. (This plain is partially separated into two basins by a range of hills; the southern half, according to Meyen ("Reise um Erde" [...] Th. 1 s. 274), falls in height, by an abrupt step, of between fifteen and twenty feet.) Near the Cordillera it is composed of a stratified mass of pebbles of all sizes, occasionally including rounded boulders: near its western boundary, it consists of reddish sandy clay, containing some pebbles and numerous fragments of pumice, and sometimes passes into pure sand or into volcanic ashes. At Podaguel, on this western side of the plain, beds of sand are capped by a <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff,</b> the uppermost layers being generally hard and substalagmitic, and the lower ones white and friable, both together precisely resembling the beds at Coquimbo, which contain recent marine shells. Abrupt, but rounded, hummocks of rock rise out of this plain: those of Sta. Lucia and S. Cristoval are formed of greenstone-porphyry almost entirely denuded of its original covering of porphyritic claystone breccia; on their summits, many fragments of rock (some of them kinds not found in situ) are coated and united together by a white, friable, <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff,</b> like that found at Podaguel. When this matter was deposited on the summit of S. Cristoval, the water must have stood 946 feet above the surface of the surrounding plain. (Or 2,690 feet above the sea, as measured barometrically by Mr. Eck. This tuff appears to the eye nearly pure; but when placed in acid it leaves a considerable residue of sand and broken crystals, apparently of feldspar. Dr. Meyen ("Reise" [...] Th. 1 s. 269) says he found a similar substance on the neighbouring hill of Dominico (and I found it also on the Cerro Blanco), and he attributes it to the weathering of the stone. In some places which I examined, its bulk put this view of its origin quite out of the question; and I should much doubt whether the decomposition of a porphyry would, in any case, leave a crust chiefly composed of carbonate of lime. The white crust, which is commonly seen on weathered feldspathic rocks, does not appear to contain any free carbonate of lime.) ...|$|E
60|$|This {{formation}} is first met with sixty-seven {{miles from the}} mouth of the river; thence it extends uninterruptedly, generally but not exclusively on the northern side of the valley, close up to the Cordillera. The basalt is generally black and fine-grained, but sometimes grey and laminated; it contains some olivine, and high up the valley much glassy feldspar, where, also, it is often amygdaloidal; it is never highly vesicular, except on the sides of rents and on the upper and lower, spherically laminated surfaces. It is often columnar; and in one place I saw magnificent columns, each face twelve feet in width, with their interstices filled up with <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff.</b> The streams rest conformably on the white sedimentary beds, but I nowhere saw the actual junction; nor did I anywhere see the white beds actually superimposed on the lava; but some way up the valley at the foot of the uppermost escarpments, they must be thus superimposed. Moreover, at the lowest point down the valley, where the streams thin out and terminate in irregular projections, the spaces or intervals between these projections are filled up to the level of the now denuded and gravel-capped surfaces of the plains, with the white-zoned sedimentary beds; proving that this matter continued to be deposited after the streams had flowed. Hence we may conclude that the basalt is contemporaneous with the upper parts of the great tertiary formation.|$|E

40|$|The great {{abundance}} of coherent volcanic and <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> throughout some Italian Regions, {{the ease with}} which they can be quarried and worked, and their reasonable compression strength characteristics have made this material a very popular one for construction purposes ever since ancient times. This paper is one product of research aimed at characterizing, from the geological, petrographic and technical points of view, the coherent volcanic and <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> used in the construction of historic buildings since the days of ancient Italy. After a short description of the technical characteristics {{of some of the most}} widely used coherent volcanic and <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> and after briefly mentioning some examples of how they are employed in the construction area, a detailed presentation is given of geological, petrographic and technical properties of some vulcanic tuffs coming from Latium Region and some <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> coming from the Murgia zone in Apulia Region. Both of these material were wide employed in ancient monumental building in Italy. The growing need for technical intervention aimed at the rehabilitation and conservation of buildings of great historic value, built with these materials, require a greater and greater knowledge of their technical characteristics. This paper presents results of many tests carried on some hundreds of samples of these materials to simulate effects of weathering on their technical and mechanical properties. In particular, the authors carried out the following kinds of tests to study different behaviours of these materials at different kinds of weathering: a) Cycles of immersion in oversaturated solutions of sodium sulphate and drying at 100 °C; b) ambient humidity for few days; c) water-saturated atmosphere at 22 ° C; d) cycles of frost - defrost; e) cycles of immersion and drying. Results coming from these kinds of tests are presentes in this paper, where are also discussed some mathematical relations between degree of weathering of these materials and their technical and mechanical behaviour...|$|R
25|$|Besides {{iron ore}} and mineral fuels, {{there is a}} variety of useful {{minerals}} and rocks, including: quartz in Muntele Mare and around Someșu Rece (where {{can also be found}} feldspar), dacites and andesites in Vlădeasa Massif and around Morlaca, Bologa, Poieni, Săcuieu, Stolna and Iara, granites in Muntele Mare, limestones and dolomites used to fabricate binders (lime, cement), exploited in Săndulești, Tureni, Surduc, Buru, Poieni, etc., <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> of high quality with quarries at Tioc–Cornești, kaolin sands at Popești, Topa, Băgara, Gârbău, etc., salt, with significant reserves at Ocna Dejului, Turda, Cojocna, Sic, Nireș, gravel pits on Someșul Mic at Gilău, Florești and on lower Arieș.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, in a precipitous part of {{the ravine}} of Las Bocas, a red {{sandstone}} is distinctly seen to overlie a thick bed of pale mud, also quite like the Pampean formation, abounding with concretions of true tosca-rock. This sandstone extends over many miles of country: it is as red as the brightest volcanic scoriae; it sometimes passes into a coarse red conglomerate composed of the underlying primary rocks; and often passes into a soft white sandstone with red streaks. At the Calera de los Huerfanos, {{only a quarter of}} a mile south of where I first met with the red sandstone, the crystalline white limestone is quarried: as this bed is the uppermost, and as it often passes into calcareous sandstone, interstratified with pure sand; and as the red sandstone likewise passes into soft white sandstone, and is also the uppermost bed, I believe that these two beds, though so different, are equivalents. A few leagues southward of these two places, on each side of the low primary range of S. Juan, there are some flat-topped, cliff-bounded, separate little hills, very similar to those fringing the primary ranges in the great plain south of Buenos Ayres: they are composed- -1st, of <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff</b> with many particles of quartz, sometimes passing into a coarse conglomerate; 2nd, of a stone undistinguishable on the closest inspection from the compacter varieties of tosca-rock; and 3rd, of semi-crystalline limestone, including nodules of agate: these three varieties pass insensibly into each other, and as they form the uppermost stratum in this district, I believe that they, also, are the equivalents of the pure crystalline limestone, and of the red and white sandstones and conglomerates.|$|E
60|$|The {{origin and}} manner of {{formation}} of the thick beds of gravel, sandy clay, volcanic detritus, and <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuff,</b> composing these basin-like plains, is very important; because, as we shall presently show, they send arms or fringes far up the main valleys of the Cordillera. Many of the inhabitants believe that these plains were once occupied by lakes, suddenly drained; but I conceive {{that the number of}} the separate breaches at nearly the same level in the mountains surrounding them quite precludes this idea. Had not such distinguished naturalists as MM. Meyen and Gay stated their belief that these deposits were left by great debacles rushing down from the Cordillera, I should not have noticed a view, which appears to me from many reasons improbable in the highest degree--namely, from the vast accumulation of WELL-ROUNDED PEBBLES--their frequent stratification with layers of sand--the overlying beds of calcareous tuff--this same substance coating and uniting the fragments of rock on the hummocks in the plain of Santiago--and lastly even from the worn, rounded, and much denuded state of these hummocks, and of the headlands which project from the surrounding mountains. On the other hand, these several circumstances, as well as the continuous union of the basins {{at the foot of the}} Cordillera, with the great plain of the Rio Rapel which still retains the marks of sea-action at various levels, and their general similarity in form and composition with the many plains near the coast, which are either similarly marked or are strewed with upraised marine remains, fully convince me that the mountains bounding these basin-plains were breached, their islet-like projecting rocks worn, and the loose stratified detritus forming their now level surfaces deposited, by the sea, as the land slowly emerged. It is hardly possible to state too strongly the perfect resemblance in outline between these basin-like, long, and narrow plains of Chile (especially when in the early morning the mists hanging low represented water), and the creeks and fiords now intersecting the southern and western shores of the continent. We can on this view of the sea, when the land stood lower, having long and tranquilly occupied the spaces between the mountain-ranges, understand how the boundaries of the separate basins were breached in more than one place; for we see that this is the general character of the inland bays and channels of Tierra del Fuego; we there, also, see in the sawing action of the tides, which flow with great force in the cross channels, a power sufficient to keep the breaches open as the land emerged. We can further see that the waves would naturally leave the smooth bottom of each great bay or channel, as it became slowly converted into land, gently inclined to as many points as there were mouths, through which the sea finally retreated, thus forming so many watersheds, without any marked ridges, on a nearly level surface. The absence of marine remains in these high inland plains cannot be properly adduced as an objection to their marine origin: for we may conclude, from shells not being found in the great shingle beds of Patagonia, though copiously strewed on their surfaces, and from many other analogous facts, that such deposits are eminently unfavourable for the embedment of such remains; and with respect to shells not being found strewed on the surface of these basin-like plains, it was shown in the last chapter that remains thus exposed in time decay and disappear.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an original description of thermal waters {{of a group}} of hot springs in the valley of the Songwe River (7 - 10 km downstream from the Panda Hill carbonatite massif) and the derived <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs.</b> It is suggested that Th hydrotherms are related to the latest, Quaternary, alkaline magmatism that acted throughout the East-African rift system, including the Rukwa graben, along which the Songwe River flows. The thermal waters contain carbon dioxide, alkalis, silicon, carbonates, and hydrocarbonates, mineralization being 3. 3 - 3. 4 gil. They differ from thermal waters of other continental rift systems, in particular from those of the Baikal Rift, in some chemical ratios (Li/Rb, Sr/Li, Sr/Rb, rNa/rCl). Major (calcite and aragonite) and secondary (dolomite and strontianite) carbonate minerals of the tuffs were taken through microprobe analysis. The calcites show extremely high contents of Sr (up to 5. 6 wt. % SrO) and Mg (up to 5 wt. % MgO). The aragonites are likewise high in Sr (11. 5 - 36. 8 wt. % SrO) but low in Mg (0. 05 - 0. 17 wt. % MgO) and form a complete isomorphic series with Ca-strontianite (46. 8 - 54. 2 wt. % SrO). The tuffs occasionally contain grains of terrigenous quartz and feldspar and admixtures of trona, halite, and hydromica-ceous minerals...|$|R

60|$|The Pampean {{formation}} is highly interesting from its vast extent, its disputed origin, {{and from the}} number of extinct gigantic mammifers embedded in it. It has upon the whole a very uniform character: consisting of a more or less dull reddish, slightly indurated, argillaceous earth or mud, often, but not always, including in horizontal lines concretions of marl, and frequently passing into a compact marly rock. The mud, wherever I examined it, even close to the concretions, did not contain any carbonate of lime. The concretions are generally nodular, sometimes rough externally, sometimes stalactiformed; they are of a compact structure, but often penetrated (as well as the mud) by hair-like serpentine cavities, and occasionally with irregular fissures in their centres, lined with minute crystals of carbonate of lime; they are of white, brown, or pale pinkish tints, often marked by black dendritic manganese or iron; they are either darker or lighter tinted than the surrounding mass; they contain much carbonate of lime, but exhale a strong aluminous odour, and leave, when dissolved in acids, a large but varying residue, of which the greater part consists of sand. These concretions often unite into irregular strata; and over very large tracts of country, the entire mass consists of a hard, but generally cavernous marly rock: some of the varieties might be called <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs.</b>|$|R

40|$|The Noggin Cove Formation {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fragmental mafic volcanic rocks with subordinate pillowed basalt and black shale. Massive volcanic conglomerates and coarse sandstones, with lesser amounts of medium-bedded tuffs and lapilli breccias, dominate the fragmental rocks. Volcanic conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones were predominantly deposited as subaqueous debris flows, {{some of which}} are spectacular in terms of their thickness and clast size. [...] The volume of fragmental rocks relative to basaltic lavas indicates an explosive volcanic source; ubiquitous vesicular clasts indicate shallow marine to subareal eruption. Debris flow conglomerates and sandstones dominate southern exposures but in the north they are subordinate to basaltic lavas and shallow marine deposits (highly <b>calcareous</b> <b>tuffs</b> and breccias). This distribution implies fragmental rocks were transported southward to form a marine volcaniclastic apron over pillow lavas, lava flows and basaltic dykes. [...] The Carmanville Melange consists mainly of sandstone, siltstone and mafic volcanic clasts and blocks in a black shale matrix. Melange is interbedded and interfolded with volcanic rocks of the underlying Noggin Cove Formation and with siltstones and sandstones of the overlying Woody Island Siltstone. In many cases, folded beds of siltstone can be seen within the black shale matrix. The melange is interpreted as olistostromal.

The first series of specimens appeared more resistant than the second one. As explanation of the hardening, the possible precipitation of new phases such as carbonate duringthe fast drying is discussed based on chemical and microstructural observations as well as the effect of suction than could change the microstructural arrangement of tuff particles when the moisture content varies...|$|R
