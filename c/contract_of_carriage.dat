40|$|The back bone of {{international}} trade has always been international transport. Without good transport networks, the movement {{of goods and services}} from one frontier to another would be an uphill task, and would greatly hinder development in international trade. The impact of such poor transport networks would reflect negatively on economies that rely on international trade for the growth of their nations. Nevertheless, perfect transport networks would be useless if the performance of the business <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> was not regulated by a law developed to meet the standards established by time, and that would regulate the relationship of the parties under <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> mainly the carrier, consignor and consignee, so as to ensure certainty and equality in the allocation of risks between the parties thereunder. This research focuses on the <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by sea. Like most other modes of transport, one of the major issues that arises in the business <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by sea is the conflict between the carrier, consignor and consignee, with regards to the allocation of risk in the carriage. Over the years, early rules that were developed to regulate the relationship of the parties under <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by sea placed the carrier in a dominant position over the consignor. The carrier issued a standard bill of lading which exempted him from almost all liability for damage or loss of the goods in his care. The consignors and bona fide third parties, not satisfied with the terms <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>contracts</b> brought {{a lot of pressure to}} bear on their governments to enact legislation protecting their interests in the transaction. The United States of America were the first to pass such national law revising the position of the parties under <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> In 1893 the United States of America passed the Harter Act. This Act aimed at imposing limits of liability on the carrier to which no derogation could be brought. However, this was a dangerous precedence which was going to hinder international trade rather than improve on it, as different nations developing local legislation on <b>carriage</b> meant conflict <b>of</b> laws. In order to avoid the extensive nationalisation <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> laws, the international maritime community set to develop rules that would regulate carriage by sea. Over the years convention has succeeded convention such that today four international regimes (The Hague Rules, Hague-Visby Rules, Hamburg Rules and Rotterdam Rules), exist regulating <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by sea. This research takes an in-depth look at these regimes that were developed to regulate carriage by sea, and the author aims to identify a particular regime that meets the standards of modern day practice <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods, and advocate for the ratification of this regime, to the exclusion of all others so as to foster uniformity, certainty and equality in the business <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> <b>of</b> goods by sea...|$|R

Whether articles 8 and 10 of the Rotterdam Rules provide an effective mechanism for electronic cargo documentation, and in which ways will be investigated.

5000|$|The consignor, in a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage,</b> is {{the person}} sending a {{shipment}} to be delivered whether by land, sea or air. Some carriers, such as national postal entities, use the term [...] "sender" [...] or [...] "shipper" [...] but {{in the event of}} a legal dispute the proper and technical term [...] "consignor" [...] will generally be used.|$|E
50|$|As {{long as the}} {{air waybill}} is neither dated nor signed twice, the goods do not fall within {{the terms of the}} {{conditions}} of contract and therefore the carrier will not accept any responsibility for the goods. The validity of the air waybill and thus the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> expires upon delivery of the shipment to the consignee (or his authorised agent).|$|E
50|$|The {{bill of lading}} from carrier to shipper {{can be used as}} an {{evidence}} of the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> by the fact that carrier has received the goods and upon the receipt the carrier would deliver the goods. In this case, the bill of lading would be used as a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage.</b> Also, the bill of lading can perform as a contract of a carriage. In this case, the bill of lading can be used if shipper does not properly ship the goods than the shipper cannot receive the bill of lading from the carrier. Eventually, the shipper would have to deliver the bill of lading to the seller. In this case, the bill of lading is used as a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> between seller and carrier. However, when the bill of lading is negotiated to a bona fide third party then the bill of lading becomes a conclusive evidence where no contradictory evidence can be introduced. It is because the third party cannot examine the actual shipment and can only pay attention to the document itself, not survey or examination of the shipment itself. However, the bill of lading will rarely be the contract itself, since the cargo space will have been booked previously, perhaps by telephone, email or letter. The preliminary contract will be acknowledged by both the shipper and carrier to incorporate the carrier's standard terms of business. If the Hague-Visby Rules apply, then all of the Rules will be automatically annexed to the bill of lading, thus forming a statutory contract.|$|E

5000|$|In most <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>carriage</b> {{the carrier}} has greater {{bargaining}} power than the shipper, {{and in the}} 19th century English judges developed rules to protect the weaker parties. Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop the English common law principles by providing a basic set of standards to be met by the carrier; but in practice the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on {{a wide array of}} exemptions from liability (such as [...] "Act of God", [...] "Perils of the Sea" [...] and [...] "negligence in navigation or management of the ship").|$|R
