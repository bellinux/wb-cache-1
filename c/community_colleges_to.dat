2500|$|While most {{college admissions}} {{involves}} {{high school students}} applying to colleges, transfer admissions are important as well. Estimates {{of the percentage of}} college students who transfer vary from 20% to 33% to 60%, with the consensus position being around a third of college students transfer, and there are many indications that transfer activity is increasing. One report suggested that nearly half of all undergraduates in the nation were attending community colleges. Media coverage of student transfers is generally less than coverage of the high school to college transition. A common transfer path is students moving from two-year <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>to</b> four-year institutions, although there is considerable movement between four-year institutions. Reasons for transferring include unhappiness with campus life, cost, and course and degree selection. There are no consistent national rules for transfers, and requirements vary by college. Many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year schools, particularly flagship state universities, so that matters such as the transfers of credits are handled appropriately. There are indications that many private colleges are more actively seeking transfer applicants. Still, transferring can be difficult; transfer students have been described in the past as [...] "academic nomads".|$|E

2500|$|According to the Free Application Federal Student Aid, {{also known}} as FAFSA, in 2013, over 58,000 {{students}} identified as homeless on their application. [...] "The federal government defines these unaccompanied homeless youth (UHY) as individuals {{who do not have}} [...] "fixed, regular and adequate" [...] housing and who are [...] "not in the physical custody of a parent or adult." [...] The McKinney Vento Act is considered the key piece of federal legislation pertaining to educational support for homeless children and teens. The causes of homelessness varies from student to student. There are two types of homeless college students: 1. students that are homeless upon entering college and 2. students who become homeless during college. For the youth that become homeless upon entering college, this situation represents the students that are having trouble sustaining housing due to job loss of their parent or guardian, the lack of a parent or guardian or because youth has been asked to leave the home or decided to runaway. The reasons for a college youth to become homeless while attending college are as follows: unable to sustain the financial expenses for housing and food. Secondly, by having the financial support given by family revoked. Fortunately, there are programs available at state colleges and universities that provide students with the necessary resources to obtain financial and housing stability and sustainability. There are also organizations such as the National Association For The Education Of Homeless Children and Youth (NAEHCY) that advocate for a higher education so the children and youth can fulfil their dreams. Another innovative model that can be of great help to college students experiencing homelessness is Single Stop USA, which operates in <b>community</b> <b>colleges</b> <b>to</b> help connect low-income students to the resources they need, including housing, to not only stay in school but to excel ...|$|E
