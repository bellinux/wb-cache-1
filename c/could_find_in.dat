5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are given more weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, who– although royalty and holy men– were given the traits of persons one <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|This period also {{marked a}} phase of {{considerable}} travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> order to preserve {{the blood of the}} pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> <b>In</b> the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E

5|$|Several units lost crucially needed {{supply lines}} {{in the middle of}} their offensives, {{particularly}} when crossing the Naktong River which had few stable bridges remaining. The NK 3rd Division stopped receiving food and ammunition supply as it pushed on Taegu in mid-August, forcing one of its regiments to withdraw from the captured Triangulation Hill. At Naktong Bulge, the NK 4th Division was able to establish a raft system for moving supplies across the river, but it still suffered serious food, ammunition, weapon, and equipment shortages after its August 5 crossing. It was also eventually turned back due to supply problems. The situation was most dire for units in the east, where rugged and mountainous terrain already posed a logistical challenge. The NK 5th Division and NK 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong stopped receiving all food and ammunition supply between August 12 and August 20, a key factor in their defeat there. In some instances, desperate North Korean units forced South Korean populations to carry their supplies for them. North Korean units had advanced too far too quickly, and their logistical system, stretched beyond its limit, collapsed at a key point in the war. Morale remained high for many units despite the lack of supplies. North Korean units instead turned to foraging for what they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the countryside or raiding UN supplies. Small guerrilla units, such as the NK 766th Infantry Regiment, could do this effectively.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{mishandling}} {{the sales}} with Philip Green, Sir Alan felt that Ruth {{was not to}} blame for the loss as she had been the top seller on her team, criticising Michelle for bringing her back when both her errors and those of Sam outweighed Ruth's single mistake. However, Michelle said she had even less reason to bring Ansell in, since both he and Ruth had sold well, and that Ruth's handling of Green was the sole fault she <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> either performance.|$|E
25|$|Food was {{scarce and}} poor in quality; {{there was no}} sanitation, running water, or plumbing. The camp had poor drainage. The area, due to its {{proximity}} to the Atlantic Ocean, receives {{a great deal of}} rain, which made the clay campgrounds permanently muddy. The inmates made paths with the few stones they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> a vain attempt to keep the mud in check. Pieces of wire that had been stripped of their barbs were placed between the cabins and the toilets and used by the refugees like the railing of a staircase, to maintain balance on the unsteady ground.|$|E

25|$|Partisans on {{both sides}} sought any {{advantage}} they <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> <b>In</b> several states, this included changing the process of selecting electors to ensure the desired result. In Georgia, Democratic-Republican legislators replaced the popular vote with selection by the state legislature. Federalist legislators did the same in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. This may have had some unintended consequences in Massachusetts, where {{the makeup of the}} delegation to the House of Representatives changed from 12 Federalists and 2 Democratic-Republicans to 8 Federalists and 6 Democratic-Republicans, perhaps the result of backlash {{on the part of the}} electorate. Pennsylvania also switched to legislative choice, but this resulted in an almost evenly split set of electors. Virginia switched from electoral districts to winner-take-all, a move that probably switched one or two votes out of the Federalist column.|$|E
25|$|A merger {{between this}} company {{with several other}} small match {{companies}} in Sweden, the company AB Svenska Förenade Tändsticksfabriker was founded in 1913 with Ivar Kreuger as the general manager. Later, by merging with the largest match company in Sweden, AB Jönköping-Vulcan, Svenska Tändsticks AB (Swedish Match) was founded in 1917. Ivar had originally tried to convince AB Jönköping-Vulcan to merge in December 1912, but {{they had not been}} interested as Vulcan was the dominating match company in Sweden. Ivar then started to acquire all of the match companies as well as most of the raw material companies he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> and around Sweden and then finally got AB Jönköping-Vulcan to accept the merger. He had been so persuasive in arguing for the merger that he managed to overvalue his side of the deal so that it was essentially the smaller organization taking over the larger one. It was his first big venture in inflating values, which became his prime tactic thereafter.|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{appearance}} of masses of enemy cavalry {{so close to}} the supply train and to the Emperor's Headquarters caused panic and consternation and prompted Eugène to immediately cancel his attack and pull back his entire Corps westwards to deal with this alarming situation.

Having no infantry of their own, the poorly coordinated Russian attacks came to nothing.|$|E

When filming continued into spring, Giacosi was able to re-create the wintry scenes by piling thirty bags of plaster onto all the bedsheets he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> order to simulate a snowscape. When a crowd scene was required, Giacosi convinced the local priest {{to move up the}} 8 April celebration of the town's patron saint by a few days, thus securing the presence of some 4,000 unpaid extras. In order to guarantee that the crowd would not dissipate as the hours passed by, Fellini instructed assistant director Rossi to shout out, [...] "Get the rooms ready for Totò and Sophia Loren", two of the most popular Italian entertainers of the period, and nobody left.|$|E
500|$|When scouts brought word on February 23 {{that the}} Mexican advance guard was in sight, the {{unprepared}} Texians gathered what food they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> town {{and fell back}} to the Alamo. [...] By late afternoon, Béxar was occupied by about 1,500 Mexican troops, who quickly raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter. For the next 13 days, the Mexican army besieged the Alamo. Several small skirmishes gave the defenders much-needed optimism, but had little real impact. [...] Bowie fell ill on February 24, leaving Travis in sole command of the Texian forces. [...] The same day, Travis sent messengers with a letter To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World, begging for reinforcements and vowing [...] "victory or death"; this letter was reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe. [...] Texian and American volunteers began to gather in Gonzales, waiting for Fannin to arrive and lead them to reinforce the Alamo. [...] After days of indecision, on February 26 Fannin prepared to march his 300 troops to the Alamo; they turned back the next day. [...] Fewer than 100 Texian reinforcements reached the fort.|$|E
500|$|British troops {{began their}} march at 2am on April 19, and Smith sent troops ahead under Major John Pitcairn. When Pitcairn {{and his men}} found a company of armed colonials at Lexington, he ordered them to disperse. [...] In the confusion, a shot was fired from an unknown source, which brought several volleys from the British troops. [...] Eight of the local men were killed and one British soldier was wounded. [...] The British burned or {{otherwise}} destroyed what supplies they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> Concord, and a second confrontation {{took place at the}} North Bridge. The bridge was held by the British, and by then about 400minutemen had assembled. Seeing the smoke from Concord, the colonials believed the town was being burned, and attempted to cross the bridge to succor it. The British fired on them but the colonials returned fire and defeated them. [...] The British, who had gotten reinforcements once they realized the countryside was roused against them, began their march to Boston harassed by at least 2,000militiamen who inflicted a steady toll by gunfire until the British gained the protection of the cannon near Boston. The encounters at Lexington and Concord were the first battles of what became the Revolutionary War.|$|E

500|$|In {{previous}} years, {{the organizers}} {{had made the}} race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper {{at a time when}} he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, [...] rider Bob Roll said [...] "Those sons of bitches put every mountain they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the race that year." [...] Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. La Stampa writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.|$|E
500|$|Von Spee {{decided to}} raid Papeete in Tahiti {{on his way}} to {{rendezvous}} {{with the rest of his}} squadron at Easter Island. The French held over [...] of high-quality Cardiff coal at the port, and von Spee hoped to seize the coal piles to replenish his squadron's supply. Additionally, von Spee aimed at destroying what allied shipping he <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> the harbour, and thought the raid might help raise his men's morale. Von Spee intended to coal at Suwarrow Atoll before sailing to Papeete, but was prevented by foul weather. Instead, von Spee decided to take Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and attempt to resupply at Bora Bora while Nürnberg and Titania were dispatched to Nukuhiva to guard the fleet's colliers. The German admiral intended to keep his vessels' identities secret by disguising them as French ships, flying French flags, and only allowing French- and English-speaking members of his crew contact with the Frenchmen present there. Von Spee managed to replenish his food stores using gold seized by Titania and Nürnberg during their raid of Fanning, and was able to discover the strength of the French military in the region as well as the exact size and positions of the coal piles at Papeete.|$|E
500|$|Close to the Edge, the group's second album, was {{released}} in 1992. Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, the album produced the Top 5 country hits [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby", the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album Beyond the Blue Neon. The next singles, [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", both failed to reach top 10. Roe considered Close to the Edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it; in a 1994 interview with New Country magazine, he stated: [...] "There aren't ten great songs out there for everybody, certainly not that you <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>in</b> a 30-day period of time." [...] Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet", which he co-wrote, {{saying that it was}} [...] "by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that's at the time when I'm thinkin', 'Oh, this is easy, let's write this. It's kinda cute." [...] Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song, but described the rest of the album with favor, saying that its [...] "strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God, family and honest living – traditional stuff, no doubt influenced by the members' bluegrass background", while Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune thought that [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", [...] "which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood", were the strongest tracks.|$|E
