25|$|The {{exponential}} processor transistor growth {{predicted by}} Moore {{does not always}} translate into exponentially greater practical CPU performance. Since around 2005–2007, Dennard scaling appears to have broken down, so even though Moore's law continued for several years after that, it has not yielded dividends in improved performance. The primary reason cited for the breakdown is that at small sizes, <b>current</b> <b>leakage</b> poses greater challenges, and also causes the chip to heat up, which creates a threat of thermal runaway and therefore, further increases energy costs.|$|E

25|$|Related to this, a single-pole RCD/RCBO {{interrupts}} the energized conductor only, while a double-pole device interrupts {{both the}} energized and return conductors. Usually {{this is a}} standard and safe practice, since the return conductor is held at ground potential anyway. However, because of its design, a single-pole RCD will not isolate or disconnect all relevant wires in certain uncommon situations, for example where the return conductor is not being held, as expected, at ground potential, or where <b>current</b> <b>leakage</b> occurs between the return and earth conductors. In these cases, a double-pole RCD will offer protection, since the return conductor would also be disconnected.|$|E
25|$|An RCD {{does not}} provide {{protection}} against unexpected or dangerously high current (called spikes or surges) when current is in the usual wires in the circuit, therefore it cannot replace a fuse or protect against overheating or fire risk due to overcurrent (overload) or short circuits if the fault {{does not lead to}} <b>current</b> <b>leakage.</b> Therefore, RCDs are often used or integrated as a single product along with some kind of circuit breaker, such as a fuse or miniature circuit breaker (MCB), which adds protection in the event of excessive current in the circuit (the resulting RCD with overcurrent protection called an RCBO). RCDs also cannot detect the situation where a human accidentally touches both conductors at the same time, since the current through an expected device, an unexpected route, or a human, are indistinguishable if the current returns through the expected conductor.|$|E
25|$|Each {{ganglion}} {{contains the}} body of one motor giant neuron (MoG), powerful and large bodied motor neurons whose projections innervate the five fast flexor (FF) muscles found in a segment and interact with them through chemical synapses. The ganglia also contain two sets of giant axons known as the lateral giant neurons and the medial giant neurons. These interneurons play important roles in escape swimming. Their large diameter allows for rapid conduction since there is less <b>current</b> <b>leakage.</b> Their projections extend through the third root in each ganglion, and Furshpan and Potter found that they synapses they subsequently made with the MoG passed depolarizing currents in a direct and unidirectional manner. These electrical synapses account for {{the speed of the}} escape mechanism and display some features of chemical synapses such as LTP and LTD. Variations in escape response characteristic depend on the location where the crayfish body is prodded or attacked and also depend on which of the giant neurons is stimulated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} diagnosis of railway arrester considering uncertainty. Arresters, a protective device that prevents damage due to transient voltages, deteriorate due to the absorption of moisture, repetitive operation during over-voltages and manufacturing defects. Various diagnostic techniques are available for monitoring deterioration of arresters. The technique based on the amplitude of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> measures the root mean square or peak values of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components. After measuring the total <b>leakage</b> <b>current,</b> harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components are analyzed by using a microprocessor based device. The level of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> {{is indicative of the}} arrester conditions. Harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components occur due to nonlinear characteristics of railway arrester. Since <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> contains uncertainty characteristics of power source, the probability density functions of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components can be obtained for ZnO arrester.

These statistical measures can be helpful to reduce the diagnostic error for railway arrester...|$|R
25|$|The {{malnutrition}} many alcoholics suffer deprives them {{of important}} cofactors for the oxidative metabolism of glucose. Neural tissues depend on this process for energy, and {{disruption of the}} cycle would impair cell growth and function. Schwann cells produce myelin that wraps around the sensory and motor nerve axons to enhance action potential conduction in the periphery. An energy deficiency in Schwann cells would account for the disappearance of myelin on peripheral nerves, which may result in damage to axons or loss of nerve function altogether. In peripheral nerves, oxidative enzyme activity is most concentrated around the nodes of Ranvier, making these locations most vulnerable to cofactor deprivation. Lacking essential cofactors reduces myelin impedance, increases <b>current</b> <b>leakage,</b> and slows signal transmission. Disruptions in conductance first affect the peripheral ends of the longest and largest peripheral nerve fibers because they suffer most from decreased action potential propagation. Thus, neural deterioration occurs in an accelerating cycle: myelin damage reduces conductance, and reduced conductance contributes to myelin degradation. The slowed conduction of action potentials in axons causes segmental demyelination extending proximally; this {{is also known as}} retrograde degeneration.|$|E

40|$|CMOS {{technology}} has scaled aggressively {{over the past}} few decades in an effort to enhance functionality, speed and packing density per chip. As the feature sizes are scaling down to sub- 100 nm regime, leakage power is increasing significantly and is becoming the dominant component of the total power dissipation. Major contributors to the total <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> in deep submicron regime are subthreshold and gate tunneling <b>leakage</b> <b>currents.</b> The <b>leakage</b> reduction techniques developed so far were mostly devoted to reducing subthreshold leakage. However, at sub- 65 nm feature sizes, gate <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> grows faster and is expected to surpass subthreshold <b>leakage</b> <b>current.</b> In this work, an extensive analysis of the circuit level characteristics of subthreshold and gate <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> is performed at 45 nm and 32 nm feature sizes.

At room temperature leakage is so low that it is specified as time to self-discharge. Supercapacitor self-discharge time is specified in hours, days or weeks.
