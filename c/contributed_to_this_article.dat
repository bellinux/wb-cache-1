5000|$|The average {{acceptance}} rate in 2009 at WMSCI and related conferences was 32.12%, {{with the average}} of 4.93 reviewers per paper/abstract. A combination of double blind peer reviews and non-anonymous peer reviews was used, {{with a total of}} 11902 reviews for the 2413 submissions. The organizers claim that for the refereed papers, the acceptance policy of WMSCI is the majority rule in both kind of reviewing, i.e. A majority of double blind reviewers and a majority of non-anonymous reviewers should recommend the acceptance of a submissions in order to be accepted for presentation and publication in the respective proceedings. More details regarding this two-tier reviewing methodology can be found at http://iiis.org/peer-reviewing.asp. when there is a tie between any kind of reviewers (double blind or non-anonymous)the tendency is to accept the respective submission. When there are a double tie among both kind of reviewers the tendency is to not accept the respective submission. This policy is (according to some people who <b>contributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>article)</b> more liberal than that of other conferences using the alternative strategy, where papers are accepted when there is the positive agreement of the reviewers (This affirmation need to be referenced) According to the organizers, WMSCI's policy would probably increase the chances of accepting poor papers, but certainly decreases the chances of rejecting good papers. Motivating their acceptance policy, the organizers cite Ernst et al. who showed that the same paper was rated from [...] "unacceptable" [...] to [...] "excellent" [...] according to 6 out of 9 measures by 45 field experts. According to the organizers, their acceptance policy may be better suited for the purpose of bringing together multi-disciplinary engineering communities, and may reduce possibilities of plagiarism and fraud generated by the reviewing process (see also peer review, peer review failure).|$|E

40|$|This {{overview}} of federal dissemination efforts {{over the last}} 30 years introduces a set of articles intended to stimulate thinking about certain basic issues of dissemination of education research knowledge and the roles {{that the federal government}} can play in that dissemination. The overview traces some of the history of federal dissemination efforts in education to provide a context in which to consider the articles that follow, especially their attention to the main ideas underlying federal dissemination planning for education. The articles gathered in this issue of Knowledge: Creation, Diffusion, Utili-zation were collected to stimulate thinking about basic issues of dissemina-tion and the roles that the federal government can play in it. The authors provide a series of prompts to focus attention on the main ideas that underlie federal dissemination system planning {{as it relates to the}} complex field of education. To set the stage for the ideas that the authors present, let’s first consider two context-establishing questions: first, what is it about the field of educa-tion that makes educational dissemination a complex endeavor?

40|$|As more firms adopt a {{customer}} asset management ap-proach to their business, {{it has become}} increasingly im-portant to understand how customer management efforts relate to the financial performance of the firm. Of specific interest to shareholders is the relationship between tradi-tional financial measures and customer-centric measures. The customer-centric measure that has received the most attention is customer lifetime value (CLV). In this article, the authors argue that the basic CLV model represents a useful foundation from which to begin to fill the gap be-tween marketing actions and shareholder value. However, much work remains to be done before appropriate models can be developed that reflect the true value of {{a customer}} to the firm. Specifically, this article elaborates on how fac-tors such as risk associated with customer behavior dy-namics, social and competitive effects, and the effect of the product life cycle can be incorporated into the basic CLV model. Marketing assets in general, and customer assets in par-ticular, have taken on increased prominence in marketing in recent years. This focus on customer assets has been driven, in part, by the recent crash of the dot. com market-place. Although the term asset connotes something of fi-nancial value, most of the dot. com start-ups were funded based on customer-centric measures such as eyeballs, number of customers, and click-through’s, which have an indirect and often tenuous relationship to shareholder value. In fact, some have focused on these customer-based metrics as one of the chief culprits behind the crash be-The {{authors would like to thank}} S.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the significance of Celestina (1499)   as it moves through time. It contends that new meanings emerge when {{the context in which}} the work is printed and read changes. As the prologue to the Tragicomedia intimates, each new act of engagement brings to the fore meanings that may not have been intended or even con-ceivable at the point of its composition. Taking a synchronic and comparative approach, the article looks at the ‘horizon of expectations ’ of Celestina’s reception in sixteenth-century Spain and Italy, when at the height of its popularity. Focusing on the issues of self-knowledge and solitude, it contextualises their portrayal within ideological debates about the misery and dignity of man that circulated in the Renaissance and within an en-vironment that was considering the possibility of disbelief. It juxtaposes Celestina against other contemporary texts involved in this supranational debate, such as Fernán Pérez de Oliva’s Diálogo de la dignidad del hombre (1546). It argues that, in this new horizon, Ce-lestina’s portrayal of self-knowledge and solitude and its engagement with debates about the misery and dignity of man goes beyond its medieval origins.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. Maternal effects can provide offspring with reliable information about the environment {{they are likely to}} experience, but also offer scope for maternal manipulation of young when interests diverge between parents and offspring. To predict the impact of parent–offspring conflict, we model the evolution of maternal effects on local adaptation of young. We find that parent–offspring conflict strongly influences the stability of maternal effects; moreover, the nature of the disagreement between parents and young predicts how conflict is resolved: when mothers favor less extreme mixtures of phenotypes relative to offspring (i. e., when mothers stand to gain by hedging their bets), mothers win the conflict by providing offspring with limited amounts of information. When offspring favor overproduction of one and the same phenotype across all environments compared to mothers (e. g., when offspring favor a larger body size), neither side wins the conflict and signaling breaks down. Only when offspring favor less extreme mixtures relative to their mothers (something no current model predicts), offspring win the conflict and obtain full information about the environment. We conclude that a partial or complete breakdown of informative maternal effects will be the norm rather than the exception in the presence of parent–offspring conflict. B.
