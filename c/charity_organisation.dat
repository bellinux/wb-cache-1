40|$|The {{issue of}} communicated {{accountability}} {{is particularly important}} in Faith-Based <b>Charity</b> <b>Organisations</b> as the donated funds and use of those funds are often meant to fulfil religious obligations {{for the well-being of}} society.

Our content analysis results indicate communicated accountability to be generally limited, focusing on providing basic descriptive information rather than judgement-based information. Our interviews with trustees and preparers of Trustee Annual Reports in Muslim <b>Charity</b> <b>Organisations</b> identified the reasons being due to high donor trust and consequently weak demand by stakeholders for the latter type of information, as well as internal organisational issues related to the organisational structure and culture, lack of internal professional expertise and high accountability cost...|$|R
