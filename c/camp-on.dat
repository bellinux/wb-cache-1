50|$|Access failure {{caused by}} the issuing of a system {{blocking}} signal by a communications system {{that does not have}} a call-originator <b>camp-on</b> feature.|$|E
5000|$|In telecommunication, a calling-party <b>camp-on</b> is {{a service}} feature {{that enables the}} {{telephone}} exchange to complete an access attempt in spite of temporary unavailability of system transmission or switching facilities required to establish the requested access.|$|E
5000|$|Systems {{that provide}} calling party <b>camp-on</b> [...] the system {{facilities}} until the necessary facilities become available, and then proceed {{to complete the}} requested access. Such systems {{may or may not}} issue a system blocking signal to inform the calling party of the access delay.|$|E
50|$|Last-call return, {{automatic}} recall, or (on PBX and centrex service) <b>camp-on,</b> is a telecommunication feature {{offered by}} telephony service providers to subscribers {{to provide the}} subscriber with the telephone number, and sometimes the time, of the last caller. The service may also offer the facility to place {{a call to the}} calling party.|$|E
50|$|Guatemala {{initially}} {{stayed out}} of World War II, with President Jorge Ubico declaring the country's neutrality on 4 September 1941. This pronouncement was reinforced five days later with another declaration. Ubico implemented strong prohibitions on Nazi propaganda in Guatemala, which had one of Latin America's largest German immigrant populations. Later, Guatemala moved into the Allied <b>camp—on</b> 9 December 1941, it declared war on Japan, and three days later, it declared war on Germany and Italy.|$|E
50|$|In tele{{communication}}, a called-party <b>camp-on</b> is {{a communication}} system service feature {{that enables the}} system to complete an access attempt in spite of issuance of a user blocking signal. This is most often found in a switchboard system at a company. Instead of going to voicemail or simply sitting on hold until the line is free, this feature places you in a queue whereby the moment the line clears, the call will be put through.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, an {{automatic}} callback {{is a computer}} telephony calling feature that permits a user, when encountering a busy condition or other condition where the called individual is unavailable, to instruct the system to retain the called number and to establish the call {{when there is an}} available line or when the called number is no longer busy. Automatic callback may be implemented in the terminal, in the telephone exchange, or shared between them. Automatic callback {{is not the same as}} <b>camp-on.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} a <b>camp-on</b> {{queueing}} system {{is related to the}} idea of having systems of multiple hierarchical queues. Customers requesting service at a service center are queued at one of different queueing stages based on the location of the customer's intended server within the service hierarchy. In many instances, customers in a <b>camp-on</b> model exhibit a dual function customer-server, giving rise to a system with queues of queues. For this model, we assume Poisson distributed arrivals with different classes of customers for each queueing level. The service completion process is regarded as exponentially distributed, a standard assumption for many communication systems. Here we discuss a stationary model for such a Markovian <b>camp-on</b> system. Closed-form solutions are derived for various state occupancy distributions of interest (e. g., joint probability distribution of queue lengths, marginal distributions for subsystems, accumulated workload, etc.), in systems with finite and infinite storage capacity and two queueing levels. Most of these results are also extended to multilevel queueing systems. It is found that this <b>camp-on</b> model is stable whenever all the distinct queues, in isolation, behave as stable systems. The form of the joint probability distribution of queue lengths is not a product of the independent contributions from each subsystem, since it must also account for the relative position of the queues with respect to the initial service center, the root of the service hierarchy. Two particular applications are discussed in detail: 1) PBX-like communication services, and 2) broadcast delivery services. Performance statistics such as waiting time distributions, blocking probabilities and mean response time are derived. These results show that we do not pay too large a penalty for introducing two or more levels of queueing, and under very extreme conditions (heavy traffic) the delay in response increases only linearly with the number of queueing stages. Broadcast service strategies provide even better performance than conventional point-to-point service, though a broadcast medium is required...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{the methodology of}} defining the measurement trigger conditions and evaluation conditions of LTE cell reselection for release 9 capable UEs. In the proposal of cell reselection parameters, the RSRQ measurement quantity is considered {{to account for the}} increase of packet traffic in LTE networks. In addition, the proposal is designed to improve the end user experiences such the LTE <b>camp-on</b> ratio, the avoidance of unnecessary cell reselection measurements causing the battery drain and the ping-pong effect between LTE and WCDMA inter-RAT cell reselection or redirection. The cell reselection parameter proposal is made based on the field test data collected in Tokyo metropolitan area...|$|E
40|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{must offer}} the standard telephony services. However, {{the transition to}} Internetbased telephony services also provides an opportunity to create new services more rapidly and with lower complexity than in the existing {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol that creates, modifies and terminates associations between Internet end systems, including conferences and point-to-point calls. SIP supports unicast, mesh and multicast conferences, as well as combinations of these modes. SIP implements services such as call forwarding and transfer, placing calls on hold, <b>camp-on</b> and call queueing by a small set of call handling primitives. SIP implementations can re-use parts of other Internet service protocols such as HTTP and the Real-Time Stream Protocol (RTSP). In this paper, we describe SIP, and show how its basic primitives can be used to construct a wide range of telephony services. ...|$|E
