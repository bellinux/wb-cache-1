40|$|Recent {{literature}} reports the growing interests in data analysis using FormalConceptAnalysis (FCA), in which data {{is represented in}} the form of object and attribute relations. FCA analyzes and then subsequently visualizes the data based on duality called Galois <b>connection.</b> <b>Attribute</b> exploration is a knowledge acquisition process in FCA, which interactively determines the implications holding between the attributes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate the attribute exploration to understand the dependencies among the attributes in the data. While performing this process, we add domain experts’ knowledge as background knowledge. We demonstrate the method through experiments on two real world healthcare datasets. The results show that the knowledge acquired through exploration process coupled with domain expert knowledge has better classification accuracy...|$|E

Boykin stated {{that despite the}} numerous media accounts linking the down-low to the occurrence of AIDS in the African-American community, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has never cited men on the down-low as a factor. and that no extensive research has ever been published about men on the down-low, {{in part because of}} the difficulty of identifying the targeted population. In his book, Beyond The Down Low: Sex, Lies and Denial in Black America, he writes that men on the 'down-low' are not the cause of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in black America. [...] Boykin argues that the down-low debate demonizes black men, stigmatizes black women, and encourages an unhealthy [...] "battle of the sexes" [...] that distracts the community's attention from the issues of HIV prevention, personal responsibility and condom use.|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of inviting managers and leaders to make formal presentations {{telling the story}} of their experience to others is widespread. In this article we explore these as a way of looking at how audiences learn and change from stories they are told. We considered a range of speakers from high profi le 'circuit speakers' to little known 'experience sharers'. We develop a conceptualization of the way members of an audience learn from the stories that are told by speakers. We started from the expectation that people would feel that they had learned most from stories that came over as 'factual description', with causal <b>connections,</b> <b>attributed</b> agency and intentional acts. Our investigation, however, found that people remembered, and said that they had changed because of, stories that were rich in 'decorative' detail but which had little practical detail on what the speaker actually did or why. What was retained by audience members were snippets of a story which could be reconstituted later by the listener for their own purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Internet users and innovative new services such as e-commerce are placing new demands on Internet servers, for example web servers. It is becoming essential for Internet servers to be highly available, have fast response times, and provide continuous service during overload at least to preferred customers. It is necessary, therefore, to protect Internet servers from overload since during server overload clients experience increased response times and service failures. In this paper we present a kernel-based architecture that protects Internet servers against overload by controlling the amount and rate of work entering the system. Our basic control algorithm limits the incoming TCP SYN requests based on <b>connection</b> <b>attributes.</b> By dropping non-compliant connection requests, the server can provide continuous service to preferred clients even under overload. We present a second mechanism that reorders the listen queue of a server socket based on the priorities of the incoming connection requests. Our experiments show that both mechanisms enable service di#erentiation during overload. We describe an adaptive architecture that uses these mechanisms to dynamically protect web servers from overload...|$|R

40|$|UnrestrictedThis study {{addresses}} how {{political connections}} influence a firm’s access to bond capital using {{a database of}} 1672 new bond issuances in China from 2001 to 2009. In this context, firm political connections are measured using a score based on the highest bureaucratic position held by a firm executive, with {{the highest level of}} political <b>connections</b> <b>attributed</b> to those who have held top positions in the central government, an intermediate level attributed to those in provincial and municipal governments, and the lowest level attributed to those who have not held any government position. Results suggest that firm political connections are positively associated with debt offering amounts and issuer credit ratings, but only in the subsample of firms that have poor information environments, such as non-publicly listed firms and non-Beijing headquartered firms, thus lending support to the argument that political connections contribute to firm reputation. The role of political connections in providing preferential access to debt is relevant to both state-owned enterprises and privately held firms. In addition, issuing firm political connections and bank underwriter political connections serve as alternative mechanisms when explaining the variation of offering amounts and issuer credit rating...|$|R

It is becoming essential for Web servers to provide performance isolation, have fast recovery times, and provide continuous service during overload at least to preferred customers. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of three kernelbased mechanisms that protect Web servers against overload by providing admission control and service differentiation based on connection and application level information. Our basic admission control mechanism, TCP SYN policing, limits the acceptance rate of new requests based on the <b>connection</b> <b>attributes.</b> The second mechanism, prioritized listen queue, supports different service classes by reordering the listen queue based on the priorities of the incoming connections. Third, we present HTTP header-based connection control that uses application-level information such as URLs and cookies to set priorities and rate control policies. We have implemented these mechanisms in AIX 5. 0. Through numerous experiments we demonstrate their effectiveness in achieving the desired degree of service di erentiation during overload. We also show that the kernel mechanisms are more ecient and scalable than application level controls implemented in the Web server...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConnectomics is a {{strategy}} for mapping complex neural networks based on high-speed automated electron optical imaging, computational assembly of neural data volumes, web-based navigational tools to explore 1012 – 1015 byte (terabyte to petabyte) image volumes, and annotation and markup tools to convert images into rich networks with cellular metadata. These collections of network data and associated metadata, analyzed using tools from graph theory and classification theory, can be merged with classical systems theory, giving a more completely parameterized view of how biologic information processing systems are implemented in retina and brain. Networks have two separable features: topology and <b>connection</b> <b>attributes.</b> The first findings from connectomics strongly validate {{the idea that the}} topologies of complete retinal networks are far more complex than the simple schematics that emerged from classical anatomy. In particular, connectomics has permitted an aggressive refactoring of the retinal inner plexiform layer, demonstrating that network function cannot be simply inferred from stratification; exposing the complex geometric rules for inserting different cells into a shared network; revealing unexpected bidirectional signaling pathways between mammalian rod and cone systems; documenting selective feedforward systems, novel candidate signaling architectures, new coupling motifs, and the highly complex architecture of the mammalian AII amacrine cell. This is but the beginning, as the underlying principles of connectomics are readily transferrable to non-neural cell complexes and provide new contexts for assessing intercellular communication...|$|R

Most of the existing hashing meth-ods focus on mapping low-level features to binary codes, but neglect attributes that are commonly as-sociated with data samples.
