The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and frankincense are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E

25|$|Although each {{nociceptor}} {{can have}} a variety of possible threshold levels, some do not respond at all to chemical, thermal or mechanical stimuli unless injury actually has occurred.

25|$|This {{approval}} <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> after {{heavy investment}} in pre-clinical development and clinical trials, {{as well as}} a commitment to ongoing safety monitoring. Drugs which fail part-way through this process often incur large costs, while generating no revenue in return. If the cost of these failed drugs is taken into account, the cost of developing a successful new drug (new chemical entity, or NCE), has been estimated at about 1.3 billion USD(not including marketing expenses). Professors Light and Lexchin reported in 2012, however, that the rate of approval for new drugs has been a relatively stable average rate of 15 to 25 for decades.|$|E

25|$|Further near-contemporary {{evidence}} <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> indirectly by inference from later kinsmen whose precise connectedness {{is impossible}} to specify. According to his first biographer, Dunstan was related to a certain Æthelflæd, a lady of royal rank who was herself a niece of King Æthelstan, to Bishop Ælfheah of Winchester, to Bishop Cynesige of Lichfield, and to various men at court (including his brother Wulfric). Dunstan's father Heorstan, who lived near the “royal island” of Glastonbury, cannot be shown {{to have been a}} prominent figure in the kingdom, although sources for Edward's reign are notoriously scanty. Since Æthelstan, Dunstan and Heorstan all share the rare onomastic element -stan, it has been tentatively suggested that they derived their kinship through Ecgwynn.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 2010, Amazon {{released}} the Kindle DX Graphite (DXG) globally. The DXG has an E Ink display with 50% better contrast ratio due to using E Ink Pearl technology and <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> in a graphite case color. It is speculated the case color change {{is to improve}} contrast ratio perception further, as some users found the prior white casing highlighted that the E Ink background is light gray and not white. Like the Kindle DX, {{it does not have}} a Wi-Fi connection. The DXG is a mix of third-generation hardware and second-generation software. The CPU has the same speed as Kindle Keyboard's CPU, but the DXG has only half the system memory, 128MB. Due to these differences, the DXG runs the same firmware as Kindle 2. Therefore, DXG cannot display international fonts, like the Cyrillic, Chinese, or any other non-Latin font and PDF support and the web browser are limited to matching the Kindle 2's features.|$|E

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E

500|$|Revolver's Jon Wiederhorn, {{pointed out}} that {{although}} the songs were arranged and recorded quickly, Inflikted sounds neither hastily executed nor incomplete. There's a connection between Max's riffing and Igor's drumming; a chemistry that <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> from musicians who learned to play together and honed their craft through years of studio sessions and live shows. Wiederhorn described Inflikted as an [...] "explosive flashback to the remorseless thrash and primal groove-metal Sepultura created between 1991's Arise and 1993's Chaos A.D. [...] The songs are raw and simple, yet graced with syncopated drum runs, experimental guitar flourishes, and sonic frills inspired by Max's love of reggae and Igor's fascination with DJ culture. The vocals are primal and savage, emboldened {{by a sense of}} urgency that's equal parts desperation, rage, and celebration." ...|$|E

[...] In his album review for Melody Maker, Williams wrote of Harrison's opening trio of songs: [...] "Unbelievably, they're {{as good as the}} originals, and in some ways even better, because they combine the power of the arrangements for horns and rhythm with a sense of joy that <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> in live performance.

500|$|It is {{possible}} that Beorhtwulf is the same person as the Beorhtwulf who witnessed a charter of Wiglaf's in 836. [...] If so, this is Beorhtwulf's first appearance in the historical record. [...] His accession to the throne of Mercia is usually thought to have occurred in about 840. [...] The date is not given directly {{in any of the}} primary sources, but it is known from regnal lists that he succeeded Wiglaf as king. [...] Historian D. P. Kirby suggests that Wiglaf's death occurred in 839, basing this date on the known chronology of the reigns of Beorhtwulf and Burgred, the next two Mercian kings. [...] It {{is possible}} that Wigmund, the son of Wiglaf, was king briefly between Wiglaf and Beorhtwulf. [...] The evidence for this possibility <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> from a later tradition concerning Wigmund's son, Wigstan, so it is uncertain whether he actually did so.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing on}} her {{personality}} in [...] "Alice on the Stage" [...] (April 1887), Carroll described her as [...] "loving and gentle", [...] "courteous to all", [...] "trustful", and [...] "wildly curious, {{and with the}} eager enjoyment of Life that <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> in the happy hours of childhood, when all is new and fair, and when Sin and Sorrow are but names — empty words signifying nothing!" [...] Commentators characterise her as [...] "innocent", [...] "imaginative", introspective, generally well-mannered, critical of authority figures, and clever. Others see less positive traits in Alice, writing that she frequently shows unkindness in her conversations with the animals in Wonderland, takes violent action against the character Bill the Lizard by kicking him into the air, and reflects her social upbringing in her lack of sensitivity and impolite replies. According to Donald Rackin, [...] "In spite of her class- and time-bound prejudices, her frightened fretting and childish, abject tears, her priggishness and self-assured ignorance, her sometimes blatant hypocrisy, her general powerlessness and confusion, and her rather cowardly readiness to abandon her struggles {{at the ends of}} the two adventures— many readers still look up to Alice as a mythic embodiment of control, perseverance, bravery, and mature good sense." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, <b>comes</b> <b>only</b> with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E
