5|$|The National Weather Service, in {{anticipation}} of a possible landfall in the Carolinas, issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Norfolk, Virginia on September 18 (tropical storm warnings were not issued at the time). A hurricane warning was issued from Cherry Point, North <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> the Virginia capes on September 19, but was discontinued early on September 20 as the hurricane passed to the east. A hurricane watch was also issued from Cape May, New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast on September 19, and like the warning, was discontinued on September 20.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Little River, South <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds {{and the lower}} Chesapeake Bay. The NHC also issued a tropical storm watch south of Little River, South <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> {{the mouth of the}} Santee River, as well as from Chincoteague, Virginia northward to Little Egg Inlet, New Jersey. Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear.

5|$|A high {{pressure}} system over New England {{resulted in the}} possibility that Edouard would track {{to the west and}} strike the United States. One computer model predicted the hurricane would strike near Atlantic City, New Jersey with winds of over 111mph (178km/h) on Labor Day. This caused Cape May County officials to contemplate ordering an evacuation for the busiest tourist weekend of the year, though an evacuation never occurred. Due to the possibility for a landfall on the East Coast of the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center issued Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches and Warnings from Cape Lookout, North <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Eastport, Maine at various times. Tropical storm warnings existed from North <b>Carolina</b> <b>to</b> Watch Hill, Rhode Island and {{from the mouth of the}} Merrimack River to the United States/Canada border, while hurricane warnings existed from Watch Hill, Rhode Island to Merrimack River, Massachusetts. Hurricane watches were also issued for the tropical storm warning area.|$|E
