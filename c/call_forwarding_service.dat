40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the influence of a}} <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>service</b> on the traffic process in modern telecommunication networks. We analyse in detail only the case when the called user is busy. It is proved that call forwarding not only increases utilization of servers and the percent of successful calls but it also increases the call loss. On the simple example, we showed that this call loss increase is greater in the case of local (internal) and incoming calls, but smaller in the case of outgoing calls. The reason for such behaviour is in the role of call forwarding function in the case of internal and incoming traffic. In that situation call forwarding function decreases the effect of limited number of users on the decrease of offered traffic, comparing to the case of internal and incoming traffic without call forwarding (Engset traffic model). This statement is illustrated by comparative graphics of traffic loss without call forwarding function, and with this function when considering, separately, internal, incoming, and outgoing traffic.

Residential service includes message rate and flat rate local calling plans with extra charges for long distance calls and supplementary services such as call waiting, 3-way <b>calling,</b> and <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> Business <b>service</b> is mostly message rate local calling plans with extra charges for long distance and supplementary services. Message Rate calling means that subscribers pay for calls based on duration of the call and distance to the called party. Government subscribers include cities, counties, state, and federal agencies and often included Centrex service. Pay phones were traditionally provided exclusively by telephone companies but during the early 1980s Customer-owned coin-operated telephone services were established.|$|R
50|$|Some {{businesses}} {{find that}} the human touch can improve contact, thus sales, but traditional wired answering services are expensive, so they have their <b>calls</b> <b>forwarded</b> to a <b>call</b> center, so the client can reach an operator instead of an answering machine or voice mail. Before the availability of <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> commercial answering <b>services</b> needed to physically connect to every line for which they provided after-hours response; this required their offices be located near the local central exchange and be fed by a huge multi-pair trunk in which a separate pair of wires existed for each client subscriber. With <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> there is no physical connection to the client's main telephone service, which is merely call-forwarded to the answering service (usually on a direct inward dial number) {{at the end of}} the business day.|$|R

50|$|<b>Call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> or <b>call</b> diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which redirects {{a telephone call}} to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> was invented by Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> that the <b>call</b> is being redirected. More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> typically can redirect incoming calls to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for <b>forwarded</b> <b>calls.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which <b>calls</b> should be <b>forwarded.</b> Once someone answers, <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect <b>call</b> <b>forwarding.</b> <b>Call</b> <b>forwarding</b> is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to <b>call</b> <b>forwarding,</b> which permit the control over <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow <b>call</b> <b>forwarding</b> to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to. People have several telephones and this makes the situation complex for the caller. Many phone calls are left unanswered. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is in this report presented {{as a solution to}} this reachability problem. The idea is to have an agent setting <b>call</b> <b>forwards</b> of all the users’ phones or numbers, towards the terminal where he is available. Later, when someone calls any of the users’ phones, the call will be terminated at the terminal where the user can receive it. The <b>Call</b> <b>Forwarding</b> Agent is compared to a number of similar services.

AIM: This study was carried out to examine, for the first time, how receptionists interact with patients on the telephone, in order to identify features of communication associated with efficacy and patient satisfaction. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a qualitative conversation analysis of incoming patient telephone calls, recorded ‘for training purposes’, in three English GP surgeries. METHODS: Data were analysed qualitatively to identify effective communication, then coded to establish the relative prevalence of communication types across each surgery. RESULTS: Analysis identified a burden on patients to drive <b>calls</b> <b>forward</b> and achieve <b>service.</b> ‘Patient burden’ occurred when receptionists failed to offer alternatives to patients whose initial requests could not be met, or to summarize relevant next actions (e. g., appointment, call-back, etc.) at the end of calls. Coding revealed that ‘patient burden’ frequency differed across the services. Increased ‘patient burden’ was associated with decreased satisfaction on published satisfaction survey scores. CONCLUSION: Patients in some practices have to push for service when calling GP surgeries. Conversation analysis specifies what constitutes (in) effective communication. Findings can then underpin receptionist training and improve patient experience and satisfaction...|$|R
