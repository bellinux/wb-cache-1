There is a tradeoff between the cost-reduction resulting from traffic concentration and the cost-increase resulting from lengthened flow paths. The objective is to find feasible and cost optimal routes for all CLS-to-CLS traffic flows under the constraint of limited link bandwidths.

40|$|The {{transport}} of connectionless data {{is necessary for}} the compatibility of emerging wide area ATM networks with existing computer networks. This paper investigates the design and performance of a virtual packet switched network overlayed on top of cell-based connection-oriented ATM networks. The virtual packet switched network is made possible by utilizing connectionless servers. Two packet forwarding techniques are examined in the context of <b>connectionless</b> <b>service.</b> Forwarding connectionless packets in a cell-by-cell manner (streaming mode) is shown to result in low end-to-end delay. Packet-by-packet forwarding of connectionless data (reassembly mode) can exhibit a comparable packet loss rate, but streaming mode is shown to produce significantly lower packet loss for very small buffers. Finally, a design for a streaming mode connectionless server is presented. 1 Introduction The emergence of a high speed, wide area ATM network presents both opportunities and challenges to network se [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The most viable {{support for}} {{connectionless}} traffic over ATM uses connectionless servers that forward packets {{based on the}} destination address in each packet. To achieve high data rates with small latency and predictable cell delay variation, this forwarding process {{must be carried out}} efficiently.

With SBR, it is possible [...] using an efficient cut-through technique [...] for a <b>connectionless</b> <b>service</b> to forward packets at near-ATM speeds with a negligible amount of added latency per packet (or burst). Router buffering, which adds complexity, can be substantially reduced through a simple traffic shaping technique.

In doing so, the issue of connection management comes into play. We propose a new connection management mechanism that provides for low bandwidth usage (as compared to a permanent connection) and low delays (as compared to a connection-per-packet approach). We model the new mechanism under two workload scenarios: an ordinary Poisson process and an interrupted Poisson process. We use Markovian techniques as well as matrix-geometric methods to evaluate the new connection management mechanism.

For that purpose ATM networks are modeled as graphs and the performance of CLS sets is evaluated by mean delay computation. In small networks the optimal CLS set is determined by enumeration of all possible sets. As this approach is not feasible for large networks, Simulated Annealing is used to approximate the optimal solution. The suitability of Simulated Annealing is examined in Monte Carlo simulations on random graphs. ...|$|R
