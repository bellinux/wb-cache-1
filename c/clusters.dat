5|$|Globular <b>clusters</b> {{are found}} in the halo of a galaxy and contain {{considerably}} more stars and are much older than the less dense open <b>clusters,</b> which {{are found in}} the disk of a galaxy. Globular <b>clusters</b> are fairly common; there are about 150 to 158 currently known globular <b>clusters</b> in the Milky Way, with perhaps 10 to 20 more still undiscovered. These globular <b>clusters</b> orbit the Galaxy at radii of 40 kiloparsecs (130,000 light-years) or more. Larger galaxies can have more: Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, may have as many as 500. Some giant elliptical galaxies (particularly those at the centers of galaxy <b>clusters)</b> such as M87, have as many as 13,000 globular <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|How these <b>clusters</b> {{are formed}} {{is not yet}} known, but their {{formation}} might well be related to that of globular <b>clusters.</b> Why M31 has such <b>clusters,</b> while the Milky Way does not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of <b>clusters,</b> {{but it would be}} very unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular <b>clusters.</b> The new-found <b>clusters</b> contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular <b>clusters.</b> The <b>clusters</b> share other characteristics with globular <b>clusters</b> such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular <b>clusters</b> is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended <b>clusters.</b> Parametrically, these <b>clusters</b> lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} <b>clusters</b> in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the <b>clusters</b> are middle-aged. Previously, these globular <b>clusters</b> had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular <b>clusters,</b> including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are actually in 'adolescence'.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>cluster</b> {{automorphism}} group of a skew-symmetric <b>cluster</b> algebra with geometric coefficients. For this, we introduce {{the notion of}} gluing free <b>cluster</b> algebra, and show that under a weak condition the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of a gluing free <b>cluster</b> algebra is a subgroup of the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of its principal part <b>cluster</b> algebra (i. e. the corresponding <b>cluster</b> algebra without coefficients). We show that several classes of <b>cluster</b> algebras with coefficients are gluing free, for example, <b>cluster</b> algebras with principal coefficients, <b>cluster</b> algebras with universal geometric coefficients, and <b>cluster</b> algebras from surfaces (except a 4 -gon) with coefficients from boundaries. Moreover, except four kinds of surfaces, the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of a <b>cluster</b> algebra from a surface with coefficients from boundaries is isomorphic to the <b>cluster</b> automorphism group of its principal part <b>cluster</b> algebra; for a <b>cluster</b> algebra with principal coefficients, its <b>cluster</b> automorphism group is isomorphic to the automorphism group of its initial quiver.

30|$|To {{fasten the}} network {{convergence}} to a stable <b>cluster</b> topology, {{a vehicle that}} is not a <b>cluster</b> head within its own range and lies within the range of a temporary <b>cluster</b> head will join this <b>cluster</b> and will not participate in electing another temporary <b>cluster</b> head. A vehicle that lies within the range of two <b>cluster</b> heads will <b>cluster</b> with the closest <b>cluster</b> head to itself given the priority to the main <b>cluster</b> over the temporary <b>cluster.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although {{globular}} <b>clusters</b> generally appear spherical in form, ellipticities {{can occur}} due to tidal interactions. <b>Clusters</b> within the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are typically oblate spheroids in shape, while {{those in the}} Large Magellanic Cloud are more elliptical.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} of studies of {{globular}} <b>clusters,</b> published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the <b>clusters</b> (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, it was found that RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Clusters</b> {{of galaxies}} consist of {{hundreds}} {{to thousands of}} galaxies bound together by gravity. <b>Clusters</b> of galaxies are often dominated by a single giant elliptical galaxy, known as the brightest cluster galaxy, which, over time, tidally destroys its satellite galaxies and adds their mass to its own.|$|E
40|$|This chapter surveys common <b>clustering</b> {{algorithms}} {{widely used}} in the data mining community in light of chemometrics.

30|$|The <b>cluster</b> head {{will remain}} as a <b>cluster</b> head if all {{its members are}} still within its range after time Tf. The <b>cluster</b> head will select a backup <b>cluster</b> head based on two criteria: first, it is the closest {{to the center of}} the <b>cluster,</b> and second, it has the highest SFw factor among all {{vehicles}} around the <b>cluster's</b> center. If some of the <b>cluster</b> members will become out of the <b>cluster</b> head's range but still within the range of the backup <b>cluster</b> head, the current <b>cluster</b> head will hand the responsibility to the backup <b>cluster</b> head by setting its field CHID = CHBK. Otherwise, if some members become out of range of both the <b>cluster</b> head and its backup, the current <b>cluster</b> head will remain the <b>cluster</b> head in the next interval. Vehicles that became out of range will form a temporary <b>cluster</b> or join an adjacent <b>cluster</b> if they fall within its <b>cluster</b> head's range.|$|R
30|$|Each <b>cluster</b> {{contains}} {{four types}} of mobile nodes which are <b>cluster</b> head, <b>cluster</b> member, backup node, and <b>cluster</b> gateway.

5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of globular <b>clusters,</b> and almost every large galaxy surveyed {{has been found to}} possess a system of globular <b>clusters.</b> The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy appear to be in the process of donating their associated globular <b>clusters</b> (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular <b>clusters</b> might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|For the {{algorithm}} to be correct, {{it must be}} the case that popping and merging the top two <b>clusters</b> from {{the algorithm}}'s stack preserves the property that the remaining <b>clusters</b> on the stack form a chain of nearest neighbors.|$|E

30|$|The K-Medoids <b>clustering</b> {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the few <b>clustering</b> algorithms that is theoretically convergent. At the beginning of this algorithm, the initial <b>cluster</b> is randomly selected, and subsequently, iterative <b>clustering</b> is done by the center of the nearest point close to the center of the <b>cluster.</b> Theoretically, iterative <b>clustering</b> is the key to convergence and not the initial <b>cluster.</b> The focus of our study is to propose a <b>clustering</b> algorithm suitable for high-dimensional data; convergence is a prerequisite to be satisfied. Therefore, the iterative <b>clustering</b> strategy of the K-Medoids <b>clustering</b> {{algorithm is}} adopted for convergence. In addition, the randomly selected initial <b>cluster</b> of the K-Medoids <b>clustering</b> is replaced by a refined non-overlapping <b>cluster.</b> Thus, our algorithm is derived from the K-Medoids <b>clustering</b> algorithm.|$|R
30|$|Once a {{temporary}} <b>cluster</b> has been formed, the temporary <b>cluster</b> head will {{wait for the}} first chance to either merge with adjacent <b>cluster</b> or become a main <b>cluster</b> itself. If this temporary <b>cluster</b> head falls within half of the communication range of its adjacent <b>cluster</b> head, it will merge with this <b>cluster</b> by sending a status message that includes the new <b>cluster</b> head's ID using the same temporary subcarriers set. When the temporary <b>cluster</b> members receive this message, they will join the new <b>cluster</b> if they fall {{within the range of}} the new <b>cluster</b> head; otherwise, they will form a new temporary <b>cluster</b> with a new <b>cluster</b> head that has the highest SFw factor among the remaining nodes that could not join the new <b>cluster.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Clustering</b> is a {{well-known}} means of organizing networks in MANETs. Many <b>clustering</b> solutions, including identifier neighbor-based <b>clustering,</b> topology-based <b>clustering,</b> mobility-based <b>clustering,</b> energy-based <b>clustering,</b> and weight-based <b>clustering,</b> have been proposed [14 - 21]. However, these <b>clustering</b> solutions significantly differ from vehicular <b>clustering.</b> MANETs are primarily limited because of their energy [22] and processing power; hence, their <b>clustering</b> is optimized for low-resource usage. However, vehicles are not only rich in resources, {{but they are also}} highly mobile. Consequently, <b>clustering</b> algorithms for MANETs are not effective in VANETs, and new solutions must be developed.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to open <b>clusters,</b> most globular <b>clusters</b> remain gravitationally bound for time periods {{comparable to the}} life spans {{of the majority of}} their stars. However, a possible exception is when strong tidal interactions with other large masses result in the dispersal of the stars.|$|E
5|$|In most Western music, tone <b>clusters</b> tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. <b>Clusters</b> may be {{performed}} with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone <b>clusters</b> because it is relatively easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular <b>clusters</b> appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular <b>clusters.</b> While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the <b>clusters</b> are measured, globular <b>clusters</b> are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E
30|$|<b>Clustering</b> {{is about}} segregating a {{collection}} of mobile nodes into different virtual logical groups in a MANET. Each <b>cluster</b> is capable to connect with other <b>cluster</b> using <b>cluster</b> gateway to provide connectivity for a network. Each <b>cluster</b> consists of various mobile nodes such as <b>cluster</b> head, <b>cluster</b> member, and <b>cluster</b> gateway, and they perform different roles in <b>cluster</b> {{at the time of}} data communication in mobile ad hoc network.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{priority}} if new <b>cluster</b> head {{priority is}} higher than old <b>cluster</b> head, then new <b>cluster</b> head will remain as <b>cluster</b> head and old <b>cluster</b> head priority will be compared with backup node priority. If old <b>cluster</b> head priority {{is higher than}} backup node, then old <b>cluster</b> head will become backup node and backup node will act as <b>cluster</b> member within the cluster; otherwise, old <b>cluster</b> head will act as <b>cluster</b> member {{and the status of}} backup node will remain the same.|$|R

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of <b>clusters</b> of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller <b>clusters</b> to form larger <b>clusters.</b> The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two <b>clusters</b> but use different definitions of the distance between <b>clusters.</b> The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of <b>clusters.</b> Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two <b>clusters</b> is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between <b>clusters,</b> a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm that initially places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of <b>clusters.</b>|$|E
5|$|No known {{globular}} <b>clusters</b> display {{active star}} formation, {{which is consistent}} with the view that globular <b>clusters</b> are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form.
