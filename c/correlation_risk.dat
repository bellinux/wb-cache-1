There is considerable ev-idence that correlations between asset returns change over time 1 and that stock return correlations increase when returns are low. 2 A marketwide increase in correlations negatively affects investor welfare by lowering diversification ben-efits and by increasing market volatility, so that states of nature with unusually high correlations may be expensive.

40|$|The {{classical}} way {{of treating}} the correlation smile phenomenon with credit index tranches {{is to choose}} a sufficiently flexible model and fit it to tranche market prices.

To this end, we use a risk neutral measure of the market factor which we derive from equity index options. The resulting model allows separating the premium for <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> from the premium for catastrophe or down-side risk. We show that ignoring the high <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> of tranches but allowing for their down-side risk explains the historical market prices fairly well.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{variance}} risk and <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> in the equity market, {{and consists of}} three essays. The first essay demonstrates that the variance risk, mea- sured as {{the difference between the}} realized return variance and its risk-neutral expectation, is an important determinant of the cross-sectional variation of hedge fund returns. Empirical evidence shows that funds with significantly higher loadings on variance risk outperform lower-loading funds on average. However, they incur severe losses during market downturns. Failure to account for variance risk results in overestimation of funds' absolute returns and underestimation of risk. The results provide important implications for hedge fund risk management and performance evaluations. The second essay examines the empirical properties of a widely-used <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> proxy, namely the dispersion trade between the index and individual stock options. I find that discrete hedging errors in such trading strategy can result in incorrect inferences on the magnitude of <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> premium and render the proxy unreliable as a measure of pure exposure to <b>correlation</b> <b>risk.</b> I implement a dynamic hedging scheme for the dispersion trade, which significantly improves the estimation accuracy of <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> and enhances the risk-return profile of the trading strategy. Finally, the third essay aims to forecast the average pair-wise correlations between stocks in the market portfolio. I investigate a comprehensive list of forecasting models and find that past average correlation and the option-implied correlation provide superior out-of-sample forecasting performance compared to other predictors. I provide empirical evidence showing that the forecasts of average correlation can improve the optimal portfolio choices and substantially enhance the performance of active correlation trading strategies.

40|$|Empirical {{testing of}} {{asymmetric}} {{information in the}} insurance market has uncovered a negative <b>correlation</b> between <b>risk</b> levels and insurance purchases, rather than the positive correlation predicted by the standard insurance theory. Hemenway (1990) proposes an explanation for this negative correlation, called "propitious selection". He argues that potential insurance buyers have different tastes for risk and that "individuals who are highly risk avoiding are more likely both to try to reduce the hazard and to purchase insurance" (p. 1064). Chiappori and Salanié (2000) also suggest that this line of argument, which they call "cherry picking", may explain the observed negative correlation. In this paper, we show that the propitious selection argument does not imply negative <b>correlation</b> between <b>risk</b> levels and insurance purchases, because it fails {{to take into account}} the supply side of the insurance market. To illustrate this claim, we provide a model where, although we assume that individuals differ in risk aversion and that the more risk averse individuals exert more precaution and buy more insurance, we end up with a positive <b>correlation</b> between <b>risk</b> and insurance purchases at equilibrium. The reason is that, in any separating equilibrium, the more risk averse individuals face insurance overprovision which, combined with moral hazard, increases their risk relative to the less risk averse individuals. To obtain the negative <b>correlation</b> between <b>risk</b> and insurance purchases, one further needs the extra condition of decreasing marginal willingness to pay for the less risk averse individuals. Finally, we find that propitious selection has profound policy implications for social insurance...|$|R

40|$|CDS index tranches and {{the pricing}} of credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations</b> 1 Standardised loss tranches based on {{credit default swap}} (CDS) indices have {{increased}} liquidity {{in the market for}} credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations.</b> Although progress is being made, quantitative modelling of these correlations is complex and not yet fully developed. JEL classification: G 12, G 13, G 14. One of the most significant developments in financial markets {{in recent years has been}} the creation of liquid instruments that allow for the trading of credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations.</b> Prime among these instruments are CDS index tranches. Broadly put, index tranches give investors, ie sellers of credit protection, the opportunity to take on exposures to specific segments of the CDS index default loss distribution. Each tranche has a different sensitivity to credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations</b> among entities in the index. One of the main benefits of index tranches is higher liquidity. This has been achieved mainly through standardisation, yet it is also due to the liquidity in the single-name CDS and CDS index markets. In contrast, possibly owing to the limited liquidity in the corporate bond market, securities referencing corporate bond indices have not been actively traded. The standardisation of index tranches may prove to be a significant further step towards more complete markets. Credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations</b> have always been key risk components in portfolios of credit-risky securities. However, up until now, standardised products for the trading of credit <b>risk</b> <b>correlations</b> have not been available. The emergence of index tranches therefore fills a gap in the ability of the markets to transfer certain types of credit risks across individuals and institutions. We examine CDS index tranches in this article. In the first section we introduce these securities, focusing on the mechanics of CDS-based contracts and market liquidity. In the second section we discuss the pricing of CDS inde...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by ample {{evidence}} that stock-return correlations are stochastic, we study the economic idea {{that the risk of}} correlation changes (affecting diversification benefits and invest-ment opportunities) may be priced. We propose a powerful test by comparing option-implied correlations between stock returns (obtained by combining S&P 100 option prices with prices of individual options on all index components) with realized correlations. Our parsimonious model shows that the substantial gap between average implied (46. 7 %) and realized (28. 7 %) correlations is direct evidence of a large negative <b>correlation</b> <b>risk</b> premium, since individual variance risk is not priced in our 1996 - 2003 sample. Empirical implementation of our model also indicates that the entire index variance risk premium {{can be attributed to the}} high price of <b>correlation</b> <b>risk.</b> Finally, the model offers a quantitatively accurate risk-based explanation for the empirically observed discrepancy between expected returns on index and on individual options.
