The software Windows 5. 1 was employed to calculate the energetic and luminous parameters of the samples: visible (Tvis) and solar (Tsol) transmittance, visible (Rvis) and solar (Rsol) reflectance, thermal transmittance (U); the thermal transmittance was evaluated in 48 different conditions, depending on the season and exposure (North, East, South, West). Results show that U values of innovative glazings lay in the 1. 299 - 1. 385 W/m 2 K range for the aerogel windows and in the 1. 384 e 1. 529 W/m 2 K range for TIM windows, while the conventional double windows have values of about 2. 5 W/m 2 K.

The most prevailing format is the packed particulate bed, which generally consists of functionalized porous spherical particles that are randomly packed in a <b>capillary.</b> Monolithic <b>media</b> (polymeric or silica) have recently become popular because of the high permeability combined with reasonable mass transfer characteristics. In this frame it is important to stress that it is theoretically expected that disorder restrains the performance of a column. When conceiving the ideal chromatographic format, the achievement of more order is therefore an interesting route to pursue. A practical realization of this approach was first put forward in 1998 by prof. Fred Regnier, making use of a microfabricated array of pillars in glass in capillary electro-chromatography mode, replacing the random particles by very accurately positioned pillars. Recognizing the potential of the technique, Desmet and coworkers performed a number of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the fluidic behaviour of such a pillar array in pressure-driven mode. As the flow-through pores can be chosen independently of the pillar diameter, optimal designs can be tailored to provide the optimal combination of flow resistance and plate height.

Heat pipes, vapor chambers, thermosyphons and cold plates {{are some of the}} phase change devices which employ microscopic porous media and are used in the thermal management of high-power electronics. These devices realize high {{heat transfer}} rates by exploiting latent heat exchange. The increasing power density of electronic chips requires that the performance of these devices be optimized so that heat can be efficiently removed from the electronic chip while limiting the temperature differential between the chip and ambient. The efficiency of heat spreading in heat pipes and vapor chambers relies on the capillary porous medium (wick structure) used in the device. The wick structure also determines the maximum heat transport capability. The study of phase change heat and mass transfer in wick structures can lead to the optimization of wick design and improved performance of the phase-change cooling devices. ^ In {{the first part of this}} thesis, numerical models are developed to study the heat and mass transport in wick structures at the pore scale. The microstructures are characterized on the basis of their wicking and thin-film evaporation performance by modeling the rates of evaporation from the liquid menisci formed in common wick microstructures. Evaporation at the interface is modeled by using appropriate heat and mass transfer rates obtained from kinetic theory. At higher heat inputs, nucleate boiling occurs in the wick structure causing a decrease in the wick thermal resistance and improvement in the device performance. A volume-of-fluid-based model is developed to study the growth of vapor bubbles in wick microstructures. ^ In the second part of this thesis, a transient three-dimensional heat pipe model is developed which is suitable for predicting the hydrodynamic and thermal performance of vapor chambers at high heat flux inputs and small length scales. The influence of the wick microstructure on evaporation and condensation mass fluxes at the liquid-vapor interface is accounted for by integrating a microstructure-level evaporation model (micromodel) with the device-level model (macromodel). The effect of boiling in the wick structure at higher heat inputs on the vapor chamber performance is modeled and the model predictions are validated with experiments performed on custom-fabricated vapor chambers. The model is further utilized to optimize the performance of an ultra-thin vapor chamber. ^ The last part of this work focuses on the design of novel wick micro- and nano-structures for performance improvement of vapor chambers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Two-phase flow in porous media is an important subsurface process that has significant impacts on the global economy and environments. To study two-phase system in porous <b>media,</b> <b>capillary</b> pressure (Pc), relative permeability (Kr), bulk electrical conductivity (σb) and bulk relative permittivity (εb) are often employed as characterization parameters. Interestingly, all of these parameters are functions of water saturation (S). However, the non-uniqueness in the Pc -S, Kr-S,σb-S and εb-S relationships pose considerable challenges in employing them for effective monitoring {{and control of the}} two-phase flow processes. In this work, laboratory scale experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the factors and conditions contributing to the non-uniqueness in the above relationships for silicone oil-water and supercritical CO 2 -water flow in porous media, with a special emphasis on geological carbon sequestration. Specifically, the dynamic capillary pressure effect, which indicates the dependence of the Pc - S relationship on the rate of change of saturation (∂S/∂t) during two-phase flow in porous media was investigated. Using a silicone oil-water system, the dynamic capillary pressure effect was quantified in term of the parameter named the dynamic coefficient, , and it was found to be dependent on the domain scale and the viscosity ratio of the two fluids. It was found that  increases with the domain scale and the viscosity ratio. It is inversely affected by S t, which is related to the degree of resistance to the fluid motion, namely, viscosity. In almost all cases,  was found to decrease monotonically with an increase in water saturation, S. An order increase in magnitude of  was observed as the domain scale increases from 4 cm scale to 8 cm in height. A similar order of increase in  was observed in the 12 cm high domain scale. There is an order increase in the value of  for the silicone oilwater system as the viscosity ratio increases from 200 to 500. For the supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) and water system in porous media, the experiments and numerical simulations showed that  increases with rising system temperature and decreasing porous media permeability. Dimensionless analysis of the silicone oil-water experimental results showed that by constructing non-dimensional groups of quantities expressing a relationship among different variables on which  depends, it is possible to summarise the experimental results and determine their functional relationship. A generalised scaling relationship for  was derived from the dimensionless analysis which was then validated against independent literature data. The exercise showed that the -S relationship obtained from the literature and the ii scaling relationship match reasonably well. This work also demonstrated the applicability of an artificial neural network (ANN) as an alternative computational platform for the prediction of the domain scale dependence of τ. The dependence of the Kr-S relationship on ∂S/∂t was also investigated. The results showed that the Kr-S curve under dynamic flow condition is different from that under the quasi-static condition. Kr for water (Krw) increases with increasing water saturation and decreases with the increase in viscosity ratio while Kr for silicone oil (Krnw) increases with decreasing water saturation {{as well as with the}} increase in viscosity ratio. Also, Krw decreases while Krnw increases with the increasing boundary pressure. However, the εb-S and σb-S relationships were found to be independent of ∂S/∂t for the scCO 2 -water system in carbonate and silicate porous media. Nevertheless, the εb and σb values decrease as the water saturation decreases in the two porous media samples. While εb decreases with increase in temperature in silica sand, the trend in the limestone showed a slight increase with temperature, especially at high water saturation. Also, the εb-S relationship is shown to be affected by pressure in silica sand increasing with the pressure of the domain. On the contrary, the σb-S relationship increases as the temperature increases with more significance at higher water saturation in the silica sand sample. This work further demonstrated the application of a membrane in the monitoring of the CO 2 in geological sites used for carbon sequestration. Commercial silicone rubber coupled with a pressure transducer showed potential in the detection of CO 2 leakage from geological sites. The response of the device in terms of the mass of permeated gas, permeability and gas flux were investigated for both CO 2 and N 2. In addition, the monitoring of potable water contamination in a shallow aquifer by the migrating or leaking of CO 2 is demonstrated with the combination of the pH analysis, geoelectrical measurement techniques and the membrane-sensor system. Overall, the work in this PhD research demonstrated robust applications of two-phase systems’ characterization parameters under different scenarios in the porous media. Implications of the findings in this work to the monitoring and control of two-phase systems in porous media are expatiated...|$|R
