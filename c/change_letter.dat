40|$|This study {{reports the}} reading of 11 Arabic-speaking {{individuals}} with letter position dyslexia (LPD), {{and the effect of}} letter form on their reading errors. LPD is a peripheral dyslexia caused by a selective deficit to letter position encoding in the orthographic-visual analyzer, which results in migration of letters within words, primarily of middle letters. The Arabic orthography is especially interesting for the study of LPD because Arabic letters have different forms in different positions in the word. As a result, some letter position errors require letter form change. We compared the rate of letter migrations that <b>change</b> <b>letter</b> form with migrations that do not <b>change</b> <b>letter</b> form in 10 Arabic-speaking individuals with developmental LPD, and one bilingual Arabic and Hebrew-speaking individual with acquired LPD. The results indicated that the participants made 40 % letter position errors in migratable words when the resulting word included the letters in the same form, whereas migrations that changed letter form almost never occurred. The error rate of the Arabic-Hebrew bilingual reader was smaller in Arabic than in Hebrew. However, when only words in which migrations do not <b>change</b> <b>letter</b> form were counted, the rate was similar in Arabic and Hebrew. Hence, whereas orthographies with multiple letter forms for each letter might seem more difficult in some respects, these orthographies are in fact easier to read in some forms of dyslexia. Thus, the diagnosis of LPD in Arabic should consider the effect of letter forms on migration errors, and use only migratable words that do not require letter-form change. The theoretical implications for the reading model are that letter form (of the position-dependent type found in Arabic) is part of the information encoded in the abstract letter identity, and thus affects further word recognition processes, and {{that there might be a}} pre-lexical graphemic buffer in which the checking of orthographic well-formedness takes place...|$|E
40|$|Culture <b>Change</b> <b>Letter</b> # 241 - A widely {{reported}} story on ocean trash cites the huge Ocean Conservancy group. The group's new report misleads, {{in that it}} avoids concluding that the trash problem facing the ocean is overwhelmingly one of plastic. Trash that biodegrades is hardly a problem compared to the non-biodegradable plastic from petroleum. Almost all plastic is petroleum based, sometimes with added poisons such as heavy metals or even radioactive materials. Non-petroleum plastic from plants is on {{a very small scale}} and is not the biodegradable-friendly substance advertised, in almost every case. Petroleum needs to be boycotted. This starts to get at the lifestyle issue that leads to the destruction of the oceans (and our air and soil and bodies). Addressing plastic [...] a new substance in human history, that we can live without [...] {{is a great way to}} start dealing with petroleum on which modern society is entirely, perilously dependent. In the news article, titled "Tidal wave of trash threatens world oceans " by Reuters, the statements made by Ocean Conservancy (with lack of follow up by Reuters) allow us to think that all we have to do is put our trash in the bins and do our recycling in order to save the oceans. When it comes to fundamental disorders, we don’t expect corporate media or mainstream-funded environmental organizations to mention the fact that there are too many people. But until societies deal with population growth and overpopulation, the oceans and ourselves are cooked. Meanwhile, since petroleum has been feeding the growing populations, and plastic is a petroleum product, let's get real...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the changing work experience and relations of two groups of Canadian postal employees in St. John's, Newfoundland. Two related factors are identified as underwriting these changes: technological based reorganization of work and the demand of a conservative state for a move to a private sector model of operations. The latter factor includes the requirement for a deficit free, and even profit-generating, operation at Canada Post Corporation and the divestment of public ownership. Underlying this empirical analysis is a theoretical interest in the labour process, technology and the managerial problem of control. [...] I argue in this thesis that among inside postal workers, members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers, technological change and the bureaucratic reorganization of work which has surrounded it has undermined their ability to resist management incursions on the shop floor. The subsequent shift in the frontier of control has enabled management to implement a number of productivity and efficiency measures, which from the workers' point of view, has had a major negative effect on their work experience and relations. Moreover, the recent move toward privatization and the generation of more flexible, casual labour further undermines the ability of workers to defend themselves. [...] While inside workers have had a continuous history of conflict over the degradation of work through technological <b>change,</b> <b>letter</b> carriers have experienced a relatively stable, institutionalized relationship with management during the past 15 years. This relationship, {{in contrast to the}} inside workers', may be characterized as "consent" based. However, with growing pressure on management to solve the economic "crisis" at Canada Post, the status quo between letter carriers and management is eroding and an ultimately antagonistic set of interests is being revealed. [...] The data from this comparative study lead to the conclusion that recent interest in the notion of consent within the labour process literature has definite theoretical and empirical limits which become apparent in examining production relations in periods of economic instability. On the other hand, the question of control of labour and technologicl change cannot be addressed in formulistic, determinist fashion. Rather, the unique organizational and historical characteristics of "each" labour process must be understood in its own context...|$|E
