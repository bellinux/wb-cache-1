40|$|Oriental, {{especially}} Chinese, {{observations of}} transient celestial events are often compared with mundane objects: fruits, birds and containers are typical. The comparison is sometimes thought to indicate {{brightness of the}} heavenly object in question (for night-time apparitions). Here, the matter is examined in some detail.

Containers probably trace back to beidou, the northern (big) dipper, which was a potent symbol in Chinese astrological correspondences. It is noted that many of the comparison objects were round, and that Chinese thinking considered the Sun, Moon, planets and stars as round also. It is shown that the comparison objects used were not constant in time, but changed, with certain ones preferred for centuries. A notable period coincides with much of the Song and Yuan Dynasties (1075 - 1360), when sunspots were almost exclusively compared with the dark plum and <b>jujube</b> (<b>Chinese</b> date) fruits, while night-time comparisons were often with stars and planets. After 1375, night-time comparisons with bullets abruptly appear, and little else was used for two hundred years. I suggest that this was inspired by contemporary military events. Although the main purpose of the observations recorded in ancient annals was astrological, there is no concrete link between the comparison objects and prognostications. A passage dating back to the Latter Han Dynasty notes that stars have their "distant connections", and goes on to say, "In the wilderness stars denote articles and objects", while elsewhere they may relate to government or society. By coupling the transient (and hence shockingly inauspicious) events to mundane objects, the imperial astronomers may have sought to distance the state from their appearance.

In this study, chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) markers were developed and used to investigate the genetic relationships between and domestication of jujube cultivars and wild jujube populations. Primer sets flanking each of the 46 cpSSR loci in non-coding regions of the chloroplast genome sequence of Z. jujuba Mill. cv. 'Junzao' were designed. In total, 10 markers showed polymorphisms from 15 samples (9 jujube cultivars and 6 wild jujube individuals), of which 8 loci were due to variations {{in the number of}} mononucleotide (A/T) repeats and 2 were due to indels. Six cpSSR markers were used in further analyses of 81 additional samples (63 jujube cultivars, 17 wild jujube samples, and 1 Indian jujube). Using these cpSSR markers, the number of alleles per locus ranged from two to four. In general, the Shannon Index (I) for each cpSSR ranged from 0. 159 to 0. 1747, and the diversity indices (h) and uh were 0. 061 to 0. 435 and 0. 062 to 0. 439, respectively.

We identified 280, 596 SSRs in the assembled genome of jujube. The density of SSRs in jujube was 872. 60 loci/Mb, which was much higher than in A. thaliana (221. 78 loci/Mb). (A+ T) -rich repeats were dominant in the jujube genome. We then randomly selected 100 SSRs in the jujube genome with long repeats and used them to successfully design 70 primer pairs. After screening using a series of criteria, a set of 20 fluorescently labeled primer pairs was further selected and screened for polymorphisms among three jujube populations. The average number of alleles per locus was 12. 8. Among the three populations, mean observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0. 858 to 0. 967 and 0. 578 to 0. 844, respectively. After testing in three populations, all SSRs loci were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in at least one population. Finally, removing high null allele frequency loci and linked loci, a set of 17 unlinked loci was in HWE. These markers will facilitate the study of jujube genetic structure and help elucidate the evolutionary history of this important fruit crop...|$|E
40|$|Reverse transcription-quantitative {{real-time}} polymerase {{chain reaction}} (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for evaluating patterns of gene expression. Jujube whole-genome sequencing has been completed, and analysis of gene function, {{an important part of}} any follow-up study, requires the appropriate selection of reference genes. Indeed, suitable reference gene selection for RT-qPCR is critical for accurate normalization of target gene expression. In this study, the software packages geNorm and NormFinder were employed to examine the expression stabilities of nine candidate reference genes under a variety of conditions. Actin-depolymerizing factor 1 (ACT 1), Histone-H 3 (His 3), and Polyadenylate-binding protein-interacting protein (PAIP) were determined to be the most stably expressed genes during five stages of fruit development and ACT 1, SiR-Fd, BTF 3, and Tubulin alpha chain (TUA) across different tissues/organs. Whereas ACT 1, Basic Transcription factor 3 (BTF 3), Glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), and PAIP were the most stable under dark conditions. ACT 1, PAIP, BTF 3, and Elongation factor 1 - gamma (EF 1 γ) were the most stably expressed genes under phytoplasma infection. Among these genes, SiR-Fd and PAIP are here first reported as stable reference genes. When normalized using these most stable reference genes, the expression patterns of four target genes were found to be in accordance with physiological data, indicating that the reference genes selected in our study are suitable for use in such analyses. This study provides appropriate reference genes and corresponding primers for further RT-qPCR studies in <b>Chinese</b> <b>jujube</b> and emphasizes the importance of validating reference genes for gene expression analysis under variable experimental conditions...|$|E
40|$|Rainfall and {{temperature}} {{are the primary}} limiting factors for optimum quality and yield of cultivated jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Adaptation to arid and cool environments has been and remains an important goal of many jujube improvement programs. This study summarized the survey results of 116 <b>Chinese</b> <b>jujube</b> varieties grown at 33 sites in China. The objective was to identify the environmental factors that influence leaf morphology, and the implications for breeding and introduction of new jujube varieties. Jujube leaf morphological traits were evaluated for their potential relationships with mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP). The results showed that many leaf morphological traits had a strong linear relationship with local precipitation {{and temperature}}. Longer veins per unit area (VLA) and reduced leaf area and leaf perimeter were typical of arid areas. VLA was inversely related to MAT and MAP at the centers of origin of jujube. There was {{a positive relationship between}} leaf shape (perimeter 2 /area) and both MAT and MAP. These results indicated that leaf vein traits of Chinese jujubes might have resulted from their adaptation to environmental factors in the course of long-term evolution. Principal component analysis allocated the 116 jujube varieties to three different groups, differentiated on the basis of morphological and physiological leaf characteristics. Jujube varieties from the Hebei, Shandong, Henan, southern Shanxi and central Shaanxi provinces were closely related, as were varieties from northwest Shanxi and northeast Shaanxi provinces, and varieties from the Gansu and Ningxia provinces. These close relationships were partially attributed to the frequent exchanges of varieties within each group. Leaf venation characteristics might be used as reference indices for jujube variety introduction between different locations...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{discriminate}} 28 Ziziphus jujuba Mill. genotypes (ZJ- 01 - ZJ- 28) based on weight and morphological characteristics of fruit, stones and seeds. These genotypes maintained in a clone repository (Nova Kachovka, Ukraine) were chosen for investigation as potential species for cultivation and use in Slovakia. The fruits were collected at the period of their full maturity (October); their morphometric parameters were following: weight from 2. 90 g (ZJ- 13) to 28. 99 g (ZJ- 22), length from 20. 73 mm (ZJ- 08) to 44. 84 mm (ZJ- 04), and width from 16. 64 mm (ZJ- 13) to 38. 87 mm (ZJ- 22). Isolated stones were also analysed, and their weight was from 0. 173 g (ZJ- 07) to 0. 731 g (ZJ- 20), length from 12. 84 mm (ZJ- 08) to 28. 67 mm (ZJ- 04), and width from 5. 06 mm (ZJ- 07) to 9. 74 mm (ZJ- 01). The weight of the seeds was ranging from 20. 00 mg (ZJ- 25) to 69. 11 mg (ZJ- 12), length from 7. 24 mm (ZJ- 15) to 11. 85 mm (ZJ- 04), and width was from 3. 86 mm (ZJ- 05) to 6. 84 mm (ZJ- 12). Significant differences in the size, shape and color of fruits, stones and seeds were also identified. The pulp, seedless stones and seeds constitute 92. 81 % (ZJ- 26) - 98. 32 % (ZJ- 04), 1. 36 % (ZJ- 04) - 6. 27 % (ZJ- 20), and 0. 25 % (QA- 24, QA- 25) - 1. 21 % (ZJ- 16) of the total fruits weight, respectively The shape index of the fruits {{was found in the}} range of 1. 04 (ZJ- 08) to 2. 00 (ZJ- 12 and ZJ- 25). The shape indexes of stones and seeds were found ranging from 1. 74 (ZJ- 08) to 4. 53 (ZJ- 05) and from 1. 32 (ZJ- 23) to 2. 74 (ZJ- 04), respectively. The relative weight of pulp was determined in the range from 92. 76 % (ZJ- 13) to 98. 32 % (ZJ- 04) and the relative weight of seed was determined in the range of 0. 25 % (ZJ- 24 and ZJ- 25) to 1. 16 % (ZJ- 26). The <b>Chinese</b> <b>jujube</b> genotypes of this study were grouped based on hierarchical clustering of the fruit, stone and seed characteristics...|$|E
