50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} camber angle, and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. Bias-ply tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. <b>Camber</b> <b>stiffness</b> is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E

Characteristics considered are those that the Formula SAE judges have deemed important for discussion on tires at competition and include coefficient of friction, slip angle, slip ratio, camber angle, cornering stiffness, <b>camber</b> <b>stiffness,</b> self-aligning torque, normal load sensitivity, load transfer sensitivity and pneumatic trail. Every effort {{has been made to}} list sample values to give the reader a general idea for common values of the considered characteristics.

40|$|The static {{aeroelastic}} divergence {{characteristics of a}} delta-planform model of the canard control surface of a proposed air-to-ground missile have been studied both analytically and experimentally in the Mach number range from 0. 6 to 3. 0. The experiments indicated that divergence occurred at a nearly constant value of dynamic pressure at Mach numbers up to 1. 2. At higher Mach numbers somewhat higher values of dynamic pressure were required to produce divergence. The analysis and the experiment indicate that the <b>camber</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the control surface and the stiffness of the control actuator are both important in divergence of surfaces of this type...|$|E
5|$|Cornering weave tendencies are {{amplified by}} {{degraded}} damping {{of the rear}} suspension. Cornering, <b>camber</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> and relaxation length of the rear tire make the largest contribution to weave damping. The same parameters of the front tire have a lesser effect. Rear loading also amplifies cornering weave tendencies. Rear load assemblies with appropriate stiffness and damping, however, were successful in damping out weave and wobble oscillations.|$|R
50|$|Many {{properties}} of the vehicle affect the understeer gradient, including tire cornering <b>stiffness,</b> <b>camber</b> thrust, lateral force compliance steer, self aligning torque, lateral load transfer, and compliance in the steering system. These individual contributions can be identified analytically or by measurement in a Bundorf analysis.|$|R
40|$|Results of an {{experimental}} research program dealing with motorcycle and scooter tires are presented. Experimental tests {{were carried out}} {{by means of a}} rotating disk test machine, which is particularly suited to test tires in the presence of large camber angles. First, the capabilities of the rotating disk machine are discussed and results are compared with the ones obtained by means of other test machines. Then the properties of several motorcycle and scooter tires are presented and compared. The advantage of presenting results in terms of <b>camber</b> and sideslip <b>stiffness</b> is highlighted. The effect of tire working conditions (inflation pressure, load and temperature) is analyzed. Finally the measurement of tire torques is discussed and some results dealing with self-aligning, twisting and rolling resistance torques are presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Vehicle System Dynamics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] data show that 35 % of fatal crashes in sport utility vehicles included vehicle rollover. At the same time, experimental testing to improve safety is expensive and dangerous. Therefore, multi-body simulation is used in this research to improve the understanding of rollover dynamics. The majority of previous work uses low-fidelity models. Here, a complex and highly nonlinear multi-body model with 165 degrees of freedom is correlated to vehicle kinematic and compliance (K&C) measurements. The Magic Formula tyre model is employed. Design of experiment methodology is used to identify tyre properties affecting vehicle rollover. A novel, statistical approach is used to link suspension K&C characteristics with rollover propensity. Research so far reveals that the tyre properties that have the greatest influence on vehicle rollover are friction coefficient, friction variation with load, <b>camber</b> <b>stiffness</b> and tyre vertical stiffness. Key K&C characteristics affecting rollover propensity are front and rear suspension rate, front roll stiffness, front camber gain, front and rear camber compliance and rear jacking force. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|E

The design factors contributing to the understeer gradient are reviewed and representative values for a modern car are presented. The effects of three types of differential are considered, as are tractive forces on free diflerentials, aerodynamic forces, the effect of load increments {{and the effects of}} turning radius. Secondary handling is investigated and the main contributing factors to the non-linearity of steer angle and attitude angle are quantfied.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from 2017 - 06 - 12 to 2019 - 06 - 12 This work develops the loads, boundary conditions, and model construction techniques {{used to create a}} high-level vehicle analysis model. The loads are derived from the overall performance parameters of the vehicle, which include 3 axis accelerations and aerodynamic forces from Computational Fluid Dynamics outputs. The boundary condition of the analysis is the mass of the vehicle directly. The analysis focuses on the vehicle on track, during quasi steady state events such as cornering, acceleration, and braking. The quasi steady state nature of these events is replicated in a linear elastic analysis by using the method of inertia relief. Additionally, a variety of vehicle stiffness parameters including torsional frame, <b>camber,</b> and toe <b>stiffness</b> are measured with the same analysis methodology. Finally, the analysis results are compared to physical testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of metal into the aeronautical industry made {{the wings and}} aerostructures stiff and rigid. High-lift devices and movable surfaces allow for discrete deflections to increase lift coefficient {{and control of the}} aircraft. Several researchers have proposed concepts for variable camber, allowing continuous deflections. This is achieved by shape memory alloys, piezoelectric actuators, fishbone structures and pressure adaptive actuation. The concept of variable stiffness is not applied in aviation nowadays. This thesis is focused on applying variable <b>camber</b> and variable <b>stiffness</b> to a Cessna Citation X inboard flap, for which a full scale actuator is produced and tested. The loads are estimated on the inboard flap with the morphing part in neutral, 15 degrees downwards and 15 degrees upwards position. The maximum loads and moments are found in the descent flight condition, which equal 209. 7 N and 15. 24 N¢m in neutral position. Deflection downwards increases the force and moment to 631. 6 Nand 37. 19 N¢m, whereas in upwards position the force and moment equal - 253. 4 Nand - 12. 68 N¢m. With the expected loads on the trailing edge of the flap, the actuator can be designed. The top bellows are designed 2. 62 times larger than the bottom bellows, because of the expected loading ratio. The wedge angles are approximately 30 degrees, which are the maximum angles for deflection in positive and negative direction. The bellows and trailing edge are made from polycarbonate, where the bellows and the inner sheet of the trailing edge have a thickness of 4 mil (0. 10 mm) and 6. 7 mil (0. 17 mm). The trailing edge is made from 30 mil (0. 762 mm) polycarbonate sheet. The stringers are replaced by aluminumspars for the test setup. The main issue found in the testing phase, was the air tightness. Even though the bellows were not completely airtight, the bellows could be inflated by applying 10 psi (0. 69 bar) air pressure. In the testing phase, the maximum deflections and deflection speeds have been measured. On average 13 degrees upwards deflection and 7 degrees downward deflection is reached. The actuation speed equals 150 deg/s and deflection rates range from 0. 88 Hz to 3. 33 Hz. The stiffness and damping have been determined as well. The stiffness increases with air pressure, for a 4 mil inner sheet thickness the stiffness increases from 3. 46 N¢m/rad to 5. 38 N¢m/rad, the 6. 7 mil inner sheet increases more, from 3. 96 N¢ m/rad to 9. 03 N¢ m/rad. It is expected that the stiffness can be varied linearly between the neutral and inflated (10 psi) state. A thicker inner sheet gives a higher stiffness. The damping coefficients are only determined for the 4 mil inner sheet. The damping coefficients equal 0. 119 in deflated, 0. 143 in neutral and 0. 226 in inflated condition. The natural frequency could be determined from the damping test as well. The natural frequency was approximately 2. 99 Hz for the deflated and the neutral tests and 3. 71 Hz for the inflated tests. The equivalent torsional stiffness corresponding to this natural frequency equals 1. 21 N¢ m/rad, 1. 24 N¢ m/rad and 1. 88 N¢ m/rad for the deflated, neutral and inflated tests respectively. The stiffness and damping coefficients are used in a torsional spring damper differential equation, together with the mass moment of inertia for the trailing edge, which is calculated in CATIA™. The mass moment of inertia equals 0. 422 g ¢m 2 for the 4 mil and 0. 434 g ¢m 2 for the 6. 7 mil inner sheet. Another analytic model is created as well, determining the deflection from the final shape of the inflated bellows. Since the actuator is still in an early development phase, it is expected that the actuator and analytic models can be improved withmore research and better production techniques.
