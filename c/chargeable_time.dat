40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the existence and}} effects of auditors' time budget pressure, premature sign-offs (PSO) and under-reporting of <b>chargeable</b> <b>time</b> (URT) {{in the context of}} a developing country, namely Mauritius. Several antecedent variables of budget pressure were also considered. Based on a mailed questionnaire survey, the perceived extent of time budget pressure (as measured by budget tightness) was found to be significantly lower than in other developed countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand and United States). Significant cross-national differences were also observed for the levels of PSO and URT. Although budget tightness was significantly related to PSO, this was not the case for URT. This has led to the suggestion that URT may be less dependent on levels of budget tightness and may have become an 'institutionalised' practice within audit firms. Finally, none of the hypothesised antecedent variables were significantly related to budget tightness. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge work {{is often}} portrayed as hidden or {{ambiguous}}: an ambiguous product is sold, ambiguous results are delivered, and work processes are ambiguous. This in turn affects {{the type of}} management expected in knowledge-intensive organisations, where emphasis is on managing people rather than work. In this study, the organisation of knowledge work is discussed and problematized through analysis of the knowledge work itself, an approach rarely pursued in studies of knowledge-intensive firms. The empirical basis of the dissertation is a study of tax consultancy at a major auditing firm. Differing images of tax consultancy work emerge depending on which {{point of view is}} emphasised, i. e. whether the work is seen through the eyes of junior or senior consultants. From the perspective of junior consultants, problem solving is emphasised while the senior's view is one of problem construction. This distinction is, among other things, based on the exclusion of juniors from client relations and the problem construction taking place within these relations, while problem solving work is often delegated to juniors. While this leads to differing views on work, there is another aspect connecting the views: <b>chargeable</b> <b>time.</b> Accounting for time spent on specific problems is a way of evaluating the work done, thereby producing an image of what is to be considered as relevant work. From the empirical observations of problem solving, problem construction, and accounting for time, the organization of knowledge work is discussed in more general terms. Knowledge work is here described as characterized by a "radial" division of labour between junior and senior workers, which simultaneously produces profitability and an image of individual progression. Through studying the organizing of knowledge work the very idea of knowledge work being ambiguous can be discussed. Instead of understanding ambiguity as something inherent in knowledge-intensive work, this study shows how ambiguity and clarity can be understood as something which actors can allocate and manage, for example within relations to clients and within relations to other personnel...|$|E

The endurance of mules is wonderful; treated to cheap fare, and constant labor, yet rarely disabled or <b>chargeable</b> with lost <b>time.</b> It would be of mutual advantage to Amherst and Aurora, {{to put up a}} cheese factory at the 'corner.' Both towns have entered the cycle of years when farming is to be a paying pursuit. The hides used in the sole-leather tannery of Buzzell & Sons, are principally from South America and Mexico.|$|R
60|$|To remove this difficulty, {{and to help}} us to {{conceive}} aright {{what it is that}} makes the confusion ideas are at any <b>time</b> <b>chargeable</b> with, we must consider, that things ranked under distinct names are supposed different enough to be distinguished, that so each sort by its peculiar name may be marked, and discoursed of apart upon any occasion: and there is nothing more evident, than that the greatest part of different names are supposed to stand for different things. Now every idea a man has, being visibly what it is, and distinct from all other ideas but itself; that which makes it confused, is, when it is such that it may as well be called by another name as that which it is expressed by; the difference which keeps the things (to be ranked under those two different names) distinct, and makes some of them belong rather to the one and some of them to the other of those names, being left out; and so the distinction, which was intended to be kept up by those different names, is quite lost.|$|R
60|$|There is {{no reason}} to suppose that Sir Alexander Ball was at any <b>time</b> <b>chargeable</b> with that {{weakness}} so frequent in Englishmen, and so injurious to our interests abroad, of despising the inhabitants of other countries, of losing all their good qualities in their vices, of making no allowance for those vices, from their religious or political impediments, and still more of mistaking for vices a mere difference of manners and customs. But if ever he had any of this erroneous feeling, he completely freed himself from it by living among the Maltese during their arduous trials, as long as the French continued masters of their capital. He witnessed their virtues, and learnt to understand in what various shapes and even disguises the valuable parts of human nature may exist. In many individuals, whose littleness and meanness in the common intercourse of life would have stamped them at once as contemptible and worthless, with ordinary Englishmen, he had found such virtues of disinterested patriotism, fortitude, and self-denial, as would have done honour to an ancient Roman.|$|R
