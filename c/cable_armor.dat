40|$|Single-conductor armored cables {{are often}} used to carry high {{currents}} in buildings. This paper presented an experimental investigation into both induced voltages and cable resistances associated with the installation of these cables within the buildings. Both induced armor voltages and cables resistances under different installation practices were measured at both power frequency and its harmonic frequencies. The impact of cable formation, bonding arrangement and cable supporting method on these issues were addressed, and illustrated experimentally via 185 mm 2 (365 kcmil) single-conductor armored copper stranded cables. The standing voltage is generally small for the armored cables used in the buildings. Power losses increase significantly when the <b>cable</b> <b>armor</b> is bonded at two cable ends, {{especially in the case}} of rich harmonic currents in the cables. Recommendations are finally provided for the installation of single-conductor armored cables in buildings. Department of Building Services EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|Single-core {{underground}} {{power cables}} with two-points bonding induce currents in their metallic sheaths. The sheath induced currents are undesirable and generate power losses {{and reduce the}} cable ampacity. This paper {{has shown that the}} values of the sheath losses in some cases could be greater than conductor losses, depending on various factors. Such these factors are type of cable layouts, cable parameters, cable spacing, sheath resistance, phase rotation, conductor current and <b>cable</b> <b>armoring.</b> In this paper the above factors have been investigated. The calculations are carried out depending mainly on IEC 60287 by a proposed computer program using MATLAB.

40|$|Switched-mode power {{supplies}} in variable-frequency drives often combine good electrical efficiency with generous production of conducted emission. The common-mode (CM) current through the output-to-motor cable may perturb nearby systems via cable-to-cable crosstalk. Parameters relevant for the coupling are the rise-fall times and amplitude of the output current and voltage, and types and lengths of the cables. Of the many techniques {{to reduce the}} crosstalk, we investigated a particular one: Reduction of the CM current by the armor of the motor <b>cable.</b> The <b>armor</b> is intended for mechanical protection, but may also substantially reduce the crosstalk. In an actual installation, we measured the transient current through the three phase leads of a motor cable. The cable length was 85 m, and it was buried in wet soil {{for most of its}} length. We also measured the transfer impedance of the armor up to 10 MHz, and used this to calculate the overall CM current in a coupled cable model using assumed reasonable values for the cable and soil parameters. Measurements and model results agreed well on the amplitude of the dominant resonance at about 300 kHz. The ratio of the inside transients to CM current was a factor of 20. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, fiber-optic {{distributed}} temperature sensing (FO-DTS) {{methods have}} been successfully used to investigate {{a wide range of}} hydrological applications. In particular, two {{methods have been}} developed to monitor the soil water content (θ) with the FO-DTS technology: the passive and the active methods. This work presents an assessment of the active method to determine the θ of a sandy soil. In this method, fiber-optic <b>cables</b> with metallic <b>armoring</b> are used and a voltage difference is applied between the two ends of the cable to warm it during a specified time period. Then, an empirical relationship is used to relate θ with a parameter called cumulative temperature (Tcum). To apply the active method, we propose a potential relationship defined by stretches, which depends on the hydrodynamic properties of the soil studied. Different experiments were carried out to assess the active method. These experiments had different heat pulse durations (2, 5, 10 and 20 min with electrical powers of 2. 1, 2. 6, 2. 3 and 2. 4 W/m, respectively), and allowed determining the optimum heat pulse duration (tf), the optimum temporal integration interval (Δt), the optimum final time of integration (t 0) used in the calculation of the cumulative temperature, and the optimum current (I) that should circulate through the fiber-optic cable to generate the heat pulse. Results show that the optimum operating parameters are: tf = 1200 s Δt = 150 s, t 0 = tf, and I ≈ 17 A (2. 43 W/m). Our analysis allowed obtaining volumetric water contents ranging from 0. 14 to 0. 46 m 3 /m 3, with errors that are smaller than 0. 08 m 3 /m 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{oil and gas}} {{industry}} today is a heavily regulated segment, and current standard hasestablished restrictions which yields a very limited weather window for offshore cable installations. This is due to experience with cable failure in harsh weather. A limiting factor in current practice is the design criterion for the minimum allowable radius of curvature in the touchdown point. In addition, current practice does not allow for occurrence of compression in the touch down zone, since this is associated with loop formation and loss of the functionality of the cable. The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the validity and conservatism of current practice, by investigating the issues related to torsion instability through a proposed design procedure. The scope of the thesis comprehends numerical analyses using the SINTEF OCEAN developed software SIMLA. The numerical studies concern a J-lay installation scenario at 100 meters water depth with an implemented cable laying vessel with realistic RAO properties. Two real-life cable cross-sections are evaluated; a single-layered <b>cable</b> without <b>armoring</b> (umbilical 1) and a torsional balanced cable with double-armoring (umbilical 2). The mechanical properties of these are calculated analytically, where the main differences lay in the torsional stiffness of the cross-sections. The effect of installation route is evaluated, and two scenarios are simulated; an end cap turn and a curved route to avoid obstacles. The results are obtained in two steps. Primarily, the critical values of torsion momentand resultant curvature with respect to loop formation are established. These parameters are determined for both a linear and a non-linear pipe material model. Subsequently a range of dynamic analyses with irregular waves are carried out. The irregular waves are applied using a Pierson-Moskowitz wave spectrum with Hs= 2 − 3 mandTp= 7 − 10 s with a one hour simulation time. In the dynamic analyses, the torsion moment and curvature in the cable are analyzed and compared with the capacity parameters for each scenario. For umbilical 1 it is found that the maximum resultant curvature for all sea states exceeds the critical API curvature, while the torsion moment is below the critical torsion moment. The sea states can, due to excess of the API criterion, not be classified as acceptable. It is also concluded that a contributing factor is the low magnitude of the horizontal bottom tension. The maximum resultant curvature for umbilical 2 oscillates around curvature values below the design criterion for minimum radius of curvature for all sea states. The torsion moments are lower than the critical torsion moment. All seastates for umbilical 2 are categorized as acceptable with respect to experienced resultant curvature. It is in addition investigated whether the cables experience compression in the touch down zone while subjected to irregular waves. For umbilical 1 it is found that compression occurs inthe touch down zone for all sea states for both installation scenarios. Umbilical 2 experiences compression in varying degree for all sea states except for Hs= 2 m,Tp= 7 s. The magnitude of the compressive axial force is increasing in accordance with increasing wave height andperiod. The magnitude of the compressive axial forces experienced are compared with the buckling loads associated with local helix buckling and birdcaging. None of the force values are within the range for the buckling loads for tensile armour buckling. Hence it can be concluded that its possible with occurrence of compression without necessarily associated kink formation nor local buckling. The effect of wave heading is also investigated. Changing the wave heading impacts the maximum resultant curvature. It is found that the most critical scenario occur when the waves are incoming with a heading of [π, 2 π]. This is due to the cable configuration, which experience a slight bend in the touch down zone at the initiation of the dynamics. It is also carried out a study of the effect of additional sea current. A current velocity of 4 m/s with correspondingly heading of 0 °, 90 °, 180 °, 270 ° is applied. This result in the observation that the most critical scenario is a current heading of 180 ° due to reduction of the cable effective weight. It is investigated whether a too low horizontal bottom tension is the reason of the severe curvature levels for umbilical 1. Analyses with a T 0 = 5 kN are run for the respective sea states. Resulting from this the curvature levels for umbilical 1 is lowered to acceptable levels for Hs= 2 m. The same analyses are carried out for umbilical 2, where the resulting curvatures increase compared to lower initial tension. This is due to severe yielding of the friction moment for the case of T 0 = 5 kN, inducing more severe deformation of the cable...|$|R
