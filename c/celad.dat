50|$|First {{historic}} {{mention of}} Czeladź comes from 1228, in {{a bill of}} Prince Kazimierz of Opole, in which {{the boundaries of the}} village were mentioned, a public house, as well as a bridge over the Brynica. In 1243, the village (spelled as <b>Celad,</b> and already having the status of a defensive gord) was mentioned again, this time in a document of Prince Konrad Mazowiecki, as it had been destroyed in 1241, during the Mongol invasion of Poland. It belonged to an abbey from Staniątki, and in 1260, Prince Władysław of Opole decided to purchase the village with its parish church. Two years later, Czeladź was sold to an abbey from Henryków, and was granted Magdeburg rights. The town remained within territory of Silesian duchies, but at the same time, Czeles, as it was known, was under the jurisdiction of bishops of Kraków. In 1434 it became part of the Duchy of Siewierz, a property of Kraków Bishops. The town had a defensive wall, remains of which were discovered in 2006, and a town hall, where on March 9, 1589, the agreement between Poles and Austrians was signed, ending the War of the Polish Succession. Even though the Duchy of Siewierz was not officially part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Czeladź was destroyed by the Swedes in the Deluge (1655-60).|$|E
