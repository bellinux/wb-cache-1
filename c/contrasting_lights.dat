[...] She got up from her deck-chair and, leaning her elbows on the {{balustrade}} of the terrace, {{looked out over the}} valley and towards the farther hills. Under the level evening light the architecture of the land revealed itself. The deep shadows, the bright <b>contrasting</b> <b>lights</b> gave the hills a new solidity. Irregularities of the surface, unsuspected before, were picked out with light and shade. The grass, the corn, the foliage of trees were stippled with intricate shadows. The surface of things had taken on a marvellous enrichment.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{different aspects of}} the screen adaptation of literary works through the close analysis of three films based on Dostoyevsky's novels: Pierre Chenal's Crime and Punishment, Robert Bresson's Pickpocket, Denys Arcand's Jesus of Montreal. Its originality lies in bringing to light the multifaceted nature of adaptation which is presented not only as a transfer, but also as a phenomenon having different degrees of occurrence, which can range from a simple borrowing to an elaboration of new artistic forms. The study is divided into three parts. It starts with the introduction which discusses adaptation {{in the light of the}} theory of Gerard Genette and establishes three major degrees of adaptation: formal, thematic and dialogic. The first part deals with the praxis of formal adaptation, specifically how Pierre Chenal adapted Crime and Punishment, i. e. what he borrowed from the original novel and how he created the atmosphere of nightmare by using expressionist elements such as a slightly deformed set, <b>contrasting</b> <b>lights,</b> projection of shadows. The second part focuses on the thematic adaptation by Robert Bresson who develops in his Pickpocket the themes of transgression, pride, the "will to power", and solitude, which were treated by Dostoyevsky in Crime and Punishment and The Gambler. It also highlights similarities between Bresson's and Dostoyevsky's aesthetic conceptions. The last part examines Denys Arcand's dialogic adaptation which contains a great variety of quotations and references, as well as a multiplicity of voices which composes a modern parable of the Passion. In focusing on the two main voices, the Gospels' voice and Dostoyevsky's voice, this final portion establishes their narrative functions, mode of occurrence, and relationship to one another...|$|E

5000|$|The Hi-Matic 7 {{followed}} in 1963. It had a faster f/1.8 lens {{and used a}} CdS cell instead of a selenium meter. Additionally, it gave photographers the option of setting the exposure manually, an option not available in the original Hi-Matic. The Hi-Matic 7S and Hi-Matic 9, both released in 1966, were somewhat improved versions of the popular 7. Compared with the 7, the 7S had the <b>Contrast</b> <b>Light</b> Compensator (CLC) metering system. The CLC had two CdS cells connected in series that purportedly offered superior metering, especially in high <b>contrast</b> <b>lighting.</b> Also, the 7S had a hot shoe instead of the cold shoe of the 7. The 9 {{was the same as}} the 7S {{with the addition of a}} slightly faster f/1.7 lens, additional shutter speeds of 1/2 and 1 sec., and Minolta's [...] "Easy-Flash" [...] system, which simplified flash photography. The Hi-Matic 11 of 1969 was similar to the 9, but the 11 had shutter priority automatic exposure, aperture and shutter speed displayed in the viewfinder, and no aperture ring.|$|R
