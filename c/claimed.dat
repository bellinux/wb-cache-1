40|$|This study aims {{at finding}} {{out how the}} two presidential nominees “Hillary Clinton” and “Barack Obama” from Democratic Party {{formulate}} their <b>claim,</b> data, warrant, rebuttal, qualifier, and backing on their argumentative statements. This is a descriptive qualitative research. The data {{of this study are}} the transcripts which were taken from three times debates during primary elections season. Those three debates are debate on January 31 st, 2008 in Hollywood, California sponsored by CNN, The Los Angles Times and Politico, on February 21 st, 2008 in Austin Texas sponsored by CNN, and debate on February 26 th, 2008 in Cleveland, Ohio sponsored by MSNBC. The debates were taken from www. cnn. com and www. nytimes. com. The Toulmin’s model and the criteria of recognizing argumentative elements by Zahro are utilized to recognize the argumentative elements in the candidates’ statements. The procedure proposed by Miles and Huberman is applied to analyze the data. The result {{of this study is that}} both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton had delivered convincing arguments in the debates due to the fact that they had fulfilled criteria of forming an argument as stated by Toulmin. The domestic policies which were mostly debated are Health care issue, Mortgage crisis, Immigration, and Economy. There are many ways of Obama and Clinton in formulating their argumentative statements. Obama had eighteen ways in delivering his arguments. Those are he proposed policy <b>claim</b> followed by fact, policy <b>claim</b> followed by data and motivational warrant, policy <b>claim</b> followed by rebuttal, policy <b>claim</b> and no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> policy <b>claim</b> followed by fact and substantive warrant, factual <b>claim</b> followed by rebuttal, factual <b>claim</b> followed by fact, factual <b>claim</b> followed by statistical data, factual <b>claim</b> but no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> factual <b>claim</b> with qualifier followed by fact, value <b>claim</b> with data inside the <b>claim,</b> value <b>claim</b> but no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> value <b>claim</b> followed by information and motivational warrant, value <b>claim</b> followed by information, value <b>claim</b> followed by rebuttal, fact followed by policy <b>claim</b> and motivational warrant, authoritative warrant followed by policy <b>claim</b> and data, and fact followed by value <b>claim.</b> Meanwhile, Clinton had twenty one ways in delivering her arguments. Those are policy <b>claim</b> followed by information, policy <b>claim</b> followed by fact, policy <b>claim</b> with qualifier followed by information, policy <b>claim</b> followed by observation result, policy <b>claim</b> with fact inside the <b>claim,</b> policy <b>claim</b> with qualifier followed by information and authoritative warrant, policy <b>claim</b> followed by statistical data, policy <b>claim</b> followed by rebuttal, policy <b>claim</b> with example inside the <b>claim,</b> policy <b>claim</b> with fact inside followed by motivational warrant, policy <b>claim</b> but no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> policy <b>claim</b> followed by information and authoritative warrant, factual <b>claim</b> with qualifier followed by information, factual <b>claim</b> followed by narrative, factual <b>claim</b> but no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> value <b>claim</b> with qualifier followed by rebuttal, value <b>claim</b> followed by information, value <b>claim</b> followed by substantive warrant and narrative, value <b>claim</b> followed by fact, value <b>claim</b> but no data supporting the <b>claim,</b> value <b>claim</b> with fact inside followed by substantive warrant. Generally, Obama and Clinton proposed their <b>claims</b> in the form of complete declarative sentence. The most common words Obama and Clinton used are the words “I think” and “I believe” before they proposed their <b>claims.</b> Moreover, they used the linguistic indicator “so” and “consequently” in proposing <b>claims.</b> And, oftentimes, they used reason indicator “because”, “the reason is [...] ” in their data. In those three debates Obama used qualifier “extensively” and “absolutely” in his <b>claim,</b> while Clinton used qualifier “absolutely”, “necessarily”, “obviously”, “passionately”, and “certainly” in her <b>claims.</b> In proposing rebuttal, Obama used linguistic indicator “but”, “if [...] ”, and “otherwise”, while Clinton used linguistic indicator “if [...] ”, “but,if [...] ” and “except”...|$|R

Flying out of Hargimont, his flight was tasked with providing fighter cover in the area northwest of Dinant.

Lützow <b>claimed</b> his fifth and sixth victory {{of the war on}} 31 May 1940, shooting down two Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighter aircraft south of Amiens.

40|$|<b>Claims</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{as a means of}} expressing HCI knowledge that is associated with a specific artefact and usage context. <b>Claims</b> describe design trade-offs and record HCI knowledge related to a specific design, or artefact, as psychological design rationale. <b>Claims</b> are created in the task-artefact cycle of interactive design and evaluation. Usability evaluation establishes a <b>claim</b> for a specific usage context, but this can restrict subsequent reuse of <b>claims</b> related knowledge. To widen the scope of reuse the knowledge contained within <b>claims</b> and their associated artefacts has to be classified and generalized. To address this problem a schema and method for classifying <b>claims</b> is introduced. The schema elaborates the description of HCI knowledge in <b>claims</b> and enables reuse by describing the assumptions and dependencies upon which a <b>claim</b> rests. Methods for generalising <b>claims</b> and discovering new <b>claims</b> from existing <b>claims</b> and artefacts were investigated. A factoring method for evolving child <b>claims</b> from parent <b>claims</b> and their usage scenarios is described. This employs a walkthrough technique based on Norman’s model of action with questions directed at the contributions a <b>claim</b> makes to usability at different stages in interaction. Factoring promotes evolution of child <b>claims</b> that either address different aspects of task support in the same domain as the parent <b>claim,</b> or development of more general child <b>claims</b> for user interface design. The relationships between <b>claims</b> are represented in maps to illustrate histories of task-artefact investigation that lead to <b>claims</b> evolution either via the factoring process or by empirical investigation. The schema and method for <b>claims</b> evolution are illustrated by case studies of <b>claims</b> development in tutoring systems and <b>claims</b> for functional requirements for specification reuse support tools. The paper concludes with a discussion of the contribution that reusable <b>claims</b> can make as a repository of HCI knowledge. 1 1...|$|R

5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession.

Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty <b>claimed</b> by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory.
