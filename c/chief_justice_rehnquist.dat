25|$|On June 23, 1997, Justice O'Connor {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court. The decision was generally divided along ideological lines, with <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Kennedy joining the majority, and Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissenting.|$|E

25|$|Each Supreme Court justice hires several law Clerks {{to review}} {{petitions}} for writ of certiorari, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four. Generally, law clerks serve {{a term of}} one to two years.|$|E
25|$|In a 5–4 decision, United States v. Morrison invalidated {{the section}} of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 that gave victims of gender-motivated {{violence}} the right to sue their attackers in federal court, although program funding remains unaffected. <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist,</b> writing for the majority, held that Congress lacked authority, under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact this section.|$|E
25|$|Justice Scalia wrote a dissent {{joined by}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> and Justice Thomas. Justice O’Connor also wrote a dissenting opinion. The dissents put into {{question}} whether a “national consensus” had formed among the state laws, citing {{the fact that at}} the time of the ruling, only 18 of the 38 states allowing the death penalty (47%) prohibited the execution of juveniles (the other 12 states executed neither juveniles nor adults).|$|E

25|$|Thomas voted most {{frequently}} with <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> and Justice Scalia {{in his early}} tenure on the Supreme Court. On average, from 1994 to 2004, Scalia and Thomas had an 87% voting alignment, the highest on the court, followed by Ginsburg and Souter (86%). Scalia and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996, at 98%. By 2004, however, other pairs of justices were observed to be more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.|$|E
25|$|Throughout much of {{the history}} of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was clearly the least {{powerful}} branch of the government, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as they are today. Until the death of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> in 2005, the composition of the Supreme Court had remained unchanged since 1994, the second longest time period without a membership change in U.S. history (the longest having been from 1812–1823).|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2005, {{it was assumed that}} the Democrats would {{filibuster}} any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court. Initially, this conjecture seemed to be borne out when conservative jurist John Roberts was renominated to replace conservative <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist.</b> The confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Later, however, the hypothesis was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative appellate judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked on his nomination. Very soon afterward, he was successfully confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Justice Stevens {{joined the}} Court's decision. He stated, though, that {{he issued a}} {{separate}} opinion only to clarify his belief that there was the possibility of further debate on the constitutional limitations of a state's ability to punish assisted suicide. As the second-most senior Justice on the Court (after <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist),</b> {{it is likely that}} Stevens' would have written the opinion himself had Rehnquist not elected to do so. This much is suggested by the length of Stevens' concurrence which runs several pages (official format) longer than Rehnquist's opinion. It is possible that the Chief Justice was in part persuaded to exercise this ability by the fact that Stevens' concurrence offers a less concrete view of the state's ability to regulate euthanasia than the majority of the Justices seem to support.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} holding of the Court {{found that the}} crèche display violated the Establishment Clause while the menorah did not. In her opinion, Justice O'Connor explained the slightly different reasons why she also supports Justice Blackmun's holding. Justice Brennan, joined by Justices Stevens and Marshall, joined parts III-A, IV, and V of Blackmun's opinion. However, Brennan disagreed with Blackmun and O'Connor's respective opinions by stating that the menorah and Christmas tree are also violations of the Establishment Clause. Justice Kennedy, joined by <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> and Justices White and Scalia, disagreed with Blackmun's reasoning in part VI and agreed with the previous judgment of the district court. Justice Stevens, in his own opinion, stated that the appeals court was correct in its ruling. He believed that the menorah display, together with the Christmas tree, signified a double violation of the establishment clause. Since the menorah is a religious symbol, he felt that Judaism and Christianity were being endorsed {{by the government to}} the exclusion of all other religions.|$|E

[...] Justice Jackson had initially planned to join a dissent in Brown. Later, at his 1986 hearings for the slot of <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice,</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> put further distance {{between himself and the}} 1952 memo: [...] "The bald statement that Plessy was right and should be reaffirmed, was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, {{joined by}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> and Justices Scalia and Kennedy. Thomas {{stated that the}} test has always been if the statute in {{question}} could be [...] "fairly interpreted" [...] to allow monetary damages. He stated that the majority had devised a new test: whether liability could be allowed on a [...] "fair inference" [...] of congressional authorization. Thomas believed that Mitchell I was the proper case to compare with this one, as none of the detailed control and responsibilities present in Mitchell II were present in this case. He further said that without a clear and unambiguous intent by Congress to make the United States liable, {{there could be no}} finding of monetary damages.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an opinion}} written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court {{reversed}} the Sixth Circuit's ruling and remanded {{the case to}} the Sixth Circuit for further proceedings. <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> stated that the Tennessee state court correctly identified Strickland v. Washingtons two-part test as the proper legal standard for effective assistance of counsel when it rejected Cone's petition for postconviction relief. Under this standard, Cone would need to demonstrate that his attorney's [...] "representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness" [...] and that [...] "there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different". Additionally, <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> wrote that in order to presume prejudice under the standards set forth in United States v. Cronic, an attorney's failure to subject a case to adversarial scrutiny [...] "must be complete." [...] <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> wrote that Cone would also need to demonstrate that that the Tennessee court [...] "applied Strickland to the facts of his case in an objectively unreasonable manner", but he was unable to do so in this case. Citing various [...] "tactical reasons" [...] why Cone's attorney did not present mitigating evidence, <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> concluded that the jury still had an opportunity to consider whether [...] "evidence of a mental disease or defect" [...] should mitigate Cone's ultimate sentence. Finally, <b>Chief</b> <b>Justice</b> <b>Rehnquist</b> wrote that the attorney's choice to waive his closing argument was a [...] "tactical decision about which competent lawyers might disagree." ...|$|E
