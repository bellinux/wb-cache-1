40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{this report}} an {{overview}} is presented {{of the operating}} results of the automatic measuring equipment and of the data acquisition system of the Netherlands National Air Quality Monitoring Network in the years 1987 and 1988. The measuring equipment for sulphur dioxyde including a new monitor scored a number of failures of 0, 92 a year only. As {{a result of a}} modification of one of the monitor's electrodes the equipment for carbon monxyde showed less defects. The mean number of failures in the equipment for ozone is higher than in the old network. This score is attributed tot the poor quality of the Rhodamine B discs used in the monitors. The high failures's number for the equipment for nitrogen oxydes is related to service and maintenance. The results for the equipment for wind velocity and for wind direction are good. During 1987 and 1988 the failure's number for the data acquisition combination modem and stationprocessor are 0, 97 and 0, 81 respectively. In general, the performance of the network can be described by two parameters the net effieciency of the equipment and the gross efficiency. Net effieciencies are higher than in previous years for sulphur <b>dioxyde,</b> <b>carbon</b> monoxyde and for nitrogen oxydes. Net effieciency of the ozone equipment is about the same in the new network and in the old one. Network's gross efficiency is 92 %...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe zinc {{complex of}} glycinate [Gly-H + Zn]+ has been formed by {{electrospray}} of a glycine/ZnCl 2 {{mixture in a}} 50 : 50 vol. water/methanol solution. In this article, the precursors and the fragments of [Gly-H + Zn]+ ions are studied by means of collisional induced decomposition (CID) experiments including H/D exchanges and accurate ab initio calculations. Two precursors were identified: [Gly + CH 3 OH-H + Zn]+ (A) and [Gly + Gly-H + Zn]+ (B), A being much more abundant than B. The three main fragmentations of [Gly-H + Zn]+ are loss of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde,</b> loss of carbon monoxyde, and successive losses of water and carbon monoxyde. To interpret these fragmentations four structures were chosen to describe [Gly-H + Zn]+. These structures are complexes between Zn(II) and glycine deprotonated either on the carboxylic group [NH 2 CH 2 COOZn]+ (1) or on the amine function [ZnNHCH 2 COOH]+ (2) or isomeric forms involving ZnH+ i. e. either [NH 2 CHCOOZnH]+ (3) or [HZn *** NH=CHCOOH]+ (4) respectively. None of the fragmentations is interpretable directly from structures 1 and 2. Loss of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> occurs from 3, loss of carbon monoxyde from a complex CX where HOZn+ interacts with CO and NH=CH 2, a rearranged form of 2. Successive losses of water and carbon monoxyde can take place from 4. The non occurrence of structures 1 and 2 during the fragmentation of [Gly-H + Zn]+ ions is interpreted by isomerizations within A before evaporation of the last molecule of solvent. These isomerizations are energetically easier than the last step of desolvation. © 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|E

In last centuries they became hobbies and team mates for equestrian activities. Horse riding today includes several disciplines, {{and many of these}} are olimpic sports. As such, equestrian deserve the attention of sports researchers, who are interested in cardiometabolic adaptations during training and competition. Cardio-Pulmonary Exercise Test The cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) today is the most reliable test that provides data on cardio metabolic and ventilatory function during exercise. Data derive from the analisys of : VO 2 : oxygen uptake (ml/min); VCO 2 : <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> production (ml/min); VE: pulmonary ventilation (L/min); HR: heart rate (bpm); It became fundamental to obtain and understanding of physiological capacities underlying sports performance. It would be useful to know the energy demands and whether the anaerobic metabolism is recruited. CO 2 excess To obtain an index of anaerobic glicolysis, excess of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> production (CO 2 excess) was assessed as follow: CO 2 excess = VCO 2 - (RER rest ? VO 2) WALK TROT CANTERING It is quite well correlated with the rate of lactate accumulation in the blood.

30|$|Introduction: Anemia and RBC {{transfusion}} as {{treatment are}} common in ICU patients. Neverthless, RBC transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Restrictive strategy policy, based on a haemoglobin [Hb] level of 7  g dL, is the guideline to transfuse most of ICU patients. The aim of RBC transfusion is to avoid tissue hypoxia by improving oxygen delivery (DO 2) and therefore oxygen consumption (VO 2). This could suggest to combine [Hb] and some parameters reflecting the sytemic DO 2 VO 2 balance to decide to transfuse. This study aims to analyse the effects of RBC transfusion on the systemic oxygenation assessed by the (central) venous oxygen saturation (S(c)VO 2), the lactate level, the venous-to-arterial <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> pressure gradient (Pv-aCO 2) and the ratio between cardiac index and O 2 extraction (IC EO 2), and to assess their usefulness in the transfusion decision.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{hydrogen}} at high yields and production rates, the biotechnological process needs to be further optimized and efficient bioreactors must be designed. A biodisc bioreactor has been design and investigated to produce biohydrogen from glucose by the Clostridium butyricum CWBI 1009 strain at a high yield and production rate. This reactor, working continuously, has an internal volume of 2. 3 l but a working volume (liquid phase) of 300 ml. Firstly, it enhances the hydrogen production rate (by about 3 times more than a completely stirred bioreactor) by partially fixing the bacteria on the porous support and thus increasing the cell concentration in the bioreactor (decoupling of HRT and SRT). Secondly, the rotating biodisc design enables efficient gas transfer (hydrogen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde)</b> from the liquid phase where it is produced by the bacteria to the headspace. Indeed, {{this is an important}} way to increase hydrogen production yields (by about 25 % compared to a completely stirred bioreactor) by allowing the bacteria to focus on the metabolites pathways that produce more hydrogen. Other reactors designs have shown such good results by increasing the interfacial surface. Peer reviewe...|$|E

An updated database of the ecology and biogeography is also provided for each species. The dominant assemblage of this lake (C. ophtalmica, C. ovum and candonids) is typical of karstic carbonate lakes of high altitudes from the Iberian Peninsula, and species characterising palustrine and spring waters have been also recognised. Our results show that ostracod species occurrence in this lake is mainly controlled by the relative values of dissolved oxygen and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> of the bottom waters. We mention the occurrence of C. cf. meerfeldiana and P. eremita by {{the first time in}} the Iberian Peninsula. Knowledge of the detailed distribution of ostracod species in lake Caicedo de Yuso/Arreo will help in the better understanding of the biogeography of these microcrustaceans in freshwater environments in the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} of liquid water being {{present at the}} surface early {{in the history of}} Mars, but at present, the surface pressure at Mars is too low to allow liquid water to be stable. Today, the polar caps constitute the largest known reservoirs of water ice on Mars. Possible reservoirs of liquid water could exist deep beneath this ice surface, where the overlying ice implies a higher pressure and provides sufficient isolation. The permanent polar caps consist of water with some dust (estimate 2 %) and possibly layers of <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> that have been deposited through millions of years. Their volume is comparable to the Greenland ice sheet. More than 150 subglacial lakes have been discovered underneath the Antarctic ice sheet. The largest one is subglacial Lake Vostok, the size of Corsica and characterized by a mean water depth> 700 m. Despite low surface temperatures, a thick insulating ice cover of 4000 m guarantees a basal temperature a the pressure melting point. Subglacial lakes could as well exist beneath the Mars polar caps today, although environmental constraints are more severe. However, given the uncertainties of the thermal conductivity, local variations of thickness or heat flow could be sufficient for basal melting to occur (Hvidberg, 2005). Ice sheets interact with subglacial lakes in a complex way, and this interaction can be trace...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{observations}} have evidenced {{traces of}} methane (CH 4) heterogeneously {{distributed in the}} martian atmosphere. However, because the lifetime of CH 4 in the atmosphere of Mars {{is estimated to be}} around 300 – 600 years on the basis of photochemistry, its release from a subsurface reservoir or an active primary source of methane have been invoked in the recent literature. Among the existing scenarios, it has been proposed that clathrate hydrates located in the near subsurface of Mars could be at the origin of the small quantities of the detected CH 4. Here, we accurately determine the composition of these clathrate hydrates, as a function of temperature and gas phase composition, by using a hybrid statistical thermodynamic model based on experimental data. Compared to other recent works, our model allows us to calculate the composition of clathrate hydrates formed from a more plausible composition of the martian atmosphere by considering its main compounds, i. e. <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde,</b> nitrogen and argon, together with methane. Besides, because there is no low temperature restriction in our model, we are able to determine the composition of clathrate hydrates formed at temperatures corresponding to the extreme ones measured in the polar caps. Our results show that methane enriched clathrate hydrates could be stable in the subsurface of Mars only if a primitive CH 4 -rich atmosphere has existed or if a subsurface source of CH 4 has been (or is still) present...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{the lack}} of robust, context-distributed {{subsurface}} greenhouses gases (GHG) concentrations data is a key bottleneck to reduce the uncertainty range of GHG groundwater input to continental surface water bodies such as rivers or lakes estimates. <b>Carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxyde (N 2 O) {{are likely to be}} indirectly transferred to the atmosphere through groundwater discharge into continental surface water bodies.

It is increasingly known that the central hypothesis {{for the next century}} is that global average temperature will increase by about 2 °C in 2100, with <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> concentration raising over 550 PPM. A catastrophic change of pattern in climate dynamics remains possible, which may be a risk more serious than gradual and anticipated warming it's more and more understood that burning the world reserves of oil, gas and coal is technically very feasible, but environmentally very catastrophic. International negociations are led {{within the framework of the}} Climate Convention. Initially, they followed the model of the ozone layer treaty negotiations. But climate change is a much wider issue, comparable in scope to law of the sea or to free-trade negotiations, with the additional complexity of scientific ignorance and intergenerational aspects. Negotiation must be expected to go on for several decades. Industrialized countries agreed in Kyoto, in 1997, to reduce the level of their greenhouse gases emissions as soon as 2008 - 2012, about 5 % below their 1990 level. This objective is ambitious considering the inertia of energy systems, since the current global trend is more like a 1 % annual growth but this is not enought to insure a stable long-term rentability for industrial investments in less emitting technologies.

40|$|International audienceAstronomy & Astrophysics Hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN) as a {{precursor}} for formylcyanide (CHOCN), ketenimine (CH 2 CNH), and cyanogen (NCCN) in astrophysical conditions ABSTRACT Context. The reactivity in astrophysical environments can be investigated {{in the laboratory}} through experimental simulations, which provide understanding {{of the formation of}} specific molecules detected in the solid phase or in the gas phase of these environments. In this context, the most complex molecules are generally suggested to form at the surface of interstellar grains and to be released into the gas phase through thermal or non-thermal desorption, where they can be detected through rotational spectroscopy. Here, we focus our experiments on the photochemistry of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN), whose formation has been shown to compete with aminomethanol (NH 2 CH 2 OH), a glycine precursor, through the Strecker synthesis. Aims. We present the first experimental investigation of the ultraviolet (UV) photochemistry of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN) as a pure solid or diluted in water ice. Methods. We used Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy to characterize photoproducts of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN) and to determine the different photodegradation pathways of this compound. To improve the photoproduct identifications, irradiations of hydroxyacetonitrile 14 N and 15 N isotopologues were performed, coupled with theoretical calculations. Results. We demonstrate that the photochemistry of pure hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH 2 CN) (σ photo = 5. 7 ± 1. 0 × 10 − 20 photon s − 1 cm 2) under the influence of UV photons, or diluted in water ice (σ photo = 8. 6 ± 1. 0 × 10 − 20 photon s − 1 cm 2), leads to the formation of formylcyanide (CHOCN), ketenimine (CH 2 CNH), formaldehyde (CH 2 O), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), carbon monoxyde (CO), and <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxyde</b> (CO 2); the presence of water increases its photodegradation rate. Furthermore, because hydroxyacetonitrile is more highly refractory than water, our results suggest that in astrophysical environments, hydroxyacetonitrile can be formed on icy grains from formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, and can be subsequently photodegradated in the water ice, or irradiated as a pure solid at the surface of dry grains after water desorption. As some of the hydroxyacetonitrile photochemistry products are detected in protostellar cores (e. g. formylcyanide or ketenimine), this compound maybe considered as one of the possible sources of these molecules at the grain surface in fairly cold regions. These photoproducts can then be released in the gas phase in a warmer region...|$|E
