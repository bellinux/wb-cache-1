5|$|Biological <b>control</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{method of}} {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an}} important component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility <b>control,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because they consider it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|Fertility <b>control</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{non-lethal}} {{method of}} population management {{that is usually}} viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it is costly and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{scientific}} <b>control</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> experiment or observation {{designed to}} minimize the effects of variables other than the independent variable.

5|$|Speed2: Cruise <b>Control</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 1997 American {{disaster}} thriller film, and {{a sequel}} to Speed (1994). It was produced and directed by Jan de Bont, and written by Randall McCormick and Jeff Nathanson, based on a story by De Bont and McCormick. Sandra Bullock stars in the film, reprising her role from Speed, while Jason Patric and Willem Dafoe co-star. The film was released by 20th Century Fox on June 13, 1997.|$|E

5|$|Biological pest <b>control</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{method of}} {{controlling}} pests such as {{insects and mites}} by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E

25|$|To remain {{neutrally}} buoyant, gas {{is added}} to the BC when the diver is negative (too heavy), or vented from the BC when the diver is too buoyant (too light). There is no stable equilibrium depth for a diver. Any change in depth from a position of neutrality result in a force toward an even less neutral depth, so buoyancy <b>control</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> continuous and active procedure—the diving equivalent of balance, in a positive feedback environment.|$|E

Local government, as opposed to central government, is the primary activator in public parking. The emphasis is on restriction of on-street parking facilities; and parking charges and fines are often major income sources for local government in North America and Europe.|$|E
