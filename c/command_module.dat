5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier USS Ticonderoga delivered the Apollo 16 <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> to the North Island Naval Air Station, near San Diego, California, on Friday, May 5, 1972. On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment {{being used to}} empty the residual toxic reaction control system fuel in the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. Forty-six people {{were sent to the}} hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him. A hole was blown in the hangar roof 250 feet above; about 40 windows in the hangar were shattered. The <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> suffered a three-inch gash in one panel.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of the fire fed by pure oxygen caused the pressure to rise to , which ruptured the Command Module's inner wall at 6:31:19 (23:31:19 GMT, initial phase of the fire). Flames and gases then rushed outside the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> through open access panels to two levels of the pad service structure. Intense heat, dense smoke, and ineffective gas masks designed for toxic fumes rather than heavy smoke hampered the ground crew's attempts to rescue the men. There were fears the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> had exploded, or soon would, and that the fire might ignite the solid fuel rocket in the launch escape tower above the <b>Command</b> <b>Module,</b> which would have likely killed nearby ground personnel, and possibly have destroyed the pad.|$|E
5|$|After the fire, the Apollo {{program was}} {{grounded}} for review and redesign. The <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> {{was found to}} be extremely hazardous and, in some instances, carelessly assembled (for example, a misplaced socket wrench was found in the cabin).|$|E
50|$|Boost Protective Cover: A hollow conical {{fiberglass}} structure {{protecting the}} <b>Command</b> <b>Module's</b> parachute compartment {{and providing a}} smooth aerodynamic cover over the docking tunnel and probe. After erosion of the pilot's windows from the escape motor exhaust was discovered during early LES flight testing, an aft protective cover surrounding the <b>Command</b> <b>Module's</b> entire upper surface was added.|$|R

5|$|On July 20, 1969, the Lunar Module Eagle {{separated}} from the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> Columbia. Collins, alone aboard Columbia, inspected Eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged.|$|E
5|$|In October 1966, NASA {{announced}} the flight would carry a small television camera to broadcast {{live from the}} <b>Command</b> <b>Module.</b> The camera would {{also be used to}} allow flight controllers to monitor the spacecraft's instrument panel in flight. Television cameras were carried aboard all manned Apollo missions.|$|E

5|$|The Apollo 1 <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> {{has never}} been on public display. After the accident, the {{spacecraft}} was removed and taken to Kennedy Space Center to facilitate the review board's disassembly in order to investigate {{the cause of the}} fire. When the investigation was complete, it was moved to the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, and placed in a secured storage warehouse.|$|E
5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the fuel tank replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|Collins was {{originally}} {{slated to be}} the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot (CMP) on Apollo 8 but was removed when he required surgery {{on his back and}} was replaced by Jim Lovell, his backup for that flight. After Collins was medically cleared, he took what would have been Lovell's spot on Apollo 11; as a veteran of Apollo 8, Lovell was transferred to Apollo 11's backup crew and promoted to backup commander.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{spacecraft}} design {{deficiencies in}} the parachute reefing cutters, the drogue and main parachute deployment mortar mountings, and the <b>command</b> module/service <b>module</b> umbilical cutters were found and corrected before the manned Apollo flights began. However, all <b>command</b> <b>modules</b> flown achieved satisfactory landing conditions and confirmed that, had they been manned spacecraft, the crew would have survived the abort conditions.|$|R

5|$|In early 1969, Anders {{accepted}} {{a job with}} the National Space Council effective August 1969 and announced that he would retire as an astronaut on that date. At that point Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch (at which point Anders would be unavailable if needed) and would later join Lovell's crew and ultimately be assigned as the original Apollo 13 CMP.|$|E
5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment {{was not to}} run a fire test on the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> before the plugs-out test. In the first episode of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Named to the {{advisory}} group chosen {{to support the}} review board, Shea threw himself into the investigation, working eighty-hour weeks. Although the precise source of ignition was never found, {{it soon became clear}} that an electrical short somewhere in the <b>command</b> <b>module</b> had started the fire, probably sparked by a chafed wire. What was less clear was where to apportion responsibility. NASA engineers tended to point to what they saw as shoddy workmanship by North American Aviation. By contrast, North American executives blamed NASA management for its decision over their objections to pressurize the <b>command</b> <b>module</b> with pure oxygen to a pressure far in excess of that needed in space, in which almost any materialincluding Velcro, with which the cabin was filledwould instantly burst into flames if exposed to a spark. Whatever the precise distribution of responsibility, Shea remained haunted by the feeling that he, personally, was responsible for the deaths of three astronauts. For years after the fire, he displayed the portrait given to him by the Apollo 1 crew in the front hallway of his own home.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{specialist}} vehicles - CAMELEON can leave its mission payload {{on the mission}} area - for continued support after the base vehicleâ€™s departure. Fuel tanks, generators, <b>command</b> <b>modules</b> can all be strategically positioned to support operations thus leaving the base vehicle free to be re-roled.|$|R
5000|$|On the Apollo 6 {{unmanned}} Block I flights, the SM {{was painted}} white {{to match the}} <b>Command</b> <b>Module's</b> appearance, but on Apollo 1, Apollo 4, and all the Block II spacecraft, the SM walls were left unpainted except for the EPS and ECS radiators, which were white.|$|R
5|$|To save cost, NASA {{used one}} of the Saturn V rockets {{originally}} earmarked for a canceled Apollo mission to launch the Skylab. Apollo spacecraft were used for transporting astronauts {{to and from the}} station. Three three-man crews stayed aboard the station for periods of 28, 59, and 84 days. Skylab's habitable volume was , which was 30.7 times bigger than that of the Apollo <b>Command</b> <b>Module.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module Eagle and landed in the Sea of Tranquility. They stayed {{a total of about}} 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the <b>command</b> <b>module.</b> They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
5|$|Apollo {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} American scientific programs ever. It cost more than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.) It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the <b>command</b> <b>module</b> (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{geospatial}} {{models are}} developed using <b>command</b> line <b>modules</b> of GIS packages. To utilize scientific workflow technology in geospatial model-ing, {{it is important}} to support <b>command</b> line GIS <b>modules</b> in scientific work-flow systems. However, straightforward representation of <b>command</b> line <b>modules</b> as workflow components conflicts with conventional conceptual de-sign patterns. We propose a two-step geospatial scientific workflow composi-tion approach. Simple conceptual workflows are composed in the first step. These allow data type-based workflow validation. The validated conceptual workflows are then transformed automatically into executable workflows using <b>command</b> line <b>modules</b> in the second step. We describe the preliminary imple-mentation of the proposed approach in the Kepler scientific workflow system and demonstrate its feasibility using an example. ...|$|R
25|$|The heater and {{protection}} thermostats were originally {{designed for the}} <b>Command</b> <b>Module's</b> 28-volt DC bus. The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply, in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly. Beechcraft, the tank subcontractor, did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage.|$|R
50|$|The Mechanized Air Defense Brigade, Unit 66440, has {{reportedly}} retrofitted its field <b>command</b> <b>modules</b> to provide <b>command</b> platforms with geographic information, air service information, battlefield monitoring and digital transmission, enhancing the units {{command and control}} capability and ability to conduct accurate air defense. The unit conducted several exercises in 2002 including a live-fire exercise.|$|R
5|$|Back on Enterprise, Commander Tucker {{arranges}} a movie {{night for}} the crew featuring the Frankenstein film trilogy, and invites Sub-Commander T'Pol. She eventually consents, and finally finds in the film an insightful view into historical Human-Vulcan relations. Meanwhile, Mayweather makes his intended modifications without permission, resulting in a confrontation when Paul finds out. The ship comes under further attack from an alien vessel, and Paul offers up the cargo as planned. The aliens refuse and demand the vessel as well. Left without any other option, Paul tells Mayweather to re-initiate the modifications, and to detach the <b>command</b> <b>module</b> from the cargo section. They soon disable the alien ship. The brothers reconcile, and Mayweather leaves, promising to visit again soon.|$|E
5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the <b>command</b> <b>module,</b> project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Slayton put Shepard down {{to command}} the next {{available}} moon mission, which was Apollo 13 in 1970. Under normal circumstances, this assignment {{would have gone to}} Cooper, as the backup commander of Apollo 10, but Cooper was swept aside. A rookie, Stuart Roosa, was designated the <b>Command</b> <b>Module</b> Pilot. Shepard asked for Jim McDivitt as his Lunar Module Pilot, but McDivitt, who had already commanded the Apollo 9 mission, balked at the prospect, arguing that Shepard did not have sufficient Apollo training to command a Moon mission. A rookie, Edgar Mitchell, was designated the Lunar Module Pilot instead.|$|E
50|$|Motor Vessel Retriever was a World War II-era Landing Craft Utility {{transferred}} to NASA from the U.S. Army. It {{was used to}} train United States astronauts for post-splashdown ocean recovery operations and water egress from their <b>command</b> <b>modules</b> during the Gemini and Apollo programs from 1963 to 1972. It operated primarily in Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} [...] "Wingless Flight", by project {{engineer}} R. Dale Reed, if he had had his way, the HL-10 would have flown in space {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. Following the cancellation of the Apollo moon project, Reed realized that there would be substantial Apollo hardware left over, including several flight-rated <b>command</b> <b>modules</b> and Saturn V rockets.|$|R
2500|$|About 38 {{seconds after}} the second stage {{ignition}} the Saturn V switched from a preprogrammed trajectory to a [...] "closed loop" [...] or Iterative Guidance Mode. The Instrument Unit now computed in real time the most fuel-efficient trajectory toward its target orbit. If the Instrument Unit failed, the crew could switch control of the Saturn to the <b>Command</b> <b>Module's</b> computer, take manual control, or abort the flight.|$|R
