While that decision in an unrelated case was still pending before the high court, in October 2004, under a plea agreement, Malvo pleaded guilty in another case in Spotsylvania County, for another murder to avoid a possible death penalty sentence, and agreed to additional sentencing of life imprisonment without parole.

2500|$|Finally, Justice Marshall {{points out}} that [...] "Even where the power of two sovereigns to pursue {{separate}} prosecutions for the same crime has been undisputed, this Court has barred both governments from combining to do what each could not constitutionally do on its own." [...] In this case, the prosecutions in Alabama and Georgia were so inextricably linked that {{it was as if}} they were acting together as a single governmental entity. Furthermore, the interests of justice, according to Marshall, were frustrated by having the defendant plead guilty to a crime in Georgia to avoid the death penalty, only to have the guilty plea prevent him from mounting a meaningful defense to <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> in Alabama. For these reasons, in the interests [...] "of fundamental fairness," [...] Justice Marshall voted against the majority decision.|$|E
40|$|The <b>capital</b> <b>charge</b> régime was {{introduced}} in New Zealand government departments in July 1991. The régime provides a mechanism for the Crown to require a return on the funds invested in New Zealand (hereafter NZ) government departments. However the current models {{used to determine the}} required rate of return (hereafter the <b>capital</b> <b>charge)</b> from departments are private sector models. Therefore, the <b>capital</b> <b>charge</b> required by the Crown will be substantially higher than what departments are able to generate.

40|$|The {{essence of}} <b>capital</b> <b>charging</b> is very simple: namely, {{that the costs}} of capital {{facilities}} should be rendered explicit. Such transparency is intended to introduce new discipline to decisions about the acquisition, use and disposal of publicly financed assets.

2500|$|The Mishnah {{questioned}} why [...] discussed three witnesses, {{when two}} witnesses were sufficient to establish guilt.

The Mishnah deduced from the multiple use of the word [...] "witnesses" [...] in [...] that two witnesses could discredit even a hundred witnesses. Rabbi Simeon deduced from the multiple use of the word [...] "witnesses" [...] in [...] that just as two witnesses were not executed as perjurers until both had been incriminated, so three were not executed until all three had been incriminated. Rabbi Akiva deduced that the addition of the third witness in [...] was to teach that the perjury of a third, superfluous witness was just as serious as that of the others. Rabbi Akiva concluded that if Scripture so penalized an accomplice just as one who committed a wrong, how much more would God reward an accomplice to a good deed. The Mishnah further deduced from the multiple use of the word [...] "witnesses" [...] in [...] that just as the disqualification of one of two witnesses would invalidate the evidence of the set of two witnesses, so would the disqualification of one witness invalidate the evidence of even a hundred. Jose ben Halafta said that these limitations applied only to witnesses in <b>capital</b> <b>charges,</b> and that in monetary suits, the balance of the witnesses could establish the evidence. Judah the Prince said that the same rule applied to monetary suits or <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> where the disqualified witnesses joined {{to take part in the}} warning of the defendant, but the rule did not disqualify the remaining witnesses where the disqualified witnesses did not take part in the warning.

Large amount of capital that are assigned to decrease this risk are evidence to this subject. One {{of the most important}} factors for modeling operational risk to estimate <b>capital</b> <b>charge</b> is loss data collections of banks.

50|$|Based on the {{original}} Basel Accord, under the Standardised Approach, banks’ activities are divided into eight business lines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage. Within each business line, gross income is a broad indicator {{that serves as a}} proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale of operational risk exposure within each of these business lines. The capital charge for each business line is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that business line. Beta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience for a given business line and the aggregate level of gross income for thatbusiness line.The total capital charge is calculated as the three-year average of the simple summation of the regulatory <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> across each of the business lines in each year. In any given year, negative <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> (resulting from negative gross income) in any business line may offset positive <b>capital</b> <b>charges</b> in other business lines without limit.|$|E
