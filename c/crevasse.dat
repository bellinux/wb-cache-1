5|$|After Mawson {{slipped into}} a <b>crevasse,</b> they began to tie {{themselves}} to their sledges as a precaution. Ninnis developed photokeratitis (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with zinc sulfate and cocaine hydrochloride. They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a <b>crevasse.</b> On 24 November, the party reached {{the eastern side of}} the glacier and ascended to the plateau.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{particularly}} steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they {{fell into a}} <b>crevasse.</b> They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp {{when one of the}} dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a litter of fourteen pups.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{eagerness to}} start out again, Amundsen waited until mid-October and the first hints of spring. He was ready to leave on 15October, but was held up by the weather {{for a few more}} days. On 19October 1911 the five men, with four sledges and fifty-two dogs, began their journey. The weather quickly worsened, and in heavy fog the party strayed into the field of crevasses that Johansen's depot party had {{discovered}} the previous autumn. Wisting later recalled how his sledge, with Amundsen aboard, nearly disappeared down a <b>crevasse</b> when the snow bridge broke underneath it.|$|E

5|$|Due to sea ice {{conditions}} and adverse weather, progress was initially very slow. By {{the end of}} October they had crossed McMurdo Sound and advanced 60miles (100km) up the difficult Victoria Land coast, at which point they decided to concentrate all their efforts on reaching the Magnetic Pole. After traversing the Nordenskjold Ice Tongue and the treacherous Drygalski Glacier they were finally able to leave the coast and turn north-west, towards the Magnetic Pole's approximate location. Before then, David had a narrow escape after falling into a <b>crevasse</b> but was rescued by Mawson.|$|E
5|$|Kenneth {{takes some}} time off from his page duties to {{volunteer}} at an animal shelter. He claims his time on a pig farm {{will allow him to}} not emotionally connect with the dogs being held there, but he quickly names all of the dogs and adopts the many dogs scheduled to be euthanized that day. Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt the dogs and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a <b>crevasse.</b> He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the <b>crevasse</b> he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{returned}} to Safety Camp with the dogs, after risking {{his own life}} to rescue a dog-team that had fallen into a <b>crevasse.</b> When the slower pony party arrived, one of the animals was in very poor condition and died shortly afterwards. Later, as the surviving ponies were crossing the sea ice near Hut Point, the ice broke up. Despite a determined rescue attempt, three more ponies died. Of the eight ponies that had begun the depot-laying journey, only two returned home.|$|E
5000|$|Steershead <b>Crevasses</b> (...) is a {{large and}} {{distinctive}} area of <b>crevasses</b> 70 miles south of Roosevelt Island in the east part of Ross Ice Shelf. The outline of the <b>crevasses</b> resembles an immense steer's head. This is a unique landmark on the direct line of flight between McMurdo Station and Byrd Station, and U.S. Navy pilots regularly observed the [...] "steer's head" [...] {{as a means of}} verifying their navigation. This was noted by Kenneth Bertrand and Fred Alberts during a November 1962 flight from McMurdo to Byrd. On their recommendation, the name Steershead <b>Crevasses</b> was approved by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names.|$|R

30|$|Image-to-image {{cross-correlation}} {{has been}} applied previously to pairs of optical sensor images to automatically track <b>crevasses</b> in mapping the velocity field of glacier motion and deformation (Scambos et al., 1992; Whillans and Tseng, 1995). However, the <b>crevasses</b> were subtle on optical sensor images and data obtained under fine conditions are limited. The cross-correlation technique is unsuitable in the present case; consequently, the use of SAR image data is most effective in detecting temporal changes in <b>crevasses,</b> including their generation, opening, propagation, and displacement.|$|R
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a <b>crevasse,</b> they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career Ninnis served both on ships and in hospitals. He {{received}} Sir Gilbert Blane's Gold Medal in 1879, {{was promoted to}} Deputy Inspector-General in 1883, was appointed Principal Medical Officer at Melville Naval Hospital in 1892, and was selected as a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1895. Upon his retirement in 1897 {{he was promoted to}} Inspector-General, and in 1900 and 1902 served as President of the Section of the Navy, Army, and Ambulance of the British Medical Association. He was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1912. Ninnis was initiated into the Freemasons 1872, was a founder of several Lodges, and in 1901 became a Past Grand Deacon of England. He was the father of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, an explorer who was lost down a <b>crevasse</b> during the 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's slow {{movement}} just offshore the Louisiana coast, {{the hurricane}} became the wettest tropical cyclone in state history, with numerous locations reporting record rainfall across the state. Of the state's ten highest official rainfall measurements associated with tropical cyclones, the two highest were measurements {{taken during the}} hurricane. Precipitation peaked at 37.5in (953mm) on Miller Island. For any given 20,000mi2 (50,000km/h2) area of Louisiana, the maximum rainfall averaged 12.1in (307.3mm). Thirteen official weather stations in the state reported monthly 24-hour rainfall total records. The highest of these was in Crowley, where 19.76in (501.9mm) of precipitation fell on August9; the station would record 33.71in (856.2mm) of rain {{over the course of}} the storm. The torrential rainfall submerged the city under 2ft (0.6m) of floodwater. In Cameron, the storm dropped 21in (533mm) of rain was reported. In St. Landry Parish, bayous flowed over their banks, causing refugees to evacuate to Opelousas. In the Acadiana region of southern Louisiana, the resulting floods were considered worse than the floods that resulted from the Sauvé's <b>Crevasse</b> in 1927. There, whooping crane populations were severely impacted by the rainfall, and only one was known to be alive by 1947. The floods inundated roughly 2,000,000acres (800,000hectares) of land in Louisiana. Much of the lowland areas remained underwater until October1940. As a result, cotton and corn crops experienced significant losses, as well as pecans. Livestock also saw large losses. Impassable areas caused by rising floodwaters prevented firefighters from extinguishing a fire which burned down much of the Shell Oil Company's offices and supply warehouses in the town of Iowa. Across the state, the hurricane caused $9million in damages, though only six fatalities resulted, relatively less than most storms of similar scale. The low death count was attributed to large evacuation procedures which underwent prior to the storm, as well as guidance provided from the newly opened Weather Bureau east of Lake Charles.|$|E

25|$|On May 3, 1849, a Mississippi River levee breach upriver {{from the}} city (around modern River Ridge, Louisiana) created the worst {{flooding}} the city had ever seen. The flood, known as at Sauvé's <b>Crevasse,</b> left 12,000 people homeless. While New Orleans has experienced numerous floods large and small in its history, the flood of 1849 was of a more disastrous scale than any save the flooding after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. New Orleans has not experienced flooding from the Mississippi River since Sauvé's <b>Crevasse,</b> although it came dangerously close during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.|$|E

25|$|They {{travel to}} a nearby Mexican lunar colony, finding it covered in cobwebs and the colonists dead, entombed in similar webbing. The Doctor {{confirms}} the colony's readings that the moon has gained over one billion tons of additional mass. They are attacked by a spider-like creature that kills Lundvik's crew, but the disinfecting spray Courtney brought kills the creature; the Doctor compares it to germs, and wants to study it further. After seeing Courtney safe to the TARDIS, they investigate a <b>crevasse</b> where thousands of the spider-like creature wait, {{and the presence of}} amniotic fluid nearby. The Doctor surprises Clara and Lundvik by diving into the <b>crevasse,</b> promising to meet them later.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{sedimentary}} deposits at the site, the two Dreadnoughtus schrani specimens {{appear to}} have been buried quickly during a fluvial avulsion event, or break in a levee resulting in a flood. This event generated a liquefacted <b>crevasse</b> splay deposit which entombed the two dinosaurs. Thus, rapid and relatively deep burial of the Dreadnoughtus type specimen accounts for its extraordinary completeness. Numerous small theropod teeth found amongst the bones are likely evidence of scavenging, most likely by megaraptorans, perhaps Orkoraptor.|$|E
25|$|Vincendon and Henry, in the {{meantime}} were totally exhausted and frostbitten and waited in the <b>crevasse</b> to be rescued but the bad weather prevented a successful operation. Multiple attempts to save the climbers were made (including a helicopter sent to rescue the party but crashing on the glacier) but they all proved useless. Both climbers died of cold after 10 days exposure. The bodies were recovered only in March 1957. The events that marked this tragedy triggered changes in mountain rescue techniques and procedures in France.|$|E
25|$|By 2003 Lafaille {{had decided}} to try to climb all {{fourteen}} 8000-metre peaks; but unlike many of the mountaineers who take on this goal, he had no desire simply to climb them by well established routes, in large expeditions and with bottled oxygen. He preferred to continue trying to achieve new routes or solo ascents, or to climb in the more demanding winter season. In 2003 he climbed Nanga Parbat, Dhaulagiri (solo) and Broad Peak in a two-month period. The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a <b>crevasse</b> and then developed high altitude pulmonary edema. He was rescued by Ed Viesturs and Denis Urubko.|$|E

30|$|The image {{brightness}} {{is proportional}} to backscatter intensity: bright pixels correspond to rough glacial surface, whereas dark pixels indicate smooth surface. Rough glacial surface includes thinning of the top snow layer, sastrugi formation, <b>crevasses,</b> and scarps.
