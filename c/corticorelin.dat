40|$|Abstract. Background: <b>Corticorelin</b> acetate (CrA) is a {{synthetic}} form of corticotropin-releasing factor {{that is currently}} undergoing clinical trials {{in the treatment of}} peritumoral brain edema (PBE). This study preclinically investigated its potential as an antitumor agent against human brain tumor xenografts. Materials and Methods: The in vivo efficacy of CrA as a single agent and in combination with the antiangiogenic agent, bevacizumab, was examined in three different patient-derived human brain tumor xenografts implanted orthotopically (intracranially) or subcutaneously in athymic mice. Results: CrA significantly increased the lifespan of mice implanted orthotopically with two different pediatric brain tumor xenograft models. In one of these tumor models, the combination of CrA with bevacizumab produced a therapeutic outcome superior t...|$|E
40|$|The {{long-term}} treatment of peritumoral edema remains {{a major challenge}} in clinical neuro-oncology. Steroids have been and will remain the backbone of any anti-edematous therapy because of their striking activity, convenient oral administration and also because of their cost-effectiveness. Their side effects, however, can compromise quality of life, particularly upon continuous administration. Therapeutic alternatives which may replace or - at least - help to reduce the steroid dose are limited. However, {{with the development of}} new agents such as <b>corticorelin</b> acetate, there is a hope that steroid-induced side effects can be delayed and reduced. The administration of anti-angiogenic agents with steroid-sparing effects, for example, bevacizumab, is limited due to their costs. Increased knowledge on boswellic acids and cyclooxygenase- 2 inhibitors which are available for clinical application may help to exploit their anti-edema activity more efficiently in the future...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{quantification}} of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation in healthy volunteers by applying pharmacological function tests with distinct pharmacodynamic (PD) mechanisms. Its main objective is {{to contribute to the}} validation of different function tests for the two most well-characterized HPA axis activation routes. To realize this objective, different experiments were executed in which specific principles that have been proposed to optimize the reliability of pharmacological function tests were observed. Human corticotrophin-releasing hormone (<b>corticorelin</b> - hCRH) and the direct serotonin (5 -HT) precursor 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) were applied for the corticotrophinergic (CRH-mediated) route while the synthetic analogue of arginine-vasopresin (AVP) desmopressin (dDAVP) and the D 2 receptor antagonist metoclopramide were used for the vasopressinergic (AVP-mediated) pathway. Additionally, the application of these function tests was expected to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the respective contributions of the corticotrophinergic and vasopressinergic pathways to HPA axis activation in health. Finally, an extra dimension was added to the validation process by applying proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure changes in hypothalamic metabolites during pharmacological stimulation.

40|$|Landmark {{advances}} {{in the field of}} synthetic protein chemistry have enabled the preparation of complex, homogeneous proteins, including those that carry specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs). In addition, chemical synthesis will allow one to incorporate unnatural elements to generate new biologics with altered properties and functions. Native chemical ligation (NCL) is a milestone in the chemical synthesis of proteins (Kent et al., Science, 1994, 266, 776 - 779), in which a C-terminal peptide thioester and an N-terminal cysteine (Cys) -containing peptide-both in side-chain unprotected forms-are selectively coupled to generate a natural peptidic linkage at the site of ligation. This method requires a cysteine at the optimal convergent ligation site. However, Cys is one of the least abundant amino acids in natural proteins. Therefore, the development of new ligation methods at other amino acids will be necessary and important in this regard. Along these lines, our laboratory has developed a novel thiol-independent approach-serine/threonine ligation (STL). It uses the N-terminal serine or threonine of a peptide segment to chemoselectively react with another peptide segment with a C-terminal salicylaldehyde ester to form an N,O-benzylidene acetal linked product, followed by acidolysis to afford the final product at the natural Ser/Thr site. To extend the application of STL in chemical protein synthesis, we have developed a robust method for the preparation of peptide salicylaldehyde esters via Fmoc-based solid phase peptide synthesis. Furthermore, we have successfully applied this ligation method in the convergent synthesis of peptide drugs of significant therapeutic importance, including Teriparatide (Forteo), <b>Corticorelin</b> (oCRH), Exenatide (Byetta) and Tesamorelin (hGHRH). Of significance, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of our STL in the assembly of a more complex target of biological interest: human erythrocyte acylphosphatase (~ 11 kDa). In summary, we have developed a new serine/threonine ligation, which can be effectively used to synthesize peptides and proteins. As there are countless serine and threonine residues in natural proteins, particularly those carrying posttranslational modifications, this method is anticipated to offer new opportunities in synthetic protein chemistry and chemical biology. published_or_final_versionChemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
