Structural characterization of purified ECACYC molecules obtained from E. coli K- 12 revealed that they uniformly contained four trisaccharide repeat units, and they were substituted with from zero to four O-acetyl groups. <b>Cells</b> <b>from</b> <b>overnight</b> cultures contained approximately 2 g ECACYC per milligram (dry weight), and cell fractionation studies revealed that these molecules were localized exclusively in the periplasm. The synthesis and assembly of ECACYC were found to require the wzxE and wzyE genes of the wec gene cluster. These genes encode proteins involved in the transmembrane translo-cation of undecaprenylpyrophosphate-linked ECA trisaccharide repeat units and the polymerization of trisac-charide repeat units, respectively. Surprisingly, synthesis of ECACYC was dependent on the wzzE gene, which is required for the modulation of the polysaccharide chain lengths of phosphoglyceride-linked ECA (ECAPG). The presence of ECACYC in extracts of several other gram-negative enteric organisms was also demonstrated; however, it was not detected in cell extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These data suggest that in addition to ECAPG, ECACYC may be synthesized in many, if not all, members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) is a cell surfac...|$|R

40|$|Several amidated biologically active {{peptides}} such as pancreastatin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, pancreatic polypeptide and amylin {{are produced}} in endocrine pancreatic tissue which contains the enzyme necessary for their final processing, i. e. peptidylglycine alpha-amidating mono-oxygenase (EC 1. 14. 17. 3). The enzyme needs ascorbic acid for activity as well as copper and molecular oxygen. The present work shows that pancreatic islet <b>cells</b> prepared <b>from</b> <b>overnight</b> cultures of isolated islets from 5 - 7 -day-old rats accumulate 14 C-labelled ascorbic acid by a Na(+) -dependent active transport mechanism which involves a saturable process (estimated Km 17. 6 microM).

The uptake of dehydroascorbic acid was linearly dependent on concentration. Dehydroascorbic acid was converted to ascorbic acid by an unknown mechanism after uptake. The uptake of both ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid was inhibited by tri-iodothyronine, and uptake of ascorbic acid, but not of dehydroascorbic acid, was inhibited by glucocorticoids.

40|$|Background Bacterial habitats, such as {{soil and}} the gut, are {{structured}} at the micrometer scale. Important aspects of microbial life in such spatial ecosystems are migration and colonization. Here we explore the colonization of a structured ecosystem by two neutrally labeled strains of Escherichia coli. Using time-lapse microscopy we studied the colonization of one-dimensional arrays of habitat patches linked by connectors, which were invaded {{by the two}} E. coli strains from opposite sides. Results The two strains colonize a habitat from opposite sides {{by a series of}} traveling waves followed by an expansion front. When population waves collide, they branch into a continuing traveling wave, a reflected wave and a stationary population. When the two strains invade the landscape from opposite sides, they remain segregated in space and often one population will displace the other from most of the habitat. However, when the strains are co-cultured before entering the habitats, they colonize the habitat together and do not separate spatially. Using physically separated, but diffusionally coupled, habitats we show that colonization waves and expansion fronts interact trough diffusible molecules, and not by direct competition for space. Furthermore, we found that colonization outcome is influenced by a culture’s history, as the culture with the longest doubling time in bulk conditions tends to take over the largest fraction of the habitat. Finally, we observed that population distributions in parallel habitats located on the same device and inoculated with <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> the same <b>overnight</b> culture are significantly more similar to each other than to patterns in identical habitats located on different devices inoculated with <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> different <b>overnight</b> cultures, even tough all cultures were started from the same ? 80 °C frozen stock. Conclusions We found that the colonization of spatially structure habitats by two interacting populations can lead to the formation of complex, but reproducible, spatiotemporal patterns. Furthermore, we showed that chemical interactions between two populations cause them to remain spatially segregated while they compete for habitat space. Finally, we observed that growth properties in bulk conditions correlate with the outcome of habitat colonization. Together, our data show the crucial roles of chemical interactions between populations and a culture’s history in determining the outcome of habitat colonization.

40|$|Plasmids in {{conjunction}} with other mobile elements such as transposons are major players in the genetic adaptation of bacteria in response to changes in environment. Here we show that a large catabolic TOL plasmid, pWW 0, from Pseudomonas putida carries genes (rulAB genes) encoding an error-prone DNA polymerase Pol V homologue which increase the survival of bacteria under conditions of accumulation of DNA damage. A study of population dynamics in stationary phase revealed that the presence of pWW 0 -derived rulAB genes in the bacterial genome allows the expression of a strong growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) phenotype of P. putida. When rulAB-carrying <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> an 8 -day-old culture were mixed with Pol V-negative <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> a 1 -day-old culture, <b>cells</b> derived <b>from</b> the aged culture out-competed <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> the nonaged culture and overtook the whole culture. At the same time, bacteria from an aged culture lacking the rulAB genes were only partially able to out-compete <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> a fresh <b>overnight</b> culture of the parental P. putida strain. Thus, in addition to conferring resistance to DNA damage, the plasmid-encoded Pol V genes significantly increase the evolutionary fitness of bacteria during prolonged nutritional starvation of a P. putida population. The results of our study indicate that RecA is involved in the control of expression of the pWW 0 -encoded Pol V. In natural environments, bacteria are faced with many different types of stresses. Among them, nutritional stress is th...|$|R

Using inside-out patches, open-cells and outside-out patches, polymyxin B {{was found to}} block K+ ATP channels by, on average, approximately 90 - 95 of the initial control level of channel activity. The effects were rapid in onset, sustained and readily reversible. Similar effects were found in patches excised <b>from</b> <b>cells</b> pretreated <b>overnight</b> with 1 μM of the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

In patches bathed with internally applied ATP (0. 5 mM) and ADP (0. 5 mM), polymyxin B inhibited channels but its actions were not reversible upon removal of the compound. However, when the same protocol was undertaken upon cells pre-treated with PMA, the effects of polymyxin B were readily reversed. Our data suggests that polymyxin B is a novel modulator of K+ ATP channels, exhibiting multiple blocking actions that may possibly involve a direct effect upon the channel and indirect effects mediated through the inhibition of endogenous protein kinase(s). © 1994 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{dynamics}} during non-steady state {{conditions as}} feeding are complex. Such studies usually demand combinations of methods to give conclusive information, particularly on myofibrillar proteins with slow turnover. Therefore, time course transcript analyses were evaluated as possible means to monitor changes in myofibrillar biosynthesis in skeletal muscles in conditions with clinical nutrition; i. e. long term exposure of nutrients. Methods Muscle tissue <b>from</b> <b>overnight</b> intravenously fed surgical patients {{were used as}} a model combined with muscle tissue from starved and refed mice as well as cultured L 6 muscle cells. Transcripts of acta 1 (α-actin), mhc 2 A (myosin) and slc 38 a 2 /Snat 2 (amino acid transporter) were quantified (qPCR) as markers of muscle protein dynamics. Results Myosin heavy chain 2 A transcripts decreased significantly in skeletal muscle tissue <b>from</b> <b>overnight</b> parenterally fed patients but did not change significantly in orally refed mice. Alpha-actin transcripts did not change significantly in muscle <b>cells</b> <b>from</b> fed patients, mice or cultured L 6 cells during provision of AA. The AA transporter Snat 2 decreased in L 6 cells refed by all AA and by various combinations of AA but did not change during feeding in muscle tissue from patients or mice. Conclusion Our results confirm that muscle cells are sensitive to alterations in extracellular concentrations of AA for induction of protein synthesis and anabolism. However, transcripts of myofibrillar proteins and amino acid transporters showed complex alterations in response to feeding with provision of amino acids. Therefore, muscle tissue transcript levels of actin and myosin do not reflect protein accretion in skeletal muscles at feeding. </p...|$|R
