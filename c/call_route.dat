40|$|Our goal is {{to extract}} {{information}} from a telephone call in order to route the call to {{one of a number}} of destinations. We assume that we do not know "a priori" the vocabulary used in the application and so we use phonetic recognition followed by identification of salient phone sequences. In previous work, we showed that using a separate language model during recognition for each route gave improved performance over using a single model. However, this technique decodes each utterance in terms of the salient sequences of each <b>call</b> <b>route,</b> which leads to insertion and substitution errors that degrade performance. In this paper, we introduce the use of mixture language models for speech recognition in the context of <b>call</b> <b>route</b> classification. The benefit of technique can has the efficiency of multiple language models to get accurate recognition on salient phoneme sequences; on the other hand, it can give help in classification, even if the size of some call routes have just 50 ~ 60 utterances. It avoids building HMMs for some salient phoneme sequences to decide whether it is correct of occurring in the utterance...|$|E
40|$|Route {{suggestion}} {{is an important}} feature of GPS navigation systems. Recently, Microsoft T-drive has been enabled to suggest routes chosen by experienced taxi drivers for given source/destination pairs in given time periods, which often take less time than the routes calculated according to distance. However, in real environments, taxi drivers may use different routes to reach the same destination, which we <b>call</b> <b>route</b> diversity. In this paper we first propose a trajectory visualization method that examines the regions where the diversity exists and then develop several novel visualization techniques to display the high dimensional attributes and statistics associated with different routes to help users analyze diversity patterns. Our techniques have been applied to the real trajectory data of thousands of taxis and some interesting findings about route diversity have been obtained. We further demonstrate that our system can be used not only to suggest better routes for drivers but also to analyze traffic bottlenecks for transportation management. © 2011 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|In {{unstructured}} peer-to-peer networks, such as Gnutella, peers propagate query messages {{towards the}} resource holders by flooding {{them through the}} network.

In this way, a query is forwarded only to a subset of the neighbors of a peer, or it is dropped if no neighbor, likely to reply, is found. The scheme also has mechanisms to cope with variations in user submitted queries, like changes in the keywords. The scheme can also evaluate the route for a query for which it is not trained.

We discuss the problems of mobile billing, refer to related work in micropayment technology, and outline the design goals of the protocol before presenting the details of our solution. 1 Billing in Mobile Networks In the fixed network a call detail record (CDR) or toll ticket is created for each call. This typically contains details about the call source, destination, duration and route. The CDRs are forwarded to a central database where periodically prices are applied to generate a customer’s bill. Basic CDR billing has been extended to mobile networks where authentication with a home location register (HLR) is used to identify the call source. I...|$|E

40|$|As mobile {{communications}} {{become increasingly}} sophisticated and ubiquitous, traditional mobile billing with its implicit trust relationships {{will no longer}} be adequate. With a large number of different sized mobile networks, a huge variety of value added service providers and many millions of roaming users, it is desirable to remove any unnecessary trust in order to increase security and provide incontestable charging. Billing allows each party involved in a call to eventually receive a share of the revenue generated. An examination of network billing techniques reveals a number of critical shortcomings and emerging problems. We address these issues by designing a multi-party electronic payment scheme that allows all parties involved in a call to be paid in real-time. The mobile user releases an ongoing stream of low-valued micropayment tokens into the network in exchange for the requested services. Dynamic pricing is supported by the association of a pricing contract with the call which specifies the cost of each leg of the <b>call</b> <b>route.</b> Any user with a mobile device and monetary value can use and pay for network access and services in any mobile network into which they roam. We eliminate the need to authenticate the user or contact a distant home network for billing purposes. Extensions to the basic scheme provide mobile wallet functionality and allow user-to-user payments. In addition solutions are designed to cope with frequent handovers between independent picocells, to aggregate several payment streams into one in the core network, and to inter-work with networks using legacy billing techniques. A detailed survey of micropayment techniques forms part of the design process and a number of new micropayment contributions result from observations made. In order to chose appropriate techniques for payment a performance comparison of micropayment schemes is presented based on benchmark measurements taken for the underlying cryptographic algorithms. The multi-party micropayment protocol is prototyped in a wireless environment where it is used to pay for user traffic from existing Internet applications. The proposed scheme has the potential to revolutionise mobile communications by allowing the emergence of many independent inexpensive high-speed picocell networks and by allowing any network entity to sell value added services. Mobile users will be able to select the most appropriate access network and services wherever they roam, paying all parties for resources as they are provided...|$|E
40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with research for the analysis and modeling of interconnection costs in telecommunications based on {{a case study of}} Tanzania. The research formed the basis for recommending the review of the current interconnection charges. Chapter 1 of the thesis started to introduce the United States of America's (USA) Reform Act of 1996,which was the first Act in the world that liberalised the telecommunications markets and opened them up to competition in the USA. The competition brought up interconnection of telecommunications networks and associated costs, which is the focus of the research. Chapter 2 provided for the design and architecture of the interconnection of telecommunications networks m the liberalized and competitive telecommunications markets in terms of types of interconnection models, interconnection components, types of services, interconnection costs and <b>call</b> <b>route</b> types and factors. In chapter 3 the thesis presented the telecommunications development in Tanzania from 1888 to date covering the period of the monopoly era where there was no interconnection of the telecommunications networks and the post-monopoly era where there is interconnection of the telecommunications networks. The chapter also presented the growth of the mobile networks over time in terms of number of mobile phones and mobile density. Chapter 4 discussed charging principles, call routing and operations of the international roaming and non-international roaming services referred to as the One Network concept, which was launched simultaneously in East Africa (Tanzania, Kenyaand Uganda) by the Zain GSM mobile network operator {{for the first time in}} the world on 26 th September, 2006. Review of the existing generic interconnection cost models developed by the British Telecommunications Company Limited and Europe Economics' Consulting Firm was presented in Chapter 5. The review formed the basis for collecting data from Tanzania. Chapter 6 presented the analysis of the data collected from Tanzania. The analysis revealed that the interconnection costs per minute for the five competitive telecommunications network operators for 2007 - 2009 were far below the interconnection charges per minute set by the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority for the same period. Chapter 7 concluded that the interconnection charges per minute for the telecommunications industry in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009 have been set over and above the interconnection costs per minute obtained from the analysis of the collected data. The research reviewed the existing generic interconnection cost models mentioned above and identified the interconnection cost estimation methods. The research then collected audited operators' accounts and traffic throughput in minutes from the five competitive telecommunications network operators in Tanzania for 2007 - 2009. It analysed the data and gave results, which showed a big percentage difference of an average of at least 300 % between the interconnection costs obtained from the analysis of the collected data and the interconnection charges set by the Regulator. The research results have justified insufficient interconnection regulations currently used by the Regulator in Tanzania. Hence, the need for the objective and accurate interconnection cost estimation methodology for setting up the cost based interconnection charges have been confirmed by this research.
