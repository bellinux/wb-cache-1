I heard that you passed through here (at the sordid inn where I first alighted) the very day before I arrived in these parts. We had a very pleasant set here; at first the Jerseys, Melbournes [3], <b>Cowpers</b> [4], and Hollands, but all gone; and the only persons I know are the Rawdons [5] and Oxfords [6], with some later acquaintances of less brilliant descent.|$|E

5000|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} by Messrs. Fox, Henderson & Co. and designed by Edward Alfred Cowper of that firm, {{who had previously}} worked {{on the design of}} The Crystal Palace. When completed, it had the largest arched single-span iron and glass roof in the world, spanning a width of 211 ft and being 840 ft long. It held this title for 14 years until St Pancras station opened in 1868. It was originally intended to have three spans, supported by columns, however it was soon realised that the supporting columns would severely restrict the workings of the railway. <b>Cowpers</b> single-span design, was therefore adopted, even though it was some 62 feet (19 metres) wider than the widest roof span at that time. [...] George Gilbert Scott praised <b>Cowpers</b> roof at New Street, stating “An iron roof in its most normal condition is too spider-like a structure to be handsome, but with a very little attention this defect is obviated. The most wonderful specimen, probably, is that at the great Birmingham Station [...] [...] [...] ” When first opened, New Street was described as the [...] "Grand Central Station at Birmingham".|$|E

A subsequent 1841 survey proposed a slightly different alignment, crossing over Tingalpa Creek only once.|$|E

In 1862 Drayson met Georgina Cowper through Andrews. In 1864 Drayson and Andrews assisted the medium Mrs. Mary Marshall at a séance attended by John Ruskin. It was held at the home of Mrs Makdougal Gregory, widow of William Gregory. More than one séance at this time involved Drayson and Ruskin; at the first, the homeopath John Rutherford Russell was also present. Drayson in May 1864 saw Ruskin and the <b>Cowpers</b> socially.

5000|$|In {{a letter}} Robert Burns wrote,Is not The Task a glorious poem? The {{religion}} of The Task, bating a few scraps of Calvinistic divinity, is {{the religion of}} God and Nature: the religion that exalts, that ennobles man.He {{is said to have}} loved the poem enough to have habitually walked about with a copy in his pocket. [...] The poem is extensively quoted in the novels of Jane Austen, and has been seen as deeply influential on her. The conversational diction of the Lake Poets works can be seen as stemming directly from The Task. Certainly the young Coleridge wrote of <b>Cowpers</b> [...] "divine Chit chat", and in later years praised The Tasks [...] "chastity of diction" [...] and [...] "harmony of blank verse". In a 1796 letter Charles Lamb testified to Coleridges thorough relish for Cowper, and on his own account wrote of Cowper as an old favourite and of [...] "reading the Task with fresh delight". Wordsworth borrowed a copy while still a schoolboy, and the poems influence on his Tintern Abbey and The Prelude is widely recognised.|$|E
5000|$|William <b>Cowpers</b> too partial {{assessment}} of Bournes poetry, {{in a letter}} to the Reverend John Newton dated 10 May 1781, frequently prefaced the various editions of his work. [...] "I love the memory of Vinny Bourne. I think him a better Latin poet than Tibullus, Propertius, Ausonius, or any of the writers in his way except Ovid, and not at all inferior to him." [...] Charles Lamb was also an admirer and translated eight more of his poems. In an enthusiastic letter to William Wordsworth, written in 1815, he summed up Bournes poetical approach as [...] "sucking from every flower, making a flower of everything! His diction all Latin, and his thoughts all English!" [...] The charm of Bournes poems lies not so much in the elegance of his Latinity as in the breadth and humour of his subject matter. He had quick sympathy for his fellow-men, and loving tenderness towards all animals. His epitaphs are models of simplicity and grace. A later critic commented on his epigrammatic style that [...] "his natural taste brought to that form an almost lyrical delicacy of touch which makes his vignettes of contemporary life a new genre … In Bourne it is the exact and sympathetic observation of the particular contemporary scene which charms us. His work shows the final and complete emancipation of the eighteenth-century Latin poet from the theory of imitating the classics which had dominated the Renaissance." ...|$|E

The morphology of the reproductive tract of the species was generally {{similar to that of}} other molossids, however, the absence of <b>Cowpers</b> glands was unusual. Spermatogenesis began in February and spermatozoa were released to the cauda epididymis during August and September. Follicular development started in March and culminated with the appearance of Graafian follicles in July. Ovulation probably occurred in August and specimens were pregnant by September. Gestation length was estimated to be four to five months and a single young was born in December. The data suggest that T. aegyptiaca is monotocous and monoestrous. ...|$|E
