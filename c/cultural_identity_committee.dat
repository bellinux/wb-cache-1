Despite widespread use {{of the past in}} the construction of ethnic, national and European <b>identity,</b> theories of <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> have been neglected in archaeology. Focusing on the interrelationships between concepts of <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> today and the interpretation of past <b>cultural</b> groups, <b>Cultural</b> <b>Identity</b> and Archaeology offers proactive archaeological perspectives in the debate surrounding European identities.

Finally, it looks at archaeological evidence for the construction of <b>cultural</b> <b>identities</b> in the European past.

40|$|The Republic of Buryatia in the Russian Federation is {{resident}} to the Buryats, {{an ethnic}} minority. A {{large part of}} the population practice Buddhism. The thesis investigates how religion and language can explain the construction of Buryat <b>cultural</b> <b>identity.</b> Most scholarly research emphasise on the importance of religion for the construction of Buryat <b>cultural</b> <b>identity.</b> However, their arguments are not fully explaining why this is the case. Therefore, Stuart Hall’s theory of <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> is applied to the case of Buryatia. The theory contains two models: one expresses that <b>cultural</b> <b>identity</b> is ‘fixed’ and the other claims that it is a ‘process’. These two models are applied using Buryat historical contexts. The thesis concludes that both language and religion are important to the construction of Buryat identity. Language is important because it functions as a system of representation, for it creates and ascribes ‘meaning’ in the cultural ‘space’.

Hence, the language of religion is important for the construction and maintenance of Buryat <b>cultural</b> <b>identity...</b>|$|R
