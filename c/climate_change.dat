5|$|<b>Climate</b> <b>Change</b> Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for <b>climate</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

After the publication of <b>Climate</b> <b>Change</b> Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, <b>Climate</b> <b>Change</b> Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

40|$|Quantifying {{the impacts}} of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> and human {{activities}} on runoff has received extensive attention, especially for the regions with significant elevation difference. The contributions of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> and human activities to runoff were analyzed using rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, slope variation, and water balance method during 1961 – 2010 at the Jinsha River basin, China. Results indicate that runoff at upstream and runoff at midstream are both dominated by <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> and the contributions of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> to runoff are 63 %~ 72 % and 53 %~ 68 %, respectively. At downstream, <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> account for only 13 %~ 18 %, and runoff is mainly controlled by human activities, contributing 82 %~ 87 %. The availability and stability of results were compared and analyzed in the four methods. Results in slope variation, double mass curve, and water balance method except rainfall-runoff relationship method are of good agreement. And the rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, and slope variation method are all of great stability.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} acknowledged that land use <b>changes</b> (LUC) and <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> have exerted significant effects on ecosystem services which are essential and vital to human well-being.

In this study, we firstly introduced research efforts in which the drivers of and their corresponding effects on climate regulation services are briefly identified.

40|$|Abstract—Temperature, {{humidity}} and precipitation in an area, are parameters proved {{influential in the}} climate of that area, and one should recognize them {{so that he can}} determine the climate of that area. <b>Climate</b> <b>changes</b> are of primary importance in climatology, and in recent years, have been of great concern to researchers and even politicians and organizations, for they can {{play an important role in}} social, political and economic activities. Even though the real cause of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> or their stability is not yet fully recognized, they are a matter of concern to researchers and their importance for countries has prompted them to investigate <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> in different levels, especially in regional, national and continental level. This issue has less been investigated in our country. However, in recent years, there have been some researches and conferences on <b>climate</b> <b>changes.</b> This study is also in line with such researches and tries to investigate and analyze the trends of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> (temperature and precipitation) in Sefid-roud (the name of a river) basin. Three parameters of mean annual precipitation, temperature, and maximum and minimum temperatures in 36 synoptic and climatology stations in a statistical period of 49 years (1956 - 2005) in the stations of Sefid-roud basin were analyzed by Mann-Kendall test. The results obtained by data analysis show that <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> are short term and have a trend. The analysis of mean temperature revealed that changes have a significantly rising trend, besides the precipitation has a significantly falling trend.

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> (mitigation of <b>climate</b> <b>change),</b> or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future <b>climate</b> <b>change</b> (see also economics of global warming).|$|E
