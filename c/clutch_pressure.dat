5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a wrist pin bore raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|E

The home market Royal Tiger also lacked the air-servo assistance to the clutch or gearchange that the OPSU had and as a result <b>clutch</b> <b>pressures</b> were heavy and gear-lever throws were rather long, un-assisted steering was hard to move at low road-speeds, interviews with drivers of the Royal Tiger show they regarded the type as hard work to drive, but rewarding.

Barton Transport who had solely taken Leyland for all its full size bus and coach needs since the end of World War II bought five Leyland Royal Tigers with Burlingham bodies for its ‘Coach Cruise’ fleet in 1951 but the poor fuel consumption saw them sold three years later by which time Leyland's major rival AEC were getting their first orders from Barton since one Regal coach in the mid-1930s. However (see rebodies above) some operators found the near indestructible build of the Royal Tiger an asset and OK Motor Services of Bishop Auckland had a Plaxton rebodied Royal Tiger on regular service well into the 1980s.|$|R

40|$|Large civil tiltrotors {{have been}} {{identified}} to replace regional airliners over medium ranges to alleviate next-generation air traffic. Variable rotor speed for these vehicles is required for efficient high-speed operation. Two-speed drive system research has been performed to support these advanced rotorcraft applications. Experimental tests were performed on two promising two-speed transmission configurations. The offset compound gear (OCG) transmission and the dual star/idler (DSI) planetary transmission were tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center variable-speed transmission test facility. Both configurations were inline devices with concentric {{input and output shafts}} and designed to provide 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 output speed reduction ratios. Both were designed for 200 hp and 15, 000 rpm input speed and had a dry shift clutch configuration. Shift tests were performed on the transmissions at input speeds of 5, 000, 8, 000, 10, 000, 12, 500, and 15, 000 rpm. Both the OCG and DSI configurations successfully perform speed shifts at full rated 15, 000 rpm input speed. The transient shifting behavior of the OCG and DSI configurations were very similar. The shift clutch had more of an effect on shifting dynamics than the reduction gearing configuration itself since the same shift clutch was used in both configurations. For both OCG and DSI configurations, low-to-high speed shifts were limited in applied torque levels in order to prevent overloads on the transmission due to transient torque spikes. It is believed that the relative lack of appreciable slippage of the dry shifting clutch at operating conditions and pressure profiles tested was a major cause of the transient torque spikes. For the low-to-high speed shifts, the output speed ramp-up time slightly decreased and the peak out torque slightly increased as the <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> ramp-down rate increased. This was caused by slightly less clutch slippage as the <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> ramp-down rate increased...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} {{is probably the}} drivetrain component with {{the greatest impact on}} driveability of an automatic transmission equipped vehicle. Since the driver only has an indirect influence on the gear shift timing, except for situations like kick-down accelerations, it is desirable to improve shift quality as perceived by the driver. However, improving shift quality is a problem normally diametrically opposed to minimizing transmission clutch energy dissipation. The latter has a great impact on transmission lifetime, and has to be defined and taken into consideration along with the notion of shift quality. The main focus of this thesis is the modeling of a drivetrain of an automatic transmission vehicle, and the implementation in MatLab/Simulink, including the first to second gear upshift. The resulting plant based on the derived equations is validated using data from a test vehicle equipped with a torque sensor located at the transmission output shaft. The shaft torque is more or less proportional to the driveline jerk, and hence of great interest for control purposes. Control strategies are discussed and a PID controller structure is developed to control the first to second gear upshift, as opposed to the traditional open-loop upshift control. Furthermore, the proposed controller structure uses the transmission output torque and the differential speed of the engaging clutch as inputs, to control the <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> and the engine output torque, respectively. The structure is unsophisticated and transparent compared to other approaches, but shows great theoretical results in terms of improved shift quality and decreased clutch wear...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{integrated}} powertrain control for gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions is developed. First, a detailed model of an automotive powertrain featuring a twin clutch transmission is developed in Matlab/Simulink®. This model includes detailed friction {{models for the}} twin clutch that enable {{an investigation into the}} effects of different friction materials on the performance of the gearshift controller. The transmission model also includes detailed models of the synchronisers and thus allows a simulation of synchroniser-to-synchroniser shifts. A simplified phenomenological model, derived from a more complex non-linear model, is employed to model the hydraulic actuation of clutches and synchroniser. The thesis finds that the dependency of the friction coefficient on the sliding speed has an important influence on the gearshift quality and the performance of gearshift controller, while the absolute level of the friction coefficient is less important. Based on this powertrain model the key problems of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions were identified and a control that overcomes these problems was developed. The first stage was to devise a gearshift control algorithm that handles single clutch-to-clutch shifts without a oneway (freewheeler-, overrunning-) clutch. This basic gearshift control algorithm featured a control of clutch slip for the engine torque transfer and a control of engine speed through engine torque manipulation (plus <b>clutch</b> <b>pressure</b> manipulation for downshifts). In a second stage, an optional transmission output torque control was developed that could be integrated in the basic control. The thesis shows that these control strategies are superior, in terms of shift quality, to conventional gearshift controls as used on planetary-type transmissions and are also robust against variations in the powertrain parameters (including friction coefficient) and sensor noise. The control strategies developed for single clutch-to-clutch shifts were extended to handle double and other multiple gearshifts that take place in the same transmission half. The thesis also investigates the other main part of gearshifts on twin clutch transmissions, the gear pre-selection. The thesis shows that, on power-on gearshifts, the torque reactions at the transmission output due to the gear pre-selection with conventional hydraulically actuated synchronisers can be effectively compensated for by a simple manipulation of engine torque.

Design and Method An empirical phenomenological research design was adopted to address the research aims. Purposefully selected participants completed phenomenological interviews, which explored in detail their experiences of choking and <b>clutch</b> performance under <b>pressure.</b> The sample consisted of 9 elite athletes (6 male and 3 female) (Mage = 27. 14; SD = 5. 27) from a range of sports (netball, rugby union, golf, tennis, and cricket).

Conversely, acquisitive-agentic self-presentation motives, and self-presentation efficacy were experienced before and during clutch performances. However, alongside self-presentation, other psychological constructs also preceded and accompanied the choking experience (e. g., unfamiliarity and perceived control).

In off-road heavy-duty vehicles, along with fuel efficiency start-up functionality at extended ambient conditions, such as low temperature and intake absolute pressure are crucial. Off-road vehicle manufacturers can overcome the parasitic loads in these conditions by oversizing the engine. Caterpillar Inc. as the pioneer in off-road technology has developed a novel clutch design to allow for engine downsizing while vehicle’s performance is not affected. The tribological behaviour of the clutch will be crucial to start engagement promptly and reach the maximum clutch capacity in the shortest possible time and smoothest way in terms of dynamics. A multi-body dynamics model of the clutch system is developed in MSC ADAMS. The flywheel is introducing the same speed and torque as the engine (represents the engine input to the <b>clutch).</b> The hydraulic <b>pressure</b> is applied behind the piston to initiate the engagement.
