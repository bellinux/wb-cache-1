5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked {{toward the open}} Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered toward the northwest and entered the ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure <b>center.</b> <b>Around</b> midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
5|$|The May Revolution was not {{the product}} of the actions of a single {{political}} party with a clear and defined agenda, but a convergence of sectors with varying interests.

5|$|The studio {{initially}} {{imagined that}} the film would <b>center</b> <b>around</b> a clone of the character Newt from Aliens, as the Ellen Ripley character had died {{at the end of}} Alien 3. Whedon composed a thirty-page treatment surrounding this idea before being informed that the studio, though impressed with his script, now intended to base the story on a clone of Ripley, whom they saw as the anchor of the series. Whedon had to rewrite the script {{in a way that would}} bring back the Ripley character, a task he found difficult. The idea of cloning was suggested by producers David Giler and Walter Hill, who opposed the production of Alien Resurrection, as they thought it would ruin the franchise.|$|E

5|$|To {{counter the}} Austrians, the French fielded {{an even larger}} array of forces. From Frankfurt am Main, Pierre Augereau and 16,000 troops {{threatened}} Simbschen's northern wing. Moreau controlled 107,000 of the main army, deployed in four wings. Bruneteau de Saint-Suzanne's 24,000-strong detached force occupied the north bank of the Danube near Ingolstadt, Grenier's 24,000-man Left Wing deployed {{on the west bank}} of the Isar River near Landshut. Moreau massed the 36,000 soldiers of the <b>Center</b> <b>around</b> Munich under his personal control. The Right Wing of Lecourbe defended the line of the upper Lech River farther west.

5|$|Tropical Storm Abby was an {{exceptionally}} small tropical cyclone that had minor effects across Southeast Texas in early August 1964. Forming as a tropical depression {{out of a}} trough south of Louisiana on August5, the system moved generally westward. It was not until August7 that the system began to organize. That day, an eye rapidly formed within the system {{and it became a}} tropical storm just 60mi (95km) southeast of Galveston, Texas. Soon thereafter, a weather reconnaissance plane reported a barometric pressure of 1000mbar (hPa; 29.53inHg) at the storm's <b>center.</b> <b>Around</b> 18:00UTC (1:00p.m. CDT), the newly named Abby attained peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). It subsequently made landfall near Matagorda, Texas four hours later. Once onshore gradual weakening ensued, though a brief period of re-organization delayed its dissipation. Abby degenerated into an area of showers on August8 southwest of San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
5|$|The Strawberry Panic! manga, {{written by}} Sakurako Kimino and {{illustrated}} by Namuchi Takumi, was serialized in Dengeki G's Magazine between September 30, 2005 and February 28, 2007 with a new chapter released once a month. Two bound volumes {{have been published in}} Japan under MediaWorks' Dengeki Comics label. The first went on sale on March 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Shizuma on the cover, and the second volume came out on October 27, 2006 featuring Nagisa and Tamao on the cover. While the manga's story is unfinished, Strawberry Panic! has not made an appearance in Dengeki G's Magazine since the publication of the April 2007 issue on February 28, 2007. Major differences between the anime and manga <b>center</b> <b>around</b> the plot and character interaction. Characters have vastly different character designs, such as Shion Tōmori and Kaname Kenjō. The manga introduces the Etoile election early on while the anime waits until {{the latter part of the}} series for dramatic effect. The first volume was released in English on December 23, 2007, the second in March 2008, and the omnibus with two additional chapters in October 2010, published by Seven Seas Entertainment.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the RSMC Nadi upgraded Tropical Depression 04F to {{a tropical}} cyclone {{and gave it}} the name Tam, making it the first named storm of the 2005–06 season. Several hours later, the storm passed close to Niuafo'ou with winds of 65km/h (40mph). By 0000UTC on January13, the JTWC classified Tam as Tropical Cyclone 06P. Although the storm was tracking towards an area with stronger winds aloft, it was forecast to intensify. Due to the relatively fast movement of the storm, the increasing winds aloft {{had little effect on}} the storm, allowing it to intensify and attain winds of 85km/h (50mph) around 0600UTC. However, with both wind shear and the forward motion of the storm continuing to increase, convection rapidly became dislocated from the <b>center.</b> <b>Around</b> 0000UTC on January14, Tam entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Wellington, New Zealand. With forward movement estimated at 75km/h (45mph) almost due south, the cyclone reached an unusually high latitude as a tropical cyclone. Coinciding with the time when Tam reached 33°S, it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of the storm persisted for several hours before dissipating early on January15.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also began}} to merge with a {{low-level}} frontal boundary associated with the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Zita. The strong shear left the center of circulation partially exposed, with deep convection persisting in only the southeastern quadrant. In addition to the shear, dry air began to enter the system, causing it to weaken further. While continuing to move at a quick pace, the storm began to turn towards the southeast along a baroclinic zone. Early on January26, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the cyclone as it lost most of its tropical characteristics. Arthur re-intensified shortly after and the JTWC reissued advisories on the storm around 2100UTC. The brief re-strengthening {{was the result of}} a breakdown in the baroclinic zone which allowed convection to redevelop around the <b>center.</b> <b>Around</b> the same time, Arthur left RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility (AoR) and entered the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre Wellington's AoR. The storm completed its extratropical transition around 1200UTC on January27, leading to the final advisory being issued on the storm.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm tracked east-southeastward {{and continued}} to organize, and by late on April 20 an upper-level warm core was present over the system. Based on its organization, Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000UTC on April 21. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Ana attained a peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), {{which was based on}} estimates from the Hebert-Poteat technique and data from QuikSCAT. Shortly thereafter, it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda, when it passed about 130miles (210km) southwest of the island. Operationally, the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane <b>Center</b> <b>around</b> this time, when it was considered a subtropical cyclone. Strong upper-level wind shear removed much of the convection, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center. The storm became completely separated from the upper-level system, and the cyclone re-organized, developing an eye feature late on April 21. Embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north, Ana continued eastward, and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center. Convection waxed and waned throughout the day, and by April 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization. After turning to the northeast, the circulation center merged with an approaching cold front on April 24, and Tropical Storm Ana completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on April 27 southeast of the Azores.|$|E
