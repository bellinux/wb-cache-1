5000|$|The Aethalometer {{principle}} {{is based upon}} the continuous filter-tape sampler developed in the 1950s for the measurement of <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>haze.</b> This instrument drew the sample air stream through a filter tape spot for a fixed time duration (usually 1 or 2 hours). The tape was advanced and its gray coloration measured optically by either transmittance or reflectance. However, the data units were arbitrary, and were not interpreted in terms of a mass concentration of a defined material in the air stream until retrospective studies linked the ‘COH unit’ to quantitative analyses of atmospheric trace constituents.Work in the 1970s at Tihomir Novakov's lab at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory established the quantitative relationship between the optical attenuation of a deposit of particles on a fibrous filter, and the carbon content of that deposit. [...] Improvements in optical and electronic technology permitted the measurement of very small increases in attenuation, such as would occur during the passage of typical ambient air through a filter on a 5- or 10-minute timebase. The development of personal computers and analog-digital interfaces permitted the real-time calculation of data, and mathematical conversion of the signals to a concentration of black carbon expressed in units of nanograms or micrograms of Black Carbon per cubic meter of air.|$|E

40|$|We have derived ambient {{black carbon}} (BC) {{concentrations}} and estimated emission factors for on-road diesel vehicles from archived <b>Coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>Haze</b> (COH) data that was routinely collected beginning in 1967 at 11 {{locations in the}} San Francisco Bay Area. COH values are {{a measure of the}} attenuation of light by particles collected on a white filter, and available data indicate they are proportional to BC concentrations measured using the conventional aethalometer. Monthly averaged BC concentrations are up to five times greater in winter than summer, and, consequently, so is the population?s exposure to BC. The seasonal cycle in BC concentrations is similar for all Bay Area sites, most likely due to area-wide decreased pollutant dispersion during wintertime. A strong weekly cycle is also evident, with weekend concentrations significantly lower than weekday concentrations, consistent with decreased diesel traffic volume on weekends. The weekly cycle suggests that, in the Bay Area, diesel vehicle emissions are the dominant source of BC aerosol. Despite the continuous increase in diesel fuel consumption in California, annual Bay Area average BC concentrations decreased by a factor of ~;; 3 from the late 1960 s to the early 2000 s. Based on estimated annual BC concentrations, on-road diesel fuel consumption, and recent measurements of on-road diesel vehicle BC emissions, diesel BC emission factors decreased by an order of magnitude over the study period. Reductions in the BC emission factor reflect improved engine technology, emission controls and changes in diesel fuel composition.

Questions have also arisen concerning the representativeness of surface observations <b>of</b> Arctic <b>Haze.</b> Due to the strongly stratified nature of the Arctic troposphere, the mechanisms which transport aerosol to the surface from the transport altitudes of the lower troposphere are not obvious. In order to examine these questions, a Mie scattering lidar was installed at Alert, NWT, Canada. Lidar observes atmospheric aerosols and hydrymeteors as they appear in nature, unmodified by sampling effects. As such the results obtained are more realistic of the light scattering characteristics of the in situ aerosol than are those obtained by integrating nephelometers, for example, which heat the aerosol and dry it before measurement.

We calculated relative risk (RR) estimates using both time-series and case-crossover methods after controlling for appropriate confounders (temperature, humidity, and change in barometric pressure). The results of both analyses were consistent. We found associations between NO 2, SO 2, CO, COH, or PM 10 and daily hospital admission of respiratory diseases especially among females. For females 0 – 14 years of age, there was 1 -day delayed effect of NO 2 (RR = 1. 19, case-crossover method), a current-day SO 2 (RR = 1. 11, time series), and current-day and 1 - and 2 -day delayed effects for CO by case crossover (RR = 1. 15, 1. 19, 1. 22, respectively).

This investigation examined {{whether there was a}} relationship between ambient air pollution in Santa Clara County, California and emergency room visits for asthma during the winters of 1988 - 1989 through 1991 - 1992. Emergency room (ER) records from three acute-care hospitals were abstracted to compile daily visits for asthma and a control diagnosis (gastroenteritis) for 3 -month periods during each winter. Air monitoring data included daily <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> (COH) and every-other-day particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 microns (PM 10, 24 -hr average), as well as hourly nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations. Daily COH measurements were used to predict values for missing days of PM 10 to develop a complete PM 10 time series. Daily data were also obtained for temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. In time-series analyses using Poisson regression, consistent relationships were found between ER visits for asthma and PM 10. Same-day nitrogen dioxide concentrations were also associated with asthma ER visits, while ozone was not. Because there was a significant interaction between PM 10 and minimum temperature in this data set, estimates of relative risks (RRs) for PM 10 -associated asthma ER visits were temperature-dependent. A 60 micrograms/m 3 change in PM 10 (2 -day lag) corresponded to RRs of 1. 43 (95 % CI = 1. 18 - 1. 69) at 20 degrees F, representing {{the low end of the}} temperature distribution, 1. 27 (95 % CI = 1. 13 - 1. 42) at 30 degrees F, and 1. 11 (95 % CI = 1. 03 - 1. 19) at 41 degrees F, the mean of the observed minimum temperature. ER visits for gastroenteritis were not significantly associated with any pollutant variable. Several sensitivity analyses, including the use of robust regressions and of nonparametric methods for fitting time trends and temperature effects in the data, supported these findings.

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between the number of}} daily hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses and ambient air pollution in Montreal, Canada, was investigated for cold and warm periods between 1983 and 1988. The comprehensive hospital discharge database of the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services was used to derive daily counts of hospital admissions for respiratory illnesses, and for certain non-respiratory illnesses not expected to be related to air pollution levels. The reliability of this database was assessed by reviewing 1, 270 hospital discharges. Routinely monitored independent variables, derived from various government databases, included temperature, relative humidity, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>haze,</b> and measures of particulate pollution, several of which were recorded only every sixth day. To permit a daily time series analysis, levels for the missing 5 days were modelled using meteorologic and other pollutant variables. To control for confounding by season, the dependent and independent time series were detrended using a weighted 19 -day moving average linear filter. To control for confounding by day-of-week cycles, the dependent series were pre-filtered with day-of-week indicator variables. For the July to August periods, statistically significant relationships were shown for all respiratory admissions to 8 -hour maximal average ozone levels 4 days prior to the admission day, relationships which were however confounded by temperature of the same lag day. After controlling for temperature, admissions for asthma, and for respiratory illnesses other than asthma, were significantly associated with particulate levels 2 to 4 days prior to the admission day for the warm but not the cold periods. Stronger associations were found using a filter which did not remove month-to-month temporal trends. A significant correlation of non respiratory admissions to particulate levels on the day of admission was confounded by temperature and relative humidity. These results suggest that particulate air pollution, possibly acidic, during photochemically active periods is related to respiratory morbidity in Montreal. The effects shown, at levels mostly below current ambient air quality standards in North America, are relevant to public health, since hospital admissions are likely to reflect more frequent episodes of less serious illness...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to identify subgroups {{of the population}} susceptible {{to the effects of}} ambient air particles. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, provided daily mean levels of various measures of particulates and gaseous pollutants. Total sulfates were also measured daily (1986 - 1993) at a monitoring station 150 km southeast of the city (Sutton, Quebec, Canada). We used <b>coefficient</b> <b>of</b> <b>haze</b> (COH), extinction coefficient, and Sutton sulfates to predict fine particles and sulfates from a fine particles model for days that were missing. We used the universal Quebec medicare system to obtain billings and prescriptions for each Montreal resident who died in the city from 1984 to 1993. These data were then used to define cardiovascular and respiratory conditions that subjects had before death. Using standard Poisson regression time-series analyses, we estimated the association between daily nonaccidental mortality and daily concentrations of particles in the ambient air among persons with cardiovascular and respiratory conditions diagnosed before death. We found no persuasive evidence that daily mortality increased when ambient air particles were elevated for subgroups of persons with chronic upper respiratory diseases, airways disease, cerebrovascular diseases, acute coronary artery disease, and hypertension. However, we found that daily mortality increased linearly as concentrations of particles increased for persons who had acute lower respiratory diseases, chronic coronary artery diseases (especially in the elderly), and congestive heart failure. For this latter set of conditions, the mean percent increase in daily mortality (MPC) for an increase in the COH across its interquartile range (18. 5 COH units per 327. 8 linear meters), averaged over the day of death and the 2 preceding days, was MPC = 5. 09 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 47 - 7. 79 %], MPC = 2. 62 (95 % CI 0. 53 - 4. 75 %), and MPC = 4. 99 (95 % CI 2. 44 - 7. 60 %), respectively. Adjustments for gaseous pollutants generally attenuated these associations, although the general pattern of increased daily mortality remained. In addition, there appeared to be a stronger association in the summer season. The positive associations found for persons who had acute lower respiratory diseases and congestive heart failure are consistent with some prevailing hypotheses and may also be consistent with recent toxicologic data implicating endothelins. Further epidemiologic studies are required to confirm these findings...|$|E

500|$|Besides the {{integration}} of southern-state and black cadets, the post-war academy also struggled with the issue <b>of</b> <b>hazing.</b> In its first 65years, hazing was uncommon or non-existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen, but took a harsher tone as Civil War veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes. The upper class cadets saw it as their duty to [...] "teach the plebes their manners." [...] Hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight {{with the death of}} former cadet Oscar L. Booz on 3 December 1900. Congressional hearings, which included testimony by cadet Douglas MacArthur, investigated his death and the pattern <b>of</b> systemic <b>hazing</b> <b>of</b> freshmen. When MacArthur returned as superintendent, he made an effort to end the practice <b>of</b> <b>hazing</b> the incoming freshmen by placing Army sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer. The practice <b>of</b> <b>hazing</b> continued on some levels well into the late 20th century, but is no longer allowed in the present day.|$|R
