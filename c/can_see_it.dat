Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> closely is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E

25|$|All {{sound is}} {{inherently}} powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> touch it, feel it and smell it. But if {{he hears a}} lion he must act, fast, because {{the sound of the}} lion signals its presence and its power. Speech is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.|$|E
25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, I was still dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far as I <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> <b>it</b> is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E

[...] Former Mojo editor Mat Snow describes Material World as [...] "a treat for the ears" [...] and, while conceding Harrison's limitations as a singer compared with Lennon and McCartney, he writes that Harrison [...] "worked hard to ensure the choruses of... 'Who Can See It' caught the ear with their deep and delicious emotion". In his review of the 2014 reissue of Harrison's Apple catalogue, for Classic Rock, Paul Trynka refers to Material Word as an album that [...] "sparkles with many gems"; of these, he adds, [...] "it's the more restrained tracks – Don't Let Me Wait Too Long, Who <b>Can</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> – that entrance: gorgeous pop songs, all the more forceful for their restraint." [...] New Zealand Herald journalist Graham Reid writes of Harrison [...] "sound battered by recent events and the Beatle legacy" [...] on [...] "Who Can See It", yet he cites the song as a [...] "standout" [...] on an album that [...] "can be very moving".|$|E

In an interview with Guitar World magazine to promote the reissue, he also revealed that McCartney had [...] "long since" [...] apologised for his behaviour towards him during the Beatles years. In the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison comments: [...] "It's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge...

Good photographs allow an appreciation of how the objects were displayed, in glassed cases and on open shelves around the walls, over doors, and over the small fireplace, which had an elaborate shelved chimneypiece in wood above. [...] Several objects, including the Casket of Saint Valerie, were on tables away from the walls. Comfortable seating was plentiful, some upholstered with pieces from medieval vestments, and there were framed photographs and houseplants.
