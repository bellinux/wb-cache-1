When Steve escapes custody with wanted criminal Bucky Barnes a.k.a. the Winter Soldier, Tony is ordered by Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross to bring him in. He recruits Black Widow, War Machine, Vision, Wakandan King T'Challa a.k.a. Black Panther, and teenage superhero Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man to combat Rogers. After the battle at Leipzig/Halle Airport (during which Tony is appalled when the Vision nearly kills Rhodes by accident and paralyzes him), Tony discovered that Steve was telling the truth about the actions of Helmut Zemo planning something sinister in Russia. Tony goes to Russia originally to aid Steve and Bucky in combating Zemo, but Zemo reveals that a brainwashed Bucky killed his parents when he was in college and Steve refused to tell him about it.

40|$|Context: Yoga-based {{intervention}} {{is emerging as}} an effective add-on therapy {{in the management of}} schizophrenia. However, many barriers make it difficult for patients to avail yoga therapy programs. One of them is motivation for yoga therapy. Ways to address the barriers are critical to employ yoga as a treatment in this population. Aim: This study aims at exploring patients′ willingness to participate in add-on yoga therapy programs on out-patient basis. Settings and Design: The study was conducted on 100 schizophrenia patients attending psychiatry out-patient services of a tertiary care hospital. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 schizophrenia patients (male: female = 57 : 43; age: 35. 8 ΁ 9. 2 years) attending the psychiatry out-patient services of a tertiary neuropsychiatry hospital were administered a survey questionnaire. Statistical Analysis Used: Chi-square test was used for testing the significance of proportions. P < 0. 05 was taken to be significant. Results: About 46 % were aware that yoga {{is also one of the}} complementary therapies useful in schizophrenia. 32 % had tried yoga in the past for some reasons, but only 31 % of them were continuing yoga; commonest reasons for not <b>continuing</b> <b>being</b> lack of motivation (31 %) and inability to spare time (27. 6 %).

40|$|Based on {{information}} provided by two consecutive samples of the four-year version of the Spanish Wage Structure Survey (WSS), {{in this paper we}} estimate, from a gender perspective, the returns to human capital in the Spanish hospitality industry. For this purpose has been estimated an expanded version of the Mincerian wage equation. This equation includes, in addition of the variables that represents the human capital following the criteria of Mincer (1974), a set of variables that attempt to measure the effects on wages of workers' personal characteristics and those characteristic related with the occupation. The descriptive analysis of the samples shows that both in the hospitality sector just as in the whole of private services of the Spanish economy, which have been utilised for comparing, the women's gross hourly wages are on average lower than the men's, but nevertheless the average years of schooling completed by workers in both samples are not significantly different in the hospitality industry. In another vein, regarding to the returns to formal education in the hospitality industry, the estimates confirm that the gap between men and women in 2006 is extended in the sample for the year 2010 from a differential of 2. 1 percentage points in 2006 to 2. 5 percentage points in 2010. In the case of the workers from other private services, this differential is significantly lower but it is <b>continuing</b> <b>being</b> higher for women. The results obtained from our work reveal that persist wages inequalities between {{men and women in the}} Spanish hospitality industry. Furthermore, it demonstrates that this sector continues to employ a large number of low-skilled workers in comparing with the average skills of the rest of the Spanish economy sectors.

40|$|After {{more than}} four centuries of {{presence}} documented in Galicia, some Jews chose to turn and try, thus, the integration in the Christian society. In occasions, some of these converted were accused of <b>continuing</b> <b>being</b> Jewish privately, which was threatening the unit of Faith that the Kings Católicos wanted to establish in their kingdoms. After successive and fruitless attempts of preaching in order that the converted ones were leaving the Judaic rites, the kings chose to request the Pope {{the creation of a}} court, controlled by the monarchy, to act against heretics and converted that were continuing practise Judaic rites. The bulla Exigit Sincerae Devotionis granted in 1478 by Sixto IV supposed the creation of the Court of the Holy Office of the Inquisition. In Galicia, nevertheless, the establishment of this court was very late and the first reference dates back of 1520. Tras más de cuatro centurias de presencia documentada en Galicia, algunos judíos optaron por convertirse e intentar, de este modo, la integración en la sociedad cristiana. En ocasiones, algunos de estos conversos fueron acusados de seguir siendo judíos en secreto, lo que amenazaba la unidad de Fe que los Reyes Católicos querían instaurar. Después de sucesivos e infructuosos intentos de predicación para que los conversos abandonasen los ritos judaicos, los reyes optaron por solicitar al Papa la creación de un tribunal, controlado por la monarquía, para actuar contra herejes y conversos que seguían practicando ritos judaicos. La bula Exigit sincerae devotionis otorgada en 1478 por Sixto IV supuso la creación del Tribunal del Santo Oficio de la Inquisición.

40|$|The Impact of ICT in Contract Formation and E-commerce Development in Tanzania is {{the title}} of this dissertation. This title was chosen {{basically}} focusing on the undisputed fact that the use of ICT has currently rapidly increased to the fact that at least every day life has been next to impossible to an individual without the use of equipment such as mobile phones, computer, laptop, automatic machine used in a particular system etc. We daily communicate and normally we either send or receive information in various forms. Communication has shifted from the old paper based to the modern electronic form {{in such a way that}} e-mails, websites, EDIs, mobile phones, etc have been highly used as the most preferred ways of communication particularly between those who are far away from each other. Internet has catalysed the speed of communication as it has now been faster, efficiency and trustworthy. This dissertation has five chapters whereby chapter one contains the basic concepts on ICT and Contracts, second chapter on the development of communication process, third chapter, contract formation practices, fourth chapter, electronic contract formation and the findings of the study. Lastly is chapter five which presents the conclusion and recommendations. In the dissertation, it has been found that among others, ICT revolution in Tanzania has not been fully legally recognized and that, what is present in the country is the application of electronic communication by Tanzania particularly those in urban areas without being protected by any strong law.

40|$|Resumo: A presente pesquisa teve como objeto de estudo desvelar a realidade de trabalhadores e trabalhadoras com idade igual ou {{superior}} a 50 anos em cooperativas populares localizadas na cidade de Campinas, SP; além de realizar uma reflexão sobre a questão do envelhecimento no mundo do trabalho e da produtividade. A metodologia utilizada apoiou-se em uma abordagem quantitativa ? qualitativa. Tratou-se, num primeiro momento, de realizar um mapeamento socioeconômico destes trabalhadores; para tanto, realizamos um levantamento quantitativo de cada cooperativa em estudo. A segunda parte correspondeu em identificar quais as representações sociais que essas pessoas tinham delas ? como trabalhadores e trabalhadoras que estão envelhecendo dentro das cooperativas populares ? e do próprio trabalho dentro do ambiente cooperativo, conseqüentemente, identificamos os anseios e necessidades que levam tais participantes a buscar o trabalho neste sistema alternativo de produção. Os resultados nos permitem analisar a realidade em que vivem os participantes das cooperativas populares estudadas. Na investigação sobre as representações sociais, realizamos um estudo comparativo entre uma cooperativa de reciclagem de entulhos, que não exige qualquer tipo de escolaridade e uma cooperativa de costura, com mulheres de nível escolar mais elevado. Percebemos que as categorias de análise ramo de produção, escolaridade e gênero são extremamente relevantes para demarcarmos as diferenças nas representações sociais encontradas. De modo geral, a velhice é valorizada por seus aspectos físicos e de perda da saúde, mas que na prática pode ser amenizado pela idéia de continuar sendo produtivo por meio do trabalhoAbstract: Disclosing {{the reality}} {{of male and female}} workers, aged 50 +, in people?s cooperatives located in the city of Campinas, SP; this was the object of study of this research; besides a reflection on aging in the work and productivity world. The methodology used is based on a quantitative-qualitative approach. In the first moment a socio-economical mapping of the workers was developed; therefore, we had a gathering of data of every cooperative in the study (quantitative). In a second moment, we identified the social representations which these people had of themselves ? as workers who are getting older in the people?s cooperative ? and of the own work in cooperative environment, and as a result, we identified the wishes and needs which make such participants to search for work in this alternative system of production. The results allow us to analyze the reality where the participants of the studied people?s cooperatives live. In the research of social representations, we developed a comparative study between a refuse material recycling cooperative, which does not require any schooling type, and a sewing cooperative, with women with higher level of schooling. We noticed that in the analysed categories in production field, schooling and gender are extremely relevant to define the differences in the social representations found. In a general way, the aging is valorized by its physical aspects and health loss, but in reality it can be softened by the idea of <b>continuing</b> <b>being</b> productive through the wor...|$|E
40|$|Background;Sub –Saharan Africa still {{bear the}} largest burden of HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Infections(STIs) with youth below 24 years <b>continuing</b> <b>being</b> {{at the highest}} risk of infections. This group {{contributes}} the large proportion of new HIV infections, with 80 % occurring in sub Saharan Africa. There is more call for innovative and effective interventions for primary preventions. A school-based sexual behavioral intervention named PREPARE was developed to promotesafer sexual and reproductive health behaviorsamong primary school adolescents in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. This innovative best practice intervention included classroom teaching and peer led education sessions Objective;This study sought to evaluate the effect of PREPARE intervention on sexual debut, condom use and proximal determinants of these sexual behaviorsamong primary school children aged 12 - 14 in Dar Es Salaam. Material and Methods;A cluster-randomized controlled trial, involving 38 (19 intervention and 19 delayed intervention) primary schools in Dar es Salaam was conducted. Using the same standardized questionnaire, data was collected at baseline and at 6 monthsfollow-up after intervention. All analyses were carried using STATA 12 statistical software. Factor analysis was performed and scales created. Difference in difference model {{was used to determine}} intervention effect. Clustering was assumed at school level. All analyses were two tailed and type- 1 error was set at 5 % level. Results;A total of 5099 students were involved in the study at baseline. Six months after the baseline a follow-up survey was conducted where 4661 (91. 4 %) among those who participated in the baseline survey were interviewed. Baseline characteristics of participants were comparable where no statistically significant differences between the groups were noted. 487 (10. 8 % SE 0. 6 %, 95 % CI; 9. 5 %, 12. 2 %) participants report to have ever had sex; 274 (Chi square 9. 12, p= 0. 03) were in the intervention schools. Among those who report to have ever had sex; 152 (34. 2 %, SE 2. 6 %, 95 % CI 28. 9 %, 39. 4 %) reported to have ever used condom. At follow-up, 352 (8. 6 % SE, 0. 6 % CI 7. 3 %, 9. 8 %) of the respondents who had no sexual experience at baseline report to have had sex, 265 (74. 3 %) were males (Chi-square; 127. 99, 2 df; 2 p;< 0. 01). The incidence of 86 per 1000 pupils transitioned into sex over the period of six months since baseline. PREPARE intervention was found to significantly improve HIV transmission knowledge among females and protection knowledge for both males and females(p< 0. 01) and reduced HIV and condom myths among female pupils. It was also found to improve attitudes among female students (positive attitude for sex delay and positive attitude for condom; 0. 205, and 0. 160, p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 01 respectively) and reduced negative attitude towards sex delay among males. The adjusted mean scores on perception of norms supportive of delayed sex and condom use significantly increased among females. The intervention also showed effect on self-efficacy for sex delay (0. 128, p< 0. 05) and improved communication with parents (0. 094, p< 0. 05) and friends (0. 213, p< 0. 01) among females. Intention to use condom was noted to improve among females (0. 211, p-value < 0. 01). No intervention effect was noted on sexual debut and condom use between the groups. Overall more intervention effect was observed among females than males. Conclusion;In this study we were able to explore sexual debut, condom use and proximal determinants of these sexual behaviors as purported in the theory of planned behavior. PEPRARE intervention was found to have significant effect by improving proximal determinants of sexual debut and condom use but not on actual behaviors this is likely due to the timing of our follow-up. Actual behavior changes are likely to occur after a considerable lapse of time. Overall the intervention seems to have more effect among female pupils as compared to male pupils...|$|E
