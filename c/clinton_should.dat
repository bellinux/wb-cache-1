Following that, interested parties formed the Tuskegee Syphilis Study Legacy Committee to develop ideas that had arisen at the symposium. It issued its final report in May 1996. The Committee had two related goals: (1) President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> publicly apologize for past government wrongdoing related to the study and (2) the Committee and relevant federal agencies should develop a strategy to redress the damages.|$|E
25|$|Coulter later {{stated that}} she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to settle, if a {{favorable}} settlement could be negotiated. From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement. However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would {{give the impression that}} Jones was merely interested in extorting money from the President.|$|E

5000|$|Around 2007, the Clinton Foundation {{was criticized}} {{for a lack of}} transparency. Although U.S. law did not require nonprofit charities—including presidential foundations—to {{disclose}} the identities of their contributors, critics said that the names of donors should be disclosed because Hillary was running to be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States. Commentator Matthew Yglesias wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed that the <b>Clintons</b> <b>should</b> make public the names of foundation donors to avoid any appearanceof impropriety.A lengthy donors list was then released by the Foundation in December 2008, which included several politically sensitive donors, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Blackwater Worldwide. The Foundation stated that the disclosures would ensure that [...] "not even the appearance of a conflict of interest" [...] would exist once Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.|$|R

He argued that <b>should</b> <b>Clinton</b> win, Garland <b>should</b> be confirmed in the Senate's lame-duck session because he is less liberal than any nominee Clinton might put forward. After meeting with Garland in April, Flake reiterated this position, saying that confirmation hearings on Garland's nomination should not be taken up until after the election, so that the American people can choose the next president, unless Clinton wins, in which case, [...] "we ought to approve him quickly." ...|$|R
25|$|Dean {{was named}} {{chairman}} {{emeritus of the}} DNC upon his retirement. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for Secretary of Health and Human Services and Surgeon General under the Obama administration. Since retiring from the DNC chairman position, Dean has held neither elected office nor an official position in the Democratic Party and, as of 2015, was working for global law firm, Dentons, {{as part of the}} firm’s public policy and regulation practice. In 2013, Dean expressed interest in running for the presidency in 2016, but published an op-ed in December 2014 in which he outlined why he would support former Secretary of State Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> she decide to run for president, which she eventually did in April 2015, resulting ultimately in winning the Democratic nomination, but eventually losing the presidential election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.|$|E
500|$|Emanuel {{declared}} in April 2006 {{that he would}} support Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her {{at least once a}} month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: [...] "I'm hiding under the desk. I'm very far under the desk, and I'm bringing my paper and my phone." [...] Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.|$|E
500|$|Apparently as {{result of}} poor {{communications}} with Lord Germain, Britain's Secretary of State for the Colonies {{and the political}} official {{in charge of the}} conflict, General Howe [...] decided instead to attempt the capture of Philadelphia, and [...] sailed south with much of his army in July, leaving Sir Henry Clinton in command at New York. [...] Howe's instructions to General Clinton were primarily to hold New York City, and to only engage in offensive operations that were consistent with that goal. [...] His instructions to Clinton on July 30 included a promise that reinforcements would arrive (but without any promised time), and that <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> consider making a move [...] "in favor or General Burgoyne's approaching Albany, with security to Kingsbridge" [...] if the opportunity presented itself. [...] A letter from Howe reached Burgoyne on August 3 informing him of his move to Philadelphia, and of Clinton's instructions. [...] Clinton wrote a letter on September 12 (received by Burgoyne on the 21st, after the Battle of Freeman's Farm) that he would [...] "make a push at [...] Montgomery in about ten days" [...] if [...] "you think 2000 men can assist you effectually".|$|E

500|$|Two {{days after}} Operation Infinite Reach, Omar {{reportedly}} called the State Department, {{saying that the}} strikes would only lead to more anti-Americanism and terrorism, and that <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> resign. The embassy bombings and the declaration of war against the U.S. had divided the Taliban and angered Omar. However, bin Laden swore an oath of fealty to the Taliban leader, and the two became friends. According to Wright, Omar also believed that turning over bin Laden would weaken his position. In an October cable, the State Department also wrote that the missile strikes worsened Afghan-U.S. relations while bringing the Taliban and al-Qaeda closer together. A Taliban spokesman even told State Department officials in November that [...] "If [...] could have retaliated with similar strikes against Washington, it would have." [...] The Taliban also denied American charges that bin Laden {{was responsible for the}} embassy bombings. When Turki visited Omar to retrieve bin Laden, Omar told the prince that they had miscommunicated and he had never agreed to give the Saudis bin Laden. In Turki's account, Omar lambasted him when he protested, insulting the Saudi royal family and praising the Al-Qaeda leader; Turki left without bin Laden. The Saudis broke off relations with the Taliban and allegedly hired a young Uzbek named Siddiq Ahmed in a failed bid to assassinate bin Laden. American diplomatic engagement with the Taliban continued, and the State Department insisted to them that the U.S. was only opposed to bin Laden and al-Qaeda, at whom the missile strikes were aimed, not Afghanistan and its leadership.|$|E
500|$|That month, Clinton {{implemented}} a Department of Defense directive known as [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell", which allowed {{gay men and}} women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that [...] "the President should lift the ban... even though [...] was sure to be overridden by the Congress". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not [...] "out of whack". The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.|$|E

5000|$|In 2016, Moore {{became a}} leading Trump critic, {{saying that in}} a presidential {{election}} between Trump and Hillary <b>Clinton,</b> Christians <b>should</b> vote for [...] "a conservative independent or third-party candidate." [...] Moore stated {{that he could not}} support the former because he [...] "stirs up racial animosity" [...] and could not support the latter for her support of abortion rights. Writing in the National Review in January 2016, Moore wrote that a Trump presidency would endanger the goals of the Manhattan Declaration; criticized Trump's involvement in the casino industry and past support for abortion rights; and argued that [...] "Trump's vitriolic — and often racist and sexist — language about immigrants, women, the disabled, and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons, not just the 'winners' of the moment, are created in God's image." ...|$|R
60|$|The plan {{to which}} we allude was concerted by General Howe, the commander-in-chief.

To divert the attention of the Americans from this stealthy march on their left, General Grant was to menace their right flank toward Gravesend before daybreak, and General De Heister to cannonade their centre, where Colonel Hand was stationed. Neither, however, was to press an attack until the guns of Sir Henry <b>Clinton</b> <b>should</b> give notice that he had effected his purpose, and turned the left flank of the Americans; then the latter were to be assailed at all points with the utmost vigor.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{analysis}} of the Clinton email controversy published by the Brookings Institution, Richard Lempert wrote that [...] "security professionals have a reputation for erring in the direction of overclassification." [...] Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, says that [...] "The odds are good that any classified information in the <b>Clinton</b> emails <b>should</b> not have been classified," [...] since an estimated 50 percent to 90 percent of classified documents could be made public without risking national security. Nate Jones, an expert with the National Security Archive at George Washington University, said: [...] "Clinton's mistreatment of federal records and the intelligence community's desire to retroactively overclassify are two distinct troubling problems. No politician is giving the right message: Blame Clinton for poor records practices, but don't embrace overclassification while you do it."' ...|$|R

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that <b>Clinton</b> never <b>should</b> have kissed the wife of the Palestinian leader, especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In 1992 the United States ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was intended to stabilize the buildup of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere but did not impose binding limits on emissions. In July 1997, when preliminary negotiations on a new climate agreement were under way, the Senate passed a resolution expressing {{the sense of the}} Senate that the <b>Clinton</b> administration <b>should</b> not agree to limits on U. S. greenhouse gas emissions if such an agreement did not include economically developing nations or if it could seriously harm the U. S. economy. In December 1997 the United States participated in drafting the Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to specifically limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Protocol did not impose limits on developing nations' emissions, and its possible effect on the U. S. economy was the subject of numerous studies during that period, including the two studies that are the subject of this report. Although the U. S. government signed the Protocol in 1998, the Clinton administration did not submit it to the Senate for advice and consent, which are necessary for ratification. In March 2001, President Bush announced that he opposed the Protocol. At a July 2002 hearing on the administration's climate initiative, the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) testified that implementing the Kyoto Protocol would reduce U. S. economic output by "up to $ 400 billion" in 2010. This estimate is similar to a $ 397 billion estimate that appeared in a 1998 report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), an independent statistical and analytical agency within the U. S. Department of Energy. The EIA estimate differed from another, well-publicized estimate prepared the same year by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which found that the costs of implementing the Protocol could be as little as $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion a year in economic output, depending on the extent of international emissions trading allowed and the participation of developing countries. Congress asked us to identify likely reasons for {{the differences between the two}} cited cost estimates ($ 397 billion from EIA and $ 7 billion to $ 12 billion by CEA), based on (1) the economic models used to prepare these estimates and (2) the assumptions incorporated into these models, including economic assumptions and assumptions about how the Protocol would be implemented. ...|$|R
