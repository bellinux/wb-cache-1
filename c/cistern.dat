5|$|Cave 24 {{is a long}} cave with {{difficult}} access that leads into a <b>cistern</b> with seating arrangements in the niches. There is a door access to the passage, which also has benches for seating.|$|E
5|$|Between caves 5 and 6, {{on higher}} level, is an {{excavation}} originally intended either for a dwelling {{or for a}} seat, but converted into a <b>cistern</b> following discovery of a rock-fault. On its left side is a bench.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Cisterns</b> of La Malga or <b>Cisterns</b> of La Mâalga are a {{group of}} <b>cisterns,</b> which {{are among the most}} visible {{features}} of the archaeological site of Carthage in Tunisia. They {{are some of the best}} preserved Roman <b>cisterns.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{most unusual}} aspect of Byzantine Constantinople's water system was {{the large number}} of <b>cisterns</b> {{throughout}} the city. This research integrates the two most recent in-depth studies of the <b>cisterns</b> to determine that there have been at least 211 <b>cisterns</b> attributed to the Byzantine city. The distribution of the <b>cisterns</b> indicates that the size and number of <b>cisterns</b> constructed reduced over time, with more and larger <b>cisterns</b> developed prior to the seventh century. <b>Cisterns</b> are concentrated in the older area of the City and sparser on the periphery, but with later ones more common in the peripheral areas, suggesting that water provision was extended over time, and although the majority of <b>cisterns</b> are small, most storage volume is concentrated in the three largest open-air <b>cisterns.</b> The extended, detailed list produced will allow more in-depth investigations to proceed. Analysis of the distribution of <b>cisterns</b> across the City creates a framework for understanding the development and functioning of Byzantine Constantinople's complex water supply system...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cisterns</b> (English: The <b>Cisterns)</b> is {{a museum}} in Copenhagen, Denmark. The <b>Cisterns</b> is an {{integral}} part of The Frederiksberg Museums, acting as a venue for art exhibitions and other events where the singularity of its architecture and atmosphere remains a core attraction.|$|R
5|$|Built under Babylonian rule (605–539BC), {{the oldest}} {{monument}} {{at the site}} is a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that includes an access ramp to a water <b>cistern.</b> Fragments of marble column bases with Torus moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era.|$|E
5|$|By the 5th century, {{structures}} with small-scale domed cross plans existed {{across the}} Christian world. Examples include the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia, the martyrium {{attached to the}} Basilica of San Simpliciano, and churches in Macedonia and {{on the coast of}} Asia Minor. Small brick domes are also found in towers of Constantinople's early 5th century land walls. Underground cisterns in Constantinople, such as the <b>Cistern</b> of Philoxenos and the Basilica <b>Cistern,</b> were composed of a grid of columns supporting small domes, rather than groin vaults. The square bay with an overhead sail vault or dome on pendentives became the basic unit of architecture in the early Byzantine centuries, found in a variety of combinations.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{strategic}} importance, the Republic of Ragusa constantly {{invested in the}} maintenance of the fortress, which contained a <b>cistern,</b> a powder storage, wine and food cellars, sentry-boxes, military barracks, and sanctuary buildings to accommodate refugees from nearby villages in the event of war.|$|E
5000|$|According to Al Idrisi, {{there were}} at least 24 <b>cisterns</b> in a single line, each with a length of 130 pace and a width of 26 pace - though Henri Saladin {{considered}} this width too high. According to Christian Tuxen Falbe, there were fifteen <b>cisterns</b> which were [...] in width and four ruined <b>cisterns</b> a little to the west and each of these nineteen <b>cisterns</b> had a length of [...]|$|R
50|$|Many {{scholars}} have viewed the several large stepped <b>cisterns</b> at Qumran as ritual baths. This supports the religious settlement model. There are difficulties in understanding all these <b>cisterns</b> as baths, however. Qumran's water arrived perhaps {{twice a year}} from rainwater runoff. Water was one of Qumran's most valued commodities, and water management {{is an integral part}} of the site, as seen with the numerous <b>cisterns</b> and channels. If the large <b>cisterns</b> were ritual baths, the water would sit getting dirtier through ritual bathing throughout the year and was extremely infrequently replenished by the run off. The current state of analysis of the <b>cisterns</b> is still unresolved, but Katharina Galor suggests a mixed usage of the stepped <b>cisterns</b> as both ritual baths and water storage. According to the Israeli archaeologists Magen and Peleg, the clay found in the <b>cisterns</b> was used for pottery factory facilities.|$|R
50|$|Unlike Alang and Kulang, {{which have}} around 10 to 15 <b>cisterns</b> each respectively, Madan has only 2 {{relatively}} small water <b>cisterns.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} carotid arteries supply oxygenated {{blood to}} the front of the brain and the vertebral arteries supply {{blood to the}} back of the brain. These two circulations join together in the circle of Willis, a ring of connected arteries that lies in the interpeduncular <b>cistern</b> between the midbrain and pons.|$|E
5|$|Birket Israel (trans. Pool of Israel) also Birket Israil or Birket Isra'in, {{abbreviated}} from Birket Asbât Beni Israìl (trans. Pool of the Tribes of the Children of Israel) was {{a public}} <b>cistern</b> located on the north-eastern corner of the Temple Mount, in Jerusalem. The structure {{is believed to have}} been built by the Romans for use as a water reservoir and also to protect the northern wall of the Temple Mount. Arab locals have known it by this name since at least 1857.|$|E
5|$|Cave 18 is {{a dining}} hall with a front wall and a grooved doorway, {{on either side}} of which are windows. A bench runs along the back and side walls. The passage to the hall has 3 broken steps and an open court in the front. A <b>cistern</b> is located {{to the left of the}} court.|$|E
25|$|The second {{network of}} <b>cisterns,</b> the <b>cisterns</b> of Aïn Mizeb, {{is very well}} preserved. Located close to the Temple of Minerva, these eight domed {{reservoirs}} can hold 9000 m³ and feature a basin into which they decant. The <b>cisterns</b> are fed by a spring located 200 metres away connected via an underground aqueduct.|$|R
50|$|The large <b>cisterns</b> were {{relied upon}} by the vast bath complex of Antoninus. The water flowed down from the <b>cisterns</b> to the baths through {{underground}} pipes.|$|R
2500|$|About [...] east-northeast of the sanctuary, {{there was}} a series of massive <b>cisterns,</b> reached by a rock-cut {{stairway}} extending about [...] down into the bedrock. The opening of the stairway is [...] northwest of the openings of the <b>cisterns.</b> The descent is steep and the steps are not all well-preserved. There are cuttings for a parapet wall around the vertiginous upper openings of the <b>cisterns</b> to prevent falls. It has been proposed that the water was raised from the <b>cisterns</b> to the water channel by the use of large human-powered waterwheels.|$|R
5|$|The Senate {{opened the}} gates of the city to the Isaurian, {{allowing}} the deposed emperor to resume the throne. Basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church, but he was betrayed by Acacius and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus, his wife Aelia Zenonis and his son Marcus were sent to a fortress in Cappadocia, where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry <b>cistern,</b> to die from exposure.|$|E
5|$|Cave 10 {{is located}} {{at a higher level}} than cave 9 and is {{difficult}} to reach as its front is broken. An open veranda with a broken ceiling and floor leads to a middle room through a grooved broken door, which has windows on either side. The right wall of the hall has a recess with a seat. A cell {{to the left of the}} room has a seat in a recess. A door from the cell leads to a half-cell which has a recess and seat. Traces of painting are seen on the ceiling. Outside the veranda to the left is a <b>cistern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick <b>cistern</b> and evidence of slave outbuildings, in addition to the foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of {{the head}} has become the diagnostic tool of choice, particularly for moderate and severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Various CT characteristics are associated with outcome, and may therefore be used as outcome predictors. One {{of the most prominent}} predictors appears to be the status of the basal <b>cisterns.</b> This study describes the prognostic value of the appearance of individual <b>cisterns</b> and ventricles in relation to that of the basal <b>cisterns.</b> Further, we determine the interrater and intrarater reliability in the evaluation of the <b>cisterns</b> and ventricles. All consecutive moderate and severe adult TBI patients admitted to our hospital were included in this study as part of the prospective Radboud University Brain Injury Cohort Study (RUBICS). Outcome was assessed at 6 months post-trauma using the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). The predictive value of <b>cisterns</b> and ventricles was determined using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. We included 126 moderate and 574 severe TBI patients. Absence (complete obliteration), but also compression of the ambient <b>cisterns</b> and/or the fourth ventricle were strongly related to unfavorable outcome and death and emerged as the only significant outcome predictors after multivariate analysis. The assessment of the ambient <b>cisterns</b> and the fourth ventricle had a satisfactory inter- and intrarater reliability (kappa coefficients: 0. 80 - 0. 95). We conclude that, because obliteration of the ambient <b>cisterns</b> and the fourth ventricle both are better than the status of the basal <b>cisterns</b> as outcome predictors, they might be used in CT prediction models in cases of moderate and severe TBI...|$|R

5|$|Justinian also {{strengthened}} {{the borders of}} the Empire from Africa to the East through the construction of fortifications and ensured Constantinople of its water supply through construction of underground cisterns (see Basilica <b>Cistern).</b> To prevent floods from damaging the strategically important border town Dara, an advanced arch dam was built. During his reign the large Sangarius Bridge was built in Bithynia, securing a major military supply route to the east. Furthermore, Justinian restored cities damaged by earthquake or war and built a new city near his place of birth called Justiniana Prima, which was intended to replace Thessalonica as the political and religious centre of Illyricum.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} main building {{is a combination of}} Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter. A lightning rod extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water <b>cistern,</b> garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped.|$|E
5|$|A bailey, {{also called}} a ward, was a {{fortified}} enclosure. It {{was a common}} feature of castles, and most had at least one. The keep {{on top of the}} motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home {{of the rest of the}} lord's household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities were often found in the bailey. Water was supplied by a well or <b>cistern.</b> Over time the focus of high status accommodation shifted from the keep to the bailey; this resulted in the creation of another bailey that separated the high status buildings– such as the lord's chambers and the chapel– from the everyday structures such as the workshops and barracks.|$|E
25|$|Apart from mosquitoes, Gibraltar's <b>cisterns</b> {{had other}} major hygiene problems. The water they stored was {{unfiltered}} {{and they were}} often located alongside functional areas such as kitchens, privies and areas for animals such as poultry. Gibraltar's colony of Barbary macaques added to the problem by fouling the rooftops and <b>cisterns.</b> The water was notionally fresh but in reality the <b>cisterns</b> tended to accumulate unhygienic debris of various types.|$|R
50|$|Access to Kohoj Fort is via {{the main}} trek trail at which breaks from the Kohoj Fort road near the Saltwater lake on the Wada-Manor road. On {{reaching}} the plateau of the fort, a temple of Lord Shankar can be seen, {{which has now}} been rehabilitated. Two <b>cisterns</b> {{can be seen in}} front of the temple. One of the routes descends from {{the left side of the}} temple, where seven adjoined <b>cisterns</b> are located. One of the <b>cisterns</b> bears clean water. The other two <b>cisterns</b> have been spoiled, the remaining four being clogged. Few remnants in dilapidated state can be seen to the right of the temple. Fortification is also seen at some of the places on the fort. The other way stretches from the right side of the temple up the hill. Three large <b>cisterns</b> can be seen on this route, one of which is clogged and the other two contain water. This water can be used for drinking. An idol of Lord Hanumana can be seen near these <b>cisterns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The SWP found <b>cisterns</b> cut in {{the rock}} and a well. Dauphin {{described}} the place as being an ancient village on a hill slope, with traces of ancient remains, including <b>cisterns</b> and caves carved into rock.|$|R
5|$|Architecturally {{this was}} an {{exciting}} period, but Honoré I was unable to remodel the fortress in the grand style of a Renaissance palazzo. In spite of the Spanish protection, the risk of attack from France was high and defence remained Honoré's main priority. With this in mind he added two new features: All Saints Tower (F) and the Serravalle Bastion (G). All Saints Tower was semi-circular and guarded {{the end of the}} rock promontory. Complete with gun platforms and cannon, it was connected to man-made caves in the rock itself. Subterranean passages also linked it to the Serravalle Bastion, which was in essence a three-storey gun tower bristling with cannon. Underneath the courtyard a <b>cistern</b> was installed, providing sufficient water for 1000 troops for a 20-month siege, with a huge vaulted ceiling supported by nine columns. Monaco was to remain politically vulnerable for another century and little building work took place from 1581 until 1604, during the reigns of Prince Charles II and Prince Hercule.|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled <b>cistern.</b> A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E
5|$|Cave 13 on a {{slightly}} higher level than cave 12, is a small dwelling with an open court and from 2 steps lead to a veranda. To {{the right of the}} court is a <b>cistern.</b> The veranda has a bench along its right wall. The front of the veranda has 2 benches, flanked by a plain eight-sided pillar and pilaster; some remnants of these survive. On the right pilaster is a double crescent ornament. A grooved door leads to a middle room, which has a bench along the right wall and seat recess to the left. A window is to the left of door. In the back wall of the middle room a cell (left) - with a grooved bench and a bench - and a half cell (right) are seen. The ceiling has traces of painting.|$|E
