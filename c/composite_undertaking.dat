This layer is assumed to have varying properties. To obtain information concerning the properties and extent of the interphase, an experimental study of the thermal behaviour of aluminium-epoxy <b>composites</b> was <b>undertaken.</b> Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed to evaluate heat capacity with respect to temperature. In addition, the effects of different factors, such as heating rate and filler concentration on the glass transition temperature of the composite, were examined.

In the first place, the freezing behaviour of eutectic alloys has been investigated as a subject {{in its own right}} over the past fifteen years. During this same period of time the concepts of fibre-strengthening were developed and put to test. This led to the second wave of interest in eutectic alloys when it was shown that several simple binary eutectic alloys after unidirectional solidification exhibited tensile deformation characteristics typical of fibre-reinforced composites. Research on eutectic composites has divided naturally between the academic institutions on the one hand where a fundamental approach is taken with regard to the structure and properties of eutectic composites utilizing low temperature binary systems, and industrial or government research laboratories on the other hand where searches for commercial high temperature pseudo-binary eutectic <b>composites</b> are <b>undertaken.</b> In the former case, work has focused on solidification microstructures and their inherent structural defects, on the crystallographic orientation relationships between eutectic phases, and on detailed analyses of the mechanical behaviour of these simple eutectic composites.

40|$|O in {{the present}} work is the {{quantitative}} comparison between the microscopic and the corresponding macroscopic failure in a two-dimensional elastic medium with known periodic microstructure. This comparison establishes theoretical limits for the validity for the averaged (homogenized) response of microstructured elastic media. Attention is focussed on an approximation of a fiber reinforced composite modeled as an infinite periodic grillage of axially compressed beams with an average shear stiffness. The particular beam model was chosen so that the problem would be analytically tractable, yet of sufficient complexity to exhibit nontrivial microscopic and macroscopic failure modes. A comparison of the stresses {{at the onset of}} the microscopic failure (taken to be the first bifurcation away from the principal periodic solution) to the stresses {{at the onset of the}} macroscopic failure (which corresponds to the loss of ellipticity for the incremental response of the homogenized model) allows one to identify whether the first failure mode, also termed the critical mode, is local (microscopic) or global (macroscopic) in nature.

40|$|Natural fibres have {{recently}} become an attractive alternative to synthetic fibres {{in the implementation}} in polymer composite structures. This is due to contemporary environmental concerns such as climate change which have caused engineers to consider renewable resources in composite structures. Inherent flaws within natural fibres {{in terms of their}} constituent contents (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) reduce the compatibility of these fibres with polymer matrices. Fibre surface modifications using chemical treatments have the potential to improve fibre-matrix compatibility. In this study, the effects of chemical treatments on hemp fibres and the resulted polyester matrix composite are discussed. The fibres were treated with alkali (0 - 10 % NaOH), acetyl and silane chemicals. The structural composition and thermal decomposition of the fibres after treatments were investigated through chemical analysis, fibre morphology analysis, FTIR analysis, and TGA and DSC analyses. Fibre structure and morphology analysis showed that the amount of hemicellulose and lignin constituents decreased in the case of alkalised and acetylated fibres. Conversely, silane molecules formed couplings on fibre surfaces and there was no changes observed in terms of hemicellulose and lignin contents. Thermal analysis revealed that, due to the presence of hemicellulose constituents, the untreated fibres had lower thermal stability. The tensile properties of treated hemp fibres were measured through DMA. Treated fibres exhibited lower strengths compared to the untreated fibres due to the removal of hemicellulose and lignin binder from their cellulose surfaces. Long unidirectional fibre composites and sandwich structures were tested using tension, compression, shear, bending and impact tests. In both composite cases, 4 % NaOH treatments reduced interface bonding strength and decreased composite properties compared to untreated samples. At higher concentrations (6 - 10 % NaOH), composite properties increased as a result of greater interface bonding. The opposite results were achieved in the case of alkalised fibres that were further treated with acetyl and silane treatments. Failure analysis of tested <b>composites</b> was <b>undertaken</b> through OM and SEM. Micrographs showed results which were in agreement which the properties achieved. Treated fibres were able to effectively improve the bonding properties of composites, even though the mechanical strength of these fibres could be decreased. Thus, the use of chemical treatments on fibres can be justified as overall composite mechanical properties increased when compared to untreated cases. ...|$|R

The goal of this program was to extend the development of this material as a filter element and fully assess the capability of this technology {{to meet the needs of}} Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion (PFBC) and Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation systems at commercial scale. The principal objective of Task 3 was to build on the initial PRD- 66 filter development, optimize its structure, and evaluate basic material properties relevant to the hot gas filter application. Initially, this consisted of an evaluation of an advanced filament-wound core structure that had been designed to produce an effective bulk filter underneath the barrier filter formed by the outer membrane. The basic material properties to be evaluated (as established by the DOE/METC materials working group) would include mechanical, thermal, and fracture toughness parameters for both new and used material, for the purpose of building a material database consistent with what is being done for the alternative candle filter systems. Task 3 was later expanded to include analysis of PRD- 66 candle filters, which had been exposed to actual PFBC conditions, development of an improved membrane, and installation of equipment necessary for the processing of a modified composition. Task 4 would address essential technical issues involving the scale-up of PRD- 66 candle filter manufacturing from prototype production to commercial scale manufacturing. The focus would be on capacity (as it affects the ability to deliver commercial order quantities), process specification (as it affects yields, quality, and costs), and manufacturing systems (e. g. QA/QC, materials handling, parts flow, and cost data acquisition). Any filters fabricated during this task would be used for product qualification tests being conducted by Westinghouse at Foster-Wheeler's Pressurized Circulating Fluidized Bed (PCFBC) test facility in Karhula, Finland.

40|$|This thesis derives a seven-stage {{methodology}} and presents {{a case study}} for developing an actionable innovation strategy for manufacturing firms. The methodology is based around a careful examination of their firm's circumstances, or external context and internal praxis. How a firm should innovate is dependent on industry environment, firm activities, technology competencies, internal culture, and its networks-and this thesis aims to develop a "theory of practice" in how to do such circumstance-based strategy. Thus, unlike much of the innovation literature, which push universalistic theories on innovation (e. g., form a Skunkworks {{to create a new}} radical product) this work aims to help firms become more innovative by developing strategies unique to their conditions. The methodology has seven modules: 1) stake intent, 2) survey the industry and firm, 3) create an innovation strategy, 4) audit the firm, 5) develop the plan to reinforce the capabilities through its existing culture, 6) execute and measure the plan, and 7) periodically reflect and adjust the plan as the firm's environment change. The case study focuses on modules 2 - 5.

According to [11] the fabrication and properties of composites are strongly influenced by the proportions and properties of the matrix and the reinforcement.

40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of Pena’s DP- 2 method over a host of methods used to make <b>composite</b> indices. To <b>undertake</b> this exercise, variables and data used and methodology adopted in Human Development Report 2011 are employed along with nine other methodologies employed by other scholars. Although there is no agreed principle of judging an index to be best among alternative indices, it may be suggested that the composite index which is most informative among all other indices may be considered as the most acceptable one. The present study reveals that Pena-DP 2 index and Penmax index have close similarity. Computationally, Pena’s method of construction of index is much simpler, but the interpretation of Penmax index is more straightforward. On the other hand, Maxmin index is norm-based and has a justification on Wald’s principle of decision-making. The Maxmin index also is the most egalitarian index against the Principal Component based index, which is known to be most elitist. On ‘sum of absolute correlation’ and ‘sum of squared correlation’, too, the Maxmin index is superior to other indices. It appears, therefore, that the Maxmin composite index which is obtained by maximization of minimum of correlation between the composite index and the constituent variables is a better than others. Further, if we go by the argument of Neumann and Morgenstern none of the composite indices is a cardinal measure in the strict sense of measurement. ...|$|R

Structural characterization of UFC/Al composites carried out by SEM, XRD, and FTIR analyses reveals that composites are fairly homogenous, and the interactions between UFC and aluminum in UFC/Al composites are more probably physical in nature. Measurements of inherent thermal stabilities, probing reaction complexity, and thermal degradation kinetics of UFC and UFC/Al <b>composites</b> have been <b>undertaken</b> by thermogravimetric (TG) /differential thermogravimetric (DTG) analyses under nonisothermal conditions. The integral procedure decompositions temperature (IPDT) elucidates significant thermal stability of UFC, and higher aluminum contents in composites are capable of enhancing the thermal stability of UFC resin. TG/DTG analyses suggest highly complicated thermal degradation profiles of UFC and UFC/Al composites, which consist of various parallel/consecutive reactions. Generalized linear integral isoconversional method has been employed to determine {{the activation energies of}} thermal degradation processes. Substantial variations in activation energies of UFC and UFC/Al composites with the advancement of reaction verify their multi-step reaction pathways. Advanced reaction model determination methodology {{with the help of a}} novel kinetic function F(α,T) reveals that the multi-step thermal degradation of UFC goes to completion by principally following intricate nucleation/growth mechanisms. It is also found that aluminum more likely participates in the thermal degradation of resin and tends to alter its reaction mechanism. Detailed interpretations of the obtained kinetic parameters are given, and their probable physical significances are discussed. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2017, 134, 44826.

50|$|In 2006, the ACF {{contracted}} EKOS Research Associates {{to conduct}} a series of 19 focus groups in 15 communities across Canada. Close to 250 individuals participated, including business leaders, government officials, Aboriginal peoples, members of the media, and representatives of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In addition to these focus groups, CRAG delivered presentations regarding the emerging domains and indicators of wellbeing {{to a group of}} representatives from various NGOs and levels of government at a workshop hosted by the ACF. Following the participants’ advice, additional refinements to the CIW conceptual framework and to the approach for consolidating the CIW <b>composite</b> measure were <b>undertaken.</b> The ACF organized two more rounds of consultations in 2007 and 2008. These discussions provided the opportunity for participants to be updated on progress towards finalizing the CIW, offer feedback on the conceptual structure, and initiate local networks of advocates who would eventually communicate the CIW to the broader public.From 2009 to the spring of 2011, the research teams for the eight domains completed their individual final reports. These reports provided a comprehensive literature review supporting the direct contribution of each domain to wellbeing. They also recommended indicators to be considered for inclusion in the composite index of the domain and eventually the composite index that would define the CIW.In 2011, coincident with the finalisation of the last of the eight domain reports, the CIW project moved from the ACF to the University of Waterloo. The project is housed in the Faculty of Applied Health Sciences where the research, community outreach, and knowledge transfer activities supported by the CIW can be further developed.|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{takes its}} {{start from the}} oft-used {{description}} of Hellenistic poetry as ‘bookish’, but looks beyond the connotations of this label as denoting a milieu which was self-consciously intellectual, and instead considers the more fundamental ramifications of the designation: that Hellenistic poetry was bookish in its form, {{as much as in}} outlook. To consider the implications of this, I focus upon a period, and a significant poetic topos, wherein the effects of the book-roll can be most keenly discerned, assessing the impact of the medium upon authorial self- representations - particularly in the construction of authorial personae - undertaken in early Hellenistic poetry (c. 323 - 246 BC). In Part I of the thesis, I assess the evolution of authorial self-representation in epigram, charting developments from the inscribed form of the genre through to the book-epigram collections of the Hellenistic period: I argue that the author acquired a newfound prominence in this medial transition, asserting their presence as a voice within the text as opposed to a figure situated strictly in antecedence to it. I demonstrate this through analyses of Posidippus, Callimachus, Nossis, Asclepiades, and the epigrams ascribed to Erinna, and suggest that we repeatedly observe authors <b>undertaking</b> <b>composite</b> processes of self-representation, {{as a direct result of}} the composite context of the book-roll. In Part II of the thesis, I examine the Mimiambs of Herodas. Through the analysis of Mimiamb 8 (in which Herodas constructs an authorial persona, and defines his poetic programme) in conjunction with an appraisal of the metapoetic dimension of the other Mimiambs, I assess the manner in which Herodas undertakes a complex, intertextual process of self-representation. Arguing that the author reflects upon the generic and medial innovations of his poetic practice across his corpus, I demonstrate that this process of reflection complements Herodas’ overt authorial self-representation in Mimiamb 8. In summary, I argue that the impact of the book-roll on authorial self-representation was wide- ranging, but that the most significant consequence of the medium was the evolution of authorial self-representation as a composite, roll-spanning activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{energetic}} materials Si/Polytetrafluoroethylene/Viton (SiTV) and Al/Polytetrafluoroethylene/Viton (AlTV) have drawn interest recently {{due to the}} increased availability and decreased cost of nano materials. The reactivity of aluminum based {{energetic materials}} is greatly enhanced {{with the use of}} nanometric reactants. Silicon sees order of magnitude increases in burning rate when nano silicon is used in place of micron sized silicon. A broad characterization of the combustion of these <b>composites</b> has been <b>undertaken.</b> Theoretical equilibrium calculations have been performed, as well as characterization of combustion in the instrumented burn tube at various mixture ratios, and pressed pellet burns at different mixture ratios and applied pressures. A comparison of two morphologically different Al materials was also carried out using the instrumented burn tube. ^ Spectroscopic measurements were made of deflagrating SiTV and AlTV pellets. High-speed images were also recorded, and the synchronization of these with the emission spectra provided details the macro scale combustion behavior. Time dependent emission intensity was caused by growing product layers {{on the surface of the}} pellets. Temperatures for each mixture ratio were measured by emission spectroscopy and used as input to three simple combustion models. The Ward, Son, and Brewster model (WSB), the Koch model, and the Williams model were applied to AlTV combustion. The modeling results provided further support of the non constant pressure exponent theory, i. e., that AlTV burns in a transition region between a coupled flame and a condensed phase controlled reaction, resulting in pressure exponents that increase with pressure. ^ Micron sized doped silicon powders were manufactured by ball milling commercially obtained doped silicon wafers. Four powders using different dopants and dopant concentrations were manufactured. These powders were characterized to determine their average particle size, specific surface area, crystalline content, and electrical and thermal properties. The effect of the doping on combustion was investigated by way of pressed pellet burning rate measurements. The burning rate was found to correlate with dopant concentration, regardless of the dopant type. It is proposed that the doping effect can be explained by increased electron mobility or increased lattice defects, both of which are proportional to dopant concentration. ...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} {{are seen as}} an attractive potential replacement for lithium ion batteries in small portable electronic devices. Crucial to the operation of direct methanol fuel cells is the proton exchange membrane, which conducts protons from the anode to the cathode, while acting as an insulator to electrons. The proton exchange membrane should also act as a physical barrier to the methanol and water at the anode, and the air or oxygen at the cathode, however {{the most commonly used}} proton exchange membrane, Nafion, suffers from significant methanol permeation from the anode to the cathode during operation. This results in markedly reduced performance, as the methanol reacts with oxygen at the cathode leading to a mixed potential, and the overall cell efficiency is reduced because the methanol does not react at the anode. Consequently, there is a significant effort in a number of laboratories worldwide to develop new proton exchange materials with high proton conductivity and low methanol permeability, or to modify existing materials such as Nafion to enhance these properties. This thesis examined the effect of modifying Nafion membranes through in situ sol gel synthesis of silicon oxide nanoparticles with varying surface chemistry and microstructure. Detailed structural characterisation of the <b>composite</b> structure was <b>undertaken</b> using a wide variety of techniques including small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, wide-angle X-ray scattering, thermal analysis techniques and positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. Transport properties of the composite membranes were evaluated by impedance spectroscopy and pervaporation techniques. A structural model was proposed to explain the structure of the composite membranes formed using mono-, di- and tri-functional silicon alkoxide precursors. Nafion composite membranes synthesised using (3 -mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane as the silicon alkoxide precursor were found to have highly favourable transport properties. In particular, their selectivity for transport of protons over methanol molecules was found to more than three times that of Nafion 117. The performance of the composite membranes in a 5 cm 2 direct methanol fuel cell was not completely consistent with the transport properties, which was attributed to factors in the preparation of the membrane electrode assemblies...|$|R
40|$|Resorbable {{phosphate}} glass fibre (PGF) reinforced polymer composites {{have been investigated}} for use as fracture fixation plates. While demonstrating impressive initial properties, these composites have shown poor retention of mechanical properties after immersion in a hydrolytic environment. Existing commercially available coupling agents for conventional glass composites have been of limited value and so novel coupling agents have been created specifically for PGF/ Poly (lactide) composites. Previous work on sorbitol-initiated poly (lactide) (S-PLA) oligomers has shown potential both in single fibre and full body composites. This thesis investigates chain length and concentration optimisation of S-PLA based coupling agents on the interfacial properties of PGF reinforced composites, both as manufactured and throughout degradation. S-PLA was synthesised to three different chain lengths: S-PLA_s, S-PLA_m and S-PLA_l where s is short, m – medium and l – long. The oligomers were characterised via NMR, GPC, DSC and FTIR. 40 P 2 O 5 - 24 MgO- 16 CaO- 16 Na 2 O- 4 Fe 2 O 3 (P 40) PGF fibres were produced and coated with S-PLA_s, S-PLA_m and S-PLA_l oligomers. It {{was found that the}} optimum coating concentration depended on the chain length of the oligomer. Initial tensile strength of the coated fibres increased compared to control though the increase was only significant for S-PLA_s coated fibres. A subsequent degradation study of the fibres in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 7 days showed that the tensile strength of the coated fibres decreased significantly compared to that of the control uncoated fibres. S-PLA_l coated fibres had better retention of the tensile strength than the medium and short chain coated fibres. Initial IFSS of embedded S-PLA coated fibres increased significantly compared to that of control but did not differ significantly from each other. A degradation study was conducted for single fibre composites with embedded control and coated fibres immersed in PBS at 37 °C for 7 days. Uncertainty in the true fibre strength during degradation made the IFSS of degraded single fibre composites inconclusive. Full-body <b>composite</b> studies were <b>undertaken</b> to investigate further. Two different methods of application of S-PLA_s on to UD fibre mats were considered: dip coating and spray coating. Composite longitudinal and transverse flexural properties were assessed prior to and after degradation in PBS at 37 °C. The coupling agent improved initial flexural properties and was effective in retaining composite properties for up to 14 days. S-PLA spray coated UD composite samples was more effective in retaining interfacial properties. Water uptake and wet mass change in longitudinal and transverse samples were stable up to 14 days after an initial increase seen at day 1. After day 14 a significant increase in water uptake and wet mass was observed for control composite samples compared to S-PLA coated samples. SEM micrographs and an increase in acidity observed at these time points show advanced fibre dissolution. XRD analysis for composite samples showed a crystallization peak at 16. 5 ° that did not increase in intensity throughout the degradation period indicating that the crystalline phase did not change during the study. The chain length of S-PLA did not appear to affect the IFSS if the appropriate coating concentration was selected. S-PLA_s was selected due to ease of manufacture however the effect of the other chain lengths on macroscopic composite properties needs to be investigated. The method of coupling agent application onto fibre mats did not appear {{to make a difference in}} initial mechanical properties; however the spray coating method shows potential in retarding degradation. This requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist for}} the development of innovative multifunctional textiles for high value market applications. Composites that combine the inherent properties of their all precursor components in a synergistic manner in particular are sought after. Thus the unique chemical and physical properties of silver or silver halide nanoparticles are combined with the traditional properties of wool, thereby producing an innovative multifunctional composite. The prepared wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites retain the elasticity, thermal insulation and softness of the wool, whilst the colour, conductivity and antimicrobial properties owing to the nanoparticles are also incorporated. Due to the multi functions of silver the resulting high quality, high value product has numerous applications within the fashion and interior furnishings industries. The wools employed for the preparation of wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are merino wool and crossbred wool. Merino wool provides the main focus of the research. The experimental approach for the colouring of merino by silver or silver halide nanoparticles follows a novel and proprietary approach. The preparation of wool - silver nanoparticle composites includes two different procedures: 1) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of wool fibres, using an external reducing agent/stabilising agent (trisodium citrate (TSC)), with the in situ binding of nanoparticles {{to the surface of the}} fibre; and 2) the synthesis of nanoparticles in the presence of the merino wool substrate, using the reducing nature of wool, with the in situ binding of nanoparticles within the fibre. Merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites range in colour from very pale yellow, through gold to tan and brown. The successful preparation of wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites includes the in situ precipitation of nanoparticles within the wool fibre. This is accomplished by doping the wool, with one of the halides, Cl⁻, Br⁻ or I⁻, prior to treatment with a silver containing solution. The colour of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites can be tuned from pink to peach to purple. The colour of the wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites is due to surface plasmon resonances, i. e. the interaction of electromagnetic radiation of visible light with the nanoparticles. The reflected colour is dependent upon the size and shape of the nanoparticle, in addition to the refractive index of the stabilising agent surround the particle. The refractive index of silver chloride or silver bromide differs to that of the reducing/stabilising agent implemented, TSC, or merino, and thus the reflected colour is altered. The colour of silver iodide nanoparticles appears to be due to the interaction of light with the formed nanoparticles themselves and not due to the formation of silver nanoparticles within the silver iodide nanoparticles. In addition to the colour being measured by UV-vis in reflectance mode, the characterisation of the hues of the prepared composites were monitored by obtaining CIE L*, a*, b* values via the HunterLab Colourquest. The morphological characterisation of merino wool coloured by silver or silver chloride nanoparticles was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When merino wool - silver nanoparticle composites are prepared using an external reducing agent, the formed nanoparticles predominantly bind to the wool fibres surfaces only. When the reducing nature of wool is used for composite preparation, nanoparticles are formed within the fibre and are dispersed throughout the fibres core, with few being present on the surface. Comparable studies of merino wool - silver halide nanoparticle composites showed that silver halide nanoparticles are formed and stabilised just below the fibres surface. The confirmation of silver or silver halide species within the prepared <b>composites</b> was <b>undertaken</b> using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), scanning transmission spectroscopy (STEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). Colourfastness tests to washing, rubbing and exposure to chlorinated swimming pool water were undertaken to assess the robustness of the prepared composites in terms of their colour. These tests indicate that the colours of both merino wool - silver and - silver chloride nanoparticle composites are very stable. The leaching of silver during the washing process was noted to be insignificant, suggesting a strong and stable bond between the fibre substrate and the nanoparticles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to elucidate the chemical bonding between the wool fibre substrate and the silver or silver halide nanoparticles. The colourfastness of merino wool - silver or - silver halide nanoparticle composites to light however, was not observed. When exposed to UV light for extended periods, a distinct change in colour occurs. Silver nanoparticle composites lighten considerably, whereas their silver chloride nanoparticle counterparts are noted to become grey in their colour. XPS was used in an attempt to determine what leads to the discolouration of the composites. Further research is required however, in order to reduce or halt the colour degradation of merino wool - silver or - silver chloride nanoparticle composites. Silver iodide nanoparticles, on the other hand, show great potential as colourants for wool, exhibiting stable colours over a long time period to light. A range of desirable colours are obtained through the colouring of wool by silver or silver halide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are strongly bound to the fibres and thus the colours are stable to washing and rubbing, exhibiting insignificant leaching of silver during such processes. Additionally, the prepared silver and silver halide nanoparticle composites tested positive for their antistatic properties, and their antimicrobial activity, providing a high value multifunctional material. Numerous applications within fashion and interior furnishing industries are therefore apparent. However, the evident setback for applications in these fields is the colour instability to light of silver, silver chloride and silver bromide nanoparticles, and thus further studies are required to eliminate this problem. Alternative options {{exist for the}} exploitation of the photosensitivity of silver halide nanoparticles within the merino wool composites, or the possibility of using silver or silver halide nanoparticles in combination with other strong dyes for the production of coloured woollen fabrics...|$|R
