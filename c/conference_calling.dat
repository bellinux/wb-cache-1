5|$|In June 1893, {{when the}} Australasian Federal League was formed {{at a meeting}} in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined {{immediately}} and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 Bathurst Conference, informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the Australian Natives' Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the <b>Conference,</b> <b>calling</b> on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.|$|E

She was also very critical of the UN for failing to impose an arms embargo on Burma after Russia and China blocked a Security Council motion. Later, she met with then-British prime minister Gordon Brown to encourage imposition of a trade embargo with the Burmese.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} market {{participants}} {{learn from the}} information that is disseminated during the Q-and-A section of <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> Specifically, we investigate whether stock prices react to information on intangible assets provided during <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> and whether <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> interactions with analysts affect managerial disclosure strategies. Based on an analysis of over 7, 000 earnings <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> we document that intangible asset disclosures in <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> have information content for market participants. We also provide evidence that managers {{are more likely to}} provide information on intangible assets in the presentation of a <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> once the issue is raised in the Q&A-section of a previous <b>conference</b> <b>call.</b> The likelihood that managers provide such information is moderated by stock price effects during the previous <b>conference</b> <b>call...</b>|$|R

40|$|Many firms {{conduct a}} <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> with analysts {{shortly after the}} {{quarterly}} earnings announcement. In these calls, management discusses the completed quarter, and analysts can ask questions. Due to SEC requirements, <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in the United States are virtually always live webcasted. A growing number of investors listens in on <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> suggesting that calls are useful for investor decision-making. This research clarifies the role of <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> by analysing a large sample of <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> transcripts, analyst forecasts, and contemporaneous stock market reactions. The study investigates why <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> are useful. The analysis shows that managers who provide little information in their presentation are actively probed by analysts, and the discussion with analysts becomes longer. Hence, the interactivity of the call enriches the information environment. In a second study, evidence is presented that information about intangible assets {{is one of the}} items in <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> that moves stock markets. This study also shows that managers use the <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> to learn about the information needs of analysts with respect to intangible assets. A third study, suggests that sell-side analysts do not voice their true beliefs on <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in an attempt to favour their buy-side clients. Collectively, these results provide evidence that <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> with analysts enrich the information environment, but their usefulness may be restricted by analyst incentives...|$|R
25|$|Telecommuting is the {{performance}} within a traditional worker and employer relationship {{when it is}} facilitated by tools such as groupware, virtual private networks, <b>conference</b> <b>calling,</b> videoconferencing, and voice over IP (VOIP) so that work may be performed from any location, most conveniently the worker's home. It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost. As broadband Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks.|$|E
25|$|From January to March 1970 Rúhíyyih Khanum crossed Africa {{from east}} to west visiting many country's {{communities}} including Cameroon, meeting with individuals and institutions both Bahá'í and civic. In October 1971 Rúhíyyih Khanum returned from western Africa. She stopped for a time in Mamfe and spoke to the Bahá'ís there and emphasized {{the role of women in}} the growth of the religion. From Mamfe she traveled more widely seeing villages and regional chiefs, attending weddings and giving talks at schools. In many places she took note of women in prominent positions in the community and sometimes spoke to about the Bahá'í law of monogamy to contrast with the traditional cultural practice of polygamy and other traditional forms. A prominent meeting was of the regional <b>conference</b> <b>calling</b> for the progress of the religion in the region. She took part in the program of observances of United Nations Day sharing the stage with members of the staff of the Secretary-General of the UN as well as the staff of the Prime Minister of Cameroon. Reaching Buea she met with the Prime Minister and mentioned her wide travels in relative safety with kind assistance of villagers and truck drivers. From there she continued her travels through Douala and Yaounde and in each case also neighboring villages while also making time for radio interviews and at the University of Cameroon before moving on to Zaire.|$|E

As a result of the summit, Hitler was selected Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} Regulation Fair Disclosure (FD) on the relevance of company-sponsored <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> Measuring relevance by a <b>conference</b> <b>call's</b> ability to improve analyst forecast accuracy and consensus, I find larger improvements in both variables during the period surrounding <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in the post-FD era versus the pre-FD era. These findings imply that in the post-FD era relatively more about a firm's upcoming earnings becomes known during <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> consistent with FD's success in eliminating selective disclosure.

40|$|Using {{computer}} based content analysis, we quantify the linguistic tone of quarterly earnings <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> for publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). After {{controlling for the}} earnings announcement, we examine the relation between <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> tone and the contemporaneous stock price reaction. We find that {{the tone of the}} <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> dialogue has significant explanatory power for the abnormal returns at and immediately following quarterly earnings announcements. The question and answer portion of the <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> dominate prepared managerial introductory remarks in explanatory significance. Furthermore, an overall positive tone in the <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> discussion between management and analysts is found to nearly offset the damaging effects of a negative earnings surprise...|$|R

In addition to FDNY, six rescue boat crews from Coast Guard Station New York, a Coast Guard rescue helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, several Coast Guard Auxiliary assets, the New York City Police Department (NYPD), New Jersey State Police, and local emergency services all participated in the rescue effort. The Red Cross and the New York Harbor Police also assisted in the efforts. At about 3:00p.m., Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, addressed questions in a press <b>conference.</b> <b>Calling</b> the crash [...] "an accident which {{we do not believe}} was survivable," [...] Bloomberg announced that the mission was no longer a rescue mission, but rather a recovery mission.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> provide additional information to analysts. For a large sample of <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> hosted by German firms between 2004 and 2007, our {{results show that}} <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> improve analysts’ ability to forecast future earnings accurately. This suggests that additional information is released during <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> The reduction in forecast error is economically significant and larger in magnitude when compared to results for the US (Bowen et al., 2002). These {{findings are consistent with}} the notion that commiting to additional disclosures is likely to yield greater effects in a less stringent disclosure system (Verrecchia, 2001). Since the majority of our sample firms conduct <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> as closed calls, the evidence of this paper suggests that <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> may contribute to an information gap between call participants and non-invited parties. Our findings should be of substantial interest to European regulators seeking to level the informational playing field for all investors...|$|R
40|$|The SEC advises {{firms to}} release all {{material}} information in their earnings announcement press release before their corresponding <b>conference</b> <b>call.</b> Until May 2009, the NYSE went further by explicitly prohibiting {{the disclosure of}} new material information in a <b>conference</b> <b>call.</b> However, we document that the S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 firms, including those that are NYSE-listed, disclose a non-trivial amount of management guidance exclusively in their <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> Firms in challenging forecasting environments rely more on the <b>conference</b> <b>call,</b> probably because the call enables managers to “flesh out” the guidance. In contrast, firms with relatively low investor visibility and high litigation risk rely less on the <b>conference</b> <b>call,</b> likely due to regulatory concerns. Finally, after controlling for the information released at the earnings announcement, we find greater magnitudes of analyst forecast revisions for firms that provide relatively more management guidance exclusively in their <b>conference</b> <b>call.</b> Collectively, our findings highlight the emerging use of non-traditional disclosure channels...|$|R
40|$|Telephone <b>calls</b> and multi-party <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> are {{transmitted}} {{and controlled by}} computer much like electronic documents. However, the way we traditionally use <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> {{is very different from}} the way we use documents. This is primarily due to the transient unstructured nature of audio, and the lack of tools for managing, manipulating, and displaying telephone conversations and <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> This work is aimed at letting people use <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> in many of the same ways that they use documents. This paper describes a system for turning <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> into archived documents that can be browsed, skimmed, displayed, hyperlinked and annotated on the World Wide Web. The “Conference Scribe ” system has three principle components: the “SkimServer ” for recording and playback, the “IDB Server ” for storing and retrieving time stamped labels, and a Java applet for interactively skimming recordings. The parallels between <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> and documents are reviewed, and form the basis for the design of the system. 1...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} analyst information intermediary roles using a textual analysis of analyst reports and corporate disclosures. We employ a topic modeling methodology from computational linguistic research {{to compare the}} thematic content of a large sample of analyst reports issued promptly after earnings <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> with {{the content of the}} calls themselves. We show that analysts discuss exclusive topics beyond those from <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> and interpret topics from <b>conference</b> <b>calls.</b> In addition, we find that investors place a greater value on new information in analyst reports when managers face greater incentives to withhold value-relevant information. Analyst interpretation is particularly valuable when the processing costs of <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> information increase. Finally, we document that investors react to analyst report content that simply confirms managers’ <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> discussions. Overall, our study shows that analysts play the information intermediary roles by discovering information beyond corporate disclosures and by clarifying and confirming corporate disclosures...|$|R
40|$|<b>Conference</b> <b>calls</b> {{have become}} {{increasingly}} common in recent years, yet there is little empirical evidence regarding the effect of <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> on executive compensation. In this study, we {{examine the effect of}} voluntary disclosures on equity incentives. We hypothesize that voluntary disclosures, as measured by <b>conference</b> <b>calls,</b> affect executive compensation contracts. Using a dataset of 6263 firm-year observations from both <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> and non-conference call firms, our results are consistent with the argument that the board of directors substitutes voluntary disclosures for more costly corporate governance mechanisms. Alternatively, in firms where CEOs have less equity incentives, the owners demand more voluntary disclosures. The results of this study should be of great importance to executives and capital market participants internationally, such as investors and analysts, since we provide evidence that <b>conference</b> <b>calls</b> affect incentive based compensation contracts, which were shown in prior studies to be value relevant...|$|R
