40|$|Purpose: (1) To {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} <b>contact</b> lens wear on straylight in rigid and soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers and (2) to relate findings to morphological changes and subjective complaints. Methods: Straylight was measured using the Oculus C-Quant during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal in 30 rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers and 30 soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers. Semi-quantitative (0 - 4) slit-lamp grading of anterior segment changes using Efron grading scales and <b>contact</b> lens characteristics were performed. Subjects answered a straylight questionnaire. Results: Soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight of logarithmic value of the straylight parameter [log(s) ] = 0. 934 during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal [comparable to log(s) = 0. 938 of age-matched normal eyes]. Rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers had a mean straylight during <b>contact</b> lens wear of log(s) = 1. 167. After <b>contact</b> lens removal, log(s) significantly decreased to 0. 997 (P < 0. 01). Straylight values with rigid <b>contact</b> lenses were strongly increased (P < 0. 001) compared with age-matched normal eyes; after <b>contact</b> lens removal, these values decreased but remained elevated. Straylight in rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers correlated {{with the amount of}} deposits on the <b>contact</b> lens (P < 0. 01) but not with other variables of the <b>contact</b> lens score. The questionnaire showed more straylight complaints in rigid <b>contact</b> lens wearers than in soft <b>contact</b> lens wearers (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: Rigid <b>contact</b> lens wear leads to increased straylight during <b>contact</b> lens wear and after <b>contact</b> lens removal. This may be because of subclinical effects of <b>contact</b> lens wear on the cornea and is not seen in soft <b>contact</b> lens wearer...|$|R

40|$|This {{sequel to}} our {{previous}} paper [MS 11 b] continues {{the study of}} topological <b>contact</b> dynamics and applications to <b>contact</b> dynamics and topological dynamics. We provide further evidence that the topological automorphism groups of a <b>contact</b> structure and a <b>contact</b> form are the appropriate transformation groups of <b>contact</b> dynamical systems. The article includes {{an examination of the}} groups of time-one maps of topological <b>contact</b> and strictly <b>contact</b> isotopies, and the construction of a bi-invariant metric on the latter. Moreover, every topological <b>contact</b> or strictly <b>contact</b> dynamical system is arbitrarily close to a continuous <b>contact</b> or strictly <b>contact</b> dynamical system with the same end point. In particular, the above groups of time-one maps are independent of the choice of norm in the definition of the <b>contact</b> distance. On every <b>contact</b> manifold we construct topological <b>contact</b> dynamical systems with time-one maps that fail to be Lipschitz continuous, and smooth <b>contact</b> vector fields whose flows are topologically conjugate but not conjugate by a <b>contact</b> C^ 1 -diffeomorphism.

40|$|We {{introduce}} topological <b>contact</b> {{dynamics of}} a smooth manifold carrying a cooriented <b>contact</b> structure, generalizing previous {{work in the}} case of a symplectic structure [MO 07] or a <b>contact</b> form [BS 12]. A topological <b>contact</b> isotopy is not generated by a vector field; nevertheless, the group identities, the transformation law, and classical uniqueness results in the smooth case extend to topological <b>contact</b> isotopies and homeomorphisms, giving rise to an extension of smooth <b>contact</b> dynamics to topological dynamics. Our approach is via symplectization of a <b>contact</b> manifold, and our main tools are an energy-capacity inequality we prove for <b>contact</b> diffeomorphisms, combined with techniques from measure theory on oriented manifolds.
