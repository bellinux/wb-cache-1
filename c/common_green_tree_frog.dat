40|$|Virulence of {{infectious}} pathogens can be unstable and evolve rapidly {{depending on the}} evolutionary dynamics of the organism. Experimental evolution {{can be used to}} characterize pathogen evolution, often with the underlying objective of understanding evolution of virulence. We used experimental evolution techniques (serial transfer experiments) to investigate differential growth and virulence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a fungal pathogen that causes amphibian chytridiomycosis. We tested two lineages of Bd that were derived from a single cryo-archived isolate; one lineage (P 10) was passaged 10 times, whereas the second lineage (P 50) was passaged 50 times. We quantified time to zoospore release, maximum zoospore densities, and timing of zoospore activity and then modeled population growth rates. We also conducted exposure experiments with a susceptible amphibian species, the <b>common</b> <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Litoria caerulea) to test the differential pathogenicity. We found that the P 50 lineage had shorter time to zoospore production (Tmin), faster rate of sporangia death (ds), and an overall greater intrinsic population growth rate (λ). These patterns of population growth in vitro corresponded with higher prevalence and intensities of infection in exposed Litoria caerulea, although the differences were not significant. Our results corroborate studies that suggest that Bd may be able to evolve relatively rapidly. Our findings also challenge the general assumption that pathogens will always attenuate in culture because shifts in Bd virulence may depend on laboratory culturing practices. These findings have practical implications for the laboratory maintenance of Bd isolates and underscore the importance of understanding the evolution of virulence in amphibian chytridiomycosis...|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases {{are a significant}} issue for amphibian conservation and the global spread of chytridiomycosis has decimated many frog populations. As well as developing effective disease management strategies, {{it is crucial to}} improve surveillance and health monitoring for the early detection and prevention of other emerging diseases. The aims of this research were to investigate emerging and endemic amphibian diseases in Queensland, to evaluate amphibian disease surveillance techniques, and to study the effect of chytridiomycosis on the host immune system. Significant diseases, including two new anuran pathogens, were discovered through the passive disease surveillance network I established at James Cook University in Cairns. Over 160 sick or dead amphibian specimens were received from various sources. Papovavirus particles were identified with electron microscopy in a dermal squamous papilloma from a white-lipped tree frog (Litoria infrafrenata). Subsequent PCR testing to further classify the virus was unsuccessful. This is the first known report describing a viral aetiology for dermal papillomas in anurans. Systemic microsporidiosis was diagnosed histologically in a <b>common</b> <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (L. caerulea), and electron microscopic analysis identified the organism as belonging to the genus Anncaliia. This is the first known report of Anncaliia species infection, and only the third published report of a pathogenic microsporidial infection, in amphibians. A new endemic disease in L. infrafrenata, manifesting as irreversible emaciation, was detected by retrospective analysis of syndromic submission data from a community frog group. I identified the cestode Spirometra erinacei as a likely primary aetiologic agent of this fatal wasting syndrome. Over a six-year period, 877 L. infrafrenata submitted to the community group were classified according to origin, season and presenting category. Irreversible emaciation accounted for 9...|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{multimodal}} signaling {{is believed to}} help facilitate the courtship process in many species. One such species in which multimodal signaling is seen to improve mating success is in the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Hyla cinerea). Many anuran amphibians, such as the <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog,</b> may use visual cues as well as auditory signals to increase their chances of impressing a mate. When the calls of the <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> were held equal, {{it was determined that}} females tended to overlook an auditory-only stimulus in favor of males who combined auditory/visual multimodal signal. It was seen that female <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frogs</b> preferred when males coupled the visual display with the auditory communication, concluding that male <b>green</b> <b>tree</b> that are visually accessible can increase their probability of mating success.|$|R
