40|$|Conflict-driven problem solvers such as GDE use {{previously}} discovered conflicts {{to guide}} further search through the candidate space. To do so, ATMS-based problem solvers employ an inference engine that performs two fundamentally different tasks: Checking a given assumption set for consistency and predicting values for system variables under given assumptions. In this paper, we show how separating {{the tasks of}} <b>conflict</b> <b>search</b> and prediction of values leads to a problem solver that can guarantee completeness and correctness of the consistency check for a given assumption set, and how this {{can be used to}} effectively guide the search for minimal conflicts. We develop an inference engine based on aggregation of relational models that can be shown to have the above properties, provided that three basic operations on relations are available. As a consequence, we can complement conflict-driven diagnosis by a new paradigm called consistency-driven search for conflicts. To illustrate these points, we present a diagnostic algorithm that exploits and implements these ideas by operating on binary aggregation trees. We argue that this algorithm is especially suited for the application in on-board diagnostic environments, where the set of observable variables remains fixed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 55 - 56) Predicted {{increases in}} air traffic are driving {{a paradigm shift}} in the Air Traffic Management system. The ATM research community has identified the adoption of Trajectory-Based Operations a viable concept of operation to accommodate the traffic growth while maintaining system safety and efficiency. This transition would require pilots and controllers to use trial planner tools to create, evaluate, modify trajectories that are exchanged between the ground and airborne systems. However, various lags (e. g., in communications or computation of trajectories) can induce delays in providing the feedback to the user during <b>conflict</b> <b>search</b> and trial planning processes. This research addresses this issue by conducting an experiment to {{study the effects of}} feedback delays on pilots during conflict detection and avoidance tasks. Twelve pilots participated in 40 en-route flight part-task simulations that required them to avoid separation violations with surrounding aircraft while maintaining flight safety and fuel efficiency. Actual air traffic over Kansas City airspace was simulated in the experiment and scaled to have moderate and higher density than current day level. The traffic was displayed on the NASA Ames Cockpit Situation Display, which featured a trial planner tool equipped with conflict alerting functionality. Feedback delays of 0, 2, 4 and 8 seconds were added to the conflict alerting functionality to observe any significant changes in pilot comfort as well as route efficiency and safety. Irrespective of the levels of feedback delays, pilots showed no significant decrease in performance in moderate traffic density simulations. However, the results were considerably different in the high traffic density condition, where the efficiency decreased significantly at levels of delay greater than 0 seconds and the pilot decision time increased significantly. In addition, pilots were more likely to commit to unsafe routes in high-density conditions with feedback delays greater than 0 seconds. It is reasonable to assume that delays are impossible to completely eradicate, but perhaps they need not be completely removed from these systems to successfully meet flight and business objectives. With thorough calculations stakeholders may be able to extrapolate the amount of feedback delay that can be deemed as acceptable in order to meet safety as well as business requirements...|$|E
40|$|The Egyptian {{society today}} is facing many socio-economical, {{political}} and cultural challenges that are directly influencing the living standards and circumstances of its members despite {{their position in the}} society's hierarchy. The most important of these challenges is the struggle between the Inherited and the Imported that takes the modernization processes that were repeatedly implemented by the different rulers and elite class of the society as its active field. These modernization processes almost always mean Westernization. They have resulted in the separation of the society into two distinct segments; a Westernized rich and powerful high-middle class and up, and a more or less traditional poor and powerless low-middle class and down. As a direct result of these challenges the society is experiencing problems of inequality, class <b>conflict,</b> <b>search</b> for identity, among many others. These problems have a great impact on the living standards {{of the majority of the}} society. Additionally, they greatly influence the power relations both between the different segments of the society and between the society as a whole and the Western societies. This thesis discusses some of the attitudes and positions towards this issue of the Inherited versus the Imported and the problems that resulted from it. It attempts to achieve this from within the architectural profession by taking the attitudes, theories and works of two contemporary Egyptian architects [...] Abdel Halim Ibrahim Abdel Halim and Carnal Bakri [...] as examples of the moderate position that tries to rid itself from any emotional or unrealistic biases towards either end. Through the study of the origins and the nature of these two architects' attitudes, theories and works I have showed how they have raised the level of sophistication and complexity of the discussion of these challenges. In other words, certain levels of reconciliations have been achieved. Nevertheless, despite these reconciliations that narrow the gap between a number of polarities within the Egyptian society and despite the agreement on the nature of the main issues at stack, issues of the role of the Egyptian architect in the development process, the nature of the architectural profession [...] being an art form or a social reform tool, how to deal with the latest available technologies that appear in the West, the universality of the current dominant civilization versus the regional identity of each society, and why and how do we relate to history, among many others, are still being debated. Thus, clear biases are evident in the two architects' underlying attitudes towards the two poles of this dilemma. by Yasser M. Nabil. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|AbstractFunctional {{cerebral}} asymmetries, {{once thought}} to be exclusively human, are now accepted to be a widespread principle of brain organization in vertebrates [1]. The prevalence of lateralization makes it likely that it has some major advantage. Until now, however, conclusive evidence has been lacking. To analyze the relation between the extent of cerebral asymmetry and the degree of performance in visual foraging, we studied grain–grit discrimination success in pigeons, a species with a left hemisphere dominance for visual object processing [2, 3]. The birds performed the task under left-eye, right-eye or binocular seeing conditions. In most animals, right-eye seeing was superior to left-eye seeing performance, and binocular performance was higher than each monocular level. The absolute difference between left- and right-eye levels was defined as a measure for the degree of visual asymmetry. Animals with higher asymmetries were more successful in discriminating grain from grit under binocular conditions. This shows that an increase in visual asymmetry enhances success in visually guided foraging. Possibly, asymmetries of the pigeon’s visual system increase the computational speed of object recognition processes by concentrating them into one hemisphere while preventing {{the other side of the}} brain from initiating <b>conflicting</b> <b>search</b> sequences of its own...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{identity}} {{is one of}} the main issues that encounters man in each culture. Identity is a set of behaviors, emotions, and thought patterns which are unique to every individual that define him as a member of a certain group. Identity is shaped by race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, language, physical features, childhood experiences, sexual  preferences and culture. Moreover, identity is usually recognized during adolescence or early adulthood in which both positive and negative features are essential in the development of individual identity. However, an identity crisis is the failure to establish identity during that age. In addition, an identity crisis is not only concerned with matters such as ethnicity or religion as it is also concerned with inner <b>conflicts,</b> <b>search</b> for identity, west vs. east, old Vs. modern.

40|$|PhDThe {{international}} migration of Colombians has received little attention, either at academic or policy levels. This research explores Colombian migration to Spain and the UK. Its main {{aim is to}} study the transnational political activities of Colombian migrants, {{in the context of}} the armed <b>conflict</b> and <b>search</b> for peace in Colombia, by taking a gendered perspective. The theoretical and conceptual frameworks draw from several research areas, mainly work on diasporas and transnational migration, and studies of armed conflict and peace. Given that these fields of study are rarely combined, this thesis provides an innovative conceptual approach. The current research is based on qualitative fieldwork conducted in the UK and Spain between 2005 and 2007, and comprising almost 100 interviews and participant observation. The main empirical finding is that Colombian migrants are an integral part of the political context in the home country, despite the emphasis by other studies on the polarisation, fragmentation and apolitical nature of the diaspora. Conceptually, this thesis argues for the need to de-construct political transnationalism, to account for: activities emerging from 'above' and 'below', 'individual' and 'collective' participation in formal and informal politics; and the connections between political participation in the countries of origin and settlement. Also, it shows that migrants' transnational politics varies according to gender, as well as other factors, mainly type of migration and social class. More importantly, the transnational political activities of Colombians abroad relate directly/indirectly to the armed <b>conflict</b> and <b>search</b> for peace in Colombia. Future research and policy-making should take into account the potential of this for civil society peace-building efforts, especially seeking to promote a gendered perspective...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{constrained}} and unconstrained {{versions of}} a new formulation of Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ACOA) named Arc Based Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (ABACOA) are augmented with the Tree Growing Algorithm (TGA) and used for the optimal layout and pipe size design of gravitational sewer networks. The main advantages offered by the proposed ABACOA formulation are proper definition of heuristic information, a useful component of the ant-based algorithms, and proper trade-off between the two <b>conflicting</b> <b>search</b> attributes of exploration and exploitation. In both the formulations, the TGA is used to incrementally construct feasible tree-like layouts out of the base layout. In the first formulation, unconstrained version of ABACOA is {{used to determine the}} nodal cover depths of sewer pipes while in the second formulation, a constrained version of ABACOA is used to determine the nodal cover depths of sewer pipes which satisfy the pipe slopes constraint. Three different methods of cut determination are also proposed to complete the construction of a tree-like network containing all base layout pipes, here. The proposed formulations are used to solve three test examples of different scales and the results are presented and compared with other available results in the literature. Comparison of the results shows that best results are obtained using the third cutting method in both the formulations. In addition, the results indicate the ability of the proposed methods and in particular the constrained version of ABACOA equipped with TGA to solve sewer networks design optimization problem. To be specific, the constrained version of ABACOA has been able to produce results 0. 1 %, 1 % and 2. 1 % cheaper than those obtained by the unconstrained version of ABACOA for the first, second and the third test examples, respectively...|$|R
