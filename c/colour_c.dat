40|$|Consider {{a simple}} graph G=(V,E) of maximum degree Δ and its proper total <b>colouring</b> <b>c</b> with the {{elements}} of the set { 1, 2, [...] .,k}. The <b>colouring</b> <b>c</b> is said to be neighbour sum distinguishing if for every pair of adjacent vertices u, v, we have c(u) +∑_e∋ uc(e) ≠ c(v) +∑_e∋ vc(e). The least integer k for which it exists is denoted by χ"_∑(G), hence χ"_∑(G) ≥Δ+ 1. On the other hand, it has been daringly conjectured that just one more label than presumed in the famous Total Colouring Conjecture suffices to construct such total <b>colouring</b> <b>c,</b> i. e., that χ"_∑(G) ≤Δ+ 3 for all graphs. We support this inequality by proving its asymptotic version, χ"_∑(G) ≤ (1 +o(1)) Δ. The major part of the construction confirming this relays on a random assignment of colours, where the choice for every edge is biased by so called attractors, randomly assigned to the vertices, and the probabilistic result of Molloy and Reed on the Total Colouring Conjecture itself.

In this paper we present a colour {{edge detection}} procedure designed to find edges between homogeneous regions of particular colours.

A hypercomplex filter is then used to highlight edges between a region of <b>colour</b> <b>C</b> 1 to a region of <b>colour</b> <b>C</b> 2.

40|$|Research on {{the colour}} {{conditions}} for perceptual transparency {{has focused on}} variants of the episcotister model proposed by Metelli. These additive models {{have been found to}} describe the luminance conditions for perceptual transparency in achromatic displays very accurately, but they are less successful in the chromatic domain. We propose an alternative psychophysical model that is based on filter transparency. A computer simulation revealed that this model does indeed describe colour relations that are found in situations where a surface is covered by a transparent filter more accurately than the additive model. In two psychophysical experiments we compared the predictions of the filter model directly with those of the additive model. In a four-colour stimulus, three colours were fixed {{in such a way that}} both models made unique and clearly different predictions for the remaining <b>colour</b> <b>C.</b> The subjects then searched for the <b>colour</b> <b>C</b> that optimised their impression of transparency.

Cepaea is also a pre-eminent model for ecological genetics because the outward colour and banding phenotype is entirely genetically determined, primarily by a ‘supergene’ of at least five loci. Unfortunately, progress in understanding the evolution and maintenance of the Cepaea polymorphism stalled, partly because of a lack of genetic markers. With a view to re-establish Cepaea as a prominent model of molecular ecology, we made six laboratory crosses of Cepaea nemoralis, five of which segregated for shell ground <b>colour</b> (<b>C)</b> and the presence or absence of bands (B). First, scoring of colour and banding in 323 individuals found no recombination between the C and B loci of the supergene.

The genotype of eleven of the most promising RAD-Seq markers was independently validated in the same 22 offspring, then up to a further 146 offspring were genotyped.

40|$|A {{colouring}} of a graph is ecological {{if every}} pair of vertices {{that have the}} same set of colours in their neighbourhood are coloured alike. We consider the following problem: if a graph G and an ecological <b>colouring</b> <b>c</b> of G are given, can further vertices added to G, one at a time, be coloured so that at each stage the current graph is ecologically coloured? If the answer is yes, then we say that the pair (G,c) is ecologically online extendible. By generalizing the well-known First-Fit algorithm, we are able to characterize when (G,c) is ecologically online extendible, and to show that deciding whether (G,c) is ecologically extendible can be done in polynomial time. We also describe when the extension is possible using only colours from a given finite set C. For the case where <b>c</b> is a <b>colouring</b> of G in which each vertex is coloured distinctly, we give a simple characterization of when (G,c) is ecologically online extendible using only the <b>colours</b> of <b>c,</b> and we also show that (G,c) is always online extendible using the <b>colours</b> of <b>c</b> plus one extra colour. We also study (off-line) ecological H-colourings (an H-colouring of G is a homomorphism from G to H).
