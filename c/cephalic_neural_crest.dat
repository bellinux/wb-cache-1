40|$|AbstractMost of the bone, cartilage, and {{connective}} tissue of the craniofacial region arise from <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. Presumably, patterning differences in crest cells {{are a result}} of regional action of transcription factors within the developing pharyngeal arches. The basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor dHAND/HAND 2 is expressed throughout much of the neural crest-derived mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in craniofacial development. However, targeted inactivation of the dHAND gene results in embryonic lethality by E 10. 5 due to vascular defects, preventing further analysis of the role of dHAND in <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell development. In order to examine putative roles of dHAND during later stages of embryogenesis, we have used a transgenic lineage marker approach, in which a portion of the dHAND upstream region containing an enhancer that directs dHAND expression to the pharyngeal arches is used to drive Cre recombinase expression. By crossing these dHAND-Cre transgenic mice with R 26 R mice, we can follow the fate of cells that expressed dHAND at any time during development by examining β-galactosidase activity. We show that dHAND is first expressed in postmigratory <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells within the pharyngeal arches. In older embryos, β-galactosidase-labeled cells are observed in most of the neural crest-derived lower jaw skeleton and surrounding {{connective tissue}}s. However, labeled cells only contribute to substructures within the middle ear, indicating that our transgene is not globally expressed in <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells within the pharyngeal arches. Moreover, dHAND-Cre mice will provide a valuable tool for tissue-specific inactivation of gene expression in multiple tissue types of neural crest origin...|$|E

In the present study the mesectodermal capabilities of trunk and lumbar neural crest were investigated at early stages of development by heterotopic, heterospecific transplantation of the neural primordium. The quail-chick nuclear marker system was used to identify the grafted cells. Mesectodermal cells did not arise from the trunk neural crest when this was implanted orthotopically, even though the neural primordium was taken early in development at the level of unsegmented plate mesoderm just anterior to Hensen's node. Mesectodermal derivatives (connective tissues, dermis and muscle but no cartilage or bone) developed from the same trunk neural crest fragments when they were hetero-topically grafted at the cephalic level and mixed with host <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. These host <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells emigrated from the contralateral neural primordium when the graft was unilateral or from the fringe area of the operation in cases of bilateral trans-plantations. As a control, unsegmented paraxial mesoderm was inserted alongside the cephalic neural tube; its cells did not migrate ventrally in the neural crest-derived area and they differentiated in the dorsal region of the host. These results indicate that mesectodermal capabilities, though reduced, exist in the trunk neural crest at early stages of development but the differentiation of these mesectodermal derivatives is largely dependent upon environmental influences which may be found in early cephalic levels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceUveal {{melanoma}} is {{the most}} common intraocular malignancy in adults, representing between about 4 % and 5 % of all melanomas. High expression levels of Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4 A 3, a dual phosphatase, is highly predictive of metastasis development and PTP 4 A 3 overexpression in uveal melanoma cells increases their in vitro migration and in vivo invasiveness. Melanocytes, including uveal melanocytes, are derived from the neural crest during embryonic development. We therefore suggested that PTP 4 A 3 function in uveal melanoma metastasis may be related to an embryonic role during neural crest cell migration. We show that PTP 4 A 3 plays a role in <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> development in Xenopus laevis. PTP 4 A 3 loss of function resulted in a reduction of neural crest territory, whilst gain of function experiments increased neural crest territory. Isochronic graft experiments demonstrated that PTP 4 A 3 -depleted neural crest explants are unable to migrate in host embryos. Pharmacological inhibition of PTP 4 A 3 on dissected neural crest cells significantly reduced their migration velocity in vitro. Our results demonstrate that PTP 4 A 3 is required for <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> migration in vivo during embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|Apc is a gene {{associated}} with {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} coli (FAP) and its inactivation is a critical step in colorectal tumor formation. The protein product, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), acts to down-regulate intracellular levels of β-catenin, a key signal transducer in the Wnt signaling. Conditional targeting of Apc in the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> of mice caused massive apoptosis of <b>cephalic</b> and cardiac <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells at about 11. 5 days post coitum, resulting in craniofacial and cardiac anomalies at birth.

40|$|Autophagy plays a very {{important}} role in numerous physiological and pathological events. However, it still remains unclear whether Atg 7 -induced autophagy is involved in the regulation of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell production. In this study, we found the co-location of Atg 7 and Pax 7 + <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells in early chick embryo development. Upregulation of Atg 7 with unilateral transfection of full-length Atg 7 increased Pax 7 + and HNK- 1 + <b>cephalic</b> and trunk <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell numbers compared to either Control-GFP transfection or opposite neural tubes, suggesting that Atg 7 over-expression in neural tubes could enhance the production of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. BMP 4 in situ hybridization and p-Smad 1 / 5 / 8 immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that upregulation of Atg 7 in neural tubes suppressed the BMP 4 /Smad signaling, which is considered to promote the delamination of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. Interestingly, upregulation of Atg 7 in neural tubes could significantly accelerate cell progression into the S phase, implying that Atg 7 modulates cell cycle progression. However, β-catenin expression was not significantly altered. Finally, we demonstrated that upregulation of the Atg 7 gene could activate autophagy as did Atg 8. We have also observed that similar phenotypes, such as more HNK- 1 + <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells in the unilateral Atg 8 transfection side of neural tubes, and the transfection with full-length Atg 8 -GFP certainly promote the numbers of BrdU+ <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells in comparison to the GFP control. Taken together, we reveal that Atg 7 -induced autophagy is involved in regulating the production of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells in early chick embryos through the modification of the cell cycle...|$|R

Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is proteolytically generated from its inactive precursor by endothelin-converting enzyme- 1 (ECE- 1) and acts on the endothelin-A (ETA) receptor. Genetic disruption of this ET- 1 /ECE- 1 /ETA pathway results in defects in branchial arch- derived craniofacial tissues, as well as defects in cardiac outflow and great vessel structures, which are derived from <b>cephalic</b> (cardiac) <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> In this study, in situ hybridization of ETA-/- and ECE- 1 (-) /- embryos with a cardiac <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> marker, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein- 1, shows that the migration of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells from the neural tube to cardiac outflow tract is not affected in these embryos. Immunostaining of an endothelial marker, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule CD- 31, shows that the initial formation of the branchial arch arteries is not disturbed in ETA-/- or ECE- 1 (-) /- embryos. To visualize the subsequent patterning of arch vessels in detail, we generated ETA-/- or ECE- 1 (-) /- embryos that expressed an SM 22 alpha-lacZ marker transgene in arterial smooth muscle cells. Wholemount X-gal staining of these mutant embryos reveals that the abnormal regression and persistence of specific arch arteries results in disturbance of asymmetrical remodeling of the arch arteries. These defects include abnormal regression of arch arteries 4 and 6, enlargement of arch artery 3, and abnormal persistence of the bilateral ductus caroticus and right dorsal aorta. These abnormalities eventually lead to various types of great vessel malformations highly similar to those seen in neural crest-ablated chick embryos and human congenital cardiac defects. This study demonstrates that ET- 1 /ETA-mediated signaling plays an essential role in a complex process of aortic arch patterning by affecting the postmigratory cardiac <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell development...|$|R

There {{is evidence}} to suggest that the skeletogenic fate of the hindbrain neural crest is specified before emigration from the neural tube and that Antennapedia class Hox genes are involved in that process. To explore the putative causal link between Hox expression and craniofacial morphology, we produced a specific series of bilateral crest deletions in chick embryos and assessed branchial arch morphology, Hox gene expression, and patterning of skeletal structures in the postoperative embryo. Surprisingly, we found that deletion of the bulk of the rhombencephalic crest and substantial portions of the dorsal rhombencephalon did not prevent normal branchial arch morphogenesis and normal patterns of Hox gene (-A 3 and -B 4) expression 48 h after operation. Neural crest-like cells have been identified on crest migration pathways {{at the level of the}} original ablation, further confirming that ablated <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> is replaced by regeneration from the cut edge of the neuroepithelium. Furthermore, in such embryos ectomesenchyme from regenerated crest is able to form a facial skeleton in which the mandible and hyoid apparatus are normal in size and organization.

40|$|ADAM 13 is a cell surface {{metalloprotease}} {{expressed in}} <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells during early Xenopus development. The cytoplasmic domain of ADAM 13 contains three potential SH 3 (Src homology type 3) binding sites, {{suggesting that this}} region may support interactions with intracellular proteins. In this report we describe the identification, by a new strategy, of three proteins that bind the ADAM 13 cytoplasmic domain in vitro: X-Src 1, X-An 4, and X-PACSIN 2. We focused our study on X-PACSIN 2 protein because it colocalizes with ADAM 13 in migrating neural crest cells during embryonic development. Using pull-down experiments we show that X-PACSIN 2 binds to ADAM 13 in vitro. Using Xenopus XTC cells, we demonstrate that ADAM 13 and X-PACSIN 2 colocalize to membrane ruffles and cytoplasmic vesicles. We also show that X-PACSIN 2 overexpression can rescue developmental alterations induced by overexpression of ADAM 13, suggesting that both proteins interact in vivo. Finally, our results suggest that X-PACSIN 2 overexpression reduces endogenous ADAM 13 function while a truncated X-PACSIN 2 (ΔSH 3) increases this activity in <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells. We propose that X-PACSIN 2 may regulate ADAM 13 activity by influencing either its subcellular localization or its catalytic activity. In agreement with this model, elimination of the ADAM 13 cytoplasmic domain increased developmental alterations attributable to ADAM 13 proteolytic activity...|$|E

We show that Wnt signaling/β-catenin is absolutely required and sufficient for Dermo 1 expression and dermal cell identity in the cranium. The absence of the Wnt signaling cue leads to formation of cartilage in craniofacial and ventral trunk regions at the expense of dermal and bone lineages. Dermo 1 can be a direct transcription target and may mediate the functional role of Wnt signaling in dermal precursors.

40|$|AbstractMost of {{the bone}} and {{cartilage}} in the craniofacial region is derived from <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, which undergo three primary developmental events: migration from the rhombomeric neuroectoderm to the pharyngeal arches, proliferation as the ectomesenchyme within the arches, and differentiation into terminal structures. Interactions between the ectomesenchymal cells and surrounding cells are required in these processes, in which defects can lead to craniofacial malformation. We have previously shown that the G-protein-coupled endothelin-A receptor (ETA) is expressed in the neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme, whereas the cognate ligand for ETA, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), is expressed in arch epithelium and the paraxial mesoderm-derived arch core; absence of either ETA or ET- 1 results in numerous craniofacial defects. In this study we have attempted to define {{the point at which}} <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> development is disrupted in ETA-deficient embryos. We find that, while neural crest cell migration in the head of ETA−/− embryos appears normal, expression of a number of transcription factors in the arch ectomesenchymal cells is either absent or significantly reduced. These ETA-dependent factors include the transcription factorsgoosecoid, Dlx- 2, Dlx- 3, dHAND, eHAND, and Barx 1, but not MHox, Hoxa- 2, CRABP 1, or Ufd 1. In addition, the size of the arches in E 10. 5 to E 11. 5 ETA−/− embryos is smaller and an increase in ectomesenchymal apoptosis is observed. Thus, ETA signaling in ectomesenchymal cells appears to coordinate specific aspects of arch development by inducing expression of transcription factors in the postmigratory ectomesenchyme. Absence of these signals results in retarded arch growth, defects in proper differentiation, and, in some mesenchymal cells, apoptosis. In particular, this developmental pathway appears distinct from the pathway that includesUFD 1 L, implicated as a causative gene in CATCH 22 patients, and suggests parallel complementary pathways mediating craniofacial development...|$|E

This raises the question of how Wnt/β-catenin signaling regulates the formation of distinct lineages from the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Using various Cre lines to conditionally activate β-catenin in <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells at different developmental stages, we show that <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell fate decisions in vivo are subject to temporal control by Wnt/β-catenin.

Even those clones contributing to only one <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> derivative often contained both neurofilament-positive and neurofilament-negative cells. These data demonstrate that migrating trunk <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, like their premigratory progenitors, can be multipotent. They give rise to cells in multiple <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> derivatives and contribute to both neuronal and non-neuronal elements within a given derivative. Thus, restriction of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell fate must occur relatively late in migration or at the final destinations...|$|R

Previous studies using mutant zebrafish indicated that foxd 3 and tfap 2 a function early and differentially {{in the development}} of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sublineages. Here, we show that the simultaneous loss of foxd 3 and tfap 2 a function in zebrafish foxd 3 zdf 10;tfap 2 alow double mutant embryos globally prevents the specification of developmentally distinct <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sublineages. By contrast, <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> induction occurs independently of foxd 3 and tfap 2 a function. We show that the failure of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell diversification in double mutants is accompanied by the absence of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sox 10 and sox 9 a/b gene expression, and that forced expression of sox 10 and sox 9 a/b differentially rescues <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sublineage specification and derivative differentiation. These results demonstrate the functional necessity for foxd 3 and tfap 2 a for <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> sublineage specification and that this requirement is mediated by the synergistic regulation of the expression of SoxE family genes. Our results identify a genetic regulatory pathway functionally discrete from the process of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> induction that is required for the initiation of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell diversification during embryonic development...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{product of}} the Drosophila gene tribbles {{inhibits}} cell division in the ventral furrow of the embryo and thereby allows the normal prosecution of gastrulation. Cell division is also absent in involuting dorsal mesoderm during gastrulation in Xenopus, and to ask whether the two species employ similar mechanisms to coordinate morphogenesis and the cell cycle, we isolated a putative Xenopus homologue of tribbles which we call Xtrb 2. Extensive cDNA cloning identified long and short forms of Xtrb 2, termed Xtrb 2 -L and Xtrb 2 -S, respectively. Xtrb 2 is expressed maternally and in mesoderm and ectoderm at blastula and gastrula stages. Later, it is expressed in dorsal neural tube, eyes, and <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Time-lapse imaging of GFP-tagged Xtrb 2 -L suggests that during cell division, it is associated with mitotic spindles. Knockdown of Xtrb 2 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) disrupted synchronous cell divisions during blastula stages, apparently {{as a result of}} delayed progression through mitosis and cytokinesis. At later stages, tissues expressing the highest levels of Xtrb 2 were most markedly affected by morpholino knockdown, with perturbation of neural crest and eye development...|$|E
40|$|Articulated jaws {{are highly}} conserved {{structures}} characteristic of gnathostome evolution. Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions {{within the first}} pharyngeal arch (PA 1) instruct <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells (CNCCs) to form the different skeletal elements of the jaws. The endothelin- 1 (Edn 1) /endothelin receptor type-A (Ednra) →Dlx 5 / 6 →Hand 2 signaling pathway is necessary for lower jaw formation. Here, we show that the Edn 1 signaling is sufficient for {{the conversion of the}} maxillary arch to mandibular identity. Constitutive activation of Ednra induced the transformation of upper jaw, maxillary, structures into lower jaw, mandibular, structures with duplicated Meckel's cartilage and dermatocranial jaws constituted by 4 dentary bones. Misexpression of Hand 2 in the Ednra domain caused a similar transformation. Skeletal transformations are accompanied by neuromuscular remodeling. Ednra is expressed by most CNCCs, but its constitutive activation affects predominantly PA 1. We conclude that after migration CNCCs are not all equivalent, suggesting that their specification occurs in sequential steps. Also, we show that, within PA 1, CNCCs are competent to form both mandibular and maxillary structures and that an Edn 1 switch is responsible for the choice of either morphogenetic program...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of <b>cephalic</b> <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells into skeletal tissue in birds {{has been observed}} using the quail-chick nuclear marking system, {{which is based on}} specific differences in the distribution of the nuclear DNA. Chimaeras were formed by replacing a fragment of cephalic neural primordium of a 2 - to 12 -somite chicken embryo by the corresponding fragment isolated from an equivalent quail embryo. The participation of the graft-derived cells {{in the formation of the}} skull of these embryos was studied on histological sections after Feulgen and Rossenbeck staining. Cells from the pi osencephalic neural crest migrate into the frontal nasal process and mix with the mesencephalic neural crest cells in the lateral nasal processes, around the optic cupule and beneath the diencephalon. In addition, the mesencephalic neural crest cells form the bulk of the mesenchyme of the maxillary processes and mandibular arch, whereas the rhombencephalic neural crest cells become located in the branchial arches. The origin of cartilages of the chondrocranium and bones of the neurocranium and viscerocranium has been shown in the chimaeric embryos: the basal plate cartilages, occipital bones, sphenoid bones and the cranial vault are mainly of mesodermal origin.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{a network}} of {{transcription}} factors that specifies <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> identity in the ectoderm has been defined, expression of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> transcription factors does not guarantee eventual migration as a <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell. While much work has gone into determining regulatory relationships within the transcription factor network, the ability of protein modifications like phosphorylation to modulate the function of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> regulatory factors and determine when {{and where they are}} active also has crucial implications. Paladin, which was previously classified as a phosphatase based on sequence similarity, is expressed in chick <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> precursors and is maintained throughout their epithelial to mesenchymal transition and migration. Loss of Paladin delays the expression of transcription factors Snail 2 and Sox 10 in premigratory <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, but does not affect accumulation of FoxD 3, Cad 6 B or RhoB, indicating that Paladin differentially modulates the expression of genes previously thought to be coregulated within the <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> gene regulatory network. Both gain and loss of Paladin function result in disrupted <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> migration, reinforcing the importance of precisely regulated phosphorylation for <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> migration. Mutation of critical, catalytic cysteine residues within Paladin's predicted phosphatase active site motifs did not abolish the function of Paladin in the <b>neural</b> <b>crest.</b> Collectively, these data indicate that Paladin is an antiphosphatase that modulates the activity of specific <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> regulatory factors during <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> development. Our work identifies a novel regulator of phosphorylation status that provides an additional layer of regulation in the <b>neural</b> <b>crest...</b>|$|R
40|$|Trunk <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells migrate along {{two major}} pathways: a ventral pathway through the somites whose cells form {{neuronal}} derivatives and a dorsolateral pathway underneath the ectoderm whose cells become pigmented. In avian embryos, the latest emigrating <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells move only along the dorsolateral pathway. To test whether late emigrating <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells are more restricted in developmental potential than early migrating cells, cultures were prepared from the neural tubes of embryos {{at various stages}} of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell migration. “Early” and “middle” aged <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells differentiated into many derivatives including pigmented cells, neurofilament-immunoreactive cells, and adrenergic cells. In contrast, “late” <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells differentiated into pigment cells and neurofilament-immunoreactive cells, but not into adrenergic cells even after 10 – 14 days. To further challenge the developmental potential of early and late emigrating <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells, they were transplanted into embryos during the early phases of <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cell migration, known to be permissive for adrenergic neuronal differentiation. The cells were labeled with the vital dye, DiI, and injected onto the ventral pathway at stages 14 – 17. Two and three days after injection, some early <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells were found to express catecholamines, suggesting they were adrenergic neuroblasts. In contrast, DiI-labeled late <b>neural</b> <b>crest</b> cells never became catecholamine-positive.
