Soon after war had broken out, the Germans began their extermination of Polish Jews, ethnic Polish, Romani, Russians, Czech, and others minorities of Poland. Most were quickly rounded up and imprisoned in ghettos, which they were forbidden to leave.|$|E
5|$|By that time, {{the land}} once held in common by the Székely <b>community</b> <b>had</b> {{gradually}} become divided into {{smaller and smaller}} units; thus {{a vast number of}} the free warrior-peasants had to enter the service of their more prosperous fellow Székelys. This social stratification was formally recognized by a royal decree in 1473. Thereafter those who performed mounted military service were differentiated from those who fought as foot-soldiers; those who were unable to finance themselves even as foot-soldiers were legally reduced to servitude.|$|E

Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary <b>community</b> <b>had</b> dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him to be accepted.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the Jewish community in 1806. In 1809 the Jewish <b>community</b> <b>had</b> a rabbi, and by 1811 it had its own cemetery.

5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi <b>community</b> <b>had</b> fallen into disarray.

5|$|Large-scale Indian {{immigration}} to the Pacific coast of North America {{took place in the}} 20th century, especially from Punjab, which faced an economic depression. The Canadian government met this influx with legislation aimed at limiting the entry of South Asians into Canada and at restricting the political rights of those already in the country. The Punjabi <b>community</b> <b>had</b> hitherto been an important loyal force for the British Empire and the Commonwealth. The <b>community</b> <b>had</b> expected that its commitment would be honoured with the same welcome and rights which the British and colonial governments extended to British and white immigrants. The restrictive legislation fed growing discontent, protests and anti-colonial sentiments within the community. Faced with increasingly difficult situations, the community began organising itself into political groups. Many Punjabis also moved to the United States, but they encountered similar political and social problems. Meanwhile, India House and nationalist activism of Indian students had begun declining on the east coast of North America towards 1910, but activity gradually shifted west to San Francisco. The arrival at this time of Har Dayal from Europe bridged the gap between the intellectual agitators in New York and the predominantly Punjabi labour workers and migrants in the west coast, and laid the foundations of the Ghadar movement.|$|E
5|$|Montreal was {{incorporated}} {{as a city}} in 1832. The opening of the Lachine Canal permitted ships to bypass the unnavigable Lachine Rapids, while {{the construction of the}} Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub.

5|$|The chronicler Symeon of Durham {{asserted}} that when St-Calais was consecrated bishop by Archbishop Thomas of York, {{he managed to}} avoid professing obedience to the archbishop, which, if true, would have freed St-Calais from interference in his diocese. After his appointment, St-Calais decided to replace his cathedral chapter of secular clergy with monks, and consulted the king and Lanfranc, the Archbishop of Canterbury, before going to Rome to receive permission from Pope Gregory VII. These consultations, and the conditions within his diocese, may have kept St-Calais from visiting Durham until some time after his elevation. In 1083 he expelled the married clergy from the cathedral, and moved a small community of monks from Bede's old monastery at Jarrow to Durham, to form the new chapter. This <b>community</b> <b>had</b> been founded at Jarrow by Reinfrid, a Norman ex-knight and monk of Evesham Abbey, and Eadwine, an English monk from Winchcombe Abbey. After the <b>community</b> <b>had</b> settled in Durham, St-Calais named Eadwine as prior, and arranged for lands to be set aside to support the monks. The expelled clergy were offered the option of joining the new monastic house, but only one actually joined.|$|E
