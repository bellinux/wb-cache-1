2500|$|The Rowland–Molina {{hypothesis}} was strongly disputed {{by representatives of}} the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The Chair of the Board of DuPont {{was quoted as saying}} that ozone depletion theory is [...] "a science fiction tale … a load of rubbish … utter nonsense". Robert Abplanalp, the President of Precision Valve Corporation (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. Nevertheless, within three years most of the basic assumptions made by Rowland and Molina were confirmed by laboratory measurements and by direct observation in the stratosphere. The concentrations of the source gases (CFCs and related compounds) and the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> species (HCl and [...] ) were measured throughout the stratosphere, and demonstrated that CFCs were indeed the major source of stratospheric chlorine, and that nearly all of the CFCs emitted would eventually reach the stratosphere. Even more convincing was the measurement, by James G. Anderson and collaborators, of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the stratosphere. ClO is produced by the reaction of Cl with ozone—its observation thus demonstrated that Cl radicals not only were present in the stratosphere but also were actually involved in destroying ozone. McElroy and Wofsy extended the work of Rowland and Molina by showing that bromine atoms were even more effective catalysts for ozone loss than chlorine atoms and argued that the brominated organic compounds known as halons, widely used in fire extinguishers, were a potentially large source of stratospheric bromine. In 1976 the United States National Academy of Sciences released a report concluding that the ozone depletion {{hypothesis was}} strongly supported by the scientific evidence. [...] In response the United States, Canada and Norway banned the use of CFCs in aerosol spray cans in 1978. Early estimates were that, if CFC production continued at 1977 levels, the total atmospheric ozone would after a century or so reach a steady state, 15 to 18 percent below normal levels. By 1984, when better evidence on the speed of critical reactions was available, this estimate was changed to 5 to 9 percent steady-state depletion.|$|E

Finally, the possibility that the ozone hole may be due more to a shift in atmospheric dynamics than to chemical destruction is addressed...|$|R
40|$|The middle {{atmosphere}} {{is rich in}} its variety of particulate matter, which ranges from meteorite debris, to sulfate aerosols, to polar stratospheric ice clouds. Volcanic eruptions strongly perturb the stratospheric sulfate (Junge) layer. High-altitude 'noctilucent' ice clouds condense at the summer mesopause. The properties of these particles, including their composition, sizes, and geographical distribution, are discussed, and their global effects, including chemical, radiative, and climatic roles, are reviewed. Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) are composed of water and nitric acid {{in the form of}} micron-sized ice crystals. These particles catalyze reactions of chlorine compounds that 'activate' otherwise inert <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> leading to severe ozone depletions in the southern polar stratosphere during austral spring. PSCs also modify the composition of the polar stratosphere through complex physiocochemical processes, including dehydration and denitrification, and the conversion of reactive nitrogen oxides into nitric acid. If water vapor and nitric acid concentrations are enhanced by high-altitude aircraft activity, the frequency, geographical range, and duration of PSCs might increase accordingly, thus enhancing the destruction of the ozone layer (which would be naturally limited in geographical extent by the same factors that confine the ozone hole to high latitudes in winter). The stratospheric sulfate aerosol layer reflects solar radiation and increases the planetary albedo, thereby cooling the surface and possibly altering the climate. Major volcanic eruptions, which increase the sulfate aerosol burden by a factor of 100 or more, may cause significant global climate anomalies. Sulfate aerosols might also be capable of activating stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on a global scale (unlike PCSs, which represent a localized polar winter phenomenon), although existing evidence suggests relatively minor perturbations in chlorine chemistry. Nevertheless, if atmospheric concentrations of chlorine (associated with anthropogenic use of chlorofluorocarbons) continue to increase by a factor of two or more in future decades, aircraft emissions of sulfur dioxide and water vapor may take on greater significance...|$|R

The mean temporal evolution of the sum of their monthly mean abundance time series indicates that the total stratospheric inorganic chlorine loading (Cly) has decreased slowly (- 0. 7 +/- 0. 3 %/yr, 1 -sigma) since it peaked in late 1996, at the limit of being statistically significant at the 2 -sigma level.

In particular, data on the properties of PSCs and their physical chemistry, the microphysical processes and time constants for cloud processes, the heterogeneous chemical processes and their time constants, and nonlinearities in the long-term ozone trend associated with physical and chemical processes are examined. The chemical reactions leading to the depletion of the inert <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> in a presence of type I PSCs are established, and it is shown that type II PSCs contribute to chemical processing that sustains the chemical imbalance of the polar stratosphere. It is shown that, using a simple model, the decadal evolution of the Antarctic ozone hole may be understood through nonlinearities in the heterogeneous chemistry, with possible contributing effects of variations in stratospheric temperatures and water vapor concentrations...|$|E

Recently, the correct understanding of this cycle was challenged by the release of new laboratory absorption cross sections yielding to significant model underestimates of observed ClO and ozone loss (see, e. g. von Hobe et al., 2007). Under this aspect, arctic stratospheric limb emission measurements carried out by the balloon version of the Michelsen Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS-B) from Kiruna (Sweden) on 11 January 2001 and 20 / 21 March 2003 have been reanalyzed with regard to the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> species ClONO 2 and the active ClOx species ClO and Cl 2 O 2.

40|$|Ground-based Fourier {{transform}} infrared (FTIR) measurements, {{performed in}} the Arctic polar night using the Moon as aninfrared light source, reveal already {{during the first half}} of December 1992 a considerable reduction in the amount ofstratospheric HCl and ClONO 2. Balloon sondes yield that in the altitude range 16 - 22 km an ozone reduction occurred assoon as the circulating air masses were irradiated by sunlight. Within the same altitude range several polar stratosphericcloud (PSC) events are being reported throughout the winter. Assuming that the reduction of HCl and ClONO 2 hadoccurred in the same altitude range, where the ozone depletion and PSCs were observed, our measurements imply thatalmost all HCl and ClONO 2 in that altitude range had disappeared. This means that the stratosphere was primed forozone depletion very early in winter. The results confirm model studies that in the Arctic; already weak PSC events canlead to a strong conversion of <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> compounds into active forms, initiating the ozone depletion, as soon assunlight is available...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFrom January to March 2005, the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment high {{resolution}} Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) on SCISAT- 1 measured {{many of the}} changes occurring in the Arctic (50 ? 80 ° N) lower stratosphere under very cold winter conditions. Here {{we focus on the}} partitioning between the inorganic <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> HCl and ClONO 2 and their activation into ClO. The simultaneous measurement of these species by the ACE-FTS provides the data needed to follow chlorine activation during the Arctic winter and the recovery of the Cl-reservoir species ClONO 2 and HCl. The time evolution of HCl, ClONO 2 and ClO as well as the partitioning between the two reservoir molecules agrees well with previous observations and with our current understanding of chlorine activation during Arctic winter. The results of a chemical box model are also compared with the ACE-FTS measurements and are generally consistent with the measurements...|$|R
40|$|The {{correlated}} set of measurements in {{the lower}} stratosphere from polar missions of the NASA ER- 2 is used to derive partitioning of the major components of the reactive nitrogen and inorganic <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The results provide a consistent method for comparing distributions, and hence the controlling processes, between {{different areas of the}} near-polar regions. Clear evidence of the effects of heterogeneous processes in the atmosphere is found. Values for NO 2, ClONO 2, N 2 O 5, and Cl 2 O 2 are derived in a simplified steady-state model based on in situ NO, ClO, O 3, temperature, and pressure measurements, laboratory-measured reaction rates; and modeled photodissociation rates. Values for the reservoir totals are independently derived from measurements of N 2 O, organic chlorine, and total reactive nitrogen. The relative abundances of the measured and derived species within the reservoirs are calculated, and the longer-lived species HCl and HNO 3 are estimated as the residuals of their respective reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} {{climate models}} that contributed simulations for {{past and future}} ozone evolution to the 2010 Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion were subject to extensive evaluation by the SPARC (Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate) CCMVal (Chemistry-Climate Model Validation) activity. The sensitivity of ozone to changes in composition and climate varies among the models, but {{the relationship between these}} variations and the model evaluations of CCMVal is not obvious. We have learned that the transport evaluation can be used to interpret the comparisons between observed and simulated columns of <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> hydrochloric acid (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO 2); these comparisons were part of the CCMVal evaluation of chemistry. The simulations with best performance on the transport diagnostics most faithfully reproduce the evolution and seasonal variation of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> as observed at NDACC (Network for Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change) stations (NyAlesund 78. 9 N, Kiruna 67. 8 N, Harestua 60. 2 N, Jungfraujoch 46. 6 N, Toronto 43. 6 N, Kitt Peak 31. 9 N, Izana 28. 3 N, Mauna Loa 19. 5 N, Lauder 45 S and Arrival Heights 77. 8 S). In the simulations, the HCl in the lower stratosphere depends on total inorganic chlorine (Cly) and partitioning between HCl and ClON 02. Total inorganic chlorine depends on the fractional release of chlorine from source gases, and ratio of ClON 02 to HCl is inversely dependent on methane and varies quadratically with ozone. Simulated HCl from various models may agree with observations even though Cly is in error, partitioning is in error, or both. Simulated ozone sensitivity to chlorine is shown to be greater for models that produce larger values of chlorine nitrate for background chlorine levels, and vice versa. Comparisons with the NDACC data show why the models with 'best' transport have similar sensitivity to chlorine change. The realistic evolution of the simulated HCl and ClONO 2 columns suggests realistic levels of Cly in the lower atmosphere. In addition, the wide range values for the sensitivity of ozone to chlorine obtained from the CCMVal simulations is explained by the wide range in lower atmospheric columns of ClONO 2 and the concomitant wide range of levels for chlorine monoxide...|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies of}} {{heterogeneous}} reactions of possible importance for Antarctic ozone depletion were performed. In particular, {{the reactions of}} chlorine nitrate (ClONO 2) and dinitrogen pentoxide (N 2 O 5) were investigated on ice and HCl/ice surfaces. These reactions occur on the surfaces of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) over Antarctica. One reaction transforms the stable <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> species (ClONO 2 and HCl) into photochemically active chlorine {{in the form of}} HOCl and Cl 2. Condensation of HNO 3 in the reactions removes odd nitrogen from the stratosphere, a requirement in nearly all models of Antarctic ozone depletion. Other reactions may also be important for Antarctic ozone depletion. Like the reactions of chlorine nitrate, these reactions deplete odd nitrogen through HNO 3 condensation. In addition, one reaction converts a stable chlorine reservior species (HCl) into photochemically active chlorine (ClNO 2).

The theory that accounts for seasonal depletion of ozone considers thereservoirs. 2) Less reactive compounds such as HCl or ClONO 2 are considered as the reservoirs.

40|$|Early in December 1991, high {{values of}} ClO are {{seen by the}} Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite at latitudes south of areas of {{temperatures}} cold enough to form polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs). A 3 D simulation shows that the heterogeneous conversion of <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> to reactive <b>chlorine</b> on the surfaces of PSCs (processing) takes place at high latitudes. Often the processed air must be transported to lower latitudes, where the reactive chlorine is photochemically converted to ClO, to be observed by MLS. In this simulation, one incidence of cold temperatures is associated with an anticyclone, and a second with a cyclone. The transport of processed air associated with the anticyclone is marked by shearing; {{a decrease in the}} maximum of the processed air is accompanied by growth of the area influenced by the processing. In contrast, the air processed in the cyclonic event spreads more slowly. This shows that transport and shearing is a crucial element to the evolution of reactive chlorine associated with a processing event. In particular, transport and shearing, as well as photochemical processes, can cause variations in observed ClO...|$|R
40|$|Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play {{a crucial}} role in the springtime {{chemical}} depletion of ozone at high latitudes. PSC particles (primarily supercooled ternary solution, or STS droplets) provide sites for heterogeneous chemical reactions that transform stable <b>chlorine</b> and bromine <b>reservoir</b> species into highly reactive ozone-destructive forms. Furthermore, large nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) PSC particles can irreversibly redistribute odd nitrogen through gravitational sedimentation (a process commonly known as denitrification), which prolongs the ozone depletion process by slowing the reformation of the stable <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Spaceborne observations from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) lidar on the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) satellite are providing a rich new dataset for studying PSCs. CALIPSO is an excellent platform for studying polar processes with CALIOP acquiring, on average, over 300, 000 backscatter profiles daily at latitudes between 55 o and 82 o in both hemispheres. PSCs are detected in the CALIOP backscatter profiles using a successive horizontal averaging scheme that enables detection of strongly scattering PSCs (e. g., ice) at the finest possible spatial resolution (5 km), while enhancing the detection of very tenuous PSCs (e. g., low number density NAT) at larger spatial scales (up to 135 km). CALIOP PSCs are separated into composition classes (STS; liquid/NAT mixtures; and ice) based on the ensemble 532 -nm scattering ratio (the ratio of total-to-molecular backscatter) and 532 -nm particulate depolarization ratio (which is sensitive to the presence of non-spherical, i. e. NAT and ice particles). In this paper, we will provide an overview of the CALIOP PSC detection and composition classification algorithm and then examine the vertical and spatial distribution of PSCs in the Arctic and Antarctic on vortex-wide scales for entire PSC seasons over the more than nine-year data record from 2006 - 2015...|$|R

A number of sensitivity runs {{is used to}} explore the impact of uncertainties in chlorine activation and denitrification on the model results. In particular, the efficiency of chlorine activation on different types of liquid aerosol versus activation on nitric acid trihydrate clouds is examined. Additionally, the impact of changes in reaction rate coefficients, in the particle number density of polar stratospheric clouds, in supersaturation, temperature or the extent of denitrification is investigated. Results are compared to satellite measurements of MLS and ACE-FTS and to in-situ measurements onboard the Geophysica aircraft during the RECONCILE measurement campaign. It is shown that even large changes in the underlying assumptions have only a small impact on the modeled ozone loss, even though they can cause considerable differences in chemical evolution and denitrification.

Products were formed with a narrow range of recoil kinetic energies, peaking at 48 kcal/mol in the center-of-mass reference frame, with a full-width half-maximum of 4 (2 kcal/mol. This kinetic energy distribution shows that the CH 3 O products are formed with a very narrow range of internal energies, and a simple model shows that to conserve angular momentum this internal energy, near 20 kcal/mol, is partitioned primarily to rotational energy.

The HZ was defined conservatively to be suitable for humans i. e. 0 °C 2 OH, hence less OH, an important sink for these two compounds. Ozone changes were smaller across the HZ. A source-sink analysis suggested the important process was a slowing in the O 3 +hv sink.

HCl, for example is a <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> (storage) molecule, which increased by a factor 5 - 10 on moving outwards over the solar HZ. For the F 2 V and K 2 V stars, similar sources and sinks dominated the chemical biomarker budget as for the solar case and columns trends were comparable across the HZ.

Within {{the frame}} of the NDSC, the total {{vertical}} column abundances of HCl and ClONO 2, by far the two most important inorganic <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> at northern mid-latitudes, have been further monitored above the Jungfraujoch station (Swiss Alps, 46. 5 ºN, 8. 0 ºE, 3580 m a. s. l.), by analyzing infrared solar absorption spectra recorded with very high-resolution Fourier spectrometers. The mean temporal evolution of the sum of their monthly mean abundance time series indicates that the total stratospheric inorganic chlorine loading (Cly) has decreased slowly (- 0. 7 � 0. 3 %/yr, 1 �) since it peaked in late 1996, at the limit of being statistically significant at the 2 � level. Comparison with model calculations and with the evolution of surface total organic chlorine will also be discussed. Context Following the demonstration of the important role played by stratospheric chlorine in the ozone layer depletion, a special effort has been devoted to the monitoring of anthropogenic chlorine bearing source gases (among which the man-made CFCs and HCFCs) and to species resulting from their photo-dissociation in the stratosphere. These monitoring activities were and remain essential to assess the efficiency of the phase out scenarios imposed by the Montreal Protocol (1987) and its subsequent Amendments and Adjustments upon important halogenated source gases with large ozone depletion potentials, with the ultimate aim of reducing the inorganic chlorine loading in the stratosphere.

40|$|Chemistry {{climate models}} (CCMs) {{are used to}} predict the future {{evolution}} of stratospheric ozone as ozone-depleting substances decrease and greenhouse gases increase, cooling the stratosphere. CCM predictions exhibit many common features, but also a broad range of values for quantities such as year of ozone-return-to- 1980 and global ozone level {{at the end of the}} 21 st century. Multiple linear regression is applied to each of 14 CCMs to separate ozone response to chlorine change from that due to climate change. We show that the sensitivity of lower atmosphere ozone to chlorine change deltaO 3 /deltaCly is a near linear function of partitioning of total inorganic chlorine (Cly) into its reservoirs; both Cly and its partitioning are controlled by lower atmospheric transport. CCMs with realistic transport agree with observations for <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and produce similar ozone responses to chlorine change. After 2035 differences in response to chlorine contribute little to the spread in CCM results as the anthropogenic contribution to Cly becomes unimportant. Differences among upper stratospheric ozone increases due to temperature decreases are explained by differences in ozone sensitivity to temperature change deltaO 3 /deltaT due to different contributions from various ozone loss processes, each with their own temperature dependence. In the lower atmosphere, tropical ozone decreases caused by a predicted speed-up in the Brewer-Dobson circulation may or may not be balanced by middle and high latitude increases, contributing most to the spread in late 21 st century predictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{work done}} on this grant {{primarily}} concerns {{the measurement of}} aerosol in the stratosphere from NASA ER- 2 aircraft in studies of stratospheric ozone depletion in {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. The ER- 2 Condensation Nucleus Counter (CNC) measures the number concentration of particles in the diameter range of approximately 0. 01 to 1 micron. The Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer measures size distributions in the 0. 17 to 3 micron diameter range. This instrument was upgraded during this grant period to a Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer (FCAS). This upgrade permitted the instrument to measure particles as small as 0. 05 micron in diameter. The inlet for the PCAS and FCAS was modified and characterized under this grant so that the modifications to the aerosol due to anisokinetic sampling and heating upon sampling and in transport to the measurement location were accounted for in the data analysis. These measurements permitted observations of particle production in the southern hemisphere winter polar vortex and observation of the impact of denitrification on the number concentration of the aerosol in the denitrified air. In the northern polar vortex, the measurements provided a characterization of the sulfate aerosol. Following the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, the measurements permitted an accurate characterization of the sulfate aerosol enhancements resulting from the eruption. This led to studies of the impact of heterogeneous chemistry on the partitioning of the partitioning of the reactive nitrogen species and the partitioning of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{investigation}} of chemical ozone loss processes in the Arctic winter stratosphere. Within {{the framework of the}} second European stratospheric arctic and midlatitude experiment (SESAME) the Juelich research center in cooperation with the university of California at Irvine performed on 3 February 1995 balloon borne in-situ measurements in the Arctic polar vortex using a combined payload, which allowed for the simultaneous observation of long-lived trace gases, chlorine containing source gases, ozone and the halogen radicals ClO and BrO, which participate in catalytic cycles leading to ozone loss. Between 19 - 23 km a layer of enhanced ClO mixing ratios with maximum values of 1150 pptv was observed with BrO mixing ratios of #propor to# 10 pptv nearly independent of altitude. The observations show for the first time an anticorrelation between ClO and O_ 3 in the Arctic polar vortex, similar to the one observed over Antarctica as early as 1987, which was a key evidence in linking halogen oxides with ozone loss. The data set obtained during the balloon flight is analyzed with regard to the following aspects. The observed enhanced ClO/Cl_y ratio of 0. 4 in this layer compared to 0. 05 typical for out-of-vortex conditions indicates chlorine activation in the Arctic polar vortex in the winter 1994 / 95.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of chlorine in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere increased considerably during the 1970 s to 1990 s, following large emissions of anthropogenic long-lived chlorine-containing source gases, notably the chlorofluorocarbons. The chemical inertness of chlorofluorocarbons allows their transport and mixing throughout the troposphere {{on a global}} scale 1, before they reach the stratosphere where they release chlorine atoms that cause ozone depletion 2. The large ozone loss over Antarctica 3 was the key observation that stimulated the definition and signing in 1987 of the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty establishing a schedule to reduce the production of the major chlorine- and bromine-containing halocarbons. Owing to its implementation, the near-surface total chlorine concentration showed a maximum in 1993, followed by a decrease of half a per cent to one per cent per year 4, in line with expectations. Remote-sensing data have revealed a peak in stratospheric chlorine after 19965, then a decrease of close to one per cent per year 6, 7, in agreement with the surface observations of the chlorine source gases and model calculations 7. Here we present ground-based and satellite data that show a recent and significant increase, at the 2 σ level, in hydrogen chloride (HCl), the main stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir,</b> starting around 2007 in the lower stratosphere of the Northern Hemisphere, in contrast with the ongoing monotonic decrease of near-surface source gases. Using model simulations, we attribute this trend anomaly to a slowdown in the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation, occurring over several consecutive years, transporting more aged air to the lower stratosphere, and characterized by a larger relative conversion of source gases to HCl. This short-term dynamical variability will also affect other stratospheric tracers and needs to be accounted for when studying the evolution of the stratospheric ozone layer...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{chemical and}} microphysical {{processes in the}} late winter in the Antarctic lower stratosphere, after the first chlorine activation and initial ozone depletion. We focused on a time interval when both further chlorine activation and ozone loss, but also chlorine deactivation, occur. We performed a comprehensive Lagrangian analysis to simulate the evolution of an air mass along a 10 -day trajectory, coupling a detailed microphysical box model to a chemistry model. Model results have been compared with in situ and remote sensing measurements of particles and ozone at the start and end points of the trajectory, and satellite measurements of key chemical species and clouds along it. Different model runs have been performed to understand the relative role of solid and liquid polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) particles for the heterogeneous chemistry, and for the denitrification caused by particle sedimentation. According to model results, under the conditions investigated, ozone depletion is not affected significantly {{by the presence of}} nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, as the observed depletion rate can equally well be reproduced by heterogeneous chemistry on cold liquid aerosol, with a surface area density close to background values. Under the conditions investigated, the impact of denitrification is important for the abundances of <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs</b> after PSC evaporation, thus stressing the need to use appropriate microphysical models in the simulation of chlorine deactivation. We found that the effect of particle sedimentation and denitrification on the amount of ozone depletion is rather small in the case investigated. In {{the first part of the}} analyzed period, when a PSC was present in the air mass, sedimentation led to a smaller available particle surface area and less chlorine activation, and thus less ozone depletion.

This minihole is typical of many transient events in the lower stratosphere that arise because of cyclonic-scale disturbances in the troposphere. Although the ozone reduction is a short-lived reversible dynamical event, through heterogeneous chemical processes there can be a significant transfer of <b>chlorine</b> from <b>reservoir</b> molecules to active radicals. This chemically perturbed air is defined as processed air, and it is found that a single event can produce enough processed air to reduce the HCl in the entire polar vortex. Chemical processing on clouds associated with transient events is shown to be a major source of processed air in the polar vortex in December before background temperatures are cold enough for more uniform heterogeneous conversion...|$|R
40|$|Total {{vertical}} column amounts of stratospheric HCl, HF, ClONO 2 and HNO 3 are reported from high resolution infrared solar absorption spectra {{taken during the}} European Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Experiment (EASOE) {{in the winter of}} 1991 - 1992. These ground based measurements were made near Are in North Sweden (63. 4 deg N, 13. 1 deg E) at an altitude of 800 m using a Fourier transform spectrometer and tunable diode laser heterodyne spectrometer. On 9 th January 1992 the HCl {{vertical column}} dropped to 1. 2 x 10 (exp 15) molecules/sq cm from a November average of 3. 6 x 10 (exp 15) molecules/sq cm. The HCl drop occurred at a time when Are was below the polar vortex and the lower stratospheric ClO column above Are was elevated to approximately 2 x 10 (exp 15) molecules/sq cm as measured by the Microwave Limb Sounder experiment on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite. These measurements indicate conversion of lower stratospheric <b>chlorine</b> from <b>reservoir</b> to chemically active forms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{comprehensive}} chemistry module CHEM {{has been}} developed for application in general circulation models (GCMs) describing tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, including photochemical reactions and heterogeneous reactions on sulphate aerosols and polar stratospheric clouds. It has been coupled to the spectral atmospheric GCM ECHAM 3. The model configuration used {{in the current study}} has been run in an "off-line" mode, i. e. the calculated chemical species do not affect the radiative forcing of the dynamic fields. First results of a 15 -year model integration indicate that the model ECHAM 3 /CHEM runs are numerically efficient and stable, i. e. that no model drift can be detected in dynamic and chemical parameters. The model reproduces the main features regarding ozone, in particular intra- and interannual variability. The ozone columns are somewhat higher than observed (approximately 10 %), while the amplitude of the annual cycle is in agreement with observations. A comparison with HALOE data reveals, however, a serious model deficiency regarding lower-stratosphere dynamics at high latitudes. Contrary to what is concluded by observations, the lower stratosphere is characterized by slight upward motions in the polar regions, so that some of the mentioned good agreements must be considered as fortuitous. Nevertheless, ECHAM 3 /CHEM well describes the chemical processes leading to ozone reduction. It has been shown that the mean fraction of the northern hemisphere, which is covered by polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) as well as the temporal appearance of PSCs in the model, is in fair agreement with observations. The model results show an activation of chlorine inside the polar vortex which is stronger in the southern than in the northern winter hemisphere, yielding an ozone hole over the Antarctic; this hole, however, is also caused to a substantial degree by the dynamics. Interhemispheric differences concerning reformation of <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> species HCl and ClONO 2 in spring have also been well reproduced by the model...|$|E
40|$|HCl {{measurements}} from HALOE in {{the northern}} hemisphere during mid-May 1997 revealed vortex fragments in which the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> partitioning was strongly pushed toward HCl (approx. 90 % HCl, approx. 10 % ClONO 2), similar to partitioning previously observed in the Antarctic vortex region. In contrast, observations of ClONO 2 and HCl {{in the northern}} polar spring, 1992, and in other years, show these species established the balance typical for gas phase photochemical reactions in this region (approx. 60 % HCl, approx. 40 % ClONO 2). Annually, chlorine reservoirs in the winter lower stratosphere polar vortex are converted to chlorine radicals via heterogeneous reactions on particle surfaces at very cold temperatures (less than about 200 K). As temperatures warm in spring, the heterogeneous processes become insignificant compared with gas phase reactions, and the chlorine reservoirs are reformed. Measurements through the northern winter/spring in 1992 show rapid formation of ClONO 2, followed by steady loss of ClONO 2 and increasing HCl. Although ClONO 2 measurements are not available for 1997, the HCl increase in 1997 is observed {{to be much more}} rapid and the eventual HCl mixing ratio is about 50 % greater than that of 1992. The observations are examined through comparison with the Goddard three-dimensional chemistry and transport model. This model utilizes winds and temperatures from the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System and a complete integration scheme for stratospheric photochemistry. Analysis of the evolution of HCl and ClONO 2 shows that the observed difference in the overall rate of HCl formation is explained by the sensitivity of the gas-phase chemistry to the ozone mixing ratio and the temperature. The results show that the model accurately simulates HCl and ClONO 2 evolution during these two winters. Model validity is further supported by comparisons with O 3 and reactive nitrogen species NO and NO 2. This analysis provides a sensitive test of the lower stratospheric chlorine photochemistry, particularly because the analysis considers constituent evolution {{at a time when the}} HCl and ClONO 2 are far from a photochemical stationary state...|$|E
40|$|The winter 2009 / 2010 was {{characterized}} by a strong Arctic vortex with extremely cold mid-winter temperatures in the lower stratosphere associated with an intense activation of reactive chlorine compounds (ClO x) from reservoir species. Stratospheric limb emission spectra were recorded during a flight of the balloon version of the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS-B) from Kiruna (Sweden) on 24 January 2010 inside the Arctic vortex. Several fast limb sequences of spectra (in time steps of about 10 min) were measured from nighttime photochemical equilibrium to local noon allowing the retrieval of chlorine- and nitrogen-containing species which change rapidly their concentration around the terminator between night and day. Mixing ratios of species like ClO, NO 2, and N 2 O 5 show significant changes around sunrise, which are temporally delayed due to polar stratospheric clouds reducing the direct radiative flux from the sun. ClO variations were derived {{for the first time}} from MIPAS-B spectra. Daytime ClO values of up to 1. 6 ppbv are visible in a broad chlorine activated layer below 26 km correlated with low values (below 0. 1 ppbv) of the <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoir</b> species ClONO 2. Observations are compared and discussed with calculations performed with the 3 -dimensional Chemistry Climate Model EMAC (ECHAM 5 /MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). Mixing ratios of the species ClO, NO 2, and N 2 O 5 are well reproduced by the model during night and noon. However, the onset of ClO production and NO 2 loss around the terminator in the model is not consistent with the measurements. The MIPAS-B observations along with Tropospheric Ultraviolet-Visible (TUV) radiation model calculations suggest that polar stratospheric clouds lead to a delayed start followed by a faster increase of the photodissoziation of ClOOCl and NO 2 near the morning terminator since stratospheric clouds alter the direct and the diffuse flux of solar radiation. These effects are not considered in the EMAC model simulations which assume a cloudless atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Recovery from {{enhanced}} chlorine {{conditions in}} the lower stratospheric polar regions of both hemispheres is investigated {{using data from the}} Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) measurements of ClO within the polar vortices are used to infer ClO(sub x) (ClO + 2 Cl 202) abundances that are then correlated with simultaneous Cryogenic Limb Array Etalon Spectrometer (CLAES) measurements of ClON 02 and Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) measurements of HCl obtained starting within 5 days {{of the end of the}} MLS and CLAES high-latitude observing periods in each hemisphere. Time series of vortex-averaged mixing ratios are calculated on two potential temperature surfaces (585 K and 465 K) in the lower stratosphere for approximately month-long intervals during late winter: August 17 - September 17, 1992, in the southern hemisphere and February 12 - March 16, 1993, in the northern hemisphere. The observed mixing ratios are adjusted for the effects of vertical transport using diabatic vertical velocities estimated from CLAES tracer data. In the northern hemisphere, the decrease in ClO, is balanced on both surfaces by an increase in ClON 02 - In the southern hemisphere, continuing polar stratospheric cloud activity prevents ClO from undergoing sustained decline until about September 3. In contrast to the northern hemisphere, there is no significant chemical change in vortex-averaged ClON 02 at 465 K, and there is an apparent decrease in ClON 02 at 585 K, even after the enhanced ClO abundances have started to recede. Results from the SLIMCAT chemical transport model initialized with UARS data and run with OH + ClO yields HCl + 02 as an 8 % channel suggest that the primary recovery product in the south during this time period is not ClON 02, but HCl. HALOE HCl mixing ratios are extrapolated back to the time of the MLS and CLAES data. At 585 K, the chlorine budget can be made to balance by extrapolating HCl back to a value of 0. 6 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at the beginning of the study period; at 465 K, the contribution from extrapolated HCl is not sufficient to offset the loss in ClOx, and there is a slight imbalance between the decrease in reactive chlorine and the change in <b>chlorine</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The difficulty in closing the chlorine budget in the southern hemisphere may arise from complications caused by ongoing activation, incomplete photochemical assumptions, and/or inadequate data quality...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic winter 2010 / 2011 was {{characterized}} by an unusually stable and cold polar vortex in the lower stratosphere. Meteorological data shows that conditions {{for the formation of}} polar stratospheric clouds, and hence the activation of <b>chlorine</b> from <b>reservoir</b> species through heterogeneous processes, were widespread. Values of Vpsc, a temperature based parameter that characterizes the winter average extent of such conditions were in the range of the extreme values reached in the coldest winters on record, i. e., 2000 and 2005. However, in contrast to these previous winters, when the ozone loss period was ended by major stratospheric warmings in March, in 2011 the very stable polar vortex stayed intact and cold well into April. The combination of extremely cold conditions throughout the winter with a long lived and stable vortex in spring led to record chemical destruction of ozone in the Arctic. Based on the measurements of the Match ozonesonde network and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on Aura we will discuss the degree and the time evolution of this record loss and compare the Arctic ozone loss in 2011 with the range of ozone losses that occurred in early and recent Antarctic ozone holes...|$|R
