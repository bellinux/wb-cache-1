40|$|Most {{schools that}} serve {{learners}} {{who come from}} disadvantaged areas and backgrounds face unusually difficult challenges. These schools experience poor performance and disciplinary problems, and teachers lack motivation and commitment. This study explores the role of leadership and management in the schooling of at-risk learners at Pandu Primary School. This school accommodates learners mostly from Hafo, a township characterised by poverty with a high crime rate. However, {{in spite of these}} factors school inspectors and advisory teachers perceive the school to be successful. The school uses an abundance of energy and unusually high levels of human effort in a very focused way to improve the teaching and learning standard. The study found the co-existence of apparently conflicting management and leadership approaches in managing and leading the school. Strict control used in the school to make teachers work hard is an element of classical organisational theory, with its emphasis on span of control or number of workers supervised. Policies with strict rules are in place to create a calm atmosphere and serve as directives for teachers and learners. On the other hand, constructivist approaches – such as instructional leadership, transformational leadership, <b>collegial</b> model of <b>management</b> and open systems – are also clearly evident in the findings. Instructional leadership is evident in the emphasis on improvement of classroom practice. Elements of transformational leadership are seen in that the principal motivates the teachers and serves as a role model. The school also has some features of the <b>collegial</b> model of <b>management,</b> and can be described as an open system. Thus, by drawing on management and leadership approaches informed by different traditions and philosophies, the school succeeds against severe odds...|$|R

In particular we highlight the characteristics of the three areas: the projects they chose; a flavour of how they addressed the projects; and identify potential lessons for those similarly seeking to improve services. • Findings: In particular we identify potential glimpses for meaningful change including: change being based on underpinning values, partnership with service users, effective communication, ‘seed money’ creativity and a <b>collegial</b> style of <b>management.</b> The inhibitors of change identified include: ‘keeping the day-job going’, underestimating the amount of time and resources required, staff changes, lack of technological support, and the need to be both looking in and out and the fact that external events can change everything. • Applications: The themes discussed are potentially generalizable and may be of help to those considering similar changes with specialist team...|$|R
40|$|Australian public {{universities}} {{have been under}} the influence of a corporate management culture since the 1980 s. Driven by pressures for more accounting and accountability, its characteristics have variously been described as being in tension with the traditional <b>collegial</b> and autonomous <b>management</b> culture, threatening its demise. This study applies a multi-theoretical lens to recognize the interests of academics as important stakeholders and critically analyses the existing literature to determine the current status of both cultures within Australian {{public universities}}. A series of interviews with a number of vice chancellors and other senior management staff complement and provide a management perspective to the analysis. The results suggest that amidst a shift toward a corporate culture, aspects of collegial and autonomous practices continue to exist in various degrees among universities due to different levels of influencing forces on its operating environment. A quasi-management approach exists with continued tensions between both cultures, compromising their expected outcomes. Universities are attempting to narrow this tension gap. An analysis of the quasi-management approach further reveals that a right balance between both cultures has potential to serve as an effective management model under a multi-theoretical platform. The findings provide avenues for further research to examine this potential...|$|R
40|$|The Israeli Ministry of Education {{launched}} the "Tomorrow 98 " programme in 1994 to integrate computer-technology into the educational system. Training the teachers for this change {{was one of}} the main goals of the programme. This study examined the integration of computer-based technology of 167 ESL teachers who had participated in the course "Integrating Computers into the English Class" organised since 1994 by the Israeli Ministry of Education. This two phased study included a questionnaire sent to all the ESL teachers who participated in the course and in-depth interviews conducted with five teachers (three users and two non- users of computer technology in their teaching) and five leading figures in their schools (three computer coordinators who work in the users' schools and two school principals in whose schools the two non-users teach). The analysis of the findings shows that 70 per cent of the teachers who participated in the course integrate computer technology in their teaching. A majority of these teachers have changed their teaching methods both in the computer environment and the regular classroom. They enjoy working in the computer room more than in the normal classroom and believe that their learners feel the same. The teachers state that their main obstacles are lack of time and access. Technical problems ceased to intimidate them as they have learnt to overcome them with the aid of their learners or peers. Of the 30 per cent who do not use computers in teaching, 93 per cent use computers to prepare their lessons and worksheets. The main reason they do not integrate computers in their teaching is lack of access to computers in school. The study shows that school principals and school cultures have a distinct influence on the success or failure of computer integration in their schools. <b>Collegial</b> school <b>management</b> and supportive school culture encourage teachers to use computers in their teaching and to experiment new teaching methods. It is the hope of the researcher that this study will help teachers, principals, course developers, and other professionals working to integrate technology into instructional settings to understand the issues which accompany this process and lead it to success...|$|R

My interest was to investigate participative management with regards to five HODs of the Albany Museum with a view to generating knowledge and insights that can be used to support senior management’s engagement with participative management at mid-management level. The research was informed by the interpretive paradigm. The interpretive paradigm does not concern itself with the search for broadly applicable laws and rules but rather seeks to produce descriptive analyses that emphasise deep interpretation and understanding of social phenomena through the meaning that the people assign to them. This study is mostly descriptive and presents the reality of participants from their own experience. Semi-structured interviews and observation capture ‘insider’ knowledge that is part of an interpretive methodology. The study found that participative management was both understood and generally accepted as a good way to manage an organisation, and even members who were critical of it could see its benefits. However, the fractured and diversified structure of the organisation calls for a particularly skillful application of this management approach, one which would also demand leadership and a greater sense of working towards what are called <b>collegial</b> models of <b>management.</b> Whether this is in fact desirable for a museum is debatable...|$|R

However, an in-depth critical analysis of international educational systems reveal that these new-age concepts associated with collegiality are more theoretical in nature and seldom translated into practice in schools (Sergiovanni and Starratt, 1988). There are still deep seated bureaucratic principles embedded in the management fibre of schools and this gives rise to a false type of working together namely “contrived collegiality”, in an effort to comply with the existing demands perpetuated by legislature and policy. According to Hargreaves (1994 : 192) contrived collegiality, as opposed to genuine collegiality, arises through administrative control, and is imposed on the teachers regardless of their desires...|$|E

It is against this background that one realises that something must be amiss in the management and leadership in these schools. Could it not be time that principals of schools come of age and realise that they as individuals per se cannot salvage this situation?

40|$|One of {{the goals}} for Namibia’s Vision 2030, through ETSIP (2005 ‐ 2015), is to {{establish}} a preprimary year in primary schools for all children aged 5 ‐ 6 to be developed first in schools serving the poorest population and OVCs. ECD is widely recognised as having {{a significant impact on the}} subsequent learning of children. The high failure and dropout rate in grade 1 made this process an important one. In 2008 the integration of ECD became a reality in five schools in the Khomas region of Namibia. At present there are 29 pilot schools in the Khomas region 29 schools, and 504 in the whole of Namibia. According to the MoE all primary schools should have a preprimary class as ECD has been recognized as a key contributor to positive outcomes in schools. This study sought to investigate various stakeholders’ experiences and views of the integration of pre‐primary into mainstream pre‐primary schooling. The goal was to investigate the management and leadership implications of this integration. The study is an interpretive case study of three pilot primary schools. The research design made provision for data collection through semi‐structured interviews, focus groups and document analysis. The main finding was that, despite numerous challenges, principals are positive about the integration of pre‐primary. There is a sense of appreciation of the importance of pre‐primary. Principals adopt participative and <b>collegial</b> <b>management</b> approaches in leading their schools towards becoming learning organisations. The study also uncovered several significant challenges, such as the need for more training and the provision of infrastructure to make the process more effective...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. (Educational Leadership and Management) In {{the twenty-first}} century there is a global trend in {{educational}} systems towards system-wide change approaches at the district, provincial or national levels. The existing model, that reinforces the school as the main unit of change, is inadequate to raise learner academic achievement on a large scale. The concept of system-wide change is relevant to South African education, where there is an urgent need to develop leaders in improving instruction. This study investigated a system-wide change strategy {{at the level of}} the school district which sought to build the leadership capacity of principals and district officials towards the improvement of instruction. This three year venture was called the Leadership for Learning Programme (LLP). A feature of the LLP is that it was based on a partnership between two universities, one that understood the local context of the school district, and another that brought international expertise, experience and appeal. The research design employed is a case study. Qualitative research methods included participant observation and interviews, while the quantitative method was accomplished by means of a questionnaire. The population included all the actors involved in the LLP, which comprised of principals, district officials, facilitators, academic staff and an administrator. A literature review was undertaken to develop a conceptual framework based on systems theory. Systems theory gives primacy to the interconnectedness and interdependence of the elements in a system. The quantitative findings indicate that of the five contact sessions of the LLP, the aspect that requires the most attention in the school district is effective communication, leadership values and collaboration. This finding was supported by the qualitative findings which showed that top-down structures in overly bureaucratic systems promote authoritarian rather than <b>collegial</b> <b>management</b> styles. The poor interpersonal relationships between principals and district officials hindered learning at the LLP. In addition, tensions that existed among district officials flared up. These issues were confronted and worked through during the LLP [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was to investigate stakeholders’ perceptions and experiences of teachers’ participation in school management and decision-making. Teachers’ involvement is a contested issue in schools. The goal was to find out to what extent and in what way teachers participate in school issues, as well as gain insight and understanding {{on the effects of}} participation of teachers in schools and how principals enhance democratic practice for quality education. The research was a case study conducted within the interpretive qualitative paradigm. I used document analysis, semi-structured interviews and observation to collect data for validity purposes and to counter subjectivity. The findings revealed at least a significant progress in terms of the Education Act, no 16 of 2001 requirement, of teachers’ participation in management and decision-making in schools, which has been an issue in the past. The study revealed that decisions are taken after consultation through consensus. The study revealed that the participation approach promotes ownership and commitment of staff to higher performance and common goals. The findings emerged that participative management has advantages for achieving higher performance through collaboration, consultation, and broader participation. The foremost findings include school principals’ roles in enhancing a <b>collegial</b> <b>management</b> approach by delegating, sharing leadership and responsibilities, and establishing organisation structures and committees involving teachers. Meetings serve as a platform for communication and sharing of information with stakeholders. However, there were also signs of tensions amid school management teams (SMTs) and teachers on participation in school matters in all aspects. Furthermore, its time-consuming nature, authoritarianism and accountability emerged as major challenges affecting the implementation of the participative approach. In addition to that, the study revealed that lack of knowledge and skills, unwillingness to involve others and to participate affects the implementation of the theory. As a result, the study recommends to the policies makers and the Ministry of Education to organize training for all stakeholders on participative management to empower them. Moreover, the study recommends to regional managers, inspectors, and advisory teachers (AT) to provide information to institutions responsible for teacher training to accommodate the theory into their curriculum. School principals should undergo training programmes or in-service training for participative leadership purposes to enhance their leadership capacity and to carry out their responsibilities effectively. ...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D., Education, North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010 The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the nature of challenges that South African educators and Senior Management Teams and parents are facing in inclusive schools; and make suggestions to help the educators, parents and Senior Management Teams to develop the necessary capacity to effectively implement the inclusive education policy as propounded in White paper 6 through eco-systemic management strategies for inclusive schools. The empirical research revealed that The Department of Education, Senior Management Teams, educators and parents experience the following challenges: * Management of the implementation of White Paper 6 on inclusive education challenges. * Ecological management challenges. * Systemic management challenges. * Methodological management challenges. * Management challenges for curriculum transformation. * Socio-economic management strategies. * Management strategies for learners with physical challenges. The majority of learners require intensive learning support. School management teams cannot offer any solution to the problems encountered by educators and the Department of Education cannot afford to provide more educators, especially qualified educators for learners with special educational needs. The educational managers at Education District Offices offer very little help or no help at all and schools rarely get assistance from Educational Psychologists while parents can also not afford the services of private educational psychologists. Based on both the literature review and the empirical research findings, this research recommended that educators be continuously trained on the implementation of White paper 6, which is the core policy for the implementation of inclusion and inclusive education in South African schools. This will enable schools to have strong leaders in inclusive school settings. All schools should be provided with the services of educational psychologists and educators adequately trained regarding learners with special educational needs in order to provide sufficient support systems in psychotherapy, psychometric assessments, career counselling, learning support and so on. Parents should be educated • on inclusive education so that they can participate effectively. Schools must be empowered to infuse White Paper 6 in their vision and mission statements and school development plans. There should be collaboration between schools, universities and non-governmental agencies that are oriented towards school development in order to assist parents, learners and community members in general to understand the ideals of inclusion in education. Professors at universities can assist with advocating the policies of inclusive education to communities and developing practical modules for their learners, which can help the educators to be effectively and efficiently trained in inclusive education. School leadership and management should direct, motivate and harness all the resources in the school in the direction it is needed in order to implement policies effectively and efficiently. This requires leadership and management styles which are suitable to inclusive education. This study recommends the ecological, strategic, transformational, invitational, political, bureaucratic and <b>collegial</b> <b>management</b> models to be considered as strong pillars for inclusive educational leadership and management. Senior leadership and management teams must be trained through workshops, seminars and conferences on the models suitable for inclusive education when they are appointed. Inclusive education is necessary for South African schools. We cannot turn a blind eye on the diverse learning needs of our learners in the diverse cultures of our rainbow nation. Doctora...|$|E
