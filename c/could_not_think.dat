5|$|In January 1941, Hichens {{was given}} a new command, Motor Gun Boat 64, {{becoming}} the first RNVR officer to command a MGB, and the only RNVR crewed boat in the 6th MGB Flotilla. It was when in command of MGB 64 that Hichens got his nickname Hitch. As each boat needed to select a radio call sign, Hichens <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of anything suitable and Lieutenant Arty Shaw suggested Hitch, which stuck and remained {{with him for the}} rest of his time with the coastal forces.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, a show that Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any more spin-offs.|$|E

Being regarded as minors who <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> for themselves, they were increasingly marginalized and relieved of their land titles, often by being drawn into debt or alcohol.|$|E

25|$|It {{was a real}} {{shock for}} Bohr...who, at first, <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a solution. For the entire evening he was {{extremely}} agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them {{that it could not}} be the case, {{that it would have been}} the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox. I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement...The morning after saw the triumph of Bohr.|$|E
25|$|When Dowler {{failed to}} return home, she was {{reported}} missing to the police at 7:00pm. A nationwide search for her followed, with 100 police officers and helicopters searching fields, streets and rivers around Hersham. Detectives who had investigated the abduction of Sarah Payne were called in to help. Police and the Dowler family made many appeals for information, including a reconstruction on Crimewatch UK. The Crimewatch UK appeal included a direct appeal to Dowler {{in the hope that}} she had run away from home of her own accord. A plea was also made by Pop Idol winner Will Young, whose concert Dowler had attended shortly before her disappearance. Dowler's mother expressed hope that her daughter had run away, but said that she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a reason why she would want to do so. The Independent reported in 2011 that Dowler had, some time previously, written a mock leaving-home letter and notes showing she had been unhappy.|$|E

Nakano cites Hamauzu as the colleague he admires most at Square Enix, and is particularly interested in the sounds he creates. When asked about his thoughts of Uematsu and how he had influenced his work, Nakano replied: [...] "He is a very youthful and active person, but he hasn't influenced my work." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{the station}} opened, the {{surrounding}} area was almost entirely rural, and would remain so throughout the station's existence. Indeed, in 1902, John L Dunk wrote in The Railway Magazine that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> why trains ran only to an inn and a few cottages. The area did however see some development, as the Avonmouth Hotel was built adjacent to the station, as well as [...] of pleasure gardens. The gardens boasted a concert hall, {{as well as an}} ornamental lake, and hosted fêtes at Easter and Whitsun. Despite excursion trains to the gardens, they were not viable financially.|$|E
500|$|Digital Trends's Anthony John Agnello {{wrote that}} [...] "no video game fans have {{suffered}} {{as much as}} EarthBound fans, and cited Nintendo's reluctance to release Mother series games in North America. IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons. Aaron Linde of Shacknews felt that Nintendo's [...] "historic passive-aggression towards EarthBound fans [...] somehow anachronistic" [...] {{in response to the}} outcries from the game's fan community. He added that while the company is known for providing [...] "the most personal experiences in gaming's history", Nintendo lacks the [...] "bedside manner" [...] required of contemporary game companies, and that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a [...] "more deserving fan base" [...] than EarthBound.|$|E

500|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg {{made a deal}} with Paramount Pictures for five Indiana Jones films. Following the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lucas let the series end as he felt he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a good plot device to drive the next installment, and chose instead to produce The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles for TV, which {{explored}} the character in his early years. Harrison Ford played Indiana in one episode, narrating his adventures in 1920 Chicago. When Lucas shot Ford's role in December 1992, he realized the scene opened up the possibility of a film with an older Indiana set in the 1950s. The film could reflect a science fiction 1950s B-movie, with aliens as the plot device. Meanwhile, Spielberg believed he was going to [...] "mature" [...] as a filmmaker after making the trilogy, and felt he would just produce any future installments.|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had always}} wanted Marsters {{for the role of}} Milton Fine/Brainiac. The pair wrote a draft for the major story arc of season five, knowing they wanted a new villain on the show to fight Clark. With the arrival of the black ship at the end of season four, Gough and Millar decided to {{introduce}} Brainiac. To them, Marsters was the only actor they could envision that could fit the [...] "menace, intelligence, and sexiness" [...] Brainiac was going to embody. Had Marsters declined the role, Gough and Millar would have rethought introducing Brainiac, as they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any other actor who could fill those shoes. Marsters felt excited playing a character that was completely intentional; he likened the intention to that of a shark. As Marsters explains, [...] " [...] was just composed of his intent. And that's exciting—it's like watching a shark. You don't really ask how a shark is feeling—it's pure." ...|$|E
500|$|Robey {{took part}} in the Festival of Variety for the BBC in 1951, which paid tribute to the British music hall. For his performance, he adopted an ad-lib style rather than use a script. His wife sat {{at the side of the}} stage, ready to provide support should he need it. According to Wilson, Robey's turn earned the loudest applause of the evening. The {{following}} month Robey undertook a long provincial tour in the variety show Do You Remember? under the management of Bernard Delfont. After an evening's performance in Sheffield, he was asked by a local newspaper reporter if he considered retiring. The comedian quipped: [...] "Me retire? Good gracious, I'm too old for that. [...] I <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of starting a new career at my age!" [...] In December, he opened the Lansbury Lodge home for retired cricketers in Poplar, East London; he considered the ceremony to be one of the [...] "happiest memories of his life." ...|$|E

500|$|... ? was {{directed}} by Hanung Bramantyo, who is of mixed Chinese-Javanese descent. He decided to direct a pluralist-themed film based on his own experiences as a mixed-race child. He chose the title ? to avoid protests upon the film's release, saying that {{if it had been}} named Liberalism or Pluralism there would be protests by opponents of those ideologies, and that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a better title. The individual characters are based on people Bramantyo has known or read about. His goal in making the film was to [...] "clarify misleading arguments about Islam" [...] and counter the portrayal of Islam as a [...] "radical religion". In a pre-release press conference, Bramantyo said that ? was not meant to be commercial, but to make a statement. The film, his fourteenth, is one of several Islam-themed movies he has directed, after the polygamous romantic drama Ayat-Ayat Cinta (The Verses of Love; 2008) and the biopic Sang Pencerah (The Enlightener; 2009).|$|E
500|$|Before Pausch was {{diagnosed}} with pancreatic cancer, he was originally going to have his lecture based on the generic academic-style [...] "Last Lecture," [...] and was not expecting his cancer to {{play a part in}} the decision. Pausch <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a subject for the speech, and was constantly being e-mailed by speech organizers and event organizers from Carnegie Mellon. Pausch was told in August, a month before the lecture, that a poster must be printed and he needed to decide on a subject immediately. The same week, he was told that the prognosis for his pancreatic cancer was to be terminal. Pausch nearly canceled the lecture after hearing the news. He was deciding whether to make the speech, or to stay at home to get his family in order so that they would be set to live a normal life following Pausch's death. Pausch discussed the matter with his wife Jai, who requested that Pausch stay at home. Jai suggested that Pausch should be spending some of his time left with their three children, not giving a speech at his workplace. Pausch decided against this, after explaining that his children would remember him through seeing his lecture.|$|E
500|$|Carter was {{inspired}} to write the scene in which Scully splashes water into Doggett's face, since {{he was aware that}} new actor Robert Patrick would be facing opposition from some members of the fan community. The scene was even the first filmed, in order to truly introduce Patrick to the show. After the conclusion of The X-Files television series in 2002, Patrick commented that this part of the episode had been his favorite scene in the series, and admitted that he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a better way to introduce his character because the scene not only said a lot, but it had actually helped him. Tom Braidwood, who appears in this episode as long-running recurring character Frohike, similarly remarked that the first meeting of Doggett and Scully was one of his favorite scenes from the entire series. Both Robert Patrick and the director of this episode, Kim Manners, felt that it was the perfect introduction to the character of John Doggett {{as the leader of the}} taskforce sent to find Mulder. Manners stated that Patrick gave a new [...] "sense of energy" [...] to the show, since they had basically used the same characters for seven years.|$|E

500|$|She went to {{the garage}} and saw Fischer's body lying face up on the driveway. She told her {{daughter}} Kathy to call 911, and her father, Buddy, who lived a few minutes away. Buddy dressed {{and headed toward the}} house. He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. As he drew closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance. When he arrived, he saw his son's body holding a garden hose. The running water had covered the entire roadway with Fischer's blood. Witnesses, including Eric, recall seeing a short-bearded Hispanic man in his mid-20s driving a white, four-door vehicle with Mexican license plates speeding away after the attack. Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started and asked him if he knew if Fischer had any enemies. Fischer's friend <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of anyone who disliked him, and only recalled that he and Fischer had been in an altercation with a group of boys at a football game.|$|E
500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and they tried to get the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|For the B-plot, Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{attempts}} {{to move out}} of his home after his divorce from Wendy (Jama Williamson). Tom again hesitates to reveal his feelings for his ex-wife, whom he married to protect from deportation. Mark (Paul Schneider) reluctantly helps Tom through the moving process as he is a truck owner and <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of a [...] "valid excuse". Donna (Retta), April (Aubrey Plaza), [...] Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Andy (Chris Pratt) join to assist Tom move his many boxes to his new home, while Tom himself works very little. At the end of the episode, Tom learns that his new home has a gas leak and that he is unable to move into his new home until Monday. Tom asks the department members to take the boxes into their own homes, but they ultimately bring his possessions and leave them in the Parks and Recreation Department office. Throughout the move, April continues to develop romantic feelings for Andy, who remains oblivious to her affections. When April's boyfriend Derek (Blake Lee) and his gay boyfriend Ben (Josh Duvendeck) arrive at Wendy's house, they mock Andy, which prompts April to refer to their behavior as [...] "really gay for a gay couple." [...] In their final appearance in the episode, Andy asks April to watch him roller-blade after work, but April declines his offer, implying that the comments of her boyfriend and his boyfriend may have confounded her feelings towards Andy.|$|E
