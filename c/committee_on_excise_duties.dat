40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyse the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco {{products}} in the Czech Republic since 1993 {{up to the present}} time, especially the development of rates and revenues. <b>Excise</b> <b>duty</b> is imposed <b>on</b> tobacco products in the Czech Republic and also in the other European Union countries. Harmonisation efforts in the European Union and also fiscal need of Czech Republic cause frequent changes in tobacco <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> rates, which conduces not only to change of tax collection, but can also bring some other related effects. In the theoretical part I first characterize the tax theory with a detailed focus <b>on</b> <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products. Subsequently I define the meaning of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products, the principles and the mechanisms of the tax collection. In the practical part of the thesis I aim at analyse the evolution of the legal framework that affects <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products and significantly affects the thesis in other sections. Further, I analyse the relationship between the rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products and tax collection and find out that the higher rate of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> not always led to higher tax yields. Finally I assess the effectiveness of the increase of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> tobacco products {{and its impact on the}} consumption of tobacco products, illegal market and the public budgets...|$|R

The theoretical part deals with tax theory with a detailed focus <b>on</b> <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> <b>on</b> mineral oils. The practical part of the thesis deals with {{the analysis of the}} evolution of the legal framework that affects solved tax and significantly affects the thesis in other sections.

40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of taxation {{as a major}} public finance to developed and developing countries is non-debatable. The issue of smuggling activities related to the indirect taxation had caused a great lost to the government not only in term of monetary aspect, but also non-monetary aspects such as quotas, embargo and product quality. However, the study of a tax evasion and smuggling activities in the indirect taxation have received less attention among the researchers and legislators. Hence, the current study aims to examine factors affecting the tax evasion <b>on</b> <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> for importation of vehicles that {{can be associated with}} smuggling activities in Malaysia. The study has indentified several potential determinants related to tax evasion on imported vehicles, such as the tax rate, penalty structure, the car's brand and size of the business of car importers. To achieve the objectives, this study used sample data from vehicles smuggling cases investigated by the tax authorities in Malaysia. The hypotheses were tested using both univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The statistical results provided evidence on the significant values of evaded <b>excise</b> <b>duties,</b> whereby the <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> and penalty rates are the contributing factors for the tax evasion in vehicles smuggling activities. Hence, this study contributes towards the body of literature in the discussed area and also provides strategic information to the policymakers in reviewing the tax policy related to <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> <b>on</b> imported vehicles in the future...|$|R
40|$|The Uganda {{government}} has since 1987 initiated {{a sequence of}} tax reforms to address the fiscal challenges facing the country. This paper uses a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the welfare effects of tax reforms on households {{and the impact of}} these challenges on production and firm activities. The findings are consistent with previous studies which found that the introduction of VAT was indeed a progressive policy reform. Zero rating all food items and agricultural products mainly benefit the low income households whose consumption basket is mainly food items. In a quest for further sources of revenue by overtaxing the rich, this could generate further revenues albeit lower savings and investments by this group. Finally, over-reliance <b>on</b> <b>excise</b> <b>duties</b> especially <b>on</b> petroleum and alcohol drinks affects the transportation sectors which are also used by the poor.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the impact of <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> increases <b>on</b> the retail price of gasoline and diesel in the Czech Republic. This study is primarily concerned with the issue of tax burden shifting because of transport fuel <b>excise</b> <b>duties.</b> This paper analyses the tax shifting process by focusing <b>on</b> periodic <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> increases to identify whether overshifting occurs and what the consequences are for the Pigovian principle of environmental taxation. The research results show that overshifting of tax burden occurs with gradual tax rate increases in selected countries. Therefore, this enables it to be emphasized that overshifting violates the rationale of corrective taxation, increasing the distortionary effects of environmental taxes and substantially decreasing taxes’ efficiency in pollution abatement...|$|R

40|$|Palinka is a {{traditional}} Hungarian fruit spirit prepared exclusively by the distillation of fruit mash or fruit pulp. As an alcoholproduct, it {{is subject to the}} Act CXXVII of 2003 <b>on</b> <b>Excise</b> <b>Duties</b> and Special Regulations on the Distribution of Excise Goods amended severaltimes. The present government of Hungary pledged to grant the right of free palinka distillation again in the previous election campaign. As of 27 September 2010, the <b>excise</b> <b>duty</b> of subcontract-distillation was repealed, and the previously non-existent “official” home distillation wasintroduced, which resulted in explicit revenue losses for the state budget. The modification of the law mentions distillate instead of the wordpalinka. The difference between the two notions will be discussed in the present study. Presumably, lawmakers did not consider the fact that atthe time of Hungary’s EU accession we entered into an agreement stipulating that the tax on subcontract-distillation should not be lower than 50 % of the tax on alcohol products. Having been unable to agree on a solution to the problems in question, Brussels launched an infringementprocedure against Hungary. Finally, Hungary was convicted; therefore, tax exemption or palinka distillation shall be ceased. This regulationcame into force on 01 January 2015. The reactions of those who used the services of subcontract distillation were negative; turnover plungedby approximately 85 % compared to the year of 2014.
