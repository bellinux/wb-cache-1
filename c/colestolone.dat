50|$|<b>Colestolone</b> {{has been}} found to {{significantly}} reduce serum levels of cholesterol both in animals and in humans. It inhibits multiple relatively early-stage steps in cholesterol biosynthesis such as HMG-CoA reductase and does not appear to affect any late-stage steps (after squalene, specifically). Unlike late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors like triparanol and azacosterol, no accumulation of sterols has been observed in animals treated with <b>colestolone,</b> suggesting that it does not share the toxicity of late-stage cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to its potent inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, it is notable that <b>colestolone</b> also happens {{to serve as a}} precursor of cholesterol, and is efficiently converted into it in rat liver homogenates and upon oral administration to rats.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Colestolone</b> ( [...] , [...] ), {{also known}} as 5α-cholest-8(14)-en-3β-ol-15-one, is a potent {{inhibitor}} of sterol biosynthesis which {{is described as a}} hypocholesterolemic (lipid-lowering) agent. It was first reported in 1977 and was studied until at least 1988, but was never introduced for medical use.|$|E
