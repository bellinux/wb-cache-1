Since privatisation in 1990 ownership has changed several times, and it is operated by the Drax Group. Completed in 1986, it is the newest <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in England, flue gas desulphurisation equipment was fitted between 1988 and 1995; high and low pressure turbines were replaced between 2007 and 2012.

Prior to its cancellation, the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy also made a statement that no more coal-fired power stations will be commissioned, making Lakvijaya the only <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in the country. Any future thermal power stations will also be natural gas–run, to reduce the nation's carbon footprint.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April, K-25 had attained a 1.1 percent enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7 percent enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other {{production plant}}s and became the prototypes {{for a new generation of}} plants. Uranium was enriched by the K-25 gaseous diffusion process until 1985; the plants were then decommissioned and decontaminated. A 235 MW <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was included for reliability and to provide variable frequency, although most electric power came from the TVA.|$|E

25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E

They were operated by the successors of the CEGB, including National Power, following the privatisation of the UK's power industry. After their closure in 2001, the stations [...] were demolished over the course of two years, ending with the demolition of the stations' chimneys on 7December 2003. As of 2009, the site is still covered in debris from the demolition. RWE Npower have proposed the construction of a clean <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> on the site.

The station was part of a post-war plan by NESCo, and the scheme had a projected cost of £3,500,000. The site was chosen in the mid-Durham area to be close to the coal supplies. It also needed to be a short distance from the River Wear, downstream of Durham, and on solid foundations. Mine workings in County Durham restricted the number of possible sites which could meet the requirement for solid foundations. The site also required good road and rail access.|$|E
500|$|Battersea Power Station is a {{decommissioned}} <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{located on}} the south bank of the River Thames, in Nine Elms, Battersea, an inner-city district of South West London. It comprises two individual power stations, built in two stages {{in the form of}} a single building. Battersea A Power Station was built in the 1930s, with Battersea B Power Station to the east in the 1950s. The two stations were built to a nearly identical design, providing the long-recognized four-chimney layout. The station ceased generating electricity in 1983, but over the past 50 years it has become one of the best known landmarks in London and is Grade II* listed. The station's celebrity owes much to numerous popular culture references, which include the cover art of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals and its appearance in the 1965 Beatles' film Help! ...|$|E

Planned by the North Eastern Electric Supply Company (NESCo) in 1944, it was never realised as the scheme faced stiff opposition from those who claimed it would obstruct views of the historic Durham Cathedral from the East Coast Main Line. A number of people supported the scheme as it would help meet the increasing demand for electricity and provide much needed jobs in the post-depression, post-war economy of Britain. The station, which had been designed by architect Giles Gilbert Scott, would have been operational by the late 1940s and would have generated 150 megawatts of electricity. However, following a public inquiry the plans were not approved and instead NESCo installed new capacity at their existing power stations.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, while Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Miliband {{attended}} the UK premiere {{of climate change}} film The Age of Stupid, where he was ambushed by actor Pete Postlethwaite, who threatened to return his OBE and vote for any party other than Labour if the Kingsnorth <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> were {{to be given the}} go-ahead by the government. A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government's policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could demonstrate that {{they would be able to}} effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a government source told the Guardian, effectively represented [...] "a complete rewrite of UK energy policy for the future".|$|E
500|$|In 1921, Sheffield Corporation built a <b>coal-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> on spare land at {{the south}} west corner of Blackburn Meadows. At the time there was no {{national}} grid, and the steelworks which occupied much of the Lower Don Valley needed additional electrical power. The chosen site {{was close to the}} steel works, was near the river, which supplied cooling water, and was well-served by railway lines, to deliver coal. The station was modified between 1937 and 1942, when its capacity was increased to 72 Megawatts, and remained operational until the 1980s. When the rest of the power station was demolished, two of its seven cooling towers were left standing due to their close proximity to the M1 motorway, and the risk that their demolition might cause Tinsley Viaduct to be damaged. The [...] towers were hyperbolic in shape, and were designed by L. G. Mouchel and Partners, who had also been responsible for the first such towers erected at Liverpool in 1925. The Blackburn Meadows towers were built between 1937 and 1938. English Heritage considered whether they should be designated as listed structures, but ruled against it because the internal cooling structures had been removed, and there was no context for them, {{as the rest of the}} station no longer existed. On 24 August 2008, at 3am, the two landmark towers were finally demolished with explosives, without damaging the motorway.|$|E
