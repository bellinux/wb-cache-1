40|$|This degree {{project is}} divided into two sub{{projects}}. Both of the projects are executed for Fogmaker, a company that specialises in designing and installing fire suppression systems in engine compartments. These projects are executed according to product development methods. The first subproject described in this report is about designing a handle for the transportation of a 35 kg weighing fire extinguisher. The handle functions as a safety seal and as a grip that makes it easier and safer to lift the fire extinguisher. A casted zinc T-handle is the best solution based on cost and AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) analysis. An FMECA (Failure Mode Effect and Criticality Analysis) and a FEM (Finite Element Method) study have been performed to verify the design. A zinc prototype of the safety handle has been manufactured and is ready for testing. It is expected that 10. 000 handles will be produced every year once this prototype is approved by Fogmaker. The second subproject concerns a <b>connection</b> <b>hub</b> placed on a pressurized bottle. In order to make the fire suppression system more reliable this component needs to be redesigned. An external company with the required expertise in hydraulic systems will develop the <b>connection</b> <b>hub</b> in cooperation with Fogmaker, based on the conceptual designs described in this report. An FMECA of the new <b>connection</b> <b>hub</b> concept proves this redesign increases the safety of the system.

40|$|International {{students}} have become major role players in international education across the globe. Their enrollment in different universities {{has increased in}} the past few decades worldwide. Most of these students bring rich cultural diversity and skills to their various host institutions and countries. These trends signal the need to examine and understand international students within the South African context. Against this background, this study explores the factors that influence academic choices of international students, academic and social challenges they face and the role of social capital in influencing international student integration at the Universities of Fort Hare and Rhodes in South Africa. A qualitative research design was employed in this study. Thirty international students were selected (and interviewed) using purposive sampling and snowballing. The study found that some of the main factors that influence the academic choices of international students include availability of scholarships and funding, recommendations of the institution by family and friends, availability of preferred course and the reputation of the institution. Some of the main challenges faced by international students in these two institutions include language barriers, financial difficulty, expensive but improperly maintained accommodation and culture shock. These challenges impede the smooth integration of international students into their new academic and social environment. However, the students employ several strategies in attempt to address the challenges they face. These include joining a student or community social organization, community engagement and making friends. These social networks and organizations serve as a support system and <b>connection</b> <b>hub</b> for the students. The study recommends that it is pertinent for the University of Fort Hare and Rhodes University to meet the needs and expectations of its international students through regular surveys that give them room to speak about their experiences. The need for efficient International Offices at both institutions is crucial as well as the employment of open‐minded multicultural trained staff in these offices. The study also suggests the need for the both institutions to provide affordable and comfortable accommodation for its international students...|$|E

40|$|Many online social {{networking}} websites allow arbitrary Web users to easily add popular users, such as famous celebrities and musicians, into their circle of friends. Such popular users, or “hubs, ” {{have a large}} number of connections in the social network. However, most online social networks treat such hubs {{in much the same way}} as they do ordinary users in terms of security and privacy. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the dangers of not differentiating between hubs and ordinary users. In particular, we show how malicious social network users can leverage their <b>connections</b> with <b>hubs</b> to amplify misdeeds, such as small-scale DDoS attacks and botnet command and control. While instances of these attacks can readily be detected and prevented using previously proposed techniques, the ease with which a {{social networking}} user can abuse <b>connections</b> with <b>hubs</b> is a worrisome attack vector. This work also underscores the need for online social networks to have better access control policies for such hubs, e. g., in how users can interact with such hubs. We conclude with design requirements for online social networking websites that would protect against amplicification attacks and yet preserve the freedom of Web users and the openness of social networks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{human brain}} is {{organized}} into {{a collection of}} interacting networks with specialized functions to support various cognitive functions. Recent research has reached a consensus that the brain manifests small-world topology, which implicates both global and local efficiency at minimal wiring costs, and also modular organization, which indicates functional segregation and specialization. However, the important questions of how and when the small-world topology and modular organization come into existence remain largely unanswered. Taking a graph theoretic approach, we attempt {{to shed light on}} this matter by an in vivo study, using diffusion tensor imaging based fiber tractography, on 39 healthy pediatric subjects with longitudinal data collected at average ages of 2 weeks, 1 year, and 2 years. Our results indicate that the small-world architecture exists at birth with efficiency that increases in later stages of development. In addition, we found that the networks are broad scale in nature, signifying the existence of pivotal <b>connection</b> <b>hubs</b> and resilience of the brain network to random and targeted attacks. We also observed, with development, that the brain network seems to evolve progressively from a local, predominantly proximity based, connectivity pattern to a more distributed, predominantly functional based, connectivity pattern.

40|$|Background: EEG {{studies have}} shown that {{patients}} with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have weaker functional connectivity than controls, especially in higher frequency bands. Furthermore, active regions seem more prone to AD pathology. How functional connectivity is affected in AD subgroups of disease severity and how network hubs (highly connected brain areas) change is not known. We compared AD patients with different disease severity and controls in terms of functional <b>connections,</b> <b>hub</b> strength and hub location. Methods: We studied routine 21 -channel resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) of 318 AD patients (divided into tertiles based on disease severity: mild, moderate and severe AD) and 133 age-matched controls. Functional connectivity between EEG channels was estimated with the Phase Lag Index (PLI). From the PLI-based connectivity matrix, the minimum spanning tree (MST) was derived. For each node (EEG channel) in the MST, the betweenness centrality (BC) was computed, a measure to quantify the relative importance of a node within the network. Then we derived color-coded head plots based on BC values and calculated the center of mass (the exact middle had x and y values of 0). A shifting of the hub locations was defined as a shift of the center of mass on the y-axis across groups. Multivariate general linear models with PLI or BC values as dependent variables and the groups as continuous variables were used in the five conventional frequency bands...|$|R
40|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the default mode network (DMN) {{plays an important role in}} the pathological mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). To examine whether the cortical activities in DMN regions show significant difference between mild AD from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), electrophysiological responses were analyzed from 21 mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and 21 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients during an eyes closed, resting-state condition. The spectral power and functional connectivity of the DMN were estimated using a minimum norm estimate (MNE) combined with fast Fourier transform and imaginary coherence analysis. Our results indicated that source-based EEG maps of resting-state activity showed alterations of cortical spectral power in mild AD when compared to MCI. These alterations are characteristic of attenuated alpha or beta activities in the DMN, as are enhanced delta or theta activities in the medial temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. With regard to altered synchronization in AD, altered functional interconnections were observed as specific connectivity patterns of <b>connection</b> <b>hubs</b> in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal regions. Moreover, posterior theta and alpha power and altered connectivity in the medial temporal lobe correlated significantly with scores obtained on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
