40|$|Background and Aim: Carbon {{monoxide}} is colorless and odorless gas. In high concentrations, CO is deadly poisonous and in low concentrations {{can cause}} fatigue, headache, dizziness and seizures. Carbon monoxide {{has a high}} affinity to combines hemoglobin which can decrease oxygen capacity in blood. To address this problem, human body begins to produce red blood cells, this can increases blood viscosity and thus increase diseases such as stroke and heart attack. About 60 percent of total emissions of carbon monoxide are associated automobile exhaust. In this study, concentration of carbon monoxide has been measured in the cabin space of taxis in high-traffic areas of Tehran. Materials and Methods: This study is carried out in spring and summer 2011. Concentrations of carbon monoxide in different types of taxi cabin space (Peugeot, Samand, Pride and Peykan) were measured by <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>meter</b> Q RAE 2 models in different conditions of motion: high speed (over 45 kilometers per hour), low speed (15 - 30 kilometers per hour) and stop (0 kilometers per hour). Results: Results showed that concentration of carbon monoxide in old vehicles (above 10 years) is {{more than three times}} compared to new vehicles and outdoor. In addition, according to the measured values, at low speeds, values of CO rapidly increased, so that in speeds of less than 15 km, values of CO go beyond standard values (9 ppm). Conclusion: Results show that the mean value of the measured concentration of carbon monoxide is higher than amounts recommended by WHO and EPA and local authorities such as Air Quality Control Organization of Tehran. Concentrations observed in this study are up to 40 more than results of a study by German researchers in summer 1995 and winter 1996...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Smoking {{cessation}} {{has been}} shown to be an important intervention for preventing cardiovascular events and improving the health of patients with heart disease. However, unaided quit attempts in these patients often leads to high rates of failure and a return to smoking. Outpatient smoking cessation clinics using face-to-face counseling, ongoing behavioral support, advice on smoking pharmacotherapy and objective monitoring, have been found to be one of the most effective interventions for improving quit smoking rates. An outpatient smoking cessation clinic was trialed within a cardiac rehabilitation service in order to explore its effects on smoking rates for patients with or at risk of heart disease. Attendance rates to the clinic were also monitored. Methods: A descriptive exploratory design was used for this newly developed clinic. Patients who currently smoked tobacco and who had a history of either coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation or those seen under a chest pain assessment service were invited to an outpatient ‘Cardiac Patients Smokers Clinic’. Initially patients were offered up to 10 clinic visits over a 3 month period. Follow-up clinic visits were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months. A portable <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>meter</b> was used to objectively measure levels of smoking and validate smoking abstinence. Primary outcomes included rates of attendance. Results: Preliminary findings showed 24 per cent of participants (N = 6) completed all their clinic visits and remained smoke free as measured by their ongoing expired carbon monoxide readings. Clinic attendance rates appeared lowest for those with significant mental health issues such as schizophrenia or substance abuse. However, rates of attendance were improved by having an administration officer make reminder telephone calls prior to clinic visits. Conclusions: Early findings indicate the feasibility of providing a specialist smoking cessation clinic within a cardiac rehabilitation service. Further, that reminder telephone calls prior to appointments improved attendance rates in patients with heart disease to this type of clinic. However, future investigations are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Many {{people with}} Severe Mental Illness (SMI) use smoking to manage symptoms, stress, or {{increase}} social contact, and consume {{nearly half of}} all tobacco sold in the US. Compared with the general population, individuals with SMI are at greater risk of co-morbid health problems and premature death. Often individuals with SMI are unaware that services like Quitlines, Nicotine Anonymous (NIC-A) meetings, and/or NRT exist. To compound matters, many states (e. g. Massachusetts) have cut tobacco cessation funding, and few programs provide integrated approaches to tobacco cessation in mental health settings that include peer supports. The lack of services and large disparities in smoking rates and health outcomes in people with SMI have resulted in a national crisis. There is a need to implement and evaluate cost-effective interventions that attempt to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use among people with SMI.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study was}} carried out to understand the effect of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> enrichment on flame temperature and NO formation in counterflow methane/air diffusion flames. Detailed chemistry and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. The results indicate that when <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> {{is added to the}} fuel, both flame temperature and NO formation rate are changed due to the variations in adiabatic flame temperature, fuel Lewis number and chemical reaction. The combination effects of three factors result in the different characteristics of flame temperature and NO formation at various strain rates, when <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> is added. At a low strain rate, the addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> causes a monotonic decrease in flame temperature and peak NO concentration. However, NO emission index first slightly increases, and then decreases. When the value of strain rate is moderate, the addition of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> has negligible effect on flame temperature and leads to a slight increase in both peak NO concentration and NO emission index, until the fraction of <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> reaches about 0. 7.

MethodsOrthotopic left lung transplantation was performed in syngeneic Lewis to Lewis rats. Grafts were preserved in University of Wisconsin solution with or without (control solution) <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> at 4 °C for 6 hours. <b>Carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> gas (5 % or 100 %) was bubbled into University of Wisconsin solution at 4 °C for 5 minutes before use.

Grafts stored in University of Wisconsin solution with <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (5 %), however, demonstrated significantly better gas exchange and significantly reduced intragraft inflammation (reduced inflammatory mediators and cellular infiltrate).
