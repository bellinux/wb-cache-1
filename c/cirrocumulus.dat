5|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, rippling patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of <b>cirrocumulus</b> clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Jet stream-powered cirrus {{can grow}} {{long enough to}} stretch across continents while {{remaining}} only a few kilometers deep. When visible light interacts with the ice crystals in cirrus cloud, it produces optical phenomena such as sun dogs and halos. Cirrus is known to raise {{the temperature of the}} air beneath the main cloud layer by an average of 10°C (18°F). When the individual filaments become so extensive that they are virtually indistinguishable from one another, they form a sheet of high cloud called cirrostratus. Convection at high altitudes can produce another high-based genus called <b>cirrocumulus,</b> a pattern of small cloud tufts that contain droplets of supercooled water.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} often {{precursors}} of {{other types of}} cloud, such as cumulonimbus, when influenced by weather factors such as instability, moisture, and temperature gradient. Normally, cumulus clouds produce little or no precipitation, but they can grow into the precipitation-bearing congestus or cumulonimbus clouds. Cumulus clouds can be formed from water vapor, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals, depending upon the ambient temperature. They come in many distinct subforms, and generally cool the earth by reflecting the incoming solar radiation. Cumulus clouds are part of the larger category of free-convective cumuliform clouds, which include cumulonimbus clouds. The latter genus-type is sometimes categorized separately as cumulonimbiform due to its more complex structure that often includes a cirriform or anvil top. There are also cumuliform clouds of limited convection that comprise stratocumulus (low-), altocumulus (middle-étage) and <b>cirrocumulus.</b> (high-étage). These last three genus-types are sometimes classified separately as stratocumuliform.|$|E
25|$|One {{group of}} {{supplementary}} features are not actual cloud formations, but precipitation that falls when water droplets or ice crystals {{that make up}} visible clouds have grown too heavy to remain aloft. Virga is a feature seen with clouds producing precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground, these being of the genera <b>cirrocumulus,</b> altocumulus, altostratus, nimbostratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus.|$|E
25|$|The mamma feature {{forms on}} {{the bases of}} clouds as downward-facing bubble-like protuberances caused by {{localized}} downdrafts within the cloud. It is also sometimes called mammatus, {{an earlier version of}} the term used before a standardization of Latin nomenclature brought about by the World Meterorological Organization during the 20th century. The best-known is cumulonimbus with mammatus, but the mamma feature is also seen occasionally with cirrus, <b>cirrocumulus,</b> altocumulus, altostratus, and stratocumulus.|$|E
25|$|Clouds of this {{structure}} have both cumuliform and stratiform characteristics {{in the form}} of rolls, ripples, or patches. They generally form as a result of limited convection in an otherwise mostly stable airmass topped by an inversion layer. If the inversion layer is absent or higher in the troposphere, increased convective activity may cause the cloud layers to develop tops {{in the form of}} turrets consisting of embedded cumuliform buildups. The stratocumuliform group is divided into <b>cirrocumulus</b> (high-level), altocumulus (mid-level), and stratocumulus (low-level).|$|E
25|$|This is a mid-level stratocumuliform {{cloud layer}} of limited {{convection}} {{that is usually}} appears {{in the form of}} irregular patches or more extensive sheets arranges in groups, lines, or waves. Altocumulus near the top of its range may resemble <b>cirrocumulus</b> but is usually thicker and composed of water droplets so that the bases show at least some light-grey shading. Opaque altocumulus associated with a weak frontal or low-pressure disturbance can produce virga, very light intermittent precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground. If the altocumulus is mixed with moisture-laden altostratus, the precipitation may reach the ground.|$|E
500|$|Cirrus Floccus {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "lock of wool" [...] or cirrus with ragged bases. They {{are not to be}} {{confused}} with <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus since they are larger than <b>cirrocumulus</b> and mostly are isolated. A precipitation-based supplementary feature virga is mostly visible, which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus and cirrus floccus.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, <b>cirrocumulus,</b> and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cirrus {{clouds are}} one of three {{different}} genera of high-étage (high-level) clouds. High-étage clouds form at [...] and above in temperate regions. The other two genera, <b>cirrocumulus</b> and cirrostratus, are also high clouds.|$|E
500|$|Smaller cumulus or {{stratocumulus}} clouds, {{along with}} cirrus, and, sometimes, altocumulus or <b>cirrocumulus,</b> {{can be found}} ahead of the squall line. [...] These clouds {{are the result of}} former cumulonimbus clouds having disintegrated, or an area of only minor instability ahead of the main squall line.|$|E
500|$|Some {{cumuliform}} clouds {{have been}} discovered on most other planets in the solar system. On Mars, the Viking Orbiter detected <b>cirrocumulus</b> and stratocumulus clouds forming via convection primarily near the polar icecaps. The Galileo space probe detected massive cumulonimbus clouds near the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. Cumuliform clouds have also been detected on Saturn. In 2008, the Cassini spacecraft determined that cumulus clouds near Saturn's south pole {{were part of a}} cyclone over [...] in diameter. The Keck Observatory detected whitish cumulus clouds on Uranus. Like Uranus, Neptune has methane cumulus clouds. Venus, however, {{does not appear to have}} cumulus clouds.|$|E
500|$|Cumulus {{clouds are}} a genus of free-convective low-étage cloud {{along with the}} related limited-convective {{cumuliform}} or stratocumuliform cloud stratocumulus. These clouds form from ground level to [...] at all latitudes. Stratus clouds are also low-étage. In the middle étage are the alto clouds, which consist of the limiited-convective cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud altocumulus and the stratiform cloud altostratus. Middle-étage clouds form from [...] to [...] in polar areas, [...] in temperate areas, and [...] in tropical areas. The high-étage clouds are all cirriform, one of which, <b>cirrocumulus,</b> is also cumuliform of limited convection or stratocumuliform. The other clouds in this étage are cirrus and cirrostratus. High-étage clouds form [...] in high latitudes, [...] in temperate latitudes, and [...] in low, tropical latitudes. Cumulonimbus clouds, like cumulus congestus, extend vertically rather than remaining confined to one étage.|$|E
500|$|Altocumulus {{clouds are}} a middle-étage cloud that forms from [...] high to [...] in polar areas, [...] in {{temperate}} areas, and [...] in tropical areas. They can have precipitation and are commonly {{composed of a}} mixture of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and water droplets in temperate latitudes. However, the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals, and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended {{to be at the}} top of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom. The ice crystals in the base of the altocumulus clouds and in the virga were found to be dendrites or conglomerations of dendrites while needles and plates resided more towards the top. Altocumulus clouds can form via convection or via the forced uplift caused by a warm front. Because Altocumulus is a genus-type of limited convection, it is divided into the same four species as <b>cirrocumulus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{pure white}} high stratocumuliform layer of limited convection. [...] It is {{composed}} of ice crystals or supercooled water droplets appearing as small unshaded round masses or flakes in groups or lines with ripples like sand on a beach. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> occasionally forms alongside cirrus and may be accompanied or replaced by cirrostratus clouds at the very leading edge of an active weather system.|$|E
2500|$|Cloud cover {{has been}} seen on most other planets in the solar system. Venus's thick clouds are {{composed}} of sulfur dioxide (due to volcanic activity) and appear to be almost entirely stratiform. They are arranged in three main layers at altitudes of 45 to 65km that obscure the planet's surface and can produce virga. No embedded cumuliform types have been identified, but broken stratocumuliform wave formations are sometimes seen in the top layer that reveal more continuous layer clouds underneath. [...] On Mars, noctilucent, cirrus, <b>cirrocumulus</b> and stratocumulus composed of water-ice have been detected mostly near the poles. [...] Water-ice fogs have also been detected on Mars.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with <b>cirrocumulus</b> and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|Stratocumuliform genus-types (<b>cirrocumulus,</b> altocumulus, and stratocumulus) {{that appear}} in mostly stable air have two species each. [...] The {{stratiformis}} species normally occur in extensive sheets or in smaller patches where there is only minimal convective activity. Clouds of the lenticularis species tend to have lens-like shapes tapered at the ends. They are most commonly seen as orographic mountain-wave clouds, but can occur anywhere in the troposphere where there is strong wind shear combined with sufficient airmass stability to maintain a generally flat cloud structure. [...] These two species {{can be found in}} the high, middle, or low level of the troposphere depending on the stratocumuliform genus or genera present at any given time.|$|E
2500|$|High clouds form at altitudes of [...] in {{the polar}} regions, [...] in the {{temperate}} regions and [...] in the tropics. [...] All cirriform clouds {{are classified as}} high and thus constitute a single genus cirrus (Ci). Stratocumuliform and stratiform clouds in the high altitude range carry the prefix cirro-, yielding the respective genus names <b>cirrocumulus</b> (Cc) and cirrostratus (Cs). [...] When limited-resolution satellite images of high clouds are analysed without supporting data from direct human observations, it becomes impossible to distinguish between individual forms or genus types, which are then collectively identified as high-type (or informally as cirrus-type even though not all high clouds are of the cirrus form or genus).|$|E
2500|$|The genitus and mutatus {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). Contrails formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, cirrostratus, or <b>cirrocumulus</b> homogenitus. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. [...] Silvagenitus (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor {{is added to the}} air above a forest canopy.|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly {{unstable}} air. The species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached floccus species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted <b>cirrocumulus,</b> altocumulus, and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level castellanus or floccus can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
2500|$|Several new {{supplementary}} features have been formally {{recognized by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The feature fluctus can form under conditions of strong atmospheric wind shear and instability when wave-like clouds of the variety undulatus break into regularly spaced crests. This variant is sometimes known informally as a Kelvin–Helmholtz (wave) cloud. [...] This phenomenon has also been observed in cloud formations over other planets {{and even in the}} sun's atmosphere. [...] Another highly disturbed but more chaotic wave-like cloud feature associated with the undulatus variety has been given the Latin name asperitus. [...] The supplementary feature cavum is a circular fall-streak hole that occasionally forms in a thin layer of supercooled altocumulus or <b>cirrocumulus.</b> [...] Fall streaks consisting of virga or wisps of cirrus are usually seen beneath the hole as ice crystals fall out to a lower altitude. [...] This type of hole is usually larger than typical lacunosus holes. A murus feature is a cumulonimbus wall cloud with a lowering, rotating cloud base than can lead to the development of tornadoes. A cauda feature is a tail cloud that extends horizontally away from the murus cloud and is the result of air feeding into the storm.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> floccus {{is a type}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "a lock of wool". <b>Cirrocumulus</b> floccus appears as small tufts of cloud with rounded heads, but ragged bottoms. The cloud can produce virga, {{precipitation}} that evaporates before reaching the ground. Like <b>cirrocumulus</b> castellanus, <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus is an indicator of atmospheric instability {{at the level of the}} cloud. In fact, <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus can form from <b>cirrocumulus</b> castellanus, being the evolutionary state after the base of the original cloud has dissipated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{stratiformis}} {{is a type}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> stratiformis {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "stretched out". <b>Cirrocumulus</b> stratiformis occurs as very small <b>cirrocumulus</b> clouds that cover {{a large part of the}} sky. This type of cloud always occurs in thin layers. There can be spaces or rifts between the individual cloudlets in the layer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{lenticularis}} {{is a type}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> lenticularis {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "like a lentil". <b>Cirrocumulus</b> lenticularis are smooth clouds that have the appearance of a lens or an almond. They usually form at the crests of atmospheric waves, which would otherwise be invisible. This species of <b>cirrocumulus</b> can often be quite elongated and normally has very distinguished boundaries. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> lenticularis forms when stable air is forced upward; this is usually due to orographic features, but can occur away from mountains as well. Irisation can occasionally occur with these clouds.|$|E
5000|$|Properly, {{the term}} <b>cirrocumulus</b> refers to each cloud, but is {{typically}} {{also used to}} refer to an entire patch of <b>cirrocumulus.</b> When used in this way, each <b>cirrocumulus</b> element is referred to as a [...] "cloudlet".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{lacunosus}} {{is a type}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> lacunosus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "full of hollows". <b>Cirrocumulus</b> lacunosus is a relatively rare cloud form that occurs as a layer of cloud with circular holes in it. These holes normally have frayed edges, and they are often arranged in a manner that resembles a net or a honeycomb.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{castellanus}} {{is a type}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> castellanus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "of a castle". These clouds appear as round turrets that are rising from either a lowered line or sheet of clouds. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> castellanus is an indicator of atmospheric instability {{at the level of the}} cloud. The clouds form when condensation occurs in the base cloud, causing latent heating to occur. This causes air to rise from the base cloud, and if the air ascends into conditionally unstable air, <b>cirrocumulus</b> castellanus will form.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus Floccus {{is derived}} from Latin, which means [...] "lock of wool" [...] or cirrus with ragged bases. They {{are not to be}} {{confused}} with <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus since they are larger than <b>cirrocumulus</b> and mostly are isolated. A precipitation-based supplementary feature virga is mostly visible, which makes it easier to distinguish the difference between <b>cirrocumulus</b> floccus and cirrus floccus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{is one of}} {{the three}} main genus-types of high-{{altitude}} tropospheric clouds, the other two being cirrus and cirrostratus. They usually occur at an altitude of 5 km to 12 km. Like lower altitude cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, <b>cirrocumulus</b> signifies convection. Unlike other high cirrus and cirrostratus, <b>cirrocumulus</b> includes a small amount of liquid water droplets, although these are in a supercooled state. Ice crystals are the predominant component, and typically, the ice crystals cause the supercooled water drops in the cloud to rapidly freeze, transforming the <b>cirrocumulus</b> into cirrostratus. This process can also produce precipitation {{in the form of a}} virga consisting of ice or snow. Thus <b>cirrocumulus</b> clouds are usually short-lived. They usually only form as part of a short-lived transitional phase within an area of cirrus clouds and can also form briefly as a result of the breaking up of part of a cumulonimbus anvil.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{undulatus}} is {{a variety}} of <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud. The name <b>cirrocumulus</b> undulatus is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "diversified as with waves". They have a rippled appearance due to wind shear and usually cover {{only a small portion}} of the sky. They appear in bands as small patches or layers. Occasionally, they comprise two or more wave forms superposed upon one another. The individual cloudlets can either be circular, or elongated in the direction of the rows.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Cirrocumulus</b> is a {{cloud of}} the stratocumuliform {{physical}} category that shows both stratiform and cumuliform characteristics and typically appears as white, patchy sheets with ripples or tufts without gray shading. Each cloudlet appears {{no larger than a}} finger held at arm's length. [...] These often are organized in rows like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, but since they are so small, <b>cirrocumulus</b> patches take on a finer appearance, sometimes also referred to colloquially as [...] "herringbone" [...] or as a [...] "mackerel sky". [...] <b>Cirrocumulus</b> is coded CH9 for the main genus-type and all subforms.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} main genera {{in the family}} of high clouds: cirrus, <b>cirrocumulus,</b> and cirrostratus. Cirrostratus clouds {{commonly}} produce halos because they are composed almost entirely of ice crystals. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> and cirrostratus are sometimes informally referred to as [...] "cirriform clouds" [...] because of their frequent association with cirrus. They are given the prefix [...] "cirro-", but this refers more to their altitude range than their physical structure. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> in its pure form is actually a high cumuliform genus, and cirrostratus is stratiform, like altostratus and lower based sheet clouds.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{occurrence}} of altocumulus and <b>cirrocumulus</b> cloud iridescence ...|$|E
5000|$|Species: <b>Cirrocumulus</b> {{stratiformis}} (Cc str) {{is one of}} four {{species and}} appears in the form of relatively flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species lenticularis (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. <b>Cirrocumulus</b> castellanus (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name floccus (Cc flo). [...] <b>Cirrocumulus</b> with castellanus buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-étage clouds.|$|E
