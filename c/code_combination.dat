40|$|Abstract Background Strategies to {{accurately}} identify {{the occurrence of}} specific health care events in administrative data is central to many quality improvement and research efforts. Many health care quality measures have treatment identification strategies based on diagnosis and procedure codes - an approach that is inexpensive and feasible but usually of unknown validity. In this study, we examined if the diagnosis/procedure code combinations used in the 2006 HEDIS Initiation and Engagement quality measures to identify instances of addiction treatment have high concordance with documentation of addiction treatment in clinical progress notes. Methods Four type of records were randomly sampled from VHA electronic medical data: (a) Outpatient records from a substance use disorder (SUD) specialty clinic with a HEDIS-qualified substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis/CPT <b>code</b> <b>combination</b> (n = 700), (b) Outpatient records from a non-SUD setting with a HEDIS-qualified SUD diagnosis/CPT <b>code</b> <b>combination</b> (n = 592), (c) Specialty SUD Inpatient/residential records that included a SUD diagnosis (n = 700), and (d) Non-SUD specialty Inpatient/residential records that included a SUD diagnosis (n = 700). Clinical progress notes for the sampled records were extracted and two raters classified each as documenting or not documenting addiction treatment. Rates of concordance between the HEDIS addiction treatment identification strategy and the raters' judgments were calculated for each record type. Results Within SUD outpatient clinics and SUD inpatient specialty units, 92 % and 98 % of sampled records had chart evidence of addiction treatment. Of outpatient encounters with a qualifying diagnosis/procedure <b>code</b> <b>combination</b> outside of SUD clinics, 63 % had chart evidence of addiction treatment. Within non-SUD specialty inpatient units, only 46 % of sampled records had chart evidence of addiction treatment. Conclusions For records generated in SUD specialty settings, the HEDIS strategy of identifying SUD treatment with diagnosis and procedure codes has a high concordance with chart review. The concordance rate outside of SUD specialty settings is much lower and highly variable between facilities. Therefore, some patients may be counted as meeting the 2006 HEDIS Initiation and Engagement criteria without having received the specified amount (or any) addiction treatment. </p...|$|E

An assembly is a declarative, stateless piece of code that facilitates <b>code</b> <b>combination.</b> It offers explicit typed interfaces to outsiders, called linkers, which can be used to link smaller assemblies into bigger, compound assemblies. Each assembly may in turn be loaded at run-time, producing a cell in the runtime environment. A cell is a dynamic, stateful component that interacts with other cells via explicit runtime interfaces. Thus, the static assemblies and the dynamic cells are fully integrated. Assemblies may also be dynamically linked into a running cell, thereby expanding its code base on runtime. We present the model and the concepts, and then go on to define a toy language supporting assemblies and cells. We precisely define the langauge via a formal operational semantics and a set of typing rules. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{efficient}} Adaptive Random Convolutional Network Coding (ARCNC) algorithm {{to address the}} issue of field size in random network coding. ARCNC operates as a convolutional code, with the coefficients of local encoding kernels chosen randomly over a small finite field. The lengths of local encoding kernels increase with time until the global encoding kernel matrices at related sink nodes all have full rank. Instead of estimating the necessary field size a priori, ARCNC operates in a small finite field. It adapts to unknown network topologies without prior knowledge, by locally incrementing the dimensionality of the convolutional code. Because convolutional codes of different constraint lengths can coexist in different portions of the network, reductions in decoding delay and memory overheads can be achieved with ARCNC. We show through analysis that this method performs no worse than random linear network codes in general networks, and can provide significant gains in terms of average decoding delay in combination networks.

40|$|Linear code {{combinations}} {{have been}} considered for suppressing the ionospheric error. In the L-band, this leads to an increased noise floor. In a combined L- and C-band (5010 – 5030 [*]MHz) approach, the ionosphere can be eliminated and the noise floor reduced at the same time. Furthermore, combinations that involve both code- and carrier-phase measurements are considered. A new L-band code-carrier combination with a wavelength of 3. 215 [*]meters and a noise level of 3. 92 [*]centimeters is found. The double difference integer ambiguities of this combination can be resolved by extending the system of equations with an ionosphere-free L-/C-band <b>code</b> <b>combination.</b> The probability of wrong fixing is reduced by several orders of magnitude when C-band measurements are included.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} elaborates {{on channel}} coding for reliable communication in passive RFID systems. RFID applications {{have been developed}} and used widely. Since a passive RFID tag has no power requirements, passive RFID has received considerable attention for application to sensor networks, access management, etc. A passive RFID system transfers energy together with information by means of inductive coupling. Coding schemes design for inductively coupled channels is the main task of this work. Due to the properties of inductive coupling, the communication over the inductively coupled channel has synchronization loss problems {{in addition to other}} classical channel errors. We therefore design codes that consider synchronization loss, energy transfer, transmission rate, and complexity of encoding and decoding. Because of the different properties of reader and tag, the coding schemes for a passive RFID system are designed differently for the two directions between a reader and a tag. In this dissertation, electronic circuits as infrastructure for the physical layer of the system are described. Modulation codes, error control codes and constrained codes, including their algebraic and structural properties, related algorithms, and techniques are addressed. <b>Code</b> <b>combination</b> and code power spectra are also considered as important issues in the code design that improve the ability of error detection and correction. </p...|$|E
