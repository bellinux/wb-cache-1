After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner would visit Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Johnson {{was charged}} with simple {{possession}} of methamphetamine and possession of a firearm by a <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> and received a $10,000 bond at a bond hearing.

On December 16, 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. Johnson was released from the Englewood Federal Correctional Institution on March 4, 2010.|$|E

40|$|In forty-nine {{states and}} the federal court system, <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> are statutorily {{excluded}} from serving as jurors. Justifying felon jury exclusion, courts and lawmakers presume that <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> would compromise the integrity of the jury process, as they are assumed to lack character and harbor a pro-defense/anti-prosecution pre-trial bias. In a series of three studies, this dissertation explores the empirical validity of the justifications for felon jury exclusion and also examines the possible costs of felon jury exclusion. Chapter 1 presents a quasi-experiment that compares the pre-trial biases of <b>convicted</b> <b>felons,</b> eligible jurors, and law students. Results suggest that a pro-defense pre-trial bias is not unique to <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> and that those with a felony criminal history likely pose no more of a risk to the impartiality of the jury process than do other groups of eligible jurors. Chapter 2 presents a mock jury experiment that assesses the validity of the character rationale, which holds that <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> would diminish the quality of deliberations. This Chapter compares homogenous juries comprised only of non-felon jurors to mixed juries comprised of non-felon and felon jurors, employing content analysis of deliberations and post-deliberation questionnaires. Results suggest that <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> likely do little to diminish the quality of deliberations and may enhance that process. Chapter 3 presents a qualitative field study that involves in-depth, semi-structured interviews with eligible and former jurors – all <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> – in Maine, the only state that places no restriction on a convicted felon’s opportunity to serve as a juror. Results suggest that inclusion in the jury process fosters a sense of empowerment and belonging for former offenders, bolstering self-esteem and enhancing one’s sense of self. This study tends to demonstrate that a policy of inclusion may help foster the successful reintegration of those with a criminal history. Taken together, the studies that comprise this dissertation are the first to empirically explore the rationales for felon jury exclusion and the possible impacts of banishing <b>convicted</b> <b>felons</b> from the jury process. This dissertation marks {{the start of a new}} field of inquiry that adds to research on juries, deliberating groups, reintegration, and criminal desistance...|$|R

It was also unclear how a <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail without first having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, a <b>convicted</b> <b>felon,</b> filed a {{civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on his suit.|$|E

5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated {{that he did not want}} it to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a <b>convicted</b> <b>felon</b> and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps under the aegis of the SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
