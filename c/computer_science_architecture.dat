The goal of this project {{is to build a}} collaborative, {{immersive}} virtual environment which will eventually integrate real humans, captured by a set of video cameras. Two Blue-C. s will be interconnected via a high-speed network. This will allow for bi-directional collaboration and interaction between two persons sharing virtual spaces. The video streams are used for both texture and geometry extraction. We will generate a 3 -D light field inlay enriched with the reconstructed geometry, which will be integrated into the virtual environment. The design and construction of the Blue-C. environment, including both hardware and software, is an interdisciplinary effort with participants from the departments of <b>computer</b> <b>science,</b> <b>architecture,</b> product development, and electrical engineering.
