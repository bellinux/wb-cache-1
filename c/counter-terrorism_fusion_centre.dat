In this study, the authors consider the problem of discrete-time state estimation over a wireless sensor network. Given a tree that represents the sensor communications with the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre,</b> the authors derive the optimal estimation algorithm at the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre,</b> and provide a closed-form expression for the steady-state error covariance matrix. They then present a tree reconfiguration algorithm that produces a sensor tree that has low overall energy consumption and guarantees a desired level of estimation quality at the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre.</b> The authors further propose a sensor tree construction and scheduling algorithm {{that leads to a}} longer network lifetime than the tree reconfiguration algorithm.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a robust energy-based target localization method in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) {{in the presence of}} Byzantine attacked sensors. Byzantine attacks will cause sensors to send false information to the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> and disturb the target localization method. Therefore, a robust energy-based target localization method is needed to counter the Byzantine attacks and a method is presented in this paper. The method presented in this paper assumes that the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> knows the exact information about the percentage of Byzantine sensors and the attack probability. If the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> does not know the Byzantine attack information, a Byzantine sensor identification scheme can be used to identify Byzantine sensors. Results showed the robust energy-based target localization method could provide better performance results than the energy-based target localizatin method, which did not consider Byzantine attacked sensors. Moreover, simulation results showed that the Byzantine sensor identificaiton scheme could identify most Byzantine attacked sensors.

40|$|We {{consider}} the classical problem of sequential detection {{of change in}} a distribution (from hypothesis 0 to hypothesis 1), where the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> receives vectors of periodic measurements, with the measurements being i. i. d. over time and across the vector components, under {{each of the two}} hypotheses. In our problem, the sensor devices ("motes") that generate the measurements constitute an ad hoc wireless network. The motes contend using a random access protocol (such as CSMA/CA) to transmit their measurement packets to the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre.</b> The <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> waits for vectors of measurements to accumulate before taking decisions. We formulate the optimal detection problem, taking into account the network delay experienced by the vectors of measurements, and find that, under periodic sampling, the detection delay decouples into network delay and decision delay. We obtain a lower bound on the network delay, and propose a censoring scheme, where lagging sensors drop their delayed observations in order to mitigate network delay. We show that this scheme can achieve the lower bound. This approach is explored via simulation. We also use numerical evaluation and simulation to study issues such as: the optimal sampling rate for a given number of sensors, and the optimal number of sensors for a given measurement rat...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{approach}} to dis-tributed detection is proposed. We use learning-based local classifiers and a likelihood ratio test (LRT) at the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre.</b> As the soft out-puts of the local detectors are not restricted to have any probabilistic meaning, we estimate the a posteri-ori probabilities of the local classi-fiers outputs to formulate the LRT in the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre.</b> The uncertainty of the estimated densities can produce a biased LRT. We propose to use confidence in-tervals for the conditional densities to determine the regions where the LRT is precise. This regions provide simple censoring schemes that only allow transmissions of reliable infor-mation for the decision. Also, we develop the Neyman Pear-son and sequential probability ratio test for this scheme. The proposed procedure is then applied to the au-tomated infectious tuberculosis di-agnosis...|$|R

40|$|Physically {{distributed}} sensors, communication networks, preprocessing algorithms {{and other}} reasons can delay or disorder {{the arrival of}} the information, provided by a set of sensors, to the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> which is in charge of estimating the state of a system.

In this paper we present two new algorithms for solving the out-of-sequence data problem for the case of linear and nonlinear dynamic control systems and compare them with other algorithms which exist in the literature.

40|$|After the September 11 th {{terrorist}} attacks in 2001 in the USA, it became apparent to many countries that coordination functions between intelligence and security services must be strengthened.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{distributed}} sequential algorithm for quick detection of spectral holes in a Cognitive Radio set up. Two or more local nodes make decisions and inform the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> (FC) over a reporting Multiple Access Channel (MAC), which then makes the final decision. The local nodes use energy detection and the FC uses mean detection {{in the presence}} of fading, heavy-tailed electromagnetic interference (EMI) and outliers. The statistics of the primary signal, channel gain and the EMI is not known. Different nonparametric sequential algorithms are compared to choose appropriate algorithms to be used at the local nodes and the Fe. Modification of a recently developed random walk test is selected for the local nodes for energy detection {{as well as at the}} <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> for mean detection. We show via simulations and analysis that the nonparametric distributed algorithm developed performs well {{in the presence of}} fading, EMI and outliers.

40|$|Abstract- A fuzzy {{management}} scheme is proposed to evaluate task priority in a multisensor scenario {{in order to}} cooperatively manage, in a decentralized way, all sensor tasks. The network could {{be considered as a}} multiagent system composed by “n ” radar’s and the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre.</b> In the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre,</b> a fuzzy reasoning system determines the priority of each surveillance system-task to be performed in each decision cycle by means of a symbolic inference process using the fused data from all sensors. At the same time, in each sensor similar reasoning process evaluates locally the sensor-task priority. The priority values of system/sensor tasks are used to negotiate in the multiagent system. This approach allows the integration of high-level (possibly subjective) information (not only numerical) in the decision cycle considering its uncertainty. Included results illustrate how the importance of the tasks, measured through their time-variable priority, allows the manager to timely adapt sensor operation to changing situations...|$|R

40|$|Cognitive radio {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential candidate to increase spectrum utilisation by exploiting spectrum holes on a non-interfering basis. Spectrum sensing is the key functionality {{to make sure that the}} cognitive radio is aware and will not disturb the operation of the licensed users. Collaborative spectrum sensing is needed to overcome deleterious channel effects such as fading or the hidden node problem and to increase sensing reliability and accuracy. This paper presents a novel optimisation framework for collaborative spectrum sensing in the presence of imperfect reporting channels. It is also shown in this paper that in fading channels spectrum sensing performance can be significantly improved by using multiple antennas at the cognitive radio terminal. A weighted optimised collaborative spectrum sensing scheme with multiple antenna cognitive terminals, which maximises global probability of detection at the <b>fusion</b> <b>centre</b> using genetic algorithm is presented.
