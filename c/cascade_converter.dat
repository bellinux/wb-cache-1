40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an effort to}} investigate the use of gate-commutated thyristors(GCTs) in <b>cascaded</b> <b>converters.</b> <b>Cascaded</b> <b>converters,</b> such as modularmultilevel converters (M 2 Cs) and <b>cascaded</b> H-bridge <b>converters</b> (CHBs), haveproved to be especially suitable in high-voltage, high-power applications. Allof the most important advantages of <b>cascaded</b> <b>converters,</b> e. g. redundancy andscalability, {{can be attributed to}} the modular structure. Of special interestregarding the choice of semiconductor power devices is the reduced requirementon the switching frequency of individual devices. This brings a shift in thetrade-off between switching and conduction losses, where the latter has moreimportance in <b>cascaded</b> <b>converters</b> than in other topologies. This shift favorsthyristor-type devices like the GCT, which can achieve very low conductionlosses. To quantify the potential gain in the application of GCTs in cascadedconverters the losses have been calculated and a comparison between differentsubmodule implementations has been presented. The comparison has shownthat GCTs can provide 20 - 30 % lower losses compared to insulated-gate bipolartransistors (IGBTs) in a typical HVDC application. In order to verify the lowlosses of GCT-based submodules, extensive work has been put into buildingand testing full-scale submodules employing GCTs. A resonant test circuithas been developed in which the submodules can be tested in steady-stateoperation which allows calorimetric measurements of the losses. The calorimetricmeasurements have verified that the loss calculation was reasonableand not lacking any important components. A drawback of GCTs is that the gate-drive units require much more powerthan gate-drive units for comparable IGBTs. In order to employ GCTs inhigh-voltage <b>cascaded</b> <b>converters</b> some means of supplying this power in thesubmodule must be provided. One option is to take this power from thesubmodule dc-link, but this requires a dc-dc converter capable of high inputvoltages. A tapped-inductor buck converter with a novel, autonomous highsidevalve was developed for this application. The autonomous operation of thehigh-side valve allows reliable operation without galvanic isolation components. A converter with a high-side valve with series-connected MOSFETs capable ofan input voltage of 3 kV has been presented. QC 20150521 </p...|$|R

40|$|Multilevel power {{conversion}} {{was first introduced}} 25 years ago. The general concept involves utilizing a higher number of active semiconductor switches to perform the {{power conversion}} in small voltage steps. There are several advantages to this approach when compared with traditional power conversion. The smaller voltage steps lead {{to the production of}} higher power quality waveforms and also reduce voltage (dv/dt) stress on the load and reduce the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) concerns [1]. Another important feature of multilevel converters is that the semiconductors are wired in a series-type connection, which allows operation at higher voltages. However, the series connection is typically made with clamping diodes, which eliminates overvoltage concerns. Furthermore, since the switches are not truly series connected, their switching can be staggered, which reduces the switching frequency and thus the switching losses. One clear disadvantage of multilevel power conversion is the larger number of semiconductor switches required. It {{should be pointed out that}} lower voltage rated switches can be used in the multilevel converter and therefore the active semiconductor cost is not appreciably increased when compared with the two level cases. However, each active semiconductor added requires associated gate drive circuitry and adds further complexity to the converter mechanical layout. Another disadvantage of multilevel power converters is that the small voltage steps are typically produced by isolated voltage sources or a bank of series capacitors. Isolated voltage sources may not always be readily available and series capacitors require voltage balance. To some extent, the voltage balancing can be addressed by using redundant switching states, which exist due to the high number of semiconductor devices. However, for a complete solution to the voltage-balancing problem, another multilevel converter may be required [2 – 4]. In recent years, there has been a substantial increase in interest to multilevel power conversion. Recent research has involved the introduction of novel converter topologies and unique modulation strategies. However, the most recently used converter topologies which are mainly addressed as applicable multilevel converters are <b>cascade</b> <b>converter,</b> neutral point clamped converter (NPC) and flying capacitor converter. There are also some combinations of the mentioned converters as series combination of a two level converter with a three level NPC converter which is named cascade 3 / 2 multilevel inverter and is depicted in Figure 1. Also series combination of three level <b>cascade</b> <b>converter</b> with a five level NPC converter which is named cascade 5 / 3 multilevel inverter and is shown in Figure 2 [5]. Some applications for these new converters include industrial drives [6 – 8], Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) [9 - 11], and vehicle propulsion [12, 13]. One area where multilevel converters are particularly suitable is that of medium-voltage drives [14]. This chapter presents an overview of a new multilevel inverter topology named Reversing Voltage (RV). The first section describes the general multilevel inverter schematic. A general method of multilevel modulation PD-SPWM is utilized that may be extended to any number of voltage levels. The final section shows simulation results of introduced inverter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This work {{is part of}} {{a bigger}} project which aims to {{research}} the potential development of commercial opportunities for the re-use of batteries after their use in low carbon vehicles on an electricity grid or microgrid system. There are three main revenue streams (peak load lopping on the distribution Network to allow for network re-enforcement deferral, National Grid primary/ secondary / high frequency response, customer energy management optimization). These incomes streams are dependent on the grid system being present. However, there is additional opportunity to be gained from also using these batteries to provide UPS backup when the grid is no longer present. Most UPS or ESS on the market use new batteries in conjunction with a two level converter interface. This produces a reliable backup solution in the case of loss of mains power, but may be expensive to implement. This paper introduces a modular multilevel <b>cascade</b> <b>converter</b> (MMCC) based ESS using second-life batteries for use on a grid independent industrial plant without any additional onsite generator as a potentially cheaper alternative. The number of modules has been designed for a given reliability target and these modules could be used to minimize/eliminate the output filter. An appropriate strategy to provide voltage and frequency control in a grid independent system is described and simulated under different disturbance conditions such as load switching, fault conditions or a large motor starting. A comparison of the results from the modular topology against a traditional two level converter is provided to prove similar performance criteria. The proposed ESS and control strategy is an acceptable way of providing backup power in the event of loss of grid. Additional financial benefit to the customer may be obtained by using a second life battery in this way...|$|E

40|$|Grid-connected {{high-power}} converters {{are found}} in high-voltage direct current transmission (HVDC), static compensators (STATCOMs), and supplies for electric railways. Such power converters should have a high reliability, high efficiency, good harmonic performance, low cost, and a small footprint. <b>Cascaded</b> <b>converters</b> are promising solutions for high-voltage high-power converters since they allow the combination of excellent harmonic performance and low switching frequencies. A high reliability can also be achieved by including redundant submodules {{in the chain of}} <b>cascaded</b> <b>converters.</b> One of the emerging <b>cascaded</b> <b>converter</b> topologies is the modular multilevel converter (M 2 C). This thesis aims to bring clarity to the dimensioning aspects and limiting factors of M 2 Cs. The dc-capacitor in each submodule is a driving factor for the size and weight of the converter. It is found that the voltage variations across the submodule capacitors will distort the voltage waveforms and also induce alternating components in the current that is circulating between the phase-legs. It is, however, shown {{that it is possible to}} control the alternating voltage by feed-forward control. It is also shown that if the circulating current is controlled, the injection of a second-order harmonic component can extend the operating region of the converter. The reason for this is that when the converter is operating close to the boundary of overmodulation the phase and amplitude of the second-order harmonic is chosen such that the capacitors are charged prior to the time when a high voltage should be inserted by the submodules. The controller that is used must be able to balance the sbmodule capacitor voltages. Typically, an increased switching frequency will enhance the performance of the balancing control scheme. In this thesis it is shown that the capacitor voltages can be balanced with programmed modulation, even if fundamental switching frequency is used. This will, however, increase the voltage ripple across the aforementioned capacitors. In order to quantify the requirements on the dc-capacitors a general analysis is provided in this thesis which is based on the assumption that the capacitor voltages are well balanced. It is found that for active power transfer, with a 50 Hz sinusoidal voltage reference, the capacitors must be rated for a combined energy storage of 21 kJ/MW if the capacitor voltages are allowed to increase by 10 % above their nominal values.
