50|$|Lasius alienus, or <b>cornfield</b> <b>ant,</b> is {{a species}} of ant in the {{subfamily}} Formicinae (family Formicidae). Workers have a length of about 2-4 mm, Queens are larger (7-9 mm).|$|E
5000|$|Lasius is a genus of {{formicine}} ants. [...] The type {{species for}} this genus {{is the black}} garden ant, Lasius niger. Other major members, which live in drier heathland, are the <b>cornfield</b> <b>ant,</b> L. neoniger, and L. alienus. Other species include the temporary social parasites of the L. mixtus group and the hyper-social parasite Lasius fuliginosus. Lasius flavus is also a commonly seen species, building grassy hillocks in undisturbed pasture. In the Alps, these mounds - always aligned east to catch the first rays of the rising sun - have been traditionally used by goatherds as natural compasses.|$|E
40|$|Each year, {{a larger}} {{proportion}} of the Earth’s surface is urbanized, and a {{larger proportion of}} the people on Earth lives in those urban areas. The everyday nature, however, that humans encounter in cities remains poorly understood. Here, we consider perhaps the most urban green habitat, street medians. We sampled ants from forty-four medians along three boulevards in New York City and examined how median properties affect the abundance and species richness of native and introduced ants found on them. Ant species richness varied among streets and increased with area but was independent of the other median attributes measured. Ant assemblages were highly nested, with three numerically dominant species present at all medians and additional species present at a subset of medians. The most common ant species were the introduced Pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum) and the native Thief ant (Solenopsis molesta) and <b>Cornfield</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius neoniger). The common introduced species on the medians responded differently to natural and disturbed elements of medians. Tetramorium caespitum was most abundant in small medians, with the greatest edge/area ratio, particularly if those medians had few trees, whereas Nylanderia flavipes was most abundant in the largest medians, particularly if they had more trees. Many of the species encountered in Manhattan were similar to those found in other large North American cities...|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{individuals}} can inhibit parasite uptake by refraining from consuming infected conspecifics. Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) and <b>cornfield</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius alienus) both detect chemical 'ant deterrent factors' adaptively produced by entamopathogenic bacteria and thus avoid infected corpses; R. tibalis doesn't cannibalize conspecifics infected with M. anisopliae.|$|R
40|$|Pavement ants (Tetramorium sp. E) {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{dominant}} species in urban areas, and are likely engaged in interspecific competition, which affects the abundance and diversity of other ant species. Ant abundance and diversity was monitored at the level of genus in Purdue Village and Copper Beech Apartments (West Lafayette, IN), along with temperature, humidity and habitat as possible factors. Temperature was found to be a significant factor affecting the abundance of ants, and humidity was not. The different habitats of the two locations corresponded to the presence of different genera. The number of pavement ants positively correlates with the number of <b>cornfield</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius neoniger) in Copper Beech Apartments, but not in Purdue Village, which might suggest a dominant-subordinate relationship between these species in Copper Beech Apartments which does not exist in Purdue Village. ^ Pavement ants are known for their large, intraspecific territorial battles, but the topic has been relatively unexplored. A large amount of preliminary work needs to be undertaken, including developing methods of mapping territories. The perimeter of buildings at each site was divided into distinct ‘territorial units’ of about 6 m and each unit baited to survey the ant population and collect pavement ants for aggression assays. The average sizes of the pavement ant colonies was 1. 3 units in 2014, 1. 6 units in 2015 and 1. 7 units in 2016. Statistical analysis found that the sum of hostile adjacent pavement ant territories affected pavement ant numbers, suggesting that the predominant aspect of competitive pressure was intraspecific competition rather than interspecific competition. ^ The territoriality of pavement ants provides an opportunity to study the effect of intraspecific competition on the efficacy of insecticides and control methods. Here, the surveys conducted in Chapter 2 and territorial maps constructed in Chapter 3 were used to assess that effect, by comparing Blanket (all pavement ant colonies around the building are treated) and Targeted baiting (only 1 pavement ant colony is treated) with thiamethoxam gel bait insecticide. Continuous treatment of the Blanket and Targeted Treatment buildings as well as surveys of all the sites for ant abundance was conducted {{until the end of the}} field season in 2016. Temperature was found to be the major factor influencing the percent reduction (p 3 ̆c 2 e- 16) in colony populations and both treatment methods were found to be just as effective at eliminating target colonies. ...|$|R
