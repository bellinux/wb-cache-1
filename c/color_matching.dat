A spectral <b>color</b> <b>match</b> attempts to give two colors the same spectral reflectance characteristic, making them a good metameric match with a low degree of metamerism, and thereby reducing {{the sensitivity of the}} resulting <b>color</b> <b>match</b> to changes in illuminant, or differences between observers.|$|R

40|$|Changes in the {{effective}} optical {{density of the}} cones are sufficient to explain changes in <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> with retinal illuminance and pupil entry. We performed three experiments. In the first experiment, six observers made <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> under both bleached and unbleached conditions {{to a series of}} six standard wavelengths. The effects of bleaching could be modeled by a decrease in optical density of the L and M cone photopigments. Slight spectral shifts in the peak wavelengths of the photopigments were required for different observers. In the second experiment we varied retinal illuminance of the color-matching field from 2. 4 to 5. 4 log Td for a series of long-wavelength primaries. The shape of the <b>color</b> <b>match</b> versus the intensity function was un-changed by the wavelength composition of the matching field. In the third experiment we measured the change in <b>color</b> <b>match</b> with retinal illuminance for different pupil entry positions. At low luminances there was a marked dependence of the <b>color</b> <b>match</b> on pupil entry positions. At high illuminance there was only a small dependence. The half-bleach illuminance values varied as expected from the Stiles-Crawford I effect. We conclude that for wavelengths> 540 nm, changes in <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> with bleaching and pupil entry can be explained by changes in {{the effective}} optical density of the cones. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{whether a}} self-screening hypothesis {{can account for}} changes in red-green <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> with changes in retinal illuminance {{and changes in the}} size of the matching field. The dependence of the <b>color</b> <b>match</b> on field size measured at moderate illuminances was not present at high illuminances. For <b>color</b> <b>matches</b> made with nor-mal pupil entry, there was no need to postulate any factors other than self-screening to account for the changes with either illuminance or field size. The self-screening model allowed us to estimate the optical density of the foveal cones and the retinal illuminance that caused half of the photopigment to be bleached at equilibrium. These esti-mates were in quantitative agreement with previous estimates made using other techniques. We also found that the change in a <b>color</b> <b>match</b> with increasing illuminance was inconsistent with first-order kinetics...|$|R

25|$|The {{observer}} would {{alter the}} brightness {{of each of the}} three primary beams until a match to the test color was observed. Not all test colors could be matched using this technique. When this was the case, a variable amount of one of the primaries could be added to the test color, and a match with the remaining two primaries was carried out with the variable color spot. For these cases, the amount of the primary added to the test color was considered to be a negative value. In this way, the entire range of human color perception could be covered. When the test colors were monochromatic, a plot could be made of the amount of each primary used {{as a function of the}} wavelength of the test color. These three functions are called the <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> functions for that particular experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{integrals}} of the XYZ <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> functions {{must all}} be equal by requirement 3 above, {{and this is}} set by the integral of the photopic luminous efficiency function by requirement 2 above. The tabulated sensitivity curves have {{a certain amount of}} arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude. This new color space would have a different shape. The sensitivity curves in the CIE 1931 and 1964 XYZ color spaces are scaled to have equal areas under the curves.|$|E

Stones were laid in long, thin ledges, evoking the natural way that they {{were found in the}} quarry and across the Driftless Area. Plaster for the interior walls was mixed with sienna, giving the finished product a golden hue. This caused the plaster to resemble the sand {{on the banks of the}} nearby Wisconsin River. The outside plaster walls were similar, but mixed with cement, resulting in a grayer color. Windows were placed so that sun could come through openings in every room at every point of the day. Wright chose not to install gutters so that icicles would form in winter. Shingles on the gradually-pitched roof were designed to weather to a silver-grey <b>color,</b> <b>matching</b> the branches of nearby trees.

Front of house engineer Blake Suib explained that, [...] " [...] and Solotech were asked {{to come up with}} a design that blocked the least amount of seats but provided the quality and coverage that [...] expects and that we were looking for". The public address (PA) was made of 64 Milos that split into four hangs of 16 per hang. Two at the 50 yard line pointed one way and directly behind, two at the 50 yard line pointed the opposite way. Also present were 32 Micas; 16 per hang, pointing to the sides. Each one of the four hangs had its own equalization (EQ) and level control, so in case one of the speakers were louder there would be a separate EQ to compensate for any change in the tone due to the distance. All the components and tools used in the public address were designed by Meyer Sound Laboratories, including a software called Mapp, used to decide where to point the PA; the Simm, to analyze and time align the PA accurately; and the Galileo, used to EQ and balance all the sections of the PA. The speakers were self-powered with amplifiers also built by Meyer Sounds. There were 24 HP700 subwoofers positioned all over the arena floor, and the Simm and Galileo were used to time align. Spears used a Crown CM-311AE headset microphone wearing the mic's beltpack (usually hidden in <b>color</b> <b>matching</b> material) on her top or pants, she did not use in-ear monitors; instead 12 Meyer CQs were positioned, eight flown around the center ring and two on each of the smaller stages. Spears specifically asked Suib to make the show sound similar to a dance club. Solotech provided the lighting package, including a mostly Vari-Lite rig, with 80 each VL3000s and VL3500s in various positions, and 60 VL500s built into the stage deck. Whitehouse also had 18 PRG Bad Boy luminaires, 16 of which sat in pods that hung in various positions lower than the rest of the rig, with two more at either end of the stage. Each of the eight pods housed two Bad Boys, two of the VL3500s, one Robert Juliat Ivanhoe followspot with scroller under DMX control, and a Molefay. Fifty Martin Professional Atomic Color strobes and four front of house Robert Juliat Aramis followspots rounded out the lighting package. The lightning team had to rehearse for a month to prepare. The tour was also the first to use the touring version of the PRG Virtuoso V676 console to control the system, which was used from the beginning of the European leg until the end of the tour.
