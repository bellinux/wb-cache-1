50|$|Population growth, the {{granting}} of perpetual leases on town properties, the encouragement of free trade and exports underpinned a booming economy. Since {{the beginning of the}} colony, officers and administrators were housed on {{the eastern side of the}} Tank Stream, while lower ranks and commerce was consigned to the western side. By the 1830s this had become entrenched with fine homes on the Potts Point ridge. The derivative neo-Classical Georgian style was being replaced with the more ornate and eclectic Gothic Revival. John Verge was the most renowned architect in the 1830s and his buildings included Tusculum in Potts Point, Elizabeth Bay House, and Camden Park.The 1840s saw an increasingly buoyant economy and confident society pushed along by the end of convict transportation and the commencement of an independent legislature. A building boom embraced the neo-Gothic style whereby the colony's strong need to identify with the home country was manifest. Public, commercial and domestic architecture overlooked the local climate in favour of styles transported from Britain, and projects with substantial budgets often produced an indiscriminate eclecticism. Conversely, projects with limited budgets that precluded ostentatious and derivative design often resulted a kind of vernacular style that responded to local conditions. Rather than a <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> between rooms, the verandah became a sun-shading device, and solid sandstone walls and cross-ventilation stabilised both cold and hot temperature extremes.|$|E

It consists of remote server, mobile handset application and a <b>connecting</b> <b>device.</b> Remote server has vehicle diagnosis database. Mobile handset application relays automobile signals and controls the flow of data packets. Using <b>connecting</b> <b>device,</b> user can send and receive signals between automobile and handset. Since remote server performs vehicle diagnosis, diagnosis history can be updated automatically. In addition, value added service can be provided easily. When {{there is a new}} automobile, the diagnosis database can be updated in the server. Thus, it is not necessary for each scanner to be updated individually. With the proposed system, self-diagnosis by users is possible using mobile systems, which is cost-effective and easy to use. I...|$|E
40|$|To collect clams {{automatically}} {{and effectively}} on coastal beach, an automatic clam collecting device was designed. The device {{consists of a}} <b>connecting</b> <b>device,</b> a shovelling device, a conveying device, and a filtering device. The mechanical device is designed based {{on some of the}} presented devices, such as a blade with slope, a pipelined conveyor belt, planar linkage mechanisms and a ski mechanism. The <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> is connected to the device body by bolts. The shovelling device adopts a blade with slope, which can reduce the resistance between sandy soil and the device. The transmission device adopts a conveyor belt with a two-stage reducer, which can effectively control the speed of the transmission and avoid the splash of mud. A mesh structure is used for soil filtering, which is designed with a certain slope, thus sandy soil and other impurities fall from the mesh for its own weight. The designed device for clam collecting will improve efficiency and decrease cost effectively...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn most {{clinical}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging systems, only commercial receive coils with the appropriate connector and encoding can be plugged in. When willing to use a dedicated receive coil for a specific study which cannot be achieved with commercial coils, the researcher faces the connecting issue related to the specificity of the proprietary connector. In this work, a universal device is proposed which allows for the connection of any single channel dedicated coil on any magnetic resonance (MR) system, {{as long as it}} is provided with at least one commercial receive coil. Technical feasibility of the universal <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> was demonstrated on a 3 T MR clinical imager. The device included an independent active decoupling circuit while signal transmission to the data cabinet was achieved by electromagnetic coupling with a commercial receive coil plugged to the MR device. The universal <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> was notably characterized in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and compared to the standard connection.

40|$|In {{the article}} design and {{technological}} features of multiprobe <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> for testing the electronic components with matrix ball leads are described and substantiated. Such test fixture has probes made as two separated flatcontact lands {{that can be}} used for testing BGA/CSP components or microelectromechanical devices. Only in case, when two parts of probe contact lands are pressed to according lead of electronic component, electrical circuit between them closes. This fact confirms presence of contact between testing fixture probe and tested lead of BGA device and can be considered as way of testing reliability increasing. Due to the proposed new form of contact probe for electronic component testing it became possible to simplify the topology of connecting circuit board. Developed commutative board with ZIF connectors allows realizing multiprobe device connection to automated measuring systems, providing also the possibility of its future application to test other electronic components with more leads. Also the results of experimental and modeling research of developed device prototype are presented and explained. Obtained results substantiate the basic requirements for the multiprobe <b>connecting</b> <b>device</b> that should be observed during its contacting to the unit under test. Designed test fixture is more simple and cheap in comparison with its analogues. Also developed method of testing effectively provides the necessary contact pressure between test fixture and unit under test without hazard of its deformation which can appear in similar devices...|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{the thermal}} and {{electrical}} switching time constants between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> cause imbalances {{in the power}} and temperature distribution thereby reducing module robustness. In this paper, the impact of electro-thermal variations (gate and thermal resistance) between parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> on module robustness is investigated for 900 V-CoolMOS and 1. 2 kV-SiC MOSFETs under clamped inductive switching (CIS) and unclamped inductive switching (UIS). Under CIS, {{the difference in the}} steady-state junction temperature (ΔTJ) and switching energy (ΔESW) between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> for a given difference in the gate and thermal resistance (ΔRG & ΔRTH) is used as the metric for determining robustness to electrothermal variations i. e. how well the devices maintain uniform temperature in-spite of switching with different rates and thermal resistances. Under UIS conditions, the change in the maximum avalanche current/energy prior to device failure {{as a function of the}} ΔTJ and ΔRG between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices</b> is used as the metric. Under both CIS and UIS, SiC devices show better performance with minimal negative response to electrothermal variations between the parallel <b>connected</b> <b>devices.</b> Finite element models have also been performed showing the dynamics of BJT latch-up during UIS for the different technologies...|$|R
