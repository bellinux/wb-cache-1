40|$|The {{established}} general {{results on}} convergence {{properties of the}} EM algorithm require the sequence of EM parameter estimates to fall {{in the interior of}} the parameter space over which the likelihood is being maximized. This paper presents convergence properties of the EM sequence of likelihood values and parameter estimates in <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> spaces for which the sequence of EM parameter estimates may converge to the boundary of the <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> space contained in the interior of the unconstrained parameter space.

40|$|To improve {{models for}} {{accurate}} projections, data assimilation, an emerging statistical approach to combine models with data, {{have recently been}} developed to probe initial conditions, parameters, data content, response functions and model uncertainties. Quantifying how many information contents are contained in different data streams is essential to predict future states of ecosystems and the climate. This study uses a data assimilation approach to examine the information contents contained in flux- and biometric-based data to <b>constrain</b> <b>parameters</b> in a terrestrial carbon (C) model, which includes canopy photosynthesis and vegetation - soil C transfer submodels. Three assimilation experiments were constructed with either net ecosystem exchange (NEE) data only or biometric data only [including foliage and woody biomass, litterfall, soil organic C(SOC) and soil respiration], or both NEE and biometric data to <b>constrain</b> model <b>parameters</b> by a probabilistic inversion application. The results showed that NEE data mainly <b>constrained</b> <b>parameters</b> associated with gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (RE) but were almost invalid for C transfer coefficients, while biometric data were more effective in constraining C transfer coefficients than other parameters. NEE and biometric data constrained about 26 % (6) and 30 % (7) {{of a total of}} 23 parameters, respectively, but their combined application constrained about 61 % (14) of all parameters. The complementarity of NEE and biometric data was obvious in <b>constraining</b> most of <b>parameters.</b> The poor constraint by only NEE or biometric data was probably attributable to either the lack of long-term C dynamic data or errors from measurements. Overall, our results suggest that flux- and biometric-based data, containing different processes in ecosystem C dynamics, have different capacities to <b>constrain</b> <b>parameters</b> related to photosynthesis and C transfer coefficients, respectively. Multiple data sources could also reduce uncertainties in parameter estimation if these data sources contain complementary information...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the task of}} estimating <b>constrained</b> <b>parameters</b> of geometric models which underpin an important class of computer vision problems. A typical model can often be described by two systems of equations, of which one relates image features to parameters, and the other captures internal relationships between the parameters. One way to produce <b>constrained</b> <b>parameters</b> is to first compute an unconstrained estimate {{by means of the}} image data and then correct this estimate so that the intra-parameter dependencies are satisfied. This paper focuses on the second stage of estimation and proposes two correction methods applicable to the result of unconstrained minimisation. The performance of the post-hoc correction techniques is evaluated through experiments on estimating the trifocal tensor relating three views of a scene. Results demonstrate that the devised constrained estimators achieve similar accuracy to the maximum likelihood estimator with the advantage of being faster. Tony Scoleri[URL]...|$|R
40|$|For {{estimating}} {{an unknown}} parameter [theta], we introduce and motivate {{the use of}} the balanced-type loss function:, where 0 [less-than-or-equals, slant][omega][less-than-or-equals, slant] 1, q([theta]) is a positive weight function, and [delta] 0 is a general "target" estimator. Developments and various examples are given with regards to the issues of admissibility, dominance, Bayesianity, and minimaxity. In many cases, as in Dey et al. [1999. On estimation with balanced loss functions. Statist. Probab. Lett. 45, 97 - 101], we show that results for loss L[omega],[delta] 0 may be inferred directly from corresponding results for weighted squared error loss (i. e., [omega]= 0). Specific issues related to <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> spaces, which include the choice of the target estimator, are addressed. Finally, we derive minimax estimators of a bounded normal mean [theta] under loss L[omega],[delta] 0 with [delta] 0 being the maximum-likelihood estimator of [theta].

40|$|Several {{issues are}} {{discussed}} when testing inequality constrained hypotheses using a Bayesian approach. First, the complexity (or size) of the inequality <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> spaces can be ignored. This {{is the case}} when using the posterior probability that the inequality constraints of a hypothesis hold, Bayes factors based on non-informative improper priors, and partial Bayes factors based on posterior priors. Second, the Bayes factor may not be invariant for linear one-to-one transformations of the data. This can be observed when using balanced priors which are centred on the boundary of the <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> space with a diagonal covariance structure. Third, the information paradox can be observed. When testing inequality constrained hypotheses, the information paradox occurs when the Bayes factor of an inequality constrained hypothesis against its complement converges to a constant as the evidence for the first hypothesis accumulates while keeping the sample size fixed. This paradox occurs when using Zellner's g prior {{as a result of}} too much prior shrinkage. Therefore, two new methods are proposed that avoid these issues. First, partial Bayes factors are proposed based on transformed minimal training samples. These training samples result in posterior priors that are centred on the boundary of the <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> space with the same covariance structure as in the sample. Second, a g prior approach is proposed by letting g go to infinity. This is possible because the Jeffreys–Lindley paradox is not an issue when testing inequality constrained hypotheses. A simulation study indicated that the Bayes factor based on this g prior approach converges fastest to the true inequality constrained hypothesis...|$|E

40|$|We {{explain that}} part of the {{reduction}} in the parameter uncertainties in the computations of Apgar et al. (Mol.

30|$|As {{the penalty}} {{function}} depends only on Φ, it thus provides constraints for the parameters in Φ alone. Depending on {{the choice of}} the order m of roughness penalty, the penalty matrix P could be rank deficient. For a ridge penalty (m= 0), the penalty matrix would be full rank (r= M); for a penalty on first-order derivatives (m= 1), the penalty matrix would have a rank M- 1, and so on. In general, for a penalty on the mth-order derivative, the penalty matrix would be rank deficient by m and would have a rank of r=M-m. This rank deficiency implies that the penalty matrix cannot simultaneously <b>constrain</b> all the <b>parameters</b> ϕ _i in Φ; only r = M-m of them would be constrained. In brief, of the M+ 4 number of unknown parameters (Φ of dimension M and Θ of dimension 4), there exist M-m <b>constrained</b> <b>parameters,</b> say Φ _f={ϕ _i, i= 1, 2, 3,...M-m}, and 4 +m unconstrained parameters Θ∪Φ _d where Φ _d={ϕ _i, i=M-m+ 1,...,M}. Apart from these, the optimal smoothing parameter τ also has to be estimated. Kumazawa et al. (2016) assumed a priori Θ and were hence left only with <b>constrained</b> <b>parameters</b> Φ _f and the other unknowns η = {Φ _d, τ}.

40|$|AbstractWe {{discuss the}} coupled {{variations}} of the gravitational, strong and electroweak coupling constants and the current knowledge of the nuclear equation of state based on heavy ion collision experiments and neutron star mass–radius relationship. In particular we focus in our description on phenomenological parameters, R, relating variations in the quantum chromodynamics scale ΛQCD and the fine structure constant α, and S, relating variations of v, the Higgs vacuum expectation value and the Yukawa couplings, h, in the quark sector. This parametrization is valid for any model where gauge coupling unification occurs at some (unspecified) high energy scale. From a physically motivated set of equations of state for dense matter we obtain the <b>constrained</b> <b>parameter</b> phase space (R,S) in high density nuclear environments. This procedure is complementary to (although currently less powerful than) those used in low-density conditions.
