5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle have evolved {{immunity}} to insecticides. For example, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle,</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a destructive pest of potato plants. Its hosts include {{other members of}} the Solanaceae, such as nightshade, tomato, eggplant and capsicum, as well as the potato. Different populations have between them developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide. The <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> was evaluated as a tool of entomological warfare during World War II, the idea being to use the beetle and its larvae to damage the crops of enemy nations. Germany tested its <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> weaponisation program south of Frankfurt, releasing 54,000 beetles.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{rotation}} {{can help}} to control pests by depriving them of their host plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced early season incidence of <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> {{by as much as}} 95%.|$|E
5|$|Beauveria bassiana (Hyphomycetes) is a {{pathogenic}} fungus that infects a {{wide range}} of insect species, including the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle.</b> It has shown to be particularly effective as a biological pesticide for L. decemlineata when used in combination with the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis.|$|E
50|$|Because it {{specifically}} targets <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> and is {{native to}} North America, Lebia grandis shows promise as a biological control species in the United States. However it does not usually occur in sufficient numbers to effect complete control. Populations {{may need to be}} augmented by releasing adult beetles but rearing these in bulk presents certain difficulties that have not yet been overcome. Other predators such as the spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) also prey on <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> but Lebia grandis is constrained by its chrysomelid larval host to habituate potato fields while other predators may disperse to other sources of food.|$|R

25|$|Girault {{earned his}} Bachelor of Science {{degree from the}} Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1903. From 1904 to 1907 he was {{employed}} as a field assistant for the United States Bureau of Entomology. During this time, {{he was involved in}} research on plum curculios (Conotrachelus nenuphar), <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), and American plum borers (Euzophera semifuneralis). In 1908, he moved to Urbana, Illinois, where he worked as a laboratory assistant of the Illinois State Entomologist. From 1909 to 1911 (still in the employ of the Illinois State Entomologist), he worked as an assistant in entomology at the University of Illinois, studying bedbugs (Cimex spp.) and <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1811 by Thomas Nuttall and was formally described in 1824 by the American entomologist Thomas Say. The beetle {{were collected in}} the Rocky Mountains where they were feeding on the buffalo bur, Solanum rostratum. The genus Leptinotarsa is assigned to the chrysolmelid beetle tribe Doryphorini (located in subfamily Chrysomelinae), which it shares with four other genera: Calligrapha, Labidomera, Proseicela, and Zygogramma.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} cost of insecticide resistance is significant, but published {{data on the}} subject is minimal. In 1994, total costs of the insecticide and crop losses in the US state of Michigan were $13.3 million, representing 13.7% of {{the total value of}} the crop. The estimate of the cost implication of insecticides and crop losses per hectare is $138–368. Long-term increased cost to the Michigan potato industry caused by insecticide resistance in <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> was estimated at $0.9 to $1.4 million each year.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{are mainly}} {{free-living}} species that directly consume {{a large number}} of prey during their whole lifetime. Given that many major crop pests are insects, many of the predators used in biological control are insectivorous species. Lady beetles, and in particular their larvae which are active between May and July in the northern hemisphere, are voracious predators of aphids, and also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The spotted lady beetle (Coleomegilla maculata) is also able to feed on the eggs and larvae of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E

50|$|Some common tomato pests are stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms {{and tobacco}} hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, slugs, and <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles.</b> The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and {{necrosis}} of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant.|$|R
25|$|Endosulfan {{has been}} used in {{agriculture}} around the world to control insect pests including whiteflies, aphids, leafhoppers, <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> and cabbage worms. Due to its unique mode of action, it is useful in resistance management; however, as it is not specific, it can negatively impact populations of beneficial insects. It is, however, considered to be moderately toxic to honey bees, and it is less toxic to bees than organophosphate insecticides.|$|R
5|$|The tansy plant {{naturally}} {{contains a}} number of volatile components including 1,8-cineole, trans-thujone, camphor and myrtenol, with the quantities and proportions of each varying seasonally and from plant to plant. 1,8-cineole is a toxin believed to defend the plant leaves against attacks by herbivores. The tansy beetle is resistant to these chemicals. However, tansy is a repellent to other Chrysomelid beetles. For example, the steam distillate of fresh leaves and flowers of tansy contains high levels of camphor and umbellulone and is strongly repellent to the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> (Leptinotarsa decemlineata).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle.</b> After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle,</b> the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

50|$|The GDR's {{propaganda}} {{also sought}} to portray the United States of America and other countries of the West, and especially its neighbour and main rival West Germany, in a negative light. For example, in 1950, the GDR published claims that the United States was sabotaging potato crops in East Germany by airdropping <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> onto crops. However, it has been claimed that the GDR's state newspaper, Neues Deutschland, failed to reach much of the East German population.|$|R

Metalaxyl-resistant strains of the late blight pathogen have become widespread in the US, greatly increasing the relative importance of this potentially devastating disease. Because no curative systemic fungicide is available to control late blight outbreaks, use of protectant fungicides has increased significantly over the past five years. The industry has critical needs for: new insecticides for CPB control; a curative systemic fungicide for late blight control; and registration of new herbicides for weed control.

5|$|Beetles are a {{group of}} insects that form the order Coleoptera, in the {{superorder}} Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except {{the sea and the}} polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle,</b> while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a genetically {{modified}} potato that was {{resistant to the}} <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> was withdrawn because major buyers rejected it, fearing consumer opposition.|$|E
25|$|A British scientist, J.B.S. Haldane, {{suggested}} that Britain and Germany were both vulnerable to entomological attack via the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle.</b> In 1942 the United States shipped 15,000 Colorado potato beetles to Britain for study as a weapon.|$|E
50|$|Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) {{was first}} used as a {{pesticide}} against <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> on crops beginning in 1936. An increase {{in the incidence of}} malaria, epidemic typhus, dysentery, and typhoid fever led to its use against the mosquitoes, lice, and houseflies that carried these diseases. Before World War II, pyrethrum, an extract of a flower from Japan, had been used to control these insects and the diseases they can spread. During World War II, Japan stopped exporting pyrethrum, forcing the search for an alternative. Fearing an epidemic outbreak of typhus, every British and American soldier was issued DDT, who used it to routinely dust beds, tents, and barracks all over the world.|$|R

The potato cyst nematode is a microscopic worm that thrives on the roots, thus causing the potato plants to wilt. Since its eggs can survive in the soil for several years, crop rotation is recommended.|$|E
40|$|The predaceous {{stinkbug}} Perillus bioculatus is attracted towards volatiles {{emitted by}} damaged potato plants. Whereas mechanically damaged plants lost attractiveness 1 h after damage was inflicted, attraction was long-lasting when the plants were damaged by <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata, a prey of P. bioculatus. A range of sesquiterpenoids was previously {{shown to be}} induced upon beetle damage. In order to evaluate the potential role of sesquiterpenoids in the attraction response, volatiles from damaged potato plants were collected and analyzed with GC-MS and GC-EAG.

5|$|After its {{introduction}} from South America to Spain {{in the late}} 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the British Empire, the US and Europe. The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, {{in the form of}} guano imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, {{in the form of an}} arsenic compound used to fight <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles.</b> Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the potato however caused the European Potato Failure, a disastrous crop failure from disease that resulted in widespread famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.|$|R
40|$|If {{males and}} females affect {{reproduction}} differentially, understanding and predicting sexual reproduction requires specification of response surfaces, that is, two-dimensional functions that relate reproduction to the (numeric) densities of both sexes. Aiming at rigorous measurement of female per capita fertilization response surfaces, we conducted a multifactorial experiment and reanalyzed an extensive data set. In our experiment, we varied the density {{of male and female}} Leptinotarsa decemlineata (<b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles)</b> by placing different numbers of the two sexes on enclosed Solanum tuberosum (potato plants) to determine the proportion of females fertilized after 3 or 22 hours. In the reanalysis, we investigated how the short-term fertilization probability of three Drosophila strains (melanogaster ebony, m. sepia, and simulans) depended on adult sex ratio (proportion of males) and total density. The fertilization probability of female Leptinotarsa decemlineata increased logistically with male density, but not with female density. These effects were robust to trial duration. The fertilization probability of female Drosophila increased logistically with both sex ratio and total density. Treatment effects interacted in m. sepia, and simulans. These findings highlight the importance of well-designed, multifactorial experiments and strengthen previous experimental evidence for the relevance of sex-specific densities t...|$|R

25|$|Germany {{is known}} to have pursued entomological warfare {{programs}} during World War II. The nation pursued the mass-production, and dispersion, of the <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetle</b> (Lepinotarsa decemlineata), aimed at the enemy's food sources. The beetle was first found in Germany in 1914, as an invasive species from North America.

40|$|Despite {{the routine}} use of marker genes in genetically {{engineered}} plants, {{little is known}} about the influence of the marker proteins produced by transgenic plants on phytophagous insects. Among the few available marker genes, the nptII gene encoding the neomycin phosphotransferase II and the uid A (gus) gene, encoding for the -glucuronidase activity, are commonly used. Control untransformed plants and three independent transgenic lines of potato plants from the cultivar Désirée carrying only one insert of the gene construct nptII-gus and exhibiting different -glucuronidase activity were used to breed <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles,</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata. Our results show that consumption of foliage of some of these transgenic plants leads to physiological alterations of the beetle feeding. Post-embryonic development of beetles fed with the foliage of the nptII-gus transformed line exhibiting the higher -glucuronidase activity is shortened by more than 2 days. Imagos emerged from such larvae show higher weight (more than 10 %) and size (at least 0. 15 mm more) and survive on average 6 days more in complete starvation. Moreover, the number of modified biological parameters and the intensity of the modifications are closely related with the -glucuronidase activity level of these transgenic lines. It is suggested that -glucuronidase expression in potato plants affects development and survival of this phytophagous beetle. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Photoperiod is a {{reliable}} indicator of season {{and an important}} cue that many insects use for phenological synchronization. Undergoing range expansion insects can face {{a change in the}} local photoperiod to which they need to resynchronize. Rapid range expansion can be associated with rapid photoperiodic adaptation, which can be associated with intense selection on strongly heritable polygenic traits. Alternatively, it is proposed that, in insects with an XO sex-determination system, genes with large effect residing on the sex chromosome could drive photoperiodic adaptation because the gene or genes are exposed to selection in the sex carrying only a single X-chromosome. The present study seeks to understand which of these alternatives more likely explains the rapid photoperiodic adaptation in European <b>Colorado</b> <b>potato</b> <b>beetles</b> Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say. Diapause induction is assessed in beetles from a northern and a southern population, as well as from reciprocal hybrid crosses between the northern and southern population, when reared at an intermediate length photoperiod. The crosses within population display the expected responses, with the northern and southern populations showing high and low diapause propensity, respectively. The hybrids show intermediate responses in all studied traits. No clear difference in the responses in hybrids depending on the latitudinal origin of their father or mother is detected, even though partial paternal line dominance is seen in the responses of male beetles in one hybrid cross. These results therefore indicate that, in L. decemlineata, photoperiodic diapause induction is strongly heritable, and has an additive polygenic autosomal background...|$|R
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the potential of wild tomato (Solanum triflorum Nutt.) to cause yield and biomass losses in lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a potential clean-up crop. Wild tomato emergence patterns, survival, seed production and soil seedbank dynamics were also examined. The study sites were located near Delisle, Laird, and Vonda, SK., from the spring of 1991 to mid-summer of 1993. Seed yield of wheat was reduced at one of four sites, and seed yield of lentil was reduced at three of six sites. In general, wild tomato seedlings emerged from early May to mid-July. Peak emergence occurred around 1 June, varied from 2 to 3 weeks among locations. More than 4, 000 and 50, 000 wild tomato seeds m- 2 were produced in wheat and lentil, respectively. Wild tomato seed bank estimates ranged from about 600 seeds m- 2 to greater than 40, 000 seeds m- 2. Approximately 0. 5 % to 20 % of the seed bank emerged throughout the season. Wild tomato can cause severe difficulties during the harvest of lentil crops. Wild tomato seed is spread by harvest equipment during the harvesting of lentil crops.
