This high degree of symmetry, and closeness of proximity of the two channels however, has the potential to increase channel cross-talk, hence a balance must be found between maintaining a thermal balance between the two channels, and maximizing the <b>channels</b> <b>separation</b> from one another.

50|$|The idea is {{to merge}} a given {{frequency}} range of multiple sound channels together so that the resulting encoding will preserve the sound information of that range not as a bundle of separate channels but as one homogeneous data stream.

30|$|The device {{presented}} in this paper can act as a narrowband optical filter offering tunability in the C-band region with narrow and smooth spectral transmission window which provides good channel isolation. The narrow transmission window is often measured as the bandwidth which in this paper is shown to be 0.07  nm or almost 9 GHz. Furthermore, the bandwidth can be decreased below 3 GHz by improving the finesse of the device: As shown in previous work [29], a finesse of 30 can be achieved which can yield the aforementioned narrow bandwidth.

50|$|A Pro-Logic decoder {{also uses}} Steering Logic, which drives amplifiers, to raise or lower the output volume of each channel {{based on the}} current {{dominant}} sound direction. For example, while a mono signal is played, the strong correlation to the center channel triggers the output volume of the left, right and surround channels to be lowered. This increases the <b>channel</b> <b>separation</b> achievable, to around 30 decibels between channels. By careful tuning of {{the response of the}} amplifiers, the total amount of signal energy remains constant and is unaffected by the operation of the channel steering. Additionally the response time of the system to changes in sound direction is important as too fast a response results in a twitchy feel, while too slow a response leaves sounds coming from an inappropriate direction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a joint source-channel coding scheme, {{a single}} mapping {{is used to}} perform both the tasks of data {{compression}} and channel coding in a combined way, rather than performing them separately. Usually for simple iid sources and <b>channels,</b> <b>separation</b> of the tasks is information theoretically optimal. In an adversarial joint source-channel coding scenario, instead of a stochastic channel, an adversary introduces a set of bounded number of errors/erasures. It has been shown recently that, even in the simplest cases of such adversarial models, separation is suboptimal and characterizing the fundamental limits is difficult. In this paper, we study several properties of such adversarial joint source-channel schemes. We show optimality of separation in some situations, provide simple joint schemes that beat separation in others, and give new bounds on the rate of such coding. I...|$|R
