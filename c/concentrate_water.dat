The use of food additives (color, flavours, or acids) into cranberry juice depends on the percentage of cranberry juice or concentrate by volume. Cranberry juice mixtures with 25% or 27% contain none of the mentioned additives, except for ascorbic acid. Cranberry juice mixtures with 22% contain no added color or flavors, but citric acid may be added. Cranberry juice mixtures with 20% may contain color, flavors, and citric acid.  The finished cranberry juice from concentrate product should yield a minimum of one one part cranberry juice concentrate to three parts water with a minimum Brix level of 12°. Additionally, each cranberry juice product should be fortified with Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid), with each serving size delivering not less than 100% of the current US Referenced Daily Intake.

The model divides a catchment into topographic elements defined by the intersection of contours and flow tube boundaries orthogonal to the contours. The slope gradient and the upslope contributing area of a shallow landslide were considered as the topographical factors in their model. Montgomery and Dietrich (1994) pointed out that steep slopes and topographic hollows which concentrate the surface and subsurface water to the outlet are the most susceptible to failure. Baeza and Corominas (2001) pointed to the important influence of a cross-section perpendicular to the slope gradient, on the initiation of shallow landslides. The cross-section of the slope (lateral convexity or concavity) shows {{the ability of the}} topography to disperse or <b>concentrate</b> <b>water</b> at a certain location, which has a large effect on the susceptibility to landsliding.|$|E
40|$|Abstract approved: The water {{required}} to irrigate greenbelts being established around Iranian cities {{is a major}} cause of concern in a country with insuffi-cient supplies. Alternative methods of afforestation which do not require irrigation must be found. One such method is to <b>concentrate</b> <b>water</b> received by a watershed without vegetation on a smaller area where trees are planted. This can be accomplished by making portions of the surface of the watershed area impervious to water through application of asphalt. This principle was tested by constructing two m wide terraces on contour lines at five m intervals resulting in a watershed to spreading area ratio of 1. 5. A special formulation of asphalt was sprayed onto the surface of the microwatersheds at the rate of one liter/m 2 in December 1969.

Previous research reported that flotation by entrainment {{is related to the}} amount of water that is transported to the <b>concentrate</b> (<b>water</b> recovery). On the other hand, plant operational experience indicates that frother type can be used to control the amount of water in the concentrate. In this work, a relationship between surfactant type and flotation by entrainment was obtained at laboratory scale using a batch flotation tests. The results indicate that the structure and molecular weight of surfactant influences the water reported to the concentrate, which is also related to the recovery of hydrophilic particles. The relationship between entrainment and water recovery is not unique, but depends on surfactant type. When comparing grade-recovery curves generated with different surfactants, the results show that there is an important effect of the surfactant type on the selectivity of the process.
