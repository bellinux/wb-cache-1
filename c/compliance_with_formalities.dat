50|$|Legal traditions {{differ on}} whether a work {{in the public domain}} can have its {{copyright}} restored. In the European Union, the Copyright Duration Directive was applied retroactively, restoring and extending the terms of copyright on material previously in the public domain. Term extensions by the U.S. and Australia generally have not removed works from the public domain, but rather delayed the addition of works to it. However, the United States moved away from that tradition with the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which removed from the public domain many foreign-sourced works that had previously not been in copyright in the US for failure to comply with US-based formalities requirements. Consequently, in the US, foreign-sourced works and US-sourced works are now treated differently, with foreign-sourced works remaining under copyright regardless of <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>formalities,</b> while domestically-sourced works may be in the public domain if they failed to comply with then-existing formalities requirements—a situation described as odd by some scholars, and unfair by some US-based rightsholders.|$|E

50|$|The {{procedure}} to register a trade mark in Australia {{is much the}} same as other countries. A completed application is filed with IP Australia (either by delivery to one of its regional offices or electronically) and checked ("examined") by an examiner of trade marks for <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>formalities</b> and substantive requirements (e.g. registrability, and lack of confusing similarity with a conflicting trade mark). The Australian Trade Marks Office Manual of Practice and Procedure is an official publication produced by IP Australia, which provides detailed information to examiners and applicants on the practices and procedures relating to the filing, examination, and registration of a trade mark in accordance with the provisions of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth). If an application is accepted, it will be published for opposition purposes for three months, during which time third parties may oppose registration on certain grounds. If there are no oppositions, or any oppositions are overcome, a certificate of registration will issue.|$|E
40|$|Reform(aliz) ing Copyright {{looks at}} {{the effect of the}} removal from the U. S. {{copyright}} laws of copyright formalities like registration, notice, and renewal. Beginning in 1976, the U. S. moved from a “conditional” copyright system that premised the existence and continuation of copyright on <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> <b>formalities,</b> to an “unconditional” system, where copyright arises automatically when a work is “fixed”. Richard Epstein has aptly characterized these changes as “copyright law... flipping over from a system that protected only rights that were claimed to one that vests all rights, whether claimed or not. ” That is a fundamental shift in any property rights regime, and one that, in the copyright context, represented a break with almost two centuries of practice. The advent of unconditional copyright has generated little comment in the academic literature—perhaps because the very term “formalities” signals that the former requirements were trifling, ministerial, or more bothersome than helpful. This paper argues that the disappearance of formalities was an important shift, and a harmful one. The paper recommends the re-introduction of formalities—albeit in a new form that accounts for changes in technology and complies with our international obligations under the Berne Convention, the principle international treaty governing copyright. This paper explores the important role that formalities played in our traditional copyright regime, particularly with respect to maintaining a balance between private incentives to produce creative works, and public access to those works. The paper then lays out a few possible approaches to re-introducing “new-style” formalities that comply with Berne...|$|E

5000|$|Compared to patents, the {{advantages}} of trade secrets are that a trade secret is not limited in time (it [...] "continues indefinitely {{as long as the}} secret is not revealed to the public", whereas a patent is only in force for a specified time, after which others may freely copy the invention), a trade secret does not imply any registration costs, has an immediate effect, does not require <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> any <b>formalities,</b> and does not imply any disclosure of the invention to the public. The disadvantages of trade secrets include that [...] "others may be able to legally discover the secret and be thereafter entitled to use it", [...] "others may obtain patent protection for legally discovered secrets", and a trade secret is more difficult to enforce than a patent.|$|R
50|$|In a concurring judgment, Cloete JA found that, at common law, a sale in {{execution}} was void {{for want}} of <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> an essential <b>formality,</b> but that non-compliance <b>with</b> non-essential <b>formalities</b> did not have this result. His view was that section 70 of the Magistrates' Courts Act should be interpreted as being to the same effect as the common law, except that a sale in execution in a magistrates' court could be impugned even {{for want of}} non-essential formalities where the purchaser did not act in good faith or had notice of the non-compliance. Furthermore, section 70 should not be interpreted as protecting a sale which is void, as this conflicts with the basic principle of legality, {{as well as the}} Constitution.|$|R
2500|$|For {{decades the}} famous image was {{unhindered}} by international copyright agreements, because Cuba {{was not a}} signatory to the Berne Convention.

As for the United States, since the image was first published in Cuba without <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> U.S. copyright <b>formalities</b> and used in Cuba before February 20, 1972 (more than 25 years before Cuba signed the Berne Convention in 1997) it is also generally, although not universally, considered to be in the public domain.|$|R
40|$|SOME human actions fit rather {{neatly into}} legal categories; many do not. This is as true of {{attempts}} to give away property as it is elsewhere. If the appropriate category is obvious, {{the effect of the}} donor 2 ̆ 7 s actions will be determined in terms of <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> the requirements specified for that type of transfer. If, for example, a man executes before witnesses a writing expressly described as his last will and testament, the validity of the execution of the document will almost certainly be controlled by the statute of wills. But the inventiveness and variety of inclination of human 2 ̆ 7 beings often produce situations not readily identifiable in terms of recognized legal patterns. In such cases, the legal classification of the situation is often a vital factor in the reasoning of decisions either sustaining or rejecting the claim of the alleged donee. The court frequently has the choice of placing the case in one of several alternative legal categories, such as will, or gift, or trust, or contract. The legal requirements of these categories differ considerably in form, and the evidence may therefore show <b>compliance</b> <b>with</b> the prescribed <b>formalities</b> of one but not with those of another. It may show a failure to meet the provisions of the statute of wills, but sufficient delivery to support an inter vivos gift. It may show no sufficient delivery, but fulfillment of the specifications of a declaration of trust or a contract.
