Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes. The precision of the detail achieved is especially noticeable in the rendering of threads of St. Donatian's blue and golden embroidered cope and mitre, in the weave of the oriental carpet, and in the stubble and veins on van der Paele's aging face.|$|E
5|$|Rounding a corner, {{they see}} a cat and hide under a basket, but the cat then sits {{on top of the}} basket for five hours, {{trapping}} the pair. Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cat locked in the greenhouse.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August {{the police}} removed the McCanns' hired car. Keela and Eddie {{were taken to}} an {{underground}} car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 11 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car and inside the boot (trunk). Keela alerted to the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. One or both dogs gave alerts at Cuddle Cat, Kate's <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bible. The McCanns' lawyer said that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, {{it could have been}} caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.|$|E

The grey coat he wears with a white neckerchief is opened at the chest, revealing a gold-brocade waistcoat, his lower half is clothed in breeches, stockings and slippers. The chaplain wears a black coat with a white collar, grey stockings and black shoes with gold buckles, the costume of a social inferior to Graham, but indicating his educated status. The clerk's dress is similarly simple, a brown jacket, bluish-green waistcoat and white collar, while the steward wears a white apron, smock and cap with a black collar, and brown trousers. The black servant's dress is richer, a white cap and pink neckerchief, and a green buttoned velvet coat with a yellow waistcoat. Trump wears Graham's wig.

500|$|A two-page preface by novelist Evelyn Waugh {{recommends}} the book, remarking on its [...] "idiomatic, uncalculated manner", {{and that the}} [...] "beguiling narrative" [...] is [...] "intensely English". He hopes that Newby is not {{the last of a}} [...] "whimsical tradition". He explains that Newby is not the other English writer of the same name and confesses (or pretends) that he began to read it thinking that it was the other man's work. He sketches out the [...] "deliciously funny" [...] account of Newby selling women's <b>clothes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> [...] "call of the wild" [...] (he admits it is an absurdly trite phrase) that led him to the Hindu Kush. Waugh ends by advising the [...] "dear reader" [...] to [...] "fall to and enjoy this characteristic artifact." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Heike Görtemaker {{noted that}} {{women did not}} play {{a big role in}} the {{politics}} of the Third Reich. Braun's political influence on Hitler was apparently minimal. She was never allowed to stay in the room when business or political conversations took place, and was sent out of the room when cabinet ministers or other dignitaries were present. She was {{not a member of the}} Nazi Party. In his post-war memoirs Hoffmann characterized Braun's outlook as [...] "inconsequential and feather-brained"; her main interests were sports, <b>clothes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cinema. By all accounts, she led a sheltered and privileged existence and seemed uninterested in politics. One instance when she took an interest was in 1943, shortly after Germany had fully transitioned to a total war economy. Among other things, this meant a potential ban on women's cosmetics and luxuries. According to Speer's memoirs, Braun approached Hitler in [...] "high indignation"; Hitler quietly instructed Speer, who was armaments minister at the time, to halt production of women's cosmetics and luxuries rather than instituting an outright ban.|$|E

500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs.

Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|In December 1993, Jackson {{was served}} with a warrant for a strip search of his body, as police wanted to verify Jordan Chandler's {{description}} of Jackson's private anatomy. The order stated that officers were to examine, photograph and videotape Jackson's entire body, [...] "including his penis, anus, hips, buttocks and {{any other part of}} his body". The warrant stated they were looking for discoloration or any other signs of vitiligo which he had previously spoken about, or any other skin disorder, and that refusal to comply would be used in court as an indication of guilt. The strip search took place on December 20, 1993, at Jackson's ranch. Those present for the prosecution were Santa Barbara District Attorney Tom Sneddon, a detective, a photographer and a doctor. Those present on behalf of Jackson were his two attorneys, a physician, a detective, a bodyguard and a photographer. The attorneys and Sneddon agreed to leave the room when the examination took place, and Jackson demanded that the prosecution detective should also leave, which he subsequently did. In an emotional state, Jackson stood on a platform {{in the middle of the}} room, took off all his <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> search lasted for approximately 25minutes, although he was never physically touched.|$|E
500|$|M. Daphne Kutzer, Professor of English at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh {{and author}} of Beatrix Potter: Writing in Code (2003) {{indicates}} Potter was venturing into new territory in creating a tale with a large human presence (Lucie). Potter's artistic uncertainty is evident in her attempt to establish a relationship between <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> social and animal selves of humans and animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle wears human clothing while the neighbourhood animals wear and shed only their skins. Logically, Kutzer points out, all the animals should wear either human clothing or only their skins. She believes Peter Rabbit's blue jacket {{is used in the}} tale as a gimmick to remind the reader that other Potter books exist for purchase, and a gimmick that disrupts Potter's artistic intent. If Peter wears human clothing then why do the other animals wear only their skins? The issue of animal clothing versus human clothing is further confused when Mrs. Tiggy-winkle sheds her human clothing {{at the end of the}} tale to reveal herself a hedgehog who may or may not be able to shed her skin as well. If she can shed her skin, then why is she wearing human clothes? [...] Kutzer believes these questions remain unanswered and erode the tale's logic.|$|E

500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe {{started working on}} it. Madonna {{wanted it to be}} [...] "loud and brazen, and a {{reflection}} of my street-style and DGAF attitude." [...] She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said [...] "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and jumping on the crowd. That just plain sucks! That's why I wanted something different, something that would be memorable." [...] For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend Maripol for the <b>clothes</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in Greenwich Village, where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna. Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the [...] "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me." [...] To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced [...] the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the Like a Virgin album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words [...] "Boy" [...] and [...] "Toy" [...] emblazed on it in gold color. For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager Freddy DeMann contacted record producer Patrick Leonard, who had just returned from the Victory Tour by The Jackson 5. At first Leonard said no, feeling exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.|$|E
500|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The comedy of the situation derives from Jenks' own attempts to manufacture some free time to enjoy himself, only to regret the action because of the resultant circumstances. Advertising for the film confirms this by stating, [...] "Jenk's day off was a day of woe instead of the day of joy he meant it to be. It taught him to never, never leave his wife's side - not even for a day!" [...] Jenks' swimming in a secluded spot, inferring swimming in the nude through {{the lack of a}} swimming suit, sets the stage for the comedy when his clothes are swapped for those of the cross-dressed convict. With no other option, Jenks dons the clothes and responds to the call for help. The lady identifies Jenks as the convict, wearing her <b>clothes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> film concludes with a chase that leads to the arrest and humiliation of Jenks. This comedy predates the well-known cross-dressing antics of Fatty Arbuckle and Charlie Chaplin by a few years. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast is uncredited because their identities are unknown. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies, Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming, and the leading man was Frank H. Crane.|$|E
