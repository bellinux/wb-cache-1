40|$|Multilevel power {{converters}} {{have been introduced}} as the solution for high-power high-voltage switching applications where they have well-known advantages. Recently, full back-to-back connected multilevel neutral point diode clamped converters (NPC converter) have been used inhigh-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems. Bipolar-connected back-to-back NPC converters have advantages in long-distance HVDCtransmission systems over the full back-to-back connection, but greater difficulty to balance the dc <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>divider</b> on both sending and receiving end NPC converters. This study shows that power flow control and dc capacitor voltage balancing are feasible using fast optimum-predictive-based controllers in HVDC systems using bipolar back-to-back-connected five-level NPC multilevel converters. For both converter sides, the control strategytakes in account active and reactive power, which establishes ac grid currents in both ends, and guarantees the balancing of dc bus capacitor voltages inboth NPC converters. Additionally, the semiconductor switching frequency is minimised to reduce switching losses. The performance and robustness of the new fast predictive control strategy, and its capability to solve the DC capacitor voltage balancing problem of bipolar-connected back-to-back NPCconverters are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a low fixed pattern noise (LFPN) capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA) for active pixel CMOS image sensors (APS) with high switchable gain and low read noise. The LFPN CTIA APS uses a switched <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>divider</b> feedback circuit to achieve high sensitivity, low gain FPN, and low read noise. This paper discusses {{the operation of}} the LFPN CTIA APS, and presents a theoretical analysis of its gain FPN and read noise. We do not analyze the effect of 1 /f noise, since it is typically much smaller than the thermal and shot noise effects. Monte Carlo simulation of gain FPN and SPICE simulation of read noise are also presented. For a 0. 35 Âµm CMOS LFPN CTIA at room temperature and an output data rate of 16 Mpixel/sec, we show that the pixel amplifier gain FPN is less than 0. 0064, where FPN is defined as the ratio of standard deviation to mean. The read noise and dynamic range are less than 3 electrons RMS and greater than 90 dB respectively. We find that theory and simulated results match closely.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the complete theoretical analysis, simulation and design optimisation of a Full-Bridge ZeroVoltage -Switched Phase-Shift (FB-ZVS-PS) DC-DC converter with an LCC auxiliary circuit, {{working with a}} frequency of 250 kHz and with an output power of 1 kW. The converter uses a <b>voltage</b> <b>capacitor</b> <b>divider</b> to create half of the input voltage in one terminal of the auxiliary inductor. The voltage at the inductor terminals will, therefore, oscillate between [...] V I / 2 and +V I / 2, producing an additional current reinforcing the primary current during the passive-to-active transition and increasing the energy available to achieve ZVS. This way, {{it is possible to}} design FB-PS-ZVS DC/DC converter without using a commutating inductor in series with the power transformer, avoiding the problems related with the effective duty cycle reduction. Furthermore, it is shown that, by properly design of LCC circuit, the ZVS range and the effective-duty-cycle can be optimised, without significant overall penalties. I...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} Schmitt trigger {{is based}} on the dynamic threshold idea that is implemented by a <b>voltage</b> <b>divider</b> with a switchable upper leg (the collector resistors RC1 and RC2) and a steady lower leg (RE). Q1 acts as a comparator with a differential input (Q1 base-emitter junction) consisting of an inverting (Q1 base) and a non-inverting (Q1 emitter) inputs. The input voltage is applied to the inverting input; the output voltage of the <b>voltage</b> <b>divider</b> is applied to the non-inverting input thus determining its threshold. The comparator output drives the second common collector stage Q2 (an emitter follower) through the <b>voltage</b> <b>divider</b> R1-R2.

40|$|Multi-level {{converters}} {{are well}} suited to medium and high power applications where the priority is for high quality a. c. currents with low harmonic content and for low switching losses. Suitable modulation schemes must find a good compromise between these two conflicting aims. This paper relates one-dimensional feed-forward modulation (1 DFFM) to carrier based modulation. 1 DFFM can produce high quality currents despite d. c. <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltage</b> ripple by accounting for measured <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltages</b> in the modulation process and can balance <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltages</b> by eliminating states that cause the <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltages</b> to diverge. It is shown in this paper that this method increases the device switching frequency compared to carrier-based modulation with the same sampling rate. An alternative modulation method is presented which balances the <b>capacitor</b> <b>voltages</b> by assigning commutations to bridges during each sampling period. This approach {{is less likely to}} cause two bridges to commutate at the same time so produces a lower device switching frequency than 1 DFFM.
