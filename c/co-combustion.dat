Muthuraman et al. (2010 a) found the ignition and carbon burnout of MSW with high ash Indian coal is even better than the Indonesian coal/Indian coal blend which indicated the feasibility for replacing Indonesian coal with MSW. Lu et al. (2016) studied the <b>co-combustion</b> of MSW and coal by use of numerical simulation and bubbling fluidized bed (BFB). The {{results show that the}} MSW blend ratio can be increased to 30 % without major modification of the coal-fired BFB reactor and the minimum CO emission was found at the mixing proportion of 20 %. The mixing of MSW helped to decrease the SO 2 and NO emission. Suksankraisorn et al. (2004) investigated the <b>co-combustion</b> of MSW and high sulfur Thai lignite in a BFB and found the addition of MSW will lower the bed temperature and carbon combustion efficiency. The emission of SO 2 can be reduced by up to 7 %– 18 % as a result of fuel sulfur dilution while the NO emission slightly increases with the increase of MSW fraction. Besides of the common pollutants, it is found that the <b>co-combustion</b> of MSW and coal can reduce the yield and toxicity of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and PCDD/Fs (Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans) (Peng et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2006). The raw MSW has complicated components and various sizes which are difficult to directly combust in existing CFB. So refuse-derived Fuel (RDF) is also used instead of the raw MSW in the <b>co-combustion</b> and the results show the pollutants can be suppressed by the additives (such as CaO) in the RDF preparation process (Chyang et al. 2010; Rigamonti et al. 2012; Wei et al. 2009). Besides, because of the high moisture content in MSW, hydrothermal treatment is found to be useful to improve the <b>co-combustion</b> of coal and MSW (Jin et al. 2013; Muthuraman et al. 2010 b).

The scope was to test the feasibility of burning secondary fuels (biomasses and residues) with coals using a low NOx burner developed for pulverized coal in the ENEL Research Centre. A <b>co-combustion</b> model was developed for interpreting the results and extrapolating kinetic parameters to practical conditions. It considers the effect of the particle size distribution, the different reactivity, and, in general, the different combustion behavior of each fuel fed to the furnace. The kinetic scheme adopted is simple and the introduced assumptions allow easy coupling with computational reactive fluid dynamic codes. Fuel conversion, oxygen concentration and carbon-in-ash profiles have been computed and compared with the experimental results. Quite good agreement has been obtained, allowing kinetic information to be used in more comprehensive descriptions of full-scale systems...|$|E
40|$|In many Eastern European {{countries}} the {{emission of pollutants}} from coal fired domestic and small commercial heating plants is a serious problem. One alternative method to reduce emissions is by burning coal with biomass that is by <b>co-combustion,</b> which would {{reduce the amount of}} net CO 2 produced, the rate of reduction of coal reserves, and the overall amounts of pollutants. The effects of <b>co-combustion</b> of coal and biomass on the levels of pollutant formation have been studied for a 30 kW domestic boiler. Of particular interest are the emissions of PAH and VOC since {{it has been shown that}} these emissions are lowered during <b>co-combustion.</b> The relation between boiler design fuel composition and measured emission profiles for VOC and PAH is discussed in detail. Outputs from modelling of the emissions and devolatilisation characteristics of the fuels have been compared to measured values. Analytical methods have been developed for characterisation of the initial devolatilisation products from both coal and biomass fuels and the relation to modelling is discussed. The fate of these initial devolatilisation products and the effect of boiler design on the formation of PAH and soot in the post combustion zones is addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{depletion}} of the conventional energy sources, {{as well as the}} degradation and pollution of the environment by the exploitation of fossil fuels caused the development of renewable energy sources (RES), including biomass. In Poland, biomass is the most popular renewable energy source, which is closely related to the obligations associated with the membership in the EU. Biomass is the oldest renewable energy source, and its potential, diversity and polymorphism place it over other sources. Besides, the improvement in its parameters, including an increase in its calorific value, resulted in increasing use of biomass as energy source. In the electric power industry biomass is applied in the process of <b>co-combustion</b> with coal. This process may contribute, inter alia, to the reduction in the emissions of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur oxides. The article presents the characteristics of the biomass burned in power boilers of one of the largest Polish power plants, located in Opole Province (Southern Poland). Besides, the impact of biomass on the installation of <b>co-combustion,</b> as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the <b>co-combustion</b> process not only in technological, but also environmental, economic and social aspects were described...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} use {{of biomass}} <b>co-combustion</b> derived fly-ash products and zeolite 13 X {{for the elimination}} of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using ozone was investigated for an integrated solar-assisted air purification and desiccant cooling system. Fly-ash products from rice husk-coal <b>co-combustion</b> at different biomass blending ratios were used as the adsorbent/catalyst materials. The material characteristics of the adsorbent/catalyst materials such as metal content and surface area were compared and correlated with the catalytic activities. It was found that the surface area and the metal constitutes have made the catalytic activities over the fly-ash products from biomass <b>co-combustion</b> superior to that from coal-only combustion. The elevated reaction temperatures from 25 °C to 75 °C also have significant effects on the removal of VOCs. The apparent activation energies of the reaction path over the fly-ash products with the addition of ozone to the air were reduced, when compared with the use of air as an oxidant. On the other hand, the potential synergy to Zeolite 13 X was explored. The combined catalytic ozonation and adsorption enhanced the VOCs removal {{and at the same time}} reduced the intermediates emission. Furthermore, the hydrophilic properties of zeolite 13 X could be utilized to handle the latent load of the solar-assisted ventilation system for energy conservations. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|E
