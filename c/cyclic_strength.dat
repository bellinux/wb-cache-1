40|$|The {{existence}} of initial shear stress {{can have a}} significant effect on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> or liquefaction potential of sand. This effect is not yet fully understood because of a lack of convergence and consistency in the existing data and interpretations, leading to great uncertainty in quantifying the effect for practical applications. This paper presents new experimental results on a silica sand to validate the concept known as threshold α, below which the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> of sand increases with α and above which the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> decreases with α (with α representing the sustained shear stress level). On the basis of a series of monotonic loading tests on the same sand, and in the framework of critical state soil mechanics, it is further confirmed that threshold α can be well related to a state parameter in the void ratio-mean effective stress plane and thereby a unified and consistent interpretation can be established. A new platform is proposed on which the relationship between <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> and state parameter is represented by a linear line, and this line will rotate clockwise as α increases. This platform provides an effective analytical tool for the study of the effect of sustained shear stress on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> of sand. Moreover, the study also shows that the cyclic loading path is well linked with the monotonic loading path under different sustained shear stress levels, and this correspondence sheds light on the mechanisms underlying a variety of experimental observations. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} stress rotation {{is one of}} the most important features of the stress state in a seabed subjected to wave loading. Most prior investigations focused their attention on the cyclic behaviour of soil deposits under the circular rotation stress path based on the analytical solutions for a seabed of infinite thickness. In this paper, the nonstandard elliptical, i. e., non-circular, rotation stress path is shown to be a more common state in the soil sediments of a finite seabed with an alternating changeover in stress due to a travelling regular wave. Then an experimental investigation in a hollow cylinder triaxial-torsional apparatus is conducted into the effect of the nonstandard elliptical stress path on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength.</b> A special attention is placed on the difference between the circular rotation stress path and the elliptical rotation stress path. The results and observations show that the shear characteristics for the circular rotation stress path in the literature are not applicable for analyzing the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> of sand in a finite seabed, and also indicate that due to the influence of three parameters about the size and the shape of a nonstandard ellipse, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> under a nonstandard elliptical rotation stress path is evidently more complex and diversified as compared with that under a circular rotation stress path. Especially the influence of the initial phase difference on the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> is significant. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to measure and compare the {{ultimate}} failure <b>strengths</b> and <b>cyclic</b> fatigue <b>strengths</b> of currently available meniscal suturing devices. No statistically significant difference in failure load was found between a vertical loop suture (mean 46. 3 N), a horizontal mattress suture (52. 5 N), the T-fix Device (47. 5 N), and the 16 -mm (39. 2 N) and 13 -mm (32. 8 N) Bionix Arrow. Statistically inferior results were seen with the 10 -mm Bionix Arrow (18. 8 N), the S. D. Sorb Stapler (4. 3 N), and the 12 -mm Arthrex Meniscal Dart (10. 5 N) (P< 0. 01). The Mitek Meniscal Repair System (28. 1 N) performed intermediate, with significantly better results than the S. D. Sorb Stapler and the 12 -mm Arthrex Dart, but significantly worse than the vertical and horizontal sutures, the T-fix and Bionix 16 -mm Device (P< 0. 01). <b>Cyclic</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> was significantly less for the 10 -mm Bionix Arrow, the S.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} an experimental investigation aimed at establishing whether pH affects the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> of artificial and natural fine-grained soils. The undrained cyclic behavior of low plasticity (liquid limit less than 30) kaolin and illite-sand mixtures, medium plasticity (liquid limit less than 50) bentonite-sand mixture, and medium plasticity natural soil recovered from the sliding zone of an earthquakeinduced landslide was studied by means of a ring-shear apparatus with a view to understanding the structural changes that occurred at different pH. The data obtained for the low plasticity clay-sand mixtures indicated that changes in pH could slightly affect the soil resistance to liquefaction. For the bentonite-sand mixture of medium plasticity, the results not only revealed the strong influence of pH but they also demonstrated that in acidic and alkaline mediums the <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> of soil significantly decreased. The outcome of tests on the natural soil corroborated the tendency observed for the bentonite-sand mixture, thus emphasizing the importance of pH in the cyclic behavior of medium plasticity clays.

Similar overall strengths were obtained from undisturbed and reconstituted tests prepared at similar densities, albeit with higher variability for the reconstituted specimens. Reconstituted specimens exhibited distinctly different response in terms of lower compressibility during initial loading cycles, and exhibited a more brittle response when large strains were mobilised, particularly for samples with high fines content.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{monotonic}} and cyclic triaxial tests {{were performed on}} a sand with fines sourced from Christchurch, New Zealand. The sand was sieved and then mixed to give three soils with different fines contents. The undrained tests were {{used to examine the}} effects of fines on the strain softening behaviour under monotonic loading and liquefaction resistance in cyclic loading. Two reference states were used as a basis for evaluation of the effects of fines: the relative density and the steady state line within the state-concept framework for sand characterization. The addition of fines to the sand base caused downward movement of the steady state line in the Dr-p' plane (e-p' plane), and this effectively increased the potential for strain softening or flow deformation. Samples prepared at an identical relative density showed decreasing <b>cyclic</b> <b>strength</b> with increasing fines content.

In static tests, we consider the effect of stacking sequence, the thickness of 90 °-oriented layers, reinforcement type on the mechanical behavior of laminates under loading and on realization of various damage modes leading to rupture.
