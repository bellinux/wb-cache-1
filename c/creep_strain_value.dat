At {{the end of the}} process stress relaxation induces shape changes in the part but significant spring back is observed (about 70 %). Usually CAF cycles for 7 XXX alloys use times around 20 h and temperatures in the range of 120 °C to 190 °C. In the present work CAF tests were performed using the alloy 7050 in an intermediate condition named Temper to Age Forming (TAF). Using the alloy 7050 -TAF resulted in significant process time reduction. From TAF temper, only 8 hours are necessary to achieve properties comparable to T 74. Coupons were submitted to CAF in two levels of initial stress, 190 MPa and 290 MPa, resulting in spring back values of 70 % and 60 % respectively. In addition, constant load creep tests were performed in the same stress levels and time of CAF tests to find the <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> <b>values.</b> <b>Creep</b> tests performed under 190 MPa resulted in <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> around 0, 1 % after 8 h. On the other hand creep tests performed under 290 MPa failed after 7 h with <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> of 1, 7 %. Results obtained are close to that found in previous studies and it is possible to conclude that the use of alloy 7050 in TAF condition allows CAF to be done in 8 hours, since the initial stress is lower than 290 MPa...|$|R

40|$|The {{soldering}} {{process of}} interconnecting crystalline silicon solar cells to form photovoltaic (PV) module {{is a key}} manufacturing process. However, during the soldering process, stress is induced in the solar cell solder joints and remains in the joint as residual stress after soldering. Furthermore, during the module service life time, thermo-mechanical degradation of the solder joints occurs due to thermal cycling of the joints which induce stress, <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> and strain energy. The resultant effect of damage on the solder joint is premature failure, hence shortened fatigue life. This study seeks to determine accumulated thermo-mechanical damage and fatigue life of solder interconnection in solar cell assembly under thermo-mechanical cycling conditions. In this investigation, finite element modelling (FEM) and simulations are carried out {{in order to determine}} nonlinear degradation of SnAgCu solder joints. The degradation of the solder material is simulated using Garofalo-Arrhenius creep model. A three dimensional (3 D) geometric model is subjected to six accelerated thermal cycles (ATCs) utilising IEC 61215 standard for photovoltaic panels. The results demonstrate that induced stress, strain and strain energy impacts the solder joints during operations. Furthermore, the larger the accumulated <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> and <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> energy in the joints, the shorter the fatigue life. This indicates that <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> and <b>creep</b> <b>strain</b> energy in the solder joints significantly impacts the thermo-mechanical reliability of the assembly joints. Regions of solder joint with critical stress, strain and <b>strain</b> energy <b>values</b> including their distribution are determined.
