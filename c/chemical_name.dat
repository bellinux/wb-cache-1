5|$|The {{amino acid}} lycoperdic acid (<b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> 3-(5(S)-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5(S)-yl)-2(S)-alanine) was {{isolated}} from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication. Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with (S)-glutamic acid, (S)-(+)-lycoperdic acid {{is expected to have}} antagonistic or agonistic activity for the glutamate receptor in the mammalian central nervous system. Methods to synthesize the compounds were reported in 1992, 1995, and 2002.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of chemical nomenclature {{is to ensure}} that a spoken or written <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> leaves no ambiguity concerning which chemical compound the name refers to: each <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> should refer to a single substance. A less important aim {{is to ensure that}} each substance has a single name, although a limited number of alternative names is acceptable in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam is a nitrobenzodiazepine. It is a 1,4 benzodiazepine, {{with the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> 1,3-Dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one.|$|E
50|$|Several {{systematic}} <b>chemical</b> <b>naming</b> formats, as {{in chemical}} databases, are used that are equivalent to, and as powerful as, geometric structures. These chemical nomenclature systems include SMILES, InChI and CML. These systematic <b>chemical</b> <b>names</b> {{can be converted}} to structural formulas and vice versa, but chemists nearly always describe a chemical reaction or synthesis using structural formulas rather than <b>chemical</b> <b>names,</b> because the structural formulas allow the chemist to visualize the molecules and the structural changes that occur in them during chemical reactions.|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} {{atropine}} compound used in medicine is atropine sulfate (monohydrate) (C17H23NO3)2·H2SO4·H2O, the full <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> is 1α H, 5α H-Tropan-3-α ol (±)-tropate(ester), sulfate monohydrate.|$|E
25|$|Another legal {{difficulty}} connected with modern pharmacopoeias is the inclusion {{in some of}} them of synthetic chemical remedies, the processes for preparing which have been patented, whilst the substances are sold under trade-mark names. The scientific <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> is often long and unwieldy, and the physician prefers when writing a prescription to use the shorter name under which it is sold by the patentees. In this case the pharmacist is compelled to use the more expensive patented article, which may lead to complaints from the patient. If the physician were {{to use the same}} article under its pharmacopoeial name when the patented article is prescribed, they would become open to prosecution by the patentee for infringement of patent rights. Hence the only solution is for the physician to use the <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> (which cannot be patented) as given in the Pharmacopoeia, or, for those synthetic remedies not included in the Pharmacopoeia, the scientific and <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> given in the British Pharmaceutical Codex.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} mineral {{constituent}} of silt and sand is quartz, also called silica, {{which has the}} <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> silicon dioxide.

25|$|In 1952, enteramine {{was shown}} {{to be the same}} {{substance}} as serotonin, and as the broad range of physiological roles was elucidated, the abbreviation 5-HT of the proper <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> 5-hydroxytryptamine became the preferred name in the pharmacological field. Synonyms of serotonin include: 5-hydroxytriptamine, thrombotin, enteramin, substance DS, and 3-(β-Aminoethyl)-5-hydroxyindole. In 1953, Betty Twarog and Page discovered serotonin in the central nervous system.|$|E
25|$|The suffix -ol {{appears in}} the IUPAC <b>chemical</b> <b>name</b> of all {{substances}} where the hydroxyl group is the functional group with the highest priority; in substances where a higher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- {{will appear in the}} International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name. The suffix -ol in non-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) also typically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group and, so, can be termed an alcohol. But many substances, particularly sugars (examples glucose and sucrose) contain hydroxyl functional groups without using the suffix. An important class of alcohols, of which methanol and ethanol are the simplest members is the saturated straight chain alcohols, the general formula for which is CnH2n+1OH.|$|E

An adjustable threshold allows the system to be tuned to high precision or high recall. At a threshold set for balanced precision and recall, {{we were able to}} extract named entities at an F score of 80. 7 % from chemistry papers and 83. 2 % from PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, we were able to achieve 57. 6 % and 60. 3 % recall at 95 % precision, and 58. 9 % and 49. 1 % precision at 90 % recall.
