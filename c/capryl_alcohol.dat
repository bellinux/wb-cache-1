30|$|Both {{sebacic acid}} and <b>capryl</b> <b>alcohol</b> have many uses. The alcohol finds its uses as plasticizer, as a solvent, dehydrater, antibubbling agent {{and also as}} a {{floatation}} agent in coal industry [36]. The esters of sebacic acid {{on the other hand}} are plasticizers for vinyl resins and are also used in the manufacture of dioctyl sebacate (DOS), a jet lubricant and lubricant in air cooled combustion motors [1, 38] Furthermore; sebacic acid is used as a monomer where it reacts with hexamethylenediamine to produce nylon 6 – 10 [38].|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several {{antifoaming}} agents by inhalation in preventing paroxysmal pulmonary edema was {{tested in a}} series of rabbits. Three single agents (silicone aerosol, freon, and ethyl alcohol vapor) proved beneficial; their combination did not enhance the beneficial effect. A new agent (silicone aerosol) and a new combination (10 per cent ether in alcohol by aerosol) are now ready for clinical triiil. A NTIFOAMING agents in paroxysmal / % pulmonary edema were advocated in J. A. 1950 by one of us (A. A. L.) following animal experimentation. 1 Several substances having effect on surface tension were tested in-cluding ether, octyl alcohol, <b>capryl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> sorbitan trioleate, and ethyl alcohol. Pulmonary edema was induced in rabbits by intravenous injection of epinephrine while the various sub-stances were administered by inhalation by means of an atomizer. Further experiments were conducted in ex-perimental pulmonary edema of the rat caused by intraperitoneal injection of thiourea, in pul-monary edema of the guinea pig caused by ingestion of ammonium chloride, and in pulmo-nary edema of the dog caused by rapid intra-carotid infusion of physiologic salt solution. 2 The general conclusion was that the heavy alcohols failed to develop any favorable effect, that ether had a moderate beneficial action, and that ethyl alcohol exerted an important favorable effect. This effect was attributed to modification of the surface tension of the foam followed by decrease of its volume and better oxygenation of the lungs. As systemic effects of the inhaled alcohol vapor were minimal, the method was particularly indicated for patients with pulmonary edema in shock or for those who might develop this syndrome. In the mean-time, several antifoaming agents were com-pared in vitro by Rosenbluth and associates. 7 The same authors found that the inhalation o...|$|E
40|$|The {{earliest}} comparative physiological {{study on}} the alcohols was made in 1869 by Richardson (1) with methyl, ethyl, butyl, amy!, and <b>capryl</b> <b>alcohols</b> on the higher animals. Although {{it is impossible to}} learn from the physical constants which Richardson gave for his alcohols exactly what mixtures he was working with, several later investigators have confirmed his generalization that the toxicity of the alcohols increases roughly with the increase in molecular weight, and that the narcotic effect increases more rapidly than the toxicity. The most recent paper and summary on this subject is by Macht (2), who adds to the original formulation the observation that the iso alcohols are less toxic than the corresponding normal primary compounds. The present paper is an account of the observations of pharma-cological interest contained in a master’s essay (3), The Reactions of Paramecium to the Lower Alcohols. The ciliate, Paramecium, employed according to the experimental technique outlined below, affords a useful basis for pharmacological comparisons. This infusorian is a relatively simple protoplasmic organization possessing not more than a most rudimentary nervous system, and not more than a primitive division of physiological labor. It is transparent, not too small, and has been the object of much biological research. Only dormant clones may be satisfactorily used. That is, populations of Paramecium ‘descended from a single individual which have come into a stable balance with their environment. Physiologically, such cultures are nearly constant over long periods of time. Physically, they remain nearly neutral in reaction throughout the period of dormancy...|$|R
