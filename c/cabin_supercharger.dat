Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering [...]|$|E
50|$|Post-war piston airliners {{such as the}} Lockheed Constellation (1943) {{extended}} the technology to civilian service. The piston engined airliners generally relied on electrical compressors to provide pressurized <b>cabin</b> air. Engine <b>supercharging</b> and <b>cabin</b> pressurization enabled planes like the Douglas DC-6, the Douglas DC-7, and the Constellation to have certified service ceilings from 24000 ft to 28400 ft. Designing a pressurized fuselage to cope with that altitude range was within the engineering and metallurgical knowledge of that time. The introduction of jet airliners required {{a significant increase in}} cruise altitudes to the 30000 - 41000 ft range, where jet engines are more fuel efficient. That increase in cruise altitudes required far more rigorous engineering of the fuselage, and in the beginning not all the engineering problems were fully understood.|$|R
