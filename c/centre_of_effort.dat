50|$|At {{a stable}} {{angle of heel}} (for a sailboat) and a steady speed, {{aerodynamic}} and hydrodynamic forces are in balance. Integrated over the sailing craft, the total aerodynamic force (FT) {{is located at the}} <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> (CE), which {{is a function of the}} design and adjustment of the sails on a sailing craft. Similarly, the total hydrodynamic force (Fl) is located at the centre of lateral resistance (CLR), which is a function of the design of the hull and its underwater appendages (keel, rudder, foils, etc.). These two forces act in opposition to one another with Fl a reaction to FT.|$|E
5000|$|This {{means that}} a V (3 m) = 5-m/s (≈10-knot) wind at 3 m above the water would be {{approximately}} V (15 m) = 6 m/s (≈12 knots) at 15 m above the water.

50|$|A {{centreboard}} or centerboard (US) is a retractable keel which pivots {{out of a}} slot in {{the hull}} of a sailboat, known as a centreboard trunk (UK) or centerboard case (US). The retractability allows the centreboard to be raised to operate in shallow waters, to move the centre of lateral resistance (offsetting changes to the sailplan that move the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> aft), to reduce drag when the full area of the centreboard is not needed, or when removing the boat from the water, as when trailering. A centreboard which consists of just a pivoting metal plate is called a centerplate. A daggerboard is similar but slides vertically rather than pivoting.|$|E

5000|$|The {{structure}} and flexibility of junk sails make the junk fast and easily controlled. The sails of a junk {{can be moved}} inward toward the long axis of the ship. In theory this closeness {{of what is called}} sheeting allowed the junk to sail into the wind.

50|$|The sail-plan is also {{spread out}} between {{multiple}} masts, {{allowing for a}} comparative powerful sail area, with a low <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> which reduces the heeling moment. However, a thoughtful analysis of these multiple masts indicates that only two or so were actually the main 'driving' sails. The others were {{used to try to}} balance the junk - that is, to get it to more or less steer itself along the chosen course. This was necessary because the Chinese stern hung rudder, in origin a modified centreline steering oar, whilst extremely efficient, was comparatively mechanically weak. The large forces that a sailing vessel can place upon its rudder were known to rip rudders from their relatively weakly constructed mountings (many trading junks carried a spare rudder), so using the sail plan to get the junk to steer itself, reducing the loads on the rudder, was an ingenious development.|$|E

5000|$|On a given sail, the net {{aerodynamic}} {{force on the}} sail is located approximately at the maximum draught intersecting the camber of the sail and passing through a plane intersecting the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> normal to the leading edge (luff), roughly perpendicular to the chord of the sail (a straight line between the leading edge (luff)and the trailing edge (leech)). Net {{aerodynamic force}} {{with respect to the}} air stream is usually considered in reference to the direction of the apparent wind (VA) over the surface plane (ocean, land or ice) and is decomposed into lift (L), perpendicular with VA, and drag (D), in line with VA. For windsurfers, lift component vertical to the surface plane is important, because in strong winds windsurfer sails are leaned into the wind to create a vertical lifting component ( [...] FVERT) that reduces drag on the board (hull) through the water. Note that FVERT acts downwards for boats heeling away from the wind, but is negligible under normal conditions.|$|E
50|$|Wind shear affects sailing {{craft in}} motion by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. Wind shear occurs because of friction above a water surface slowing {{the flow of}} air. The ratio of wind at the surface to wind at a height above the surface varies by a power law with an exponent of 0.11-0.13 over the ocean. This means that a 5-m/s (≈10-knot) wind at 3 m above the water would be approximately 6 m/s (≈12 knots) at 15 m above the water. In hurricane-force winds with 40-m/s (≈78 knots) at the surface the speed at 15 m would be 49 m/s (≈95 knots). This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> on them higher above the surface and increase the heeling moment. Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding twist {{in the shape of}} the sail to achieve attached flow with height.|$|E
50|$|The {{increasingly}} asymmetric underwater {{shape of}} the hull matching the increasing angle of heel may generate an increasing directional turning force into the wind. The sails' <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> will also increase this turning effect or force on the vessel's motion due to increasing lever effect with increased heeling which shows itself as increased human effort required to steer a straight course. Increased heeling reduces exposed sail area relative to the wind direction, so leading to an equilibrium state. As more heeling force causes more heel, weather helm may be experienced. This condition has a braking effect on the vessel but has the safety effect in that an excessively hard pressed boat will try and turn into the wind, therefore, reducing the forces on the sail. Small amounts (≤5 degrees) of weather helm are generally considered desirable because of the consequent aerofoil lift effect from the rudder. This aerofoil lift produces helpful motion to windward & the corollary {{of the reason why}} lee helm is dangerous. Lee helm, the opposite of weather helm, is generally considered to be dangerous because the vessel turns away from the wind when the helm is released, thus increasing forces on the sail {{at a time when the}} helmsperson is not in control.|$|E

50|$|A skeg is {{employed}} {{in the type of}} kayak used on more open water such as the sea. Its purpose and use are rather {{different from those of the}} surfing skeg. In the kayak, the amount of exposure of the skeg to the water, and also its effect on the position of the boat's centre of lateral resistance (CLR), is freely adjustable by the crew. The adjustment varies the degree to which the wind affects the boat - that is, the amount of lateral movement the wind can cause by impacting the upper parts of the boat and the crew. In more conventional calculations, this would be the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> of the sail area (CE). In still water, where the wind is pushing the boat sideways, a contrary force (lateral resistance) develops, resisting that movement. If the central points of the application of those two forces coincide, the boat moves steadily sideways. Otherwise, it rotates in the horizontal plane, until they are in line. By varying the CLR, it is possible to better control the boat's attitude towards the wind and waves. Irregular flowing movement of the water complicates the issue, however. This link explains the subtleties of the kayak skeg. They may be made of wood, fiberglass or aluminum. Some are deployed using internal cables, but others use external ropes and bungee cord.Typically, these are retractable, and they are not a rudder. If properly configured (e.g., use of street sign aluminum in a narrow box that extends through the hull) they will not flex, and will greatly decrease and counter pitch, Roll and yaw, like a centerboard on a sailboat, when the craft is moving. In that sense, the skeg acts as a lifting foil.|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} helpful to {{calculate}} a <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> to help interpret load data gathered from physical model testing. The <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> {{is taken to}} be a point where a load consisting of a force and the smallest possible moment must be located {{if it is to}} be equivalent to the actual loading on the model. The mathematical equations used to locate the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> cannot specify a point, but do define a line; this line is the line of action of the equivalent load.

The method compares the lines of action from similar test to test is minimized. In some cases, the method can be sensitive to experimental error. The method was applied to data gathered in a test of the hydrodynamic loads acting on a component of a minesweeping system. This application of the method helped to determine what circumstances cause the method to become overly sensitive to experimental error. Two other methods of specifying a point instead of a line were suggested. They set arbitrary restrictions on the location of the <b>centre</b> <b>of</b> <b>effort,</b> and are expected to be roughly as sensitive to error as the method developed here.
