However, exposure of the mixture of hybrids to 1 M propionic acid followed by buffer at pH 8 resulted in recovery of binding activity for p-iodobenzoate and p-iodobenzenearsonate. Thus no exchange occurred between the light and heavy chains of the hybrids in the buffer, but exchange did occur on exposure to propionic acid, and this exchange favored a preferential combination among the chains in such a manner that effective antibody sites resulted...|$|E

Field crops were grown with and without water stress in 2008 and 2009. Canopy vertical distributions of leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), specific leaf area (SLA), nitrogen concentration (N(conc)) and specific leaf nitrogen (SLN) were assessed over time for each crop x year x water input <b>combination.</b> <b>Light</b> and nitrogen distributions were quantified by the Beer's law (exponential model) and extinction coefficients for light (K(L)) and nitrogen (K(N)) were calculated. Within a year, K(L) did not change significantly over the studied period in all irrigated crops, but differences in K(L) were significant between years (sunflower: 0. 74 vs. 0. 89; kenaf: 0. 62 vs. 0. 71; cynara: 0. 77). K(L) estimates were always lower (- 48 to - 65 %) in water-stressed sunflower and kenaf crops because of the reduction in leaf angle. These results {{should be taken into}} account, when simulating water-limited biomass production. Vertical SLN distributions were found in canopies when LAI was > 1. 5 (40 from 51 cases). These distributions were significantly correlated with the cumulative LAI from the top (r(2) = 0. 75 - 0. 81; P 0. 66 : P < 0. 001). However, observed SLN distributions were less steep than the distributions that would maximize canopy photosynthesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background:The {{gamut of}} a color CRT {{is defined by}} its three primary colors, each {{produced}} by a phosphor/electron gun <b>combination.</b> <b>Light</b> from the primaries combines additively, so the color gamut is a subset of a three dimensional vector space [1]. With the primaries as basis vectors normalized to 1. 0, the color gamut is a unit cube, known as the RGB color geometry, since the three primaries are usually red, green, and blue. User interaction via RGB is generally thought to be counterintuitive, and transformations of RGB, such as Smith 2 ̆ 7 s HSV geometry [10] which is derived from centuries old artists 2 ̆ 7 models [2], are more popular. More recent color theories, based on psychophysical and physiological models of early visual processing, suggest that more intuitive geometries may be possible. The RGYB geometry is based on two recent discoveries about the human visual system. First, the three color signals from the cone receptors are organized into three opponent channels [1, 7]. A single achromatic channel indicates lightness or brightness. Two chromatic channels, red/green and yellow/blue, signal the chromatic quantities. Second, signals on the achromatic channel are easily distinguishable from signals on the chromatic ones [6]. Consequently, it is usual to represent colors {{as a set of}} surfaces of colors that vary in chromaticity, each at a different level of brightness. Examples are as diverse as CIE chromaticity coordinates, the CIELUV uniform color space, the Munsell color system, and computer graphics color spaces such as HSV and HLS [10, 12]...|$|E
40|$|In {{binocular}} <b>combination,</b> <b>light</b> {{images on}} the two retinas are combined to form a single “cyclopean” perceptual image, in contrast to binocular rivalry which occurs when the two eyes have incompatible (“rivalrous”) inputs and only one eye`s stimulus is perceived. We propose a computational theory for binocular combination with two basic principles of interaction: in every spatial neighborhood, each eye (i) exerts gain control on the other eye's signal {{in proportion to the}} contrast energy of its own input and (ii) additionally exerts gain control on the other eye's gain control. For stimuli of ordinary contrast, when either eye is stimulated alone, the predicted cyclopean image is the same as when both eyes are stimulated equally, coinciding with an easily observed property of natural vision. The gain-control theory is contrast dependent: Very low-contrast stimuli to the left- and right-eye add linearly to form the predicted cyclopean image. The intrinsic nonlinearity manifests itself only as contrast increases. To test the theory more precisely, a horizontal sine wave grating of 0. 68 cycles per degree is presented to each eye. The gratings differ in contrast and phase. The predicted (and perceived) cyclopean grating also is a sine wave; its apparent phase indicates the relative contribution of the two eyes to the cyclopean image. For 48 measured combinations of phase and contrast, the theory with only one estimated parameter accounts for 95 % of the variance of the data. Therefore, a simple, robust, physiologically plausible gain-control theory accurately describes an early stage of binocular combination...|$|E

"BACKGROUND: Methylaminolaevulinate (MAL) -photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a successful topical treatment for a number of (pre) cancerous dermatological conditions. In <b>combination,</b> <b>light</b> of the appropriate wavelength, the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) and tissue oxygen result in the production of singlet oxygen and reactive oxygen species inducing cell death. OBJECTIVES: This study investigates real-time changes in localized tissue blood oxygen saturation and perfusion in conjunction with PpIX fluorescence monitoring for the first time during dermatological MAL-PDT. METHODS: Oxygen saturation, perfusion and PpIX fluorescence were monitored noninvasively utilizing optical reflectance spectroscopy, laser Doppler perfusion imaging and a fluorescence imaging system, respectively. Patients attending for standard dermatological MAL-PDT were recruited to this ethically approved study and monitored prior to, during and after light irradiation. RESULTS: Significant reductions in mean blood oxygen saturation (P < 0 · 005) and PpIX fluorescence (P < 0 · 001) were observed within the first minute of irradiation (4 · 75 J cm(- 2)) while, in contrast, perfusion was observed to increase significantly (P < 0 · 01) during treatment. The changes in oxygen saturation and PpIX fluorescence were positively correlated during the initial phase of treatment (r(2) = 0 · 766). CONCLUSIONS: Rapid reductions in the localized blood oxygen saturation have been observed {{for the first time to}} occur clinically within the initial minutes of light irradiation and positively correlate with the concurrent PpIX photobleaching. Furthermore, perfusion increases, suggesting that the microvasculature compensates for the PDT-induced oxygen depletion...|$|E
40|$|Labor {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{operating}} costs associated with tree fruit production in the United States. Pruning and harvest can easily eclipse over a quarter of an orchard 2 ̆ 7 s operating budget. Additionally, labor sources are becoming increasingly difficult to find while worker pay keeps going up. As a result, it appears that labor costs will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Work on developing mechanized alternatives to pruning is seen as one of the key areas to reduce an orchard 2 ̆ 7 s dependence on human labor. The objective of this study was to test a set of simplified pruning rules (RUL), written for possible use by an automated pruner, against pruning done by a commercial orchard crew (COM), and pruning by skilled horticulturists from Purdue University (PHP). Measurements on orchard productivity, fruit quality, light distribution, and pruning cuts were taken to determine what differences, if any, existed between the three pruning treatments. This experiment was replicated in two different commercial orchards in Indiana, U. S. using two different scion/rootstock combinations in 2013 and expanded to three locations with five different scion/rootstock combinations in 2014. In 2013, minimal differences were seen between pruning treatments. There were no differences in yield for either scion/rootstock <b>combination.</b> <b>Light</b> distribution was higher in the COM trees of 2 ̆ 7 Golden Delicious 2 ̆ 7 /M. 26 while soluble solid concentration (SSC) was higher in fruit from the PHP treatment of these trees. 2 ̆ 7 Pink Lady 2 ̆ 7 /B. 9 PHP fruit were significantly smaller than fruit from the other two treatments. In 2014, a significant difference was seen in only one of the scion/rootstock combinations in terms of light distribution. Yield was highest in the COM for 2 ̆ 7 Golden Delicious 2 ̆ 7 /M. 26, but individual fruit weight was also the lowest in this treatment. No other differences were seen in terms of yield or fruit quality. Pruning analysis showed that the RUL treatment made fewer cuts than the COM treatment in three of the five cultivars. Looking at the distribution of cuts, the proportion of cuts made for branches greater than 12 ̆ 2 in diameter was highest in the RUL treatment for both 2 ̆ 7 Golden Delicious 2 ̆ 7 /M. 26 and 2 ̆ 7 Fuji 2 ̆ 7 /M. 9. The COM treatment for these cultivars had the lowest proportion of large cuts. These results show that only minimal differences existed between pruning treatments and, more importantly, show that pruning using a set of simplified pruning rules will not result in a loss of productivity or fruit quality. ...|$|E
