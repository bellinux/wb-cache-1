40|$|Background: A {{protocol}} for the micropropagation of the grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivar ‘Monastrell’ was developed. Initial plant material {{was obtained from}} the sanitary selection of grapevine plants performed by real-time RT-PCR to confirm the absence of Grapevine fanleaf virus, Arabis mosaic virus, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1, Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3, and Grapevine fleck virus. Results: The effects of the salt composition (comparing Lloyd and McCown woody plant medium and Murashige and Skoog medium 1 / 2 macronutrients) and the growth regulator benzylaminopurine (BAP), at 0 and 8. 9  μM, on plant propagation were evaluated using nodes as explants. The most efficient procedure consisted of bud induction in the medium with Lloyd and McCown woody plant salts and 8. 9  μM BAP for 30  d along with elongation in cytokinin-free medium for 60  d, which gave 22 nodes/explant (174 plants/initial plant). A second <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> in a medium without BAP for another 60  d could give approximately 10, 000 nodes, which can be obtained after an additional 2  months of culture. All plants acclimatized after the second cycle of multiplication were successfully transferred to soil. Conclusion: We developed an optimal {{protocol for}} V. vinifera cv. ‘Monastrell’ micropropagation, the first described for this cultivar...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sweetpotato, (Ipomoea batatas L.), is vegetatively {{propagated}} crop. Due to {{the following}} <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> <b>propagation,</b> viruses are accumulated, which contributes to the decline of sweetpotato yield and quality.

In the current study, we evaluated shoot growth, rooting ability and mini-cuttings production of P. pinaster in response to nitrogen fertilization and seasons. We compared eight half-sib families of P. pinaster from Asturias and Galicia (Northern Iberian Peninsula), searching for useful parameters and growing conditions {{to be included in}} a mass propagation program for clonal family forestry. We fertilized P. pinaster seedling mother plants kept in a greenhouse with three levels of nitrogen: high (HN), medium (MN) and low (LN) to evaluate rooting ability of mini-cuttings.

The weldments were prepared using each of two experimental "second-generation" GMA welding wires and a coated electrode. Fatigue tests were conducted using both sound weldments and weldments containing various internal defects, including porosity, slag, lack of fusion, and lack of penetration. Radiographic and ultrasonic testing techniques were used to study the initiation and <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> fatigue cracks originating at internal weld flaws. The fatigue {{studies have indicated that}} although the highest standards of quality may be used in the fabrication of HY- 130 (T) welded joints, it has not been possible to guarantee the elimination of all defects which have proven to be critical sites for internal fatigue crack nucleation under axial loading. Internal failures were as likely to occur in specimens rated as sound weldments under radiographic inspection as in weldments having regions containing readily detected flaws. Fatigue cracks originating at internal defects were found to initiate at approximately twenty to eighty percent of the total cyclic life-time of butt-welded joint, for tests conducted at a stress <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> zero-to-tension.

For test of them, a method of one-step growth experiment {{was used in this}} work. It is designed to observe one <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> phage <b>propagation,</b> i. e. adsorption, multiplication, and burst. The results were as follows. First, the host bacteria grew within the range of temperature from 17 ° to 35 °C with optimum at 32 °C, however, the phages propagated only between 25 ° and 28 °C with optimum at 25 °C. Secondly, the host bacteria showed different behaviours on the mineral requirement for growth. Tow of them required media supplemented 3 % NaCl for growth, and the other three required K-, Mg-, and Ca-salt as well as NaCl. But all of the tested phages propagated only in the same mineral condition as sea water. These results demonstrate that temperature and mineral conditions for the phage propagation in host cell are more restrictive than that for the growth of host bacterium alone. The properties of the tested phages, psychrophilic and specific mineral requirement for propagation, defined them as marine phages. 供試海洋ファージ系, 06 N- 21 P, 06 N- 24 P, 06 N- 34 P, 06 N- 52 P, 06 N- 58 Pの増殖に及ぼす培養温度と培地中無機塩組成の影響について検討した。その結果,各宿主菌の発育温度域は 17 ~ 35 °Cであり,発育至適温度は 32 °C付近にあった。これに対し,各供試ファージの菌体内増殖の温度域は宿主菌発育のそれに比して狭く 25 °~ 28 °Cで,至適温度は宿主菌のそれより低い 25 °C前後にあった。また,各宿主菌の発育のための無機塩要求性には差異があり,それを型別すると, 06 N- 21, 06 N- 34 はNaClを要求する好塩型, 06 N- 24, 06 N- 52, 06 N- 58 はNaCl,KCl,Mg-塩,Ca-塩などの海水無機塩成分を要求する海洋型であった。しかしそれらに感染するファージは,培地中の無機塩成分,NaCl,KCl,Mg-塩,Ca-塩が海水と同様な濃度組成にある時にのみ増殖した。このように宿主菌体内でのファージの増殖には,宿主菌が発育できる温度域や無機塩組成より狭く厳しい条件下においてのみ増殖することが知られた。そして供試ファージの増殖における低温性と,厳しい海水無機塩要求性は,それらが海洋ファージであることを性格づけていた...|$|R

IM concentration typically increased with internode maturity and comprised up to 217 mm (33 % of total sugars) in whole-cane juice. There was generally a comparable decrease in sucrose concentration, with no overall decrease in total sugars. Sugarcane is vegetatively propagated from stem cuttings known as setts. Culture-derived plants were slower to establish and generally gave shorter and thinner stalks at harvest than those grown from field-sourced setts in the initial field generations. However, after several <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> field <b>propagation,</b> selections were obtained with cane yields similar to the recipient genotypes. There was no apparent adverse effect of IM accumulation on vigour assessed by stalk height and diameter or other visual indicators including germination of setts and establishment of stools. There was some inconsistency in IM levels in juice, between samplings of the vegetatively propagated transgenic lines. Until the causes are resolved, it is prudent to selectively propagate from stalks with higher IM levels in the initial vegetative field generations. Pol/Brix ratio allowed rapid identification of lines with high IM levels, using common sugar industry instruments. Sucrose isomerase activity was low in these transgenic lines, and the results indicate strong potential to develop sugarcane for commercial-scale production of IM if higher activity can be engineered in appropriate developmental patterns...|$|R

In addition, acoustic emissions from full-tube oscillations were analyzed using velocity data. To my knowledge, the current study is the first attempt to experimentally determine the structure of these oscillatory reactive flows. It was established that the flow was essentially onedimensional with little curving of the flow tube only near the flame front. Entropy generation from vorticity was negligible when compared with the entropy produced from combustion of methane in oxygen, as it was determined through an application of Crocco’s theorem. This confirmed previous computational studies indicating that flame oscillations are thermally, not fluid mechanically, driven.

In developed countries this problem has been overcome by general access to and frequent use of seed, produced by specialized growers, that has been certified to have pathogen and pest incidence below established thresholds, {{often referred to as}} certified seed. The success of certified seed in developed countries has concentrated the research and development agenda on the establishment of similar systems in developing countries. Despite these efforts, certified seed has had little penetration into the informal seed systems currently in place in most developing countries. Small-scale farmers in these countries continue to plant seed tubers acquired through the informal seed system, i. e. produced on-farm or acquired from neighbours or local markets. Informal seed tubers frequently have poor health status, leading to significant reductions in yield and/or market value. This review emphasizes the need to refocus management efforts in developing countries on improving the health status of seed tubers in the informal system by integrating disease resistance and on-farm management tools with strategic seed replacement. This ‘integrated seed health strategy’ can also prolong the good health status of plants derived from certified seed, which would otherwise be diminished due to potential rapid infection from neighbouring fields.

In vitro, it was demonstrated that DNA segments harboring the operator sequences formed loops in the presence of CI, but CI-mediated DNA looping has not been directly visualized in vivo, hindering a deep understanding of the corresponding dynamics in realistic cellular environments. We report a high-resolution, single-molecule imaging method to probe CI-mediated DNA looping in live E. coli cells. We labeled two DNA loci with differently colored fluorescent fusion proteins and tracked their separations in real time with ∼ 40 nm accuracy, enabling the first direct analysis of transcription-factor-mediated DNA looping in live cells. Combining looping measurements with measurements of CI expression levels in different operator mutants, we show quantitatively that DNA looping activates transcription and enhances repression. Further, we estimated the upper bound of the rate of conformational change from the unlooped to the looped state, and discuss how chromosome compaction may impact looping kinetics. Our results provide insights into transcription-factor-mediated DNA looping in a variety of operator and CI mutant backgrounds in vivo, and our methodology can be applied to a broad range of questions regarding chromosome conformations in prokaryotes and higher organisms...|$|R
50|$|For {{the sake}} of simplicity, assume that all emitted photons are emitted in a {{direction}} parallel to the ring. Fig. 7 illustrates {{the effect of the}} ring laser's rotation. In a linear laser, an integer multiple of the wavelength fits the length of the laser cavity. This means that in traveling back and forth the laser light goes through an integer number <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> its frequency. In the case of a ring laser the same applies: the number <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>of</b> the laser light's frequency is the same in both directions. This quality of the same number <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> in both directions is preserved when the ring laser setup is rotating. The image illustrates that there is wavelength shift (hence a frequency shift) {{in such a way that}} the number <b>of</b> <b>cycles</b> is the same in both directions <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b>|$|R

The fungus is dimorphic, yeast cells being the {{prevalent}} form <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> The fungus is strongly hydrophilic, probably completing its anamorph life cycle in submersion. Adaptation to dry conditions is slow. Types of conidiogenesis comprise annellidic, phialidic and sympodial reproduction, {{in addition to}} isotropic development. Phialoconidia fail to germinate under the conditions tested, and thus may have a function other than dispersal. Sterile, multicellular bodies resembling a Capronia teleomorph are described...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is to provide a}} {{plausible}} explanation for the relatively good performance of the Polish economy and the resulting cyclical divergence from the euro area during the recent financial crisis. The investigation of the factors which contributed to this divergence is particularly important in the light of Poland’s prospective accession to the euro area, as it may indicate the problem of asymmetric shocks affecting both economies or asymmetric responses to shocks. The results point out to two reasons for the differential output trajectory in Poland as compared to other CEECs: (i) lower exposure to foreign shocks being the result of a lower degree of economic openness, and (ii) resilient internal activity, which {{may be the result of}} structural characteristics of the Polish economy. The recent cyclical decoupling might, however, contribute to the acceleration of Poland’s real convergence to the euro area and consequently speed up the cyclical convergence process. business <b>cycles</b> synchronisation, <b>propagation</b> <b>of</b> shocks, transmission of cyclical fluctuations, real convergence...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The first <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> seismic waves {{recorded}} at distances of 45, 300 and 355 km. from the GNOME nuclear explosion {{was used to}} determine whether the near source wave characteristics at 0. 3 km. could be determined from distance measurements. Both head wave and body wave propagation were considered. First the recorded signals at distance were inversely propagated back to the near source region as head waves, and secondly, the measured source at 0. 3 km. was propagated out to 300 km. from the source as a body wave. In both cases, restricted comparisons between theory and observation can be made, but the comparison appears to favor the body wave type <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> More research is needed to make a more conclusive choice between the two modes <b>of</b> <b>propagation.</b> Methods were developed which can be used to determine source motion from distance measurements when the data are sufficient to do so...|$|R
40|$|Pasteuria spp. include endospore-forming {{bacterial}} pathogens of cladoceran crustaceans and plant-parasitic nematodes. <b>Propagation</b> <b>of</b> these nematode pathogens requires attachment of soilborne endospores to nematode hosts, infection, growth, sporulation, {{and release}} of endospores {{to repeat the}} <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> infection and <b>propagation.</b> The ability <b>of</b> these bacteria to suppress the levels of plant-parasitic nematodes in the field has made them particularly promising candidates for biocontrol of nematode diseases of plants. Genes encoding 16 S ribosomal RNA have been sequenced for the cladoceran (water flea) parasite and type species, Pasteuria ramosa, and for Pasteuria spp. isolated from root-knot (Meloidogyne arenaria race 1 and Meloidogyne sp.), soybean cyst (Heterodera glycines), and sting (Belonolaimus longicaudatus) nematodes. These have provided a phylogenetic basis for their designation to a distinct clade within the family Alicyclobacillaceae of the gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria. Two apparent biotypes of P. penetrans demonstrating a host preference for different Meloidogyne spp. showed identical 16 S rDNA sequences, suggesting host-recognition evolves within a given species. The sequences of genes encoding sporulation transcription factors, sigE and sigF, from P. penetrans biotype P- 20 show different phylogenetic relationships to other endospore-forming bacteria, supporting their application to further discriminate Pasteuria spp. and biotypes. Distribution of an adhesin-associated epitope on polypeptides from different Pasteuria isolates provides an immunochemical approach to differentiate species and biotypes with specific host preferences. Application of bioinformatics to genomic data, as well as further characterization of the biochemical basis for host recognition, will facilitate development of Pasteuria spp. as benign alternatives to chemical nematicides...|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{computational}} {{investigations of}} the flame phenomenology in mesoscale tubes were performed. Particular emphasis was given to oscillating flames, a phenomenon in which a flame front undergoes a periodic <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> upstream <b>propagation,</b> extinction, and downstream re-ignition. Fuel-rich methane-oxygen mixtures and straight quartz ducts with one end open to the atmosphere were used. The flame behavior was determined {{as a function of}} equivalence ratio and Reynolds number in order to produce maps of the phenomenology and identify the boundaries between behavioral regimes. Rich propane-oxygen mixtures and multiple tube lengths were also studied in order to examine the impact of fuel selection and geometry on the regime boundaries. Infrared thermometry was utilized {{in order to determine the}} wall temperature distributions for different flame phenomenologies and to test the hypothesis that the moving nature of an oscillating flame will more uniformly distribute enthalpy throughout the duct. Both quartz and steel tubes were studied during IR experiments in order to investigate the effects of material properties on the resulting temperature distribution and flame phenomenology. Analysis of the exhaust gases was performed in order to measure fuel leakage and incomplete combustion that may occur due to the gaps in combustion that exist in the oscillation cycle. Oscillating flames were found to have fuel leakage and pollutant emission no greater than conventional stationary flames, and to produce a nearly uniform temperature in the tube wall, aspects that make them highly suitable for small-scale power generation. The results of the experiments were used in efforts to develop a high-level computational model that could predict the flame phenomenology. The experimental results strongly suggested a thermal driving mechanism underlying oscillations and revealed the interwoven nature of the wall temperature distribution and the flame phenomenology. The computational model succeeded in qualitatively reproducing all observed flame phenomenologies. However, it was also determined that more complex mechanisms are needed in order to accurately replicate the experimentally observed boundaries between behavioral regimes...|$|R
40|$|Governing {{the life}} <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> {{data on the}} web is a {{challenging}} issue for organisations and users. Data is distributed under certain policies that determine what actions are allowed and in which circumstances. Assessing what policies propagate to the output of a process is one crucial problem. Having a description of policies and data flow steps implies a huge number <b>of</b> <b>propagation</b> rules to be specified and computed (number of policies times number of actions). In this paper we provide a method to obtain an abstraction that allows {{to reduce the number}} of rules significantly. We use the Datanode ontology, a hierarchical organisation of the possible relations between data objects, to compact the knowledge base to a set of more abstract rules. After giving a definition <b>of</b> Policy <b>Propagation</b> Rule, we show (1) a methodology to abstract policy propagation rules based on an ontology, (2) how effective this methodology is when using the Datanode ontology, (3) how this ontology can evolve in order to better represent the behaviour <b>of</b> policy <b>propagation</b> rules...|$|R
