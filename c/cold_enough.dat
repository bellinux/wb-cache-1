5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, it {{approaches}} close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its presence shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} {{can bring}} mild weather {{with a little}} rain and surface winds of , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding , (sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe). The band of precipitation {{that is associated with}} the warm front is often extensive. In mature extratropical cyclones, an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation, frequent thunderstorms, and thundersnows. Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress. During fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall.|$|E

During his teenage years, he trained upwards of six hours a day, and won several {{national}} championships in the sport. He qualified to represent Canada in the 1976 Summer Olympics, but the lack of funding for cycling in North America at the time would have necessitated him funding his own journey and leaving school to do so; McLachlan opted instead to remain in education and focus on his interest in photography.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The left {{edge of the}} {{conveyor}} belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front. An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along {{the conveyor}} belt. Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone. A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right (left in the Southern Hemisphere), aligning with the upper level westerly flow. However, the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest (southwest in the Southern Hemisphere) side of the cyclone, which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation. If the air mass is <b>cold</b> <b>enough,</b> the precipitation falls {{in the form of}} heavy snow. Theory from the 1980s talked about the presence of a cold conveyor belt originating north of the warm front and flowing along a clockwise path (in the northern hemisphere) into the main belt of the westerlies aloft, but there has been conflicting evidence {{as to whether or not}} this phenomenon actually exists.|$|E
25|$|North Dakota has a {{continental}} climate with hot summers and cold winters. The temperature differences are quite significant {{because of its}} far inland position and being {{in the center of}} the Northern Hemisphere, with roughly equal distances to the North Pole and the Equator. As such, summers are almost subtropical in nature, but winters are <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> to ensure plant hardiness is very low.|$|E

25|$|The mile {{of highway}} along the Wallkill is at first wooded and curvy but then offers many {{pleasant}} riverside scenes. A burned-out former Borden Cheese factory {{is the last}} highlight before crossing the county line. This section of the river is popular with local fishermen {{and there are many}} informal parking spots available (In winters when it is <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> for the river to freeze over, snowmobile trails can be seen on the ice). A Ulster County sheriff's substation is the first in a string of buildings that indicate the road has reached the hamlet of Wallkill.|$|E
25|$|Winter sports only play a minor role in British {{sporting}} {{life because}} the winters are not <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> {{for them to}} be practised out of doors very much. Great Britain is not a leading nation at the Winter Olympics, but has had a few successes in sports such as figure skating, curling and bob skeleton. A number of athletes represented Great Britain in the freestyle skiing discipline when it debuted at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Snowboarder Jenny Jones made history at those Games as the first British competitor to win a medal in an event on snow when she took a bronze in the slopestyle competition.|$|E

But this house, being well thatched, and the sides and roof made very thick, kept out the <b>cold</b> well <b>enough.</b> He made, also, an earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it, and another of the company, with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a funnel to the chimney to carry out the smoke.|$|R
25|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} the potential for life to survive using deliquescing salts. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere. If the mixture of salts is right, they may support liquid water at times of high atmospheric humidity, with salts dilute enough {{to be capable of}} supporting life. This water would be warm enough (warmer than about -25°C) but <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> so that it doesn't immediately evaporate in the thin Martian atmosphere. The salts and perchlorates required are known to exist on Mars, though whether they occur in the correct mixtures to support these marginally habitable deliquescing droplets and thin layers of salty brines is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The building's {{expected}} low utility usage profile was a reality. It {{had used}} 0.39 gigajoules (GJ) of energy per square meter during the 2008 fiscal year.

Anecdotal accounts suggested the building's heating was working well: even in outdoor winter temperatures of , <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> that many businesses in Yellowknife send employees home, the Greenstone Building remained warm enough that workers there could continue in their duties comfortably. In the summertime, SNC had learned to start the chiller before other buildings did, in order to avoid brownouts.|$|E
25|$|Nova Scotia {{lies in the}} mid-temperate zone. Since the {{province}} is almost surrounded by the sea, the climate is closer to maritime than to continental climate. The winter and summer temperature extremes of the continental climate are moderated by the ocean. However, winters are still <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> to be classified as continental—still being nearer the freezing point than inland areas to the west. The Nova Scotian climate {{is in many ways}} similar to the central Baltic Sea coast in Northern Europe, only wetter and snowier. This is in spite of Nova Scotia being some fifteen parallels south. Areas not on the Atlantic coast experience warmer summers more typical of inland areas, and winter lows a little colder.|$|E
60|$|You have {{no doubt}} all seen French chateaus, as every body travels in France nowadays. This {{was one of the}} oldest; {{standing}} naked and alone, {{in the midst of a}} desert of gravel walks and cold stone terraces; with a cold-looking formal garden, cut into angles and rhomboids; and a cold leafless park, divided geometrically by straight alleys; and two or three noseless, cold-looking statues without any clothing; and fountains spouting <b>cold</b> water <b>enough</b> to make one's teeth chatter. At least, such was the feeling they imparted on the wintry day of my uncle's visit; though, in hot summer weather, I'll warrant there was glare enough to scorch one's eyes out.|$|R

25|$|Horseradish is {{perennial}} in hardiness zones 2–9 and can {{be grown}} as an annual in other zones, although not as successfully as in zones with both a long growing season and winter temperatures <b>cold</b> <b>enough</b> to ensure plant dormancy. After the first frost in autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug and divided. The main root is harvested and one or more large offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year's crop. Horseradish left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots {{and can be}}come invasive. Older roots left in the ground become woody, after which {{they are no longer}} culinarily useful, although older plants can be dug and re-divided to start new plants. The early season leaves can be distinctively different, asymmetric spiky, before the mature typical flat broad leaves start to be developed.|$|E
25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was <b>cold</b> <b>enough,</b> in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim out of the pool. In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E
25|$|While the {{deterministic}} {{relationship between}} snowpack characteristics and snowpack stability {{is still a}} matter of ongoing scientific study, {{there is a growing}} empirical understanding of the snow composition and deposition characteristics that influence the likelihood of an avalanche. Observation and experience has shown that newly fallen snow requires time to bond with the snow layers beneath it, especially if the new snow falls during very cold and dry conditions. If ambient air temperatures are <b>cold</b> <b>enough,</b> shallow snow above or around boulders, plants, and other discontinuities in the slope, weakens from rapid crystal growth that occurs {{in the presence of a}} critical temperature gradient. Large, angular snow crystals are indicators of weak snow, because such crystals have fewer bonds per unit volume than small, rounded crystals that pack tightly together. Consolidated snow is less likely to slough than loose powdery layers or wet isothermal snow; however, consolidated snow is a necessary condition for the occurrence of slab avalanches, and persistent instabilities within the snowpack can hide below well-consolidated surface layers. Uncertainty associated with the empirical understanding of the factors influencing snow stability leads most professional avalanche workers to recommend conservative use of avalanche terrain relative to current snowpack instability.|$|E
60|$|In {{some respects}} this change {{was for the}} better; while it did not improve our {{situation}} in others. It placed both Anneke and myself behind a shelter, as respected the wind; which, though neither very strong nor very <b>cold,</b> had <b>enough</b> of March about it to render the change acceptable. It took my companion, too, from a position where motion was difficult, and often dangerous; leaving her on a level, even spot, where she could walk with ease and security, and keep the blood in motion by exercise. Then it put us both {{in the best possible}} situation to profit by any contact with that shore, along and near which our island was now slowly moving.|$|R
50|$|Although the Toiyabe Range is in {{the rain}} shadow of the higher Sierra Nevada (U.S.) range {{to the west and}} is too arid to support forests except for {{scattered}} pines, the climate was <b>cold</b> and snowy <b>enough</b> during the Pleistocene to develop alpine glaciers in several places, with cirques, moraines, and other glacial features still apparent.
