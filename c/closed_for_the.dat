When they are older, the mother will brood them only at night or during bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Nero {{opened on}} 25 February 1705, with Mattheson {{in the title}} role. Its staging so closely after Almira's run {{indicates}} that it was probably composed, in part or in whole, during 1704. There are no surviving accounts of its public reception, but it clearly proved less successful than its predecessor, running for just three performances before the theatre <b>closed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Lenten season. When the Gänsemarkt reopened the opera was not revived, and was never performed again.|$|E
5|$|On 1 December 2010, {{the bridge}} was <b>closed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time due to heavy snow.

5|$|The primary {{instrument}} carried {{aboard the}} station was the BST-1M multispectral telescope, which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared, ultraviolet and submillimetre spectra using a 1.5metre-diameter mirror which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around 269°C.

5|$|Ahead of {{the storm}} on August25, the United States Department of Defense set the Condition of Readiness (COR) at stage 3 on Guam, {{indicating}} destructive winds were possible within 48hours.

On August28, COR 1 was declared, the highest level. In response, all fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters on the island were moved into hangars or transported to Japan or the Philippines. All schools were <b>closed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of Omar's passage over Guam. Flight operations were suspended {{for at least two}} days, stranding 5,000passengers on the island.
