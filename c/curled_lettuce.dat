40|$|A simple subunit of the bioregenerative {{life support}} system (BLSS) {{consisting}} of the ground-controlled mulberry (Morus alba L.) and the silkworms was {{set up on the}} ground. The mulberry tree could provide nutrient mulberry fruits for astronauts and its leaves as the main feedstuff for the silkworms until their third instar. Astronauts utilized <b>curled</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) stem as vegetables and the silkworms over third instar could be fed on 65 % of inedible leaves of the lettuce. About 71. 4 % of protein were detected in the silkworm larval powder; thus, 105 silkworms could satisfy the requirement of one person per day. Besides, 18 kinds of amino acids were determined in the obtained silkworm powder. Moreover, the R-criterion was suggested to estimate and optimize the animal feeding facilities. The scenario of treating the wastes is also proposed in this paper. Our results may be valuable {{for the establishment of a}} complex BLSS in the future...|$|E
