Probably, it is {{connected}} not only to the properties of the memory, but also to that the past always is associated with the young, best years of life. Not the last role thus plays, certainly, and the significance of events, distribution of which in time is determined "by madam Good Luck". In this schedule we had luck: we came in Phystech in lab of L. I. Rusinov at the end of 50 -th Years (V. L. in 1957, V. N. in 1958), when it was just shown, that one of the fundamental laws of physics, the con-servation law of spatial parity, is upset in weak interactions. This discovery being one of the most consider-able in the modern physics, resulted in a severe "shock " of existed time-space conceptions. It opened new capabilities, and we well remember that a spirit of romanticism and overall enthusiasm, which has griped of physical community. The new ideas and proposals were emerging almost each day: V-А-theory, the con-serning vectorial the current, the combined parity, the two-component neutrino, the universality of a weak interaction [...] . Our small in the number group (except for us it included an radio designer and a technician) immediately joined in this precipitant flow, which bore many new questions demanding the experimental answers. The maiden experiments were connected to research of β-γ correlations with the purpose of <b>check</b> <b>som...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to investigate the morphology and topographic distribution, developmental changes of somatostatin-producing cells in the small intestinal of African ostrich chicks at different ages: 1 day (birth), 45 days, 90 (days) and 334 (control). The results were as follows: Somatostatin (SOM) cells {{were present in the}} mucosal layer of whole small intestinal of the African ostrich on all <b>checked</b> days. <b>SOM</b> cells had round and spherical shapes (closed-type cells) or spindle and pyriform shapes (open-type cells). SOM cells were localized preferentially in the duodenum of 90 days old ostrich. The quantity of SOM-IP cells increased gradually after birth until 90 days and peaked on 90 days in the duodenum, meanwhile it decreased gradually after birth until 90 days and footed on 90 days in the jejunal and ileal regions. These results indicated that SOM might be involved in functional and developmental regulation of small intestinal of African ostrich chicks...|$|R
40|$|Data {{obtained}} with the GSS ersatz network density item are compared to density data {{obtained with}} the more traditional, more costly, GSS sociometric network items. The inexpensive rsatz density data are not independent of network density, but they are almost completely unreliable. The full range of possible densities occurs at each level of ersatz density and only 1 to 2 percent of variation in network density can be described with ersatz density. Hypotheses operationahzed with the ersatz density variable specified as a predictor will be biased toward the null hypothesis. Given this GSS experiment, the reliability of conchrsions from studies replacing sociometric network items with inexpensive items purposing to measwe network structure directly should be interpreted with caution. The network items adopted for the 1985 General Social Survey (GSS) are sociometric {{in the sense of}} asking respondents to name specified people and describe relations with and between each pair of named individuals. Each respondent was asked: “Looking back over the last six months, who are the people with whom you discussed matters important to you? ” Diverse data were then obtained on relations with and among the first five persons named. r Sociometric items were adopted on the assumption that they are more reliable and valid than the comparatively crude network items more typical of survey research. However, no national probability data were available with which the assumption could be <b>checked</b> and <b>som...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to investigate, through an experiment, if {{positive}} mood promotes creativity and flexible thinking. Participants were a total of 93 college students. The main hypothesis was that subjects induced with positive mood would perform better than subjects induced with negative mood, at a test reflecting creativity. To further explore the implications of priming (subliminal manipulated moods), a neutral control group was included. The cognitive test used in the study was Duncker´s The Candle Problem, a test which aims to get the subjects to apply flexible and creative thinking. The priming methods applied in the study was music and video clips. To measure the participant’s subjective mood a self-report scale, Mood Adjective Check List (MACL), was included as a successful manipulation control. The result showed a clear relationship between positive and negative priming, implying that subjects induced with positive mood performed significantly better than subjects induced with negative mood. There was no significant relationship between the groups induced with neutral and negative mood.    Syftet med studien var att genom ett experiment utforska om positiv sinnesstämning främjar kreativitet och flexibelt tänkande. Deltagarna i experimentet var totalt 93 studenter. Den huvudsakliga hypotesen var att deltagare inducerade till positivt känslotillstånd skulle prestera bättre än deltagare inducerade till negativt känslotillstånd, på ett kreativitetsreflekterande test. För att närmare undersöka påverkan av priming (subliminalt manipulerade känslotillstånd) inkluderades även en neutral kontrollgrupp. Testet som användes var Dunckers The Candle Problem. Syftet med testet var att få deltagarna att tillämpa flexibelt och kreativt tänkande. Priming-metoden som användes i experimentet bestod av musik och filmklipp. För att mäta deltagarnas subjektiva känslotillstånd tillämpades formuläret Mood Adjective <b>Check</b> List (MACL) <b>som</b> en framgångsrik manipulationskontroll. Ur resultatet utlästes en tydlig relation mellan positiv och negativ priming, att deltagare som fått positiv priming klarade testet signifikant bättre än deltagare med negativ priming. Mellan grupperna som inducerats med neutral och negativ sinnesstämning upptäcktes dock ingen signifikant relation. ...|$|R
