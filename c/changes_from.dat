50|$|The {{vertebrate}} {{species that}} {{were important to}} the initial water to land transition can be qualified as being one of five groups: Sarcopterygian fishes, prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> fins to limbs, the method of locomotion <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> swimming to walking, respiratory structures <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction <b>changed</b> <b>from</b> larval development to metamorphosis.|$|R

With a density of 4.25g/cm3 at 20°C, Clerici solution {{is one of the}} heaviest aqueous solutions known. It was used in the 20th century for measuring the density of minerals by the flotation method, but its use has discontinued due to the high toxicity and corrosiveness of the solution.|$|E

5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the <b>changes</b> <b>from</b> the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, {{it has been found}} that as tissue <b>changes</b> <b>from</b> normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence <b>changes</b> <b>from</b> about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E

Immediately after MD 7, the route interchanges with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Essex near The Centre at Golden Ring. After US 40, I-695 crosses over CSX’s Philadelphia Subdivision {{and comes to}} a partial directional interchange with MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). At this interchange, I-695 turns south onto the Windlass Freeway, crossing over the Northeast Corridor again within the interchange.|$|E

In particular, coral mining, {{agricultural}} and urban runoff, pollution (organic and inorganic), overfishing, blast fishing, disease, and the digging of canals and access into islands and bays are localized threats to coral ecosystems. Broader threats are sea temperature rise, sea level rise and pH <b>changes</b> <b>from</b> ocean acidification, all associated with greenhouse gas emissions.
