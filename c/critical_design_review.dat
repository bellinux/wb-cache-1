5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>review</b> and construction proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary design review {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>review</b> in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

40|$|NASA's {{plan for}} {{enhancing}} space-based research capabilities begins with extended-duration Space Shuttle missions that will double the research capability currently provided by Spacelab and culminate in Space Station Freedom. The 14 -day USML 1 mission flown on the Space Shuttle in June 1992 was {{a space station}} precursor mission, dedicated to microgravity and life science research. Freedom will be a permanent space-based research facility, providing a working environment nearly free of buoyancy-driven convection, sedimentation, and hydrostatic pressure and featuring access to the ultra-high vacuum of space (for external payloads). In its crew-tended phase, Space Station Freedom will provide 40 times Spacelab's capability, and in its permanently occupied phase, Freedom will provide 110 times Spacelab's capability. (The Russian space station, Mir, offers 26 times Spacelab's capabilities.)

500|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1990 McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics {{revealed}} delays and projected cost increases. [...] Due to complications with the composite materials, aircraft weight had increased to 30% over design specification. This was unwelcome for an airplane {{that needed to}} operate efficiently and effectively from an aircraft carrier. Technical difficulties with {{the complexity of the}} radar system to be used also caused costs to increase; by one estimate the A-12 was to consume up to 70% of the Navy's budget for aircraft. [...] After delays, its <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>review</b> was successfully completed in October 1990 and the maiden flight was rescheduled to early 1992.

2500|$|The {{committee}} {{charged that}} the project was [...] "billions of dollars over budget and plagued by poor management". The telescope was originally estimated to cost $1.6bn but the cost estimate grew throughout the early development reaching about $5bn {{by the time the}} mission was formally confirmed for construction start in 2008. In summer 2010, the mission passed its <b>Critical</b> <b>Design</b> <b>Review</b> with excellent grades on all technical matters, but schedule and cost slips at that time prompted Maryland US Senator Barbara Mikulski to call for an independent review of the project. The Independent Comprehensive Review Panel (ICRP) chaired by J. Casani (JPL) found that the earliest possible launch date was in late 2015 at an extra cost of $1.5bn (for a total of $6.5bn). They also pointed out that this would have required extra funding in FY2011 and FY2012 and that any later launch date would lead to a higher total cost. Because the runaway budget diverted funding from other research, the science journal Nature described the James Webb as [...] "the telescope that ate astronomy". However, termination of the JWST project as proposed by the House appropriation committee also would have imperiled funding to other missions, such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} initial {{findings from}} an ongoing research project studying {{the social and}} organizational practices of technical reviews at NASA. Technical reviews are a ubiquitous part of organizational life in most technical organizations, {{and one of the}} most consequential in terms of risk and innovation management. At NASA, a series of formal technical reviews are conducted across the mission lifecycle, including preliminary and <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> in conceptual <b>design</b> as well as launch and flight readiness reviews in mission operations. Additionally, less formal engineering peer reviews are often conducted as pre-cursors to formal reviews. While recent reports at NASA–most prominent the Columbia investigation report–criticize the inadequate practice of technical reviews, little is known about the specific behavioral impacts of review processes. The objective of this research project is to systematically collect much needed empirical data to model the functional and dysfunctional effects of formal and informal technical reviews on work practices, managerial decision making, and organizational culture. We introduce a novel conceptual framework distinguishing formal, documentary reviews and informal, discursive reviews as two substantially different sets of practices. We show how each of these practices inhibit or facilitate effective knowledge sharing between project engineers and external experts. The paper also presents some initial empirical findings supporting this framework. 1 1477...|$|R
40|$|NASA's new Ares Launch Vehicle {{will require}} twelve {{thrusters}} to provide roll {{control of the}} vehicle during the first stage firing. All twelve roll control thrusters will be located at the inter-stage segment that separates the solid rocket booster first stage from the second stage. NASA selected a mono propellant hydrazine solution {{and as a result}} awarded Aerojet-General a contract in 2007 for an advanced development program for an MR- 80 - series 625 Ibf vacuum thrust monopropellant hydrazine thruster. This thruster has heritage dating back to the 1976 Viking Landers and most recently for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory. Prior to the Ares application, the MR- 80 -series thrusters had been equipped with throttle valves and not typically operated in pulse mode. The primary objective of the advanced development program was to increase the technology readiness level and retire major technical risks for the future flight qualification test program. Aerojet built on their heritage MR- 80 rocket engine designs to achieve the design and performance requirements. Significant improvements to cost and lead-time were achieved by applying Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA) principles.

40|$|Medical {{capabilities}} {{aboard the}} International Space Station (ISS) have been packaged to help astronaut crew medical officers (CMO) mitigate both urgent and non-urgent medical issues during their 6 -month expeditions. Two ISS crewmembers are designated as CMOs for each 3 -crewmember mission and are typically not physicians. In addition, the ISS may have communication gaps {{of up to}} 45 minutes during each orbit, necessitating medical equipment that can be reliably operated autonomously during flight. The retirement {{of the space shuttle}} combined with ten years of manned ISS expeditions led the Space Medicine Division at the NASA Johnson Space Center to reassess the current ISS Medical Kit System. This reassessment led to the system being streamlined to meet future logistical considerations with current Russian space vehicles and future NASA/commercial space vehicle systems. Methods The JSC Space Medicine Division coordinated the development of requirements, fabrication of prototypes, and conducted usability testing for the new ISS Medical Kit System in concert with implementing updated versions of the ISS Medical Check List and associated in-flight software applications.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the design and implementation of software solutions for the ground segment of satellite missions, with application to the ESEO mission. The ESEO project is currently in Phase D after successfully passing the preliminary and <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> and the launch is foreseen in 2017. Starting from our experience with ALMASat- 1 mission, we greatly improved the ground systems for a more complex mission like ESEO. One {{of the most important}} improvement is the introduction of a Software Defined Radio with a dedicated software application acting as a transceiver capable of communicating with the on-board transceiver at the registered frequencies and using the defined communication protocol and modulation scheme. It also displays and registers the acquired signal for post-processing tasks. The spacecraft monitoring and control system and the telemetry data visualisation and display tool have been designed keeping in mind the high number of subsystems and payloads and the possibility to re-use the same software for future missions with the minimum effort. The introduction of a connection to a database is essential considering the high number of spacecraft and mission data. This thesis also presents the software solutions designed and implemented for ground stations used by EUMETSAT to operate LEO and GEO weather satellites. The Ground Station Analysis and Reporting tool was developed to allow engineers checking through periodic reports the performance of two ground stations located in Svalbard. The Satellite Passes and Conflicts Engine supports now the schedule of Metop and NOAA satellite passes over Svalbard ground station and {{it can be used to}} compute passes and resolve conflicts of multiple satellites over multiple ground stations based on the propagation of the TLEs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contract}} was to provide optomechanical engineering and fabrication support to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) program {{in the areas of}} mirror, optical bench and camera assemblies of the telescope. The Center for Applied Optics (CAO) worked closely with the Optics and S&E technical staff of MSFC to develop and investigate the most viable and economical options for the design and fabrication of a number of parts for the various telescope assemblies. All the tasks under this delivery order have been successfully completed within budget and schedule. A number of development hardware parts have been designed and fabricated jointly by MSFC and UAH for the engineering model of SXI. The major parts include a nickel electroformed mirror and a mirror mount, plating and coating of the ceramic spacers, and gold plating of the contact rings and fingers for the camera assembly. An aluminum model of the high accuracy sun sensor (HASS) was also designed and fabricated. A number of fiber optic tapers for the camera assembly were also coated with indium tin oxide and phosphor for testing and evaluation by MSFC. A large number of the SXI optical bench parts were also redesigned and simplified for a prototype telescope. These parts include the forward and rear support flanges, front aperture plate, the graphite epoxy optical bench and a test fixture for the prototype telescope. More than fifty (50) drawings were generated for various components of the prototype telescope. Some of these parts were subsequently fabricated at UAH machine shop or at MSFC or by the outside contractors. UAH also provide technical support to MSFC staff for a number of preliminary and <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> <b>reviews.</b> These <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> included PDR and CDR for the mirror assembly by United Technologies Optical Systems (UTOS), and the program quarterly reviews, and SXI PDR and CDR. UAH staff also regularly attended the monthly status reviews, and made a significant number of suggestions to improve the design, assembly and alignment of the telescope. Finally, a high level assembly and alignment plan for the entire telescope was prepared by UAH. This plan addresses the sequence of assembly, the required assembly and alignment tolerances, and the methods to verify the alignment at each step during the assembly process. This assembly and alignment plan will be used to assemble and integrate the engineering model (EM) of the telescope. Later on, based on this plan more detailed assembly and alignment procedures will be developed for the lower-level assemblies of SXI...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{study of}} the {{designer}} plays a <b>critical</b> role in <b>design</b> research. However laboratory based study is often poorly compared and contrasted to practice, leading {{to a lack of}} uptake and subsequent research impact. The importance of addressing this issue is highlighted by its significant influence on design research and many related fields. As such the main aim of this work is to improve empirical design research by characterising the relationship between practice and laboratory-based studies for <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> situations. A <b>review</b> {{of the state of the}} art methods in design research and key related fields is reported. This highlights the importance and commonality of a set or core issues connected to the failure to effectively link study of practice and study in the laboratory. Further to this a technical review and scoping was carried out to establish the most efective capture strategy to be used when studying the designer empirically. Subsequently three studies are reported, forming a three point comparison between practice the laboratory (with student practitioners) and an intermediary case (a laboratory with practitioners). Results from these studies contextualise the critical situations in practice and develop a detailed multi-level comparison between practice and the laboratory which was then validated with respect to a number of existing studies. The primary contribution of this thesis is the development of a detailed multi-level relationship between practice and the laboratory for <b>critical</b> <b>design</b> situations: information seeking, ideation and <b>design</b> <b>review.</b> The second key contribution is the development of a generic method for the empirical study of designers in varying contexts - allowing researchers to build on this work and more effectively link diverse studies together. The final key contribution of this work is the identification of a number of core methodological issues and mitigating techniques affecting both design research and its related fields.
