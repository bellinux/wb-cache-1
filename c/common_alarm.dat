40|$|When maize plants, Zea mays L., are {{mechanically}} {{damaged and}} the damaged sites {{are treated with}} caterpillar regurgitant, the plants will release a specific blend of volatiles. It is known that these volatiles can be attractive to natural enemies of herbivores. We hypothesise that the plant volatiles constitute part of the induced plant defence and that herbivores {{will be affected by}} the odours as well. In laboratory and semi-field studies this hypothesis was tested for the aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) (Rhynchota, Sternorrhyncha, Aphididae). In a Y-tube olfactometer significantly more aphids chose the odour of healthy, undamaged maize seedlings when tested against clean air or plants treated with regurgitant. Clean air was chosen more often when tested next to the odour of treated plants. This apparently repellent effect of the odour of treated plants was significant for winged aphids, but not for the wingless aphids. In field experiments aphids were released in the centre of circles of eight potted maize plants. Four plants in each circle were damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant while the other plants were left unharmed. At different intervals after aphid release, the number of aphids was counted on each plant. Significantly fewer winged and wingless aphids were found back on treated plants than on healthy plants. We suggest that herbivores may be repelled by the odours because they could indicate that: 1) the plant has initiated the production of toxic compounds; 2) potential competitors are present on the plant; 3) the plant is attractive to parasitoids and predators. Aphids may be particularly sensitive to induced maize volatiles because one of the major compounds emitted by the plant is (E) -β-farnesene, which is a <b>common</b> <b>alarm</b> pheromone for aphids. Collections and analyses of the odours emitted by crushed R. maidis confirmed that it too emits (E) -β-farnesene when stressed. The results are discussed in context of plant defence strategies and their possible exploitation for the control of pest insects...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{test and}} treat {{strategy}} for Helicobacter pylori infection has raised some concern since young gastric cancer patients {{may have no}} alarm symptoms. In this study the frequency of alarm symptoms was assessed {{in a series of}} young gastric cancer patients, as well as the impact of absence of alarm symptoms on delay in diagnosis and stage of gastric cancer at diagnosis and survival. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out on 92 gastric cancer patients < or = 45 years of age identified from databases in four hospitals between January 1985 and December 2001. Characteristics analysed included duration and features of dyspeptic symptoms, presence of alarm symptoms, time interval from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, pTNM stage and survival. RESULTS: Of the 92 patients, 54 (58. 7 %) presented uncomplicated dyspepsia and 38 (41. 3 %) alarm symptoms. In those with uncomplicated dyspepsia, epigastric pain was the most common complaint (64. 1 %) followed by vomiting (30. 4 %), heartburn and nausea. Weight loss was the most <b>common</b> <b>alarm</b> symptom (30. 4 %), followed by anorexia (10. 9 %), dysphagia or anaemia (7. 6 %). The mean delay from first symptoms to final diagnosis was 16. 8 +/- 13. 9 weeks in patients with alarm symptoms and 29. 3 +/- 39. 9 weeks in patients without alarm symptoms (P:ns). Patients without alarm symptoms showed significantly less aggressive gastric cancer compared to patients with alarm symptoms in relation to TNM stage and survival (cumulative 5 -year survival rate: 76 % versus 49 % P: 0. 01). The survival rate, at 5 years, of patients without alarm symptoms, and with a history of dyspepsia of more than 24 weeks, was higher than that in patients with early diagnosis (93. 4 % versus 66. 5 %: P: 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of young gastric cancer patients present without alarm symptoms. Despite the delay in diagnosis, these patients have a better outcome than those with alarm symptoms. Thus the delay in diagnosis of patients without alarm symptoms does not affect survival...|$|E

40|$|Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a {{well known}} precancerous condition. Late {{diagnosis}} of cancer in CD often occurs and the prognosis is poor. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the relationship between clinical presentation and diagnosis of intestinal adenocarcinoma in CD. Patients and methods: Medical records of 12 consecutive patients with intestinal adenocarcinoma in CD and of 79 consecutive CD patients undergoing bowel surgery from 2004 till 2008 were reviewed. Gender, age, disease duration, phenotype and localization, familiarity for colorectal cancer, weight loss, overt rectal bleeding, urgency, vomiting, obstruc- tion, fever, abdominal mass at palpation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucorrhea and urinary symptoms were analyzed as possible predictors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: Ten men and 2 women underwent surgery for intestinal cancer in CD with a median age of 50 years (31 - 68). Carcinomas were localized in the terminal ileum in 4 cases, right colon in 3, transverse colon in 1, sigmoid colon in 1, rectum in 2 and an anorectal fistula in 1. Only 3 patients were pre-operatively diagnosed with cancer while the others had a post-operative diagnosis. At diagnosis only 3 (25 %) patients presented with AJCC stage II cancer while 4 (33 %) presented with stage III and 5 (42 %) with stage IV. Rectal bleeding (OR 0. 385 (95 % CI 0. 077 - 1. 926), p= 0. 20) and weight loss (OR 0. 667 (95 % CI 0. 313 - 1. 418), p= 0. 17) were unrelated to cancer diagnosis. At univariate analysis age, fever, obstruction, diarrhea and vomiting resulted to be significantly associated to cancer diagnosis. At multivariate analysis only age (OR 1. 057 (95 % CI 0. 999 - 1. 107), p= 0. 05) and obstruction (OR 6. 530 (95 % CI 1. 533 - 27. 806), p= 0. 01) significantly predicted cancer diagnosis. Discussion: In CD, rectal bleeding, the most <b>common</b> <b>alarm</b> symptom for intestinal cancer, is not useful for an early diagnosis. CD patients presenting with an older age and obstruction should be thoroughly investigated to rule out neoplastic lesions. Early diagnosis of intestinal cancer remains a clinical challenge in CD...|$|E

The cell phone {{now has a}} multiform identity: it may become a portable computer, dedicated to professional customers; sometimes it has a few predetermined keys to allow easy use for other consumers (e. g., elderly individuals); it can take on multiple forms for entertainment and communication among young people. At the same time, the use functions have multiplied {{and there has been}} technological convergence with other media (computer, television and the Internet) : besides the basics of mobile telephoning, at present the mobile phone manages short message services (SMS), multimedia messaging services (MMS), music, video games, software for professionals, photo camera, video camera, television programs, movies, and information. It supports every kind of accessory function, from the more <b>common</b> (<b>alarm,</b> calculator, etc.) to the more original: it becomes an audio guide to visit museums, a navigator for motorists, or a book narrator (downloading digital recordings of famous texts). Product design can vary from a valuable luxury item to a trendy cell phone for teenagers. It satisfies needs for relationships, but also security and affiliation; it has created new languages and new rules for community membership and interactivity. On the demand side, the evolution of mobile communication consumption is an overwhelming phenomenon, as reported in the recent international literature. In Italy, recent investigations show increasing use of the cell phone against a general dip in purchases. This paper explores the Italian demand for mobile phones {{through the use of a}} multidimensional segmentation approach. In particular, it poses the following questions: (1) Do differences exist among Italian mobile phones users leading to the identification of different market segments? (2) More specifically, is it possible and useful to describe them adopting a multidimensional approach? Thus, it aims to contribute to a better understanding of consumer behavior in Italy, by investigating the characteristics of cell phone users. A multidimensional segmentation approach was adopted, using concurrently three sets of variables: consumer/user lifestyles, use motivations and product/service attributes. Data on a national sample (1067 individuals) were collected and factor and cluster analysis were then performed on the database. The study led to the identification of three user segments, each with a diverse combination of the segmentation variables. Findings provide implications for the mobile telecommunication industry and could suggest strategic choices to mobile operators—especially cell phone producers—and constitute the basis for their strategic positioning...|$|E

40|$|Episyrphus balteatus DeGeer (Diptera, Syrphidae) is an {{abundant}} and efficient aphid-specific predator. We tested the electroantennographic (EAG) response of this syrphid {{fly to the}} <b>common</b> aphid <b>alarm</b> pheromone, (E) -beta-farnesene (E beta F), and to several plant volatiles, including terpenoids (mono- and sesquiterpenes) and green leaf volatiles (C 6 and C 9 alcohols and aldehydes). Monoterpenes evoked significant EAG responses, whereas sesquiterpenes were inactive, except for the aphid alarm pheromone (E beta F). The most pronounced antennal responses were elicited by six and nine carbon green leaf alcohols and aldehydes [i. e., (Z) - 3 -hexenol, (E) - 2 -hexenol, (E) - 2 -hexenal, and hexanal]. To investigate the behavioral activity {{of some of these}} EAG-active compounds, E. balteatus females were exposed to R-(+) -limonene (monoterpene), (Z) - 3 -hexenol (green leaf alcohol), and E beta F (sesquiterpene, <b>common</b> aphid <b>alarm</b> pheromone). A single E. balteatus gravid female was exposed for 10 min to an aphid-free Vicia faba plant that was co-located with a semiochemical dispenser. Without additional semiochemical, hoverfly females were not attracted to this plant, and no oviposition was observed. The monoterpene R-(+) -limonene did not affect the females' foraging behavior, whereas (Z) - 3 -hexenol and E beta F increased the time of flight and acceptance of the host plant. Moreover, these two chemicals induced oviposition on aphid-free plants, suggesting that selection of the oviposition site by predatory hoverflies relies on the perception of a volatile blend composed of prey pheromone and typical plant green leaf volatiles.

However, these manuals are lengthy and difficult to use, particularly in emergencies. We aim {{to assess the impact}} of targeted education on warnings and errors in improving competency to troubleshoot the alarms. Methods Twenty-one patients, with a median age of 13, were recruited over a 5 -month period. Each patient had 2 study visits. The frequencies and types of alarms were recorded, and patients were given a summary sheet that outlined <b>common</b> <b>alarms</b> encountered and troubleshooting tips. In visit 2, the frequencies and types of alarms were compared to those of visit 1. The patients were asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the education session given in visit 1, their level of competency in decrypting alarm codes, and their promptness in responding to alarms. Results Low cartridge (W 1), low battery (W 2), and bolus cancelled (W 8) were the commonest warnings. The most noted errors were occlusion (E 4), power interruption (E 8), empty battery (E 2), set not primed (E 11), and cartridge empty (E 1). The numbers of warning and error signals markedly decreased after targeted education (P< 0. 05). The ability in decrypting warning signals significantly improved (P= 0. 02), and the frequency of response to pump alarms significantly increased (P= 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Reporting of {{symptoms}} which may signal {{cancer is the}} first step in the diagnostic pathway of cancer diseases. Cancer <b>alarm</b> symptoms are <b>common</b> in the general population. Public awareness and knowledge of cancer symptoms are sparse, however, and many people do not seek medical help when having possible cancer symptoms. As social inequality is associated with cancer knowledge, cancer awareness, and information-seeking, our hypothesis is that social inequality may also exist in the general population with respect to reporting of cancer alarm symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations between socioeconomic and demographic determinants and reporting of <b>common</b> cancer <b>alarm</b> symptoms. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was performed based on a stratified sample of the Danish general population. A total of 13 777 randomly selected persons aged 20 years and older participated. Our main outcome measures were weighted prevalence estimates of self-reporting one of the following cancer alarm symptoms during the preceding 12 months: a lump in the breast, coughing for more than 6 weeks, seen blood in urine, or seen blood in stool. Logistic regression models were used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for the associations between each covariate and reporting of cancer alarm symptoms. Results A total of 2 098 (15. 7 %) of the participants reported one or more cancer alarm symptoms within the preceding 12 months. Women, subjects out of the workforce, and subjects with a cancer diagnosis had statistically significantly higher odds of reporting one or more cancer alarm symptoms. Subjects with older age and subjects living with a partner had lower odds of reporting one or more cancer alarm symptoms.

Aim: To evaluate and compare the body mass index in school children from 06 to 10 years, both sexes in a municipal school from Cuiabá-MT. Materials and Methods: The study included 234 children aged between 06 and 10 years, of both sexes, regularly enrolled and attending a public school in Cuiabá-MT. Body mass and height was evaluated, and, subsequently calculated the body mass index (BMI) and corresponding percentile. Results: There was no statistical difference between body mass (p= 0. 47), height (p= 0. 68), BMI (p= 0. 17) and percentile (0. 52) compared girls and boys. There was a higher prevalence of normal weight in both groups and for all age-groups, except for girls aged 10 years, with 36. 4 % (n= 12) normal weight and 39. 4 % (n= 13) obese.

40|$|Animal signals {{function}} to elicit behaviors in receivers that ultimately benefit the signaler, while receivers should {{respond in a}} way that maximizes their own fitness. However, the best response may be difficult for receivers to determine when unreliable signaling is <b>common.</b> “Deceptive” <b>alarm</b> calling is <b>common</b> among tufted capuchins (Cebus apella nigritus) in competitive feeding contexts, and responding to these calls is costly. Receivers should thus vary their responses based on whether a call is likely to be reliable. If capuchins are indeed able to assess reliability, I predicted that receivers will be less likely to respond to alarms that are given during competitive feeding contexts than in noncompetitive contexts, and, within feeding contexts, that individuals inside or adjacent to a food patch will be less likely to respond to alarms than those further from the resource. I tested these predictions in a group of wild capuchins by observing the reactions of focal animals to alarm calls in both noncompetitive contexts and experimental feeding contexts. Antipredator escape reactions, but not vigilance reactions, occurred significantly less often in competitive feeding contexts than in noncompetitive contexts and individuals adjacent to food patches were more likely to respond to alarm calls than were those inside or further from food patches. Although not all predictions were fully supported, the findings demonstrate that receivers vary their behavior {{in a way that}} minimizes the costs associated with “deceptive” alarms, but {{further research is needed to}} determine whether or not this can be attributed to counterdeception...|$|R
