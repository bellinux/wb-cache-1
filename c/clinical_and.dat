40|$|Abstract. <b>Clinical</b> {{pharmacology}} <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacy {{bring together}} professionals who have fi rm grounding in {{the principles of}} drug therapy and who aim to improve the safety and effi cacy of treat-ments for the benefi ts of patients. However, there are clear diff erences, typically in the undergraduate and less prominent in postgraduate education. <b>Clinical</b> pharmacologists <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacists are accountable for the same target groups. <b>Clinical</b> pharmacology <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacy share similar and parallel development, history, the same goal and the same fi nancial resources (they compete for the same fi nancial sources). As an academic discipline, Clinical Pharmacology has been developed over the past 40 years, but its impact on health care services has been less conspicuous. Clinical pharmacy has had a quicker and more coordinated development in health care services dominated and synchronized by the American College of Clinical Pharmacy, but a less notable advance as academic discipline. Collaboration between <b>clinical</b> pharmacology <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacy should be possible. In practice, competition and domination of one group can always be discerned depending on the country or {{the area of the}} country. Clinical pharmacology- clinical pharmacy collaboration is important for the benefi t of patients, educa-tion, authorities <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacology <b>and</b> <b>clinical</b> pharmacy associations <b>and</b> development...|$|R

5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based either on <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell). Some tumours {{are difficult to}} classify and have features overlapping more than one category. High grade endometroid tumours in particular tend to have both type I and type II features.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> electrophysiological findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable <b>clinical</b> <b>and</b> pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
