25|$|Goto and Nagumo {{once more}} {{assemble}} the original Section 2 members {{in an abandoned}} subway passage as they embark on a secret operation to apprehend Yukihito Tsuge, a former GSDF officer who planned the terrorist attacks as revenge {{for the failure of}} a UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia back in 1999. With the threat of US intervention looming unless the government controls the situation, the team uses an old stretch of the Ginza Line to approach an artificial island Tsuge uses as his hideout. Goto also takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> on his end by facilitating the arrest of Shigeki Arakawa, a GSDF intelligence agent who is actually one of Tsuge's cohorts. After a fierce fight inside the artificial island's tunnel which results in flooding, the team evacuates the tunnel while Nagumo breaks through to finally arrest Tsuge.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} balance that has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things?</b> The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E
25|$|Lady Cripps {{returned}} to England with her sick grandson. Just before Christmas 1962, Joe {{was released from}} prison and allowed to return to legal practice. The anxieties of the final years of the Nkrumah regime were relieved in 1966, by the coup that ousted Nkrumah. In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> on the home front. She kept an eye on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

500|$|Johnson, alive but injured, is {{spying on}} his own home, {{watching}} Briggs visit Shelly. Shelly is terrified that Johnson will return and kill her; but Briggs reassures her he will take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> Johnson is also listening to a police radio in his truck, and hears that Renault's myna bird is being considered a witness as its ability to mimic speech might provide a clue; he drives off immediately. That night, he shoots the bird dead through the sheriff station's window. However, a voice-activated tape recorder had been left by the bird's cage; Cooper is {{able to find the}} words [...] "Leo, no!" [...] among the phrases it had repeated that evening.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, they {{discover}} {{the identity of}} one of the dead robbers, Blake, and learn of his abandoned apartment. Fauxlivia goes to the apartment alone without alerting Peter, but Peter soon joins her. The two find that Blake had a roommate, likely the third man, but he is nowhere to be seen. That night, while at Olivia's apartment, Fauxlivia studies Olivia's case files, and comments of her prime counterpart, [...] "You have a photographic memory. How am I gonna do that?" [...] indicating that she does not possess this ability. A moment later she is visited by the third man, Joe (Russell Harvard), who had seen Fauxlivia at Blake's apartment and, believing her to be a cop, brought the item stolen from the Milton home - a small box. Fauxlivia finds Joe is deaf, and thus was unaffected by the ultrasonics of the box. Fauxlivia contacts Newton, who collects the box [...] having originally hired the men to collect it for him [...] and offers to kill the deaf man. Fauxlivia tells him she will take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> herself and shoots the deaf man. While hiding the body, Peter arrives to talk to her. To distract him and prevent him from noticing a pool of blood seeping under the bathroom door, Fauxlivia engages in romantic actions with Peter.|$|E
500|$|Salander is a {{computer}} hacker who has survived severe emotional and sexual abuse. The character was a [...] "vulnerable victim-turned-vigilante with the [...] "take-no-prisoners" [...] attitude of Lara Croft and the [...] "cool, unsentimental intellect" [...] of Spock. Fincher felt that Salander's eccentric persona was enthralling, and stated, [...] "there's a kind of wish fulfillment {{to her in the}} way that she takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> the way she will only put up with so much, but there are other sides to her as well." [...] Casting was complicated by the raft of prominent candidates such as Natalie Portman, Ellen Page, Kristen Stewart, Emily Browning, Jennifer Lawrence, Keira Knightley, Anne Hathaway, Olivia Thirlby, Scarlett Johansson, and Emma Watson. Despite the hype, some eventually withdrew from consideration due to the time commitment and low pay. Mara had worked with Fincher in his 2010 film The Social Network. Fincher, while fond of the actress' youthful appearance, found it difficult at first to mold her to match Salander's antisocial demeanor, which was a vast contrast from her earlier role as the submissive Erica. Mara went through multiple changes in her appearance to become Salander. Her hair was dyed black and cut into various jagged points, giving the appearance that she cut it herself. In addition to her transgressive appearance, which was described as a [...] "mash-up of brazen Seventies punk and spooky Eighties goth with a dash of S temptress" [...] by Lynn Hirschberg of W, Mara participated in a formal screening and was filmed by Fincher on a subway in Los Angeles in an effort to persuade the executives of Sony Pictures that she was a credible choice.|$|E

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> {{in the cosmos}} or that he does not, and, if he does take care, that it is either <b>of</b> all <b>things</b> or <b>of</b> some. Now if he takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything, {{there would be no}} {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. On the other hand, if he takes <b>care</b> <b>of</b> only some <b>things,</b> why does he take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have taken <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> <b>of</b> which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the <b>things</b> in the cosmos.|$|R
