50|$|Although such {{material}} {{could be}} worked at low temperatures {{to produce the}} striated Damascene pattern of intermixed ferrite and cementite bands in a manner identical to pattern-welded Damascus steel, any heat treatment sufficient to dissolve the carbides would permanently destroy the pattern. However, Verhoeven and Pendray discovered that in samples of true Damascus steel, the Damascene pattern could be recovered by aging at a moderate temperature. They found that certain <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> elements, {{one of which was}} vanadium, did not disperse until the steel reached higher temperatures than those needed to dissolve the carbides. Therefore, a high heat treatment could remove the visual evidence of patterning associated with carbides but did not remove the underlying patterning of the <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> elements; a subsequent lower-temperature heat treatment, at a temperature at which the carbides were again stable, could recover the structure by the binding of carbon by those elements.|$|E
50|$|Alloying {{elements}} {{are added to}} achieve certain properties in the material. As a guideline, alloying {{elements are}} added in lower percentages (less than 5%) to increase strength or hardenability, or in larger percentages (over 5%) to achieve special properties, such as corrosion resistance or extreme temperature stability.Manganese, silicon, or aluminum are added during the steelmaking process to remove dissolved oxygen, sulfur and phosphorus from the melt.Manganese, silicon, nickel, and copper are added to increase strength by forming solid solutions in ferrite. Chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten increase strength by forming second-phase carbides. Nickel and copper improve corrosion resistance in small quantities. Molybdenum helps to resist embrittlement. Zirconium, cerium, and calcium increase toughness by controlling the shape of inclusions. Sulfur ({{in the form of}} manganese sulfide) lead, bismuth, selenium, and tellurium increase machinability.The alloying elements tend to form either solid solutions or compounds or carbides. Nickel is very soluble in ferrite; therefore, it forms compounds, usually Ni3Al. Aluminium dissolves in the ferrite and forms the compounds Al2O3 and AlN. Silicon is also very soluble and usually forms the compound SiO2•MxOy. Manganese mostly dissolves in ferrite forming the compounds MnS, MnO•SiO2, but will also form carbides in the form of (Fe,Mn)3C. Chromium forms partitions between the ferrite and carbide phases in steel, forming (Fe,Cr3)C, Cr7C3, and Cr23C6. The type of carbide that chromium forms depends on the amount of carbon and other types of alloying elements present. Tungsten and molybdenum form carbides if there is enough carbon and an absence of stronger <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> elements (i.e., titanium & niobium), they form the carbides W2C and Mo2C, respectively. Vanadium, titanium, and niobium are strong <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> elements, forming vanadium carbide, titanium carbide, and niobium carbide, respectively.Alloying elements also {{have an effect on the}} eutectoid temperature of the steel. Manganese and nickel lower the eutectoid temperature and are known as austenite stabilizing elements. With enough of these elements the austenitic structure may be obtained at room temperature. Carbide-forming elements raise the eutectoid temperature; these elements are known as ferrite stabilizing elements.|$|E

40|$|Diamond {{reinforced}} metal-matrix composites (MMCs) are utilised for cutting, drilling, grinding {{and polishing}} a variety of materials, in many cases being the most efficient and economic choice. The increased cost of synthetic diamond abrasives has led to constant search for ways to extent diamond tool life. This has been realised by introducing chemical reactions at the interfaces {{in order to develop}} chemical bridges between diamonds and metals that prolong the retention of crystals at the operating surfaces of the tools. Alloying the matrix with <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> metals is a way to introduce interfacial reactivity, but involves problems with concentrating the alloying element at the interfacial region and may cause alteration of the wear resistance characteristics of the binder, which may be an undesirable effect. A recent development and alternative method to alloying is the coating of the diamonds with <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> metals, offering unique advantages. Although metal-coated diamonds are commercially available, the effectiveness of their usage and the understanding of interfacial phenomena occurring in composites reinforced with such abrasives still remain unexplored. The work carried out in this research has examined the interfacial bonding in diamond MMCs reinforced with metal-coated crystals. The work described in this thesis included a preliminary study on diamond/metal reactivity serving the need to identify the mode and intensity at which synthetic diamonds and elemental metals interact at various conditions. This was achieved by examining the changes occurring to diamond surfaces when crystals were heated in the presence of various elemental metals. The latter were brought in contact with the diamonds either in the form of loose or hot-pressed metallic powders or in the form of thin metal coatings deposited onto the crystals by vapour deposition methods. Results showed that metals, depending on their electronic configuration, either catalyse the graphitisation of diamond surfaces and dissolve carbon or react at the diamond surfaces to form carbide crystallites. Dissolution of the diamond occurred by formation of oriented hexagonal/triangular and rectangular pits on octahedral { 111 } and cubic { 100 } surfaces respectively. Intensity of interactions strongly depended on heating temperature and time. Metal coatings were found to efficiently react with the diamonds only after annealing at temperatures of the order of 1000 °C subsequent to the deposition. The diamond impregnated MMCs investigated in this research were reinforced with various types of metal-coated and metal-powder encapsulated diamonds of the <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> metals of Ti, Cr and W. The tested composites included two types of metal-matrices that of standard plain cobalt as well as some selected alloyed matrices typically employed in practice. Interfacial bonding characterisation and assessment of the potential capability of the metal-coatings to offer enhanced diamond retention has been made by determining the mechanical properties of the composites and by conducting extensive microscopic analysis of the developed fracture surfaces. The results suggested that incorporating metal-coated crystals could be beneficial in improving the diamond retention, provided that consolidation temperature is sufficiently high to favour diamond/metal reactions. Results showed improvements in mechanical properties to be achieved when reinforcing with the coated diamonds compared to non-coated grit. The characteristics of the interactions at the diamond surfaces in the composites conformed to the findings of the preliminary study on the fundamentals of diamond/metals interactions. Reactions on crystal surfaces took place at the locations where prior dissolution of the diamond had occurred. Metal coatings were found to provide excellent protection to the diamonds against catalysed dissolution by aggressive binders. Thin coatings suffered from loss of continuity in systems were the coating metal atoms were readily soluble in the metal-matrix. This was avoided with thicker coatings that also appeared to provide a supplementary mechanical effect in addition to the chemical bonding in improving the retention of the diamond crystals. Encapsulation of diamond with <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> metals was a hybrid method between alloying the metal-matrix and coating the crystals. Although encapsulation provided sufficient levels of chemical interactions, it was shown that diamonds could not be efficiently protected from aggressive binders. In addition, composites impregnated with powder-encapsulated diamonds suffered from inadequate sintering of the <b>carbide</b> <b>forming</b> metal zones surrounding the crystals when consolidation was performed at relatively low temperatures which was reflected in inferior mechanical properties.

The results showed that at 700 °C, all the alloys were twice as oxidation resistant as the type- 304 alloy (i. e., the experimental alloys showed weight gains about half that of type- 304). Surprisingly, at 800 °C, alloys that contained both Al and Si additions were less oxidation resistant than the type- 304 alloy. However, alloys containing only Si additions were significantly more oxidation resistant than the type 304 alloys (i. e., showed weight gains 4 times less than the type- 304 alloy). Further, alloys with only Si additions pre-oxidized at 800 °C, showed zero weight gain in subsequent testing for 1000 hours at 700 °C. This implies the potential for producing in-situ protective coating for these alloys.
