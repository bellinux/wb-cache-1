40|$|To {{test the}} <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> model of {{isochromosome}} formation, we have defined the breakpoints of cytogenetically monocentric and dicentric Xq isochromosomes (i(Xq)) from Turner syndrome probands, using FISH with cosmids and YACs {{derived from a}} contig spanning proximal Xp. Seven different pericentromeric breakpoints were identified, with 10 of 11 of the i(Xq) s containing varying amounts of material from Xp. Only {{one of the eight}} cytogenetically monocentric i(Xq) s demonstrated a single alpha-satellite (DXZ 1) signal, consistent with classical models involving <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision.</b> The remaining seven were inconsistent with such a model and had breakpoints that spanned proximal Xp 11. 21 : one was between DXZ 1 and the most proximal marker, ZXDA; one occurred between the duplicated genes, ZXDA and ZXDB; two were approximately 2 Mb from DXZ 1; two were adjacent to ALAS 2 located 3. 5 Mb from DXZ 1; and the largest had a breakpoint just distal to DXS 1013 E, indicating the inclusion of 8 Mb of Xp DNA between centromeres. The three cytologically dicentric i(Xq) s had breakpoints distal to DXS 423 E in Xp 11. 22 and therefore contained > or = 12 Mb of DNA between centromeres. These data demonstrate that the majority of breakpoints resulting in i(Xq) formation are in band Xp 11. 2 and not in the centromere itself. Therefore, we hypothesize that the predominant mechanism of i(Xq) formation involves sequences in the proximal short arm that are prone to breakage and reunion events between sister chromatids or homologous X chromosomes...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{individuals}} with an i(Xq) or idic(Xq) were studied using RFLP analysis {{in order to}} determine both parental origin and extent of heterozygosity of the isochromosome and to search for the presence of short-arm material. In five cases the isochromosome was paternally derived, while nine patients had a maternal i(Xq). The analysis of heterozygosity of the nine maternally derived isochromosomes by using Xq markers showed heterozygosity in two cases, suggesting an origin from two homologous X chromosomes. Homozygosity was found at all informative loci in seven cases, which therefore are probably the product of either <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> or sister-chromatid exchange. Presence of Xp markers was seen both in the three i(Xq) chromosomes which appeared dicentric by cytogenetic analysis and in three additional cytogenetically monocentric cases. Mean parental ages were greater for the maternally derived cases as compared with the paternally derived cases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background B {{chromosomes}} (Bs) are dispensable elements which {{occur in}} many species including rye (Secale cereale). We determined {{the organization of}} B variants to obtain insights into the origin of B polymorphisms in rye. Results The observed B variants were classified according to their morphology and in situ hybridization patterns with the B-specific repeats D 1100 and CL 11 into (I) long arm iso B, (II) D 1100 -deficient B and (III) small metacentric B variants. Long arm iso Bs are likely products of a meiotic <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> and subsequent duplication of the long arm, whereas small B variants are probably generated by chromosome breakage. Some deficient Bs experienced extensive amplification of CL 11 repeats. Conclusions Both the pericentromere and the nondisjunction control region seem {{to be involved in}} the generation of rye B chromosome variants. However, due to the loss of the B-specific nondisjuction control region most of the variants generated are not capable to accumulate in a population. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{centromere}} of eukaryotic chromosomes {{is essential}} for the faithful segregation and inheritance of genetic information. In the majority of eukaryotic species, centromeres are associated with highly repetitive DNA, and as a consequence, the boundary for a functional centromere is difficult to define. In this study, we demonstrate that the centers of rice centromeres are occupied by a 155 -bp satellite repeat, CentO, and a centromere-specific retrotransposon, CRR. The CentO satellite is located within the chromosomal regions to which the spindle fibers attach. CentO is quantitatively variable among the 12 rice centromeres, ranging from 65 kb to 2 Mb, and is interrupted irregularly by CRR elements. The break points of 14 rice <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> events were mapped {{to the middle of the}} CentO arrays, suggesting that the CentO satellite is located within the functional domain of rice centromeres. Our results demonstrate that the CentO satellite may be a key DNA element for rice centromere function...|$|E
40|$|The {{centromere}} of the maize (Zea mays) B chromosome contains several megabases of a B-specific repeat (ZmBs), a 156 -bp satellite repeat (CentC), and centromere-specific retrotransposons (CRM elements). Here, we {{demonstrate that}} {{only a small fraction of}} the ZmBs repeats interacts with CENH 3, the histone H 3 variant specific to centromeres. CentC, which marks the CENH 3 -associated chromatin in maize A centromeres, is restricted to an ∼ 700 -kb domain within the larger context of the ZmBs repeats. The breakpoints of five B <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> derivatives are mapped within this domain. In addition, the fraction of this domain remaining after misdivision correlates well with the quantity of CENH 3 on the centromere. Thus, the functional boundaries of the B centromere are mapped to a relatively small CentC- and CRM-rich region that is embedded within multimegabase arrays of the ZmBs repeat. Our results demonstrate that the amount of CENH 3 at the B centromere can be varied, but with decreasing amounts, the function of the centromere becomes impaired...|$|E
40|$|B {{chromosome}} {{variation in}} nine Moroccan {{populations of the}} grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans was analysed for 3 consecutive years. In addition to B 1, which was the predominant B chromosome in all nine populations, we found 15 other B variants, albeit at very low frequency. Eight variants were found in adults caught in the wild, four appeared in adults reared in the laboratory and seven were found in embryo progeny of controlled crosses between a 0 B male and a B-carrying female. Some variants were found {{in more than one}} kind of material. At least the seven B variants that appeared in embryo progeny of females carrying a different B type arose de novo through mutation of the maternal B chromosome. The mutation rate of B chromosomes was 0. 73 %, on average, which explains the high variety of morphs and banding patterns found. The most frequent de novo mutations observed in these chromosomes were <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision</b> with or without chromatid nondisjunction, which generates iso-B-chromosomes or telocentric Bs, respectively, as well as translocations with A and B chromosomes and deletions. But the whole variation observed, including that found in adult individuals, suggests that other mutations such as duplications, inversions and centric fusions do usually affect B chromosomes. Finally, B chromosome mutation rate was remarkably similar in both Moroccan and Spanish populations, which suggests that it might be dependent on B chromosome intrinsic factors...|$|E
40|$|Supernumerary marker {{chromosomes}} (SMCs) are common, {{but their}} molecular content and mechanism of origin {{are often not}} precisely characterized. We analyzed all centromere regions to identify the junction between the unique chromosome arm and the pericentromeric repeats. A molecular-ruler clone panel for each chromosome arm was developed and used {{for the design of}} a custom oligonucleotide array. Of 27 nonsatellited SMCs analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), seven (approximately 26 %) were shown to be unique sequence negative. Of the 20 unique-sequence-positive SMCs, the average unique DNA content was approximately 6. 5 Mb (range 0. 3 – 22. 2 Mb) and 33 known genes (range 0 – 149). Of the 14 informative nonacrocentric SMCs, five (approximately 36 %) contained unique DNA from both the p and q arms, whereas nine (approximately 64 %) contained unique DNA from only one arm. The latter cases are consistent with ring-chromosome formation by <b>centromere</b> <b>misdivision,</b> as first described by McClintock in maize. In one case, a r(4) containing approximately 4. 4 Mb of unique DNA from 4 p was also present in the proband's mother. However, FISH revealed a cryptic deletion in one chromosome 4 and reduced alpha satellite in the del(4) and r(4), indicating that the mother was a balanced ring and deletion carrier. Our data, and recent reports in the literature, suggest that this “McClintock mechanism” of small-ring formation might be the predominant mechanism of origin. Comprehensive analysis of SMCs by aCGH and FISH can distinguish unique-negative from unique-positive cases, determine the precise gene content, and provide information on mechanism of origin, inheritance, and recurrence risk...|$|E
