5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator that captures prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic <b>cutlassfish</b> (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E

5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and <b>cutlassfishes,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion.

Off Tunisia, crustaceans are the second-most common prey taken after teleosts. Off Australia, this species consumes mostly teleosts, with smaller individuals taking mainly Lepidorhynchus denticulatus and larger individuals taking increasing numbers of snake mackerels and <b>cutlassfishes.</b> It is a strong-swimming species, with feeding and activity level increasing at night.

40|$|Age {{and growth}} of two species of <b>cutlassfishes,</b> Trichiurus spp. (Trichiuridae), from the South China Sea were examined. Between December 1996 and November 1997, 1495 {{specimens}} were collected from coastal waters near Hong Kong. Two species, Trichiurus lepturus and T. nanhaiensis, were harvested and ages of specimens were estimated by using transverse sections of the sagittal otoliths. Opaque growth rings were verified to have formed annually during February. Lee's phenomenon was not observed for either species, although T. lepturus tended to display reverse Lee's phenomenon. Otolith weight was linearly related to age, and accounted for about 72 % and 76 % {{of the variation in}} age (t) for T. lepturus and ir: nanhaiensis, respectively, comparable to the von Bertalanffy growth models in preanal length (PL). For older fish, otolith weight provided a more precise estimate of age than preanal length. Preanal length and age were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth model by nonlinear regression, resulting in PL (mm) = 5891 - e[- 0. 168 ((t + 2. 682) ]) (T. lepturus); PL (mm) = 6021 - e([- 0. 207 (t + 2. 044)) (T. nanhaiensis).

50|$|Although often {{considered}} a single highly widespread species, {{it has been}} argued that it is a species complex that includes several species with the main groups being in the Atlantic (Atlantic <b>cutlassfish),</b> East Pacific (Pacific <b>cutlassfish),</b> Indo-Pacific and Northwest Pacific (Japanese <b>cutlassfish).</b> If split, the Atlantic would retain the scientific name T. lepturus. The Northwest Pacific (Sea of Japan and East China Sea) differs in morphometrics, meristics and genetics, and is sometimes recognized as T. japonicus. Morphometric and meristic differences have also been shown in the population of the East Pacific (California to Peru), leading some to recognize it as T. nitens. Additional studies are required on the possible separation and nomenclature of the Indo-Pacific populations, but based on mtDNA there are three species in this region: T. japonicus (marginal in the region, see range above), T. lepturus (West Pacific; the species also found in the Atlantic) and the final preliminarily referred to as Trichiurus sp. 2 (Indian Ocean, and East and South China Seas). The names T. coxii and T. haumela have been used for the populations off Australia and in the Indo-Pacific, respectively, but firm evidence supporting their validity as species is lacking.|$|E

In a 12 mo sampling period between December 1996 and November 1997, 1495 specimens of T. lepturus and T. nanhaiensis were collected from Hong Kong coastal waters. Spawning period and reproductive cycle were studied by checking the temporal profile of the Relative Gonadal Index/Gonosomatic Index, and by examining ovaries macroscopically and whole oocytes microscopically. All 3 methods provided similar results: the spawning periods of T. lepturus and T, nanhaiensis were March to June and April to August, respectively Both species were found to practice group-synchronous spawning and mature females are capable of spawning more than once each spawning season. The mean preanal lengths at sexual maturity of T. lepturus and T, nanhaiensis females were 255 and 282 mm respectively. The sex ratios of both species were significantly different from 1 : 1 among different sampling months, and different age and size ranges...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on two piscivore species of <b>cutlassfishes</b> (Trichiuridae) that show some degree of {{differences}} in morphology of the jaw system: Aphanopus carbo and Trichiurus lepturus. As studies dealing with myological features of A. carbo and T. lepturus are presently lacking, we first provide {{a detailed description of}} the head musculature of A. carbo and T. lepturus. Secondly, {{we focus on}} the mechanics of the mouth closing system of these trichiurids by using biomechanical modelling. More specifically, models allows us to: (1) describe the differences between how the lower jaw lever system works during mouth closure and during generating static bite force; (2) evaluate the effects of morphological change on the performance of both functions; (3) determine whether the configuration of each component of the lower jaw lever system is a compromise between both functions, or whether there is a partition of function (optimization for either hard biting or fast jaw closing) between the different parts of the jaw closing musculature; and (4) discuss the dynamical implications of having elongate jaws for capturing prey. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 152, 717 – 736.
