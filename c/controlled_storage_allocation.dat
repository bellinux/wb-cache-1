We propose that this model of file system behavior is a relic of the past, when disk storage was a scarce resource.

Applications like information filtering and dynamic environments like the Internet require inverted files to be updated efficiently. Recently, extensible inverted files are proposed {{which can be}} used for fast online indexing. The effective <b>storage</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme for such inverted files uses the arrival rate to preallocate storage. In this article, this <b>storage</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme is improved by using information about both the arrival rates and their variability to predict the storage needed, as well as scaling the <b>storage</b> <b>allocation</b> by a logarithmic factor. The resultant, final storage utilization rate can be as high as 97 - 98 % after indexing about 1. 6 million documents. This compares favorably with the storage utilization rate of the original arrival rate <b>storage</b> <b>allocation</b> scheme. Our evaluation shows that the retrieval time for extensible inverted file on solid state disk is on average similar to the retrieval time for in-memory extensible inverted file.

Parallel and distributed indices built using commodity hardware like personal computers (PCs) can substantially save cost because PCs are produced in bulk, achieving {{the scale of}} economy.

This paper presents an analytical investigation and an empirical evaluation of storage-efficient inmemory extensible inverted files, which are represented by fixed- or variable-sized linked list nodes. The size of these linked list nodes is determined by minimizing the storage wastes or maximizing storage utilization under different conditions, which lead to different <b>storage</b> <b>allocation</b> schemes.
