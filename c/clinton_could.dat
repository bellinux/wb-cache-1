25|$|Unlike Bush, Clinton {{was able}} to unite his fractious and ideologically diverse party behind his candidacy, even when its {{different}} wings were in conflict. To garner the support of moderates and conservative Democrats, he attacked Sister Souljah, a little-known rap musician whose lyrics Clinton condemned. Furthermore, Clinton made clear his support {{of the death penalty}} and would later champion making school uniforms in public schools a requirement. <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> also point to his centrist record as Governor of Arkansas. More liberal Democrats were impressed by Clinton's record on abortion and affirmative action. His strong connections to African Americans also played a key role. In addition, he organized significant numbers of young voters and became a symbol of the rise of the Baby Boomer generation to political power. Supporters remained energized and confident, even in times of scandal or missteps.|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} {{continued}} to Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina, many observers concluded that Clinton had little chance to overcome Obama's lead in pledged delegates. Even {{if she were}} to succeed in changing the dynamics of the race, there would not be enough pledged delegates remaining for her to catch up under most realistic scenarios. Some analysts believed <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> still win the nomination by raising doubts about Obama's electability, fighting for Michigan and Florida delegates to be seated at the convention, and convincing superdelegates to support her despite her expected loss in the pledged delegate vote. However, the window of opportunity for re-votes in Michigan and Florida appeared to close in late March, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, said that it would be harmful to the party if superdelegates were to overturn the result of the pledged delegate vote.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 LifeZette {{published}} a video titled [...] "Clinton Body Count", which promoted conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton. LifeZette removed {{the video and}} later released {{a statement saying that}} [...] "the video was made in jest, and merely noted that the theories existed," [...] comparing them to viral videos [...] "left-leaning digital outlets". In September, the website {{published a}} since-removed article entitled [...] "10 People Under the Clinton Curse", which stated that it was [...] "hard to deny that being close with the <b>Clintons</b> <b>could</b> kill you." ...|$|R
50|$|The project, however, took a {{different}} turn, and the resulting book, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, proved to be largely sympathetic to Hillary Clinton, causing surprise within the publishing industry. Having received the large advance and a tight one-year deadline from Simon & Schuster's then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In Blinded by the Right, Brock {{said that he had}} reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the <b>Clintons,</b> <b>could</b> not find any evidence of wrongdoing {{and did not want to}} make any more misleading claims.|$|R
50|$|Whether or not <b>Clinton</b> {{actually}} <b>could</b> prevail {{with the}} help of party-appointed superdelegates was also an increasingly debated question, as Obama gained 47 new superdelegates between Super Tuesday and mid-March, while Clinton lost 7.|$|R
500|$|The Clinton Presidential Park {{occupies}} nearly [...] of {{land and}} {{is located on the}} riverfront next to the museum. It is a leading example of urban renewal, as the site was formerly a run-down warehouse district. The park was built next to the site of abandoned railroad tracks of the defunct Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. The center of the park is Celebration Circle, a fountain plaza around which the Center's major buildings are located. It also includes an arboretum, amphitheater, gardens, and a children's play area. There is also an area where <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> be buried if he chooses.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "During {{the time}} {{for which he was}} elected" [...] has not been controversial. Justice Joseph Story has expounded in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States that the disqualifying event expires at the {{conclusion}} of the elected term in which it occurred. This view is commonly accepted. Moreover, Department of Justice memoranda, outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General, hold that [...] "the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [...] currently serving". This principle was applied, for example, to the question of whether President <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> appoint Representative Bill Richardson as Ambassador to the United Nations despite a salary increase prior to his current term, and whether President Harding could appoint Senator William Kenyon as a Judge despite the Congressional increase of judicial salaries during his previous term. Opinions issued by the Clinton administration Office of Legal Counsel often presupposed the application of the clause, and conceded that [...] "he tradition of interpreting the Clause has been 'formalistic' rather than 'functional". Another clarification came in 1969, when newly re-elected Representative Melvin Laird was President-elect Nixon's choice for Secretary of Defense and Congress was expected to raise the pay of Cabinet members in the new term. Attorney General Ramsey Clark gave an official opinion, which Laird followed, that Laird could be sworn in and serve in the new term from January 3 to January 20 (when Nixon would take office) without running afoul of the Clause, as long as he joined the cabinet before the pay raise went into effect.|$|E
500|$|On October 7, Trump {{announced}} on Larry King Live that he formed an exploratory committee {{to explore a}} Reform Party presidential bid. Trump planned to use the committee, not to raise money—he would personally fund his campaign—but to advise him on political matters {{in preparation for a}} run. In the interview with Larry King, Trump was optimistic about his chances indicating a [...] "very strong possibility" [...] of victory. He referenced a non-scientific National Enquirer poll of 100 individuals, showing him in first place against his Democratic and Republican counterparts. [...] When pressed, Trump identified Oprah Winfrey as his ideal choice for a running mate, describing her as [...] "somebody that is very special," [...] and that if she agreed to run, [...] "she'd be fantastic [...] [...] [...] she's popular, she's brilliant, she's a wonderful woman." [...] Oprah's spokesperson later responded [...] "at this point in time [...] [...] [...] Oprah is not running." [...] Trump labeled Rudy Giuliani the greatest Mayor of New York and spoke admirably of Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, saying that Reagan had a demeanor that contributed to a phenomenal spirit in the nation. [...] Trump argued that President Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> have been a great president, but destroyed his legacy with the Lewinsky scandal. [...] As for the Reform Party, Trump offered praise for both Perot and Ventura, and attacked potential primary opponent Buchanan as someone [...] "enamored" [...] with Adolf Hitler, based on Buchanan's thesis that Hitler presented no military threat to the United States ahead of World War II.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, President Bill Clinton {{became the}} first {{president}} since Nixon to assert executive privilege and lose in court, when a federal judge ruled that <b>Clinton</b> aides <b>could</b> be called to testify in the Lewinsky scandal.|$|R

25|$|Mortensen {{endorsed}} Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the 2016 U.S Presidential race. He {{wrote an}} open letter just before Election Day 2016 where he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary <b>Clinton</b> and <b>could</b> not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he also thought (erroneously) that Clinton would be elected President in the end.|$|R
500|$|The {{conservative}} {{advocacy group}} Judicial Watch announced after the nomination that it believed a Saxbe fix was unconstitutional and that <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> not become Secretary of State until 2013 at the earliest. After the Saxbe fix was passed, Judicial Watch said it might seek to halt Clinton's appointment via litigation. On January 29, 2009, {{a week after}} Clinton had been sworn into the position, Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit Rodearmel v. Clinton in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, on behalf of David Rodearmel, a U.S. Foreign Service Officer and State Department employee. The suit claims that Clinton is [...] "constitutionally ineligible" [...] to serve as Secretary of State due to the Ineligibility Clause and that Rodearmel cannot be forced to serve under her, as it would violate the oath he took as a Foreign Service Officer in 1991 to [...] "support and defend" [...] and [...] "bear true faith and allegiance" [...] to the U.S. Constitution. On February 6, a panel of three judges was appointed to hear the case. On May 20, the Obama administration Office of Legal Counsel filed an opinion with the district court saying that Clinton's appointment did not violate the Ineligibility Clause, and that an [...] "on net" [...] view of the Clause [...] "presents an entirely natural interpretation of the [...] language." [...] On October 30, 2009, the District Court dismissed the case, stating [...] "Because Rodearmel has failed to allege that Clinton has taken any action—much less an action that has aggrieved him—he does not come within the 'zone of interests' protected by the Secretary of State Emoluments Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the debate, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled {{over who}} best {{exemplified}} the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". [...] In one noted exchange, Edwards said that <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> not bring change, {{while he and}} Obama can. [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] He made {{clear that he was}} referring to Clinton, adding, [...] "I didn't hear these kind of attacks from Senator Clinton while she was ahead. Now that she's not we hear them." [...] Clinton passionately retorted: [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Obama's upset win in Iowa, it {{appeared}} to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primaries and then onward to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published on the Clinton campaign, as Obama surged to a roughly 10-point lead in the New Hampshire polls. However, the race turned quickly {{in the days before}} the primary, and the polls were slow to register a reversal toward Clinton. At the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire debate on [...] January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama against Clinton. In one noted exchange, Edwards said that <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> not bring about change, while he and Obama could: [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] Clinton passionately retorted, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy. The morning before the primary, Clinton became [...] "visibly emotional" [...] in response to a friendly question from a voter. Video of the moment was replayed on cable news television throughout the day, accompanied by pundit commentary that ranged from sympathetic to callous in tone. Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising three-percent victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count. Richardson withdrew from the race on January 10.|$|E
5000|$|An August 12, 2007, article {{described}} {{concerns that}} a <b>Clinton</b> candidacy <b>could</b> {{lead to a}} backlash due to fears that she might prove [...] "polarizing." [...] The article states, [...] "A strategist {{with close ties to}} leaders in Congress said Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races would be strongly urged to distance themselves from Clinton." [...] According to an online poll, [...] "half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen. Hillary Clinton." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, Hoeffel made a third run at Congress, {{taking on}} his former {{colleague}} on the Montgomery County Commission, Jon Fox, now a freshman Congressman. That year, Fox hung onto his seat by an 84-vote margin. However, in 1998, {{in his fourth}} attempt, Hoeffel broke through. Hobbled by a tough Republican primary and {{the fallout from the}} impeachment of President Bill <b>Clinton,</b> Fox <b>could</b> not hang on a second time. Hoeffel won by more than 5,000 votes. [...] Hoeffel became only the second Democrat to represent the Montgomery County-based district in 86 years.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the success}} of The Real Anita Hill, Free Press paid Brock a $550,000 advance {{to write a book}} about Hillary Clinton. The {{expectation}} was that it would be a takedown in the style of his writings on Anita Hill and Bill Clinton. The project, however, took a different turn, and the resulting book, The Seduction of Hillary Rodham, proved to be largely sympathetic to Mrs. Clinton. Having received a $1 million advance and a tight one-year deadline from Simon & Schuster's then-conservative-focused Free Press subsidiary, Brock was under tremendous pressure to produce another bestseller. However, the book contained no major scoops. In Blinded by the Right (2002), Brock said that he had reached a turning point: he had thoroughly examined charges against the <b>Clintons,</b> <b>could</b> not find any evidence of wrongdoing and did not want to make any more misleading claims. Brock further said that his former friends in right-wing politics shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. National Review proposed another theory: since [...] "no liberal source in the world would talk to Brock", he could not collect the kind of information he was after. National Review also suggested that while writing the book, Brock had been [...] "seduced" [...] by Sidney Blumenthal, a champion and friend of the Clinton circle.|$|R
60|$|So one day, {{at about}} six, she {{stationed}} {{herself at the}} door of the big building in which were Mr Clinton's offices, and waited. Presently he appeared in the doorway, and after standing for a minute or two on the threshold, ever with the enigmatical smile hovering on his lips, came down the steps and walked slowly along the crowded street. His wife walked behind him; and he was not difficult to follow, for he had lost his old, quick, business-like step, and sauntered along, looking to the right and to the left, carelessly, as if he had not awaiting him at home his duties as the father of a family.... After a while he turned down a side street, and his wife followed with growing astonishment; she could not imagine where he was going. Just then a little flower-girl passed by and offered him a yellow rose. He stopped and looked at her; Mrs <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> see that she was a grimy little girl, with a shock of unkempt brown hair and a very dirty apron; but Mr Clinton put his hand on her head and looked into her eyes; then he gave her a penny, and, stooping down, lightly kissed her hair.|$|E
60|$|Mr Clinton became daily stronger, {{and soon}} he was quite well. He resumed {{his work at the}} office, and in every way seemed to have regained his old self. He gave {{utterance}} to no more startling theories, and the casual observer might have noticed no difference between him and the model clerk of six months back. But Mrs Clinton had received too great a shock to look upon her husband with casual eyes, and she noticed in his manner an alteration which disquieted her. He was much more silent than before; he would take his supper without speaking a word, without making the slightest sign to show that he had heard some remark of Mrs Clinton's. He did not read the paper in the evening as he had been used to do, but would go upstairs {{to the top of the}} house, and stand by an open window looking at the stars. He had an enigmatical way of smiling which Mrs <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> not understand. Then he had lost his old punctuality--he would come home at all sorts of hours, and, when his wife questioned him, would merely shrug his shoulders and smile strangely. Once he told her that he had been wandering about looking at men's lives.|$|E

50|$|Situated in the South, {{which has}} become a Republican stronghold in recent elections, North Carolina is an anomaly. While very Democratic at the local and state level, the last Democratic presidential nominee to win the Tar Heel State was Jimmy Carter in 1976; not even the Southern {{moderate}} populist Bill <b>Clinton</b> from Arkansas <b>could</b> win North Carolina.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{election}} of Barack Obama as President and the leftward shift of the national Democratic Party, Arkansas Democrats have seen their influence gradually decline. While Arkansas was able to resist {{the rise of the}} Republican Party {{throughout the rest of the}} South (partially thanks to Bill <b>Clinton),</b> it <b>could</b> not hold off forever. The Republicans began to make serious inroads in 2010, and it continued until it finally in 2014, when Republicans captured all the statewide offices, both chambers of the state legislature, all the U.S House seats and both U.S Senate seats, putting the Democrats in the minority for the first time in state history.|$|R

2500|$|In response, House {{impeachment}} manager Steve Chabot {{called the}} resort to Bronston [...] "the {{cornerstone of the}} president's defense" [...] and a [...] "legal smokescreen", when presenting {{the case to the}} Senate. <b>Clinton,</b> he claimed, <b>could</b> very well remember those things he claimed not to.

5000|$|This {{election}} was close {{throughout the whole}} campaign since Gore {{was able to use}} the good economy to his advantage while being hurt by perceptions of him as robotic and pompous. The Lewinsky scandal also might have hurt Gore and helped Bush in the polls among voters who were concerned about moral values. Finally, Gore was hurt by his refusal to campaign with incumbent President Bill <b>Clinton,</b> which <b>could</b> have turned out more Democrats to vote. In the end Gore won the popular vote but very narrowly lost Florida [...] in the initial vote count as well as multiple recounts, with the decision upheld by the Supreme Court, the electoral vote, and the election.|$|R
50|$|Donald Trump's {{victory in}} the Hoosier State can be {{attributed}} to several factors. For one, Donald Trump had selected Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate, effectively eliminating any chance that <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> repeat Obama's surprise upset win in the state over John McCain eight years prior. Also, the state skews whiter and more Evangelical Protestant {{than the rest of the}} Midwest and the Rust Belt overall, which is a better demographic make-up for Republicans; Trump won white born-again and Evangelical Christians by a margin of 75-22.|$|E
50|$|According to Linda Tripp's {{grand jury}} testimony, she felt Willey pursued a romance with Clinton {{from the start}} of her White House affiliation. Willey had speculated with Tripp as to how {{she might be able to}} set up an {{assignation}} between herself and the president. She routinely attended events at which Clinton would be present, wearing a black dress she believed he liked. According to Tripp's testimony, Willey wondered if she and <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> arrange to meet in a home to which she had access, on the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Iowa defeat, the {{campaign}} hoped that Bill <b>Clinton</b> <b>could</b> help salvage a win in New Hampshire, where he had achieved a political comeback in his 1992 presidential campaign. As he had in Iowa, the former President campaigned intensively, but his New Hampshire appearances failed to draw large or enthusiastic crowds. On the day before the primary, press reports indicated that Hillary Clinton advisers were pessimistic about the immediate future, thinking it was unlikely {{she would be able to}} win either New Hampshire or South Carolina.|$|E

I {{was president of the}} Federalist Society chapter at my law school, worked on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal and wrote speeches for President Bush—not the [...] "Read My Lips" [...] Bush, the [...] "Axis of Evil" [...] Bush.
