40|$|Hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weldments is {{the most}} serious problem {{limiting}} the use of high strength low alloy steel in the structural industry. Improvement of the weldability of structural steel has significantly reduced the risk of <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the heat affected zone. Consequently, the avoidance of weld metal <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> becomes a major task since the risk of hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the HAZ is greatly diminished in modem low carbon steels. Hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weld metal is caused by the complex interaction of the diffusible hydrogen content, residual stress and susceptible microstructure. Depending on the joint geometry which induces stresses, <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in weld metal can be of two types with respect to the welding direction: longitudinal cracking which is parallel to the welding direction, and transverse cracking which is perpendicular to the welding direction. Weld deposits for high strength low alloy steels can be susceptible to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> The investigation described in this thesis involved the use of the gapped bead-on-plate (G-BOP) test to examine the effect of shielding gas mixture and preheat temperature on weld metal transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour in a flux cored arc welded BIS 812 EMA quenched and tempered steel. The minimum yield stress of BIS 812 EMA steel 1 s 690 MPa. The consumable used in welding was a low hydrogen flux cored wire. Literature relevant to the characteristics of weld metal <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> has been reviewed, with emphasis on the factors affecting hydrogen induced <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> The process of flux cored arc welding, the weld thermal cycle and the properties of weld metal have been examined. The main types of <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> and relevant weldability tests have been discussed. Two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures (Ar- 5 %C 02 and Ar- 20 %C 02) and five different preheat temperatures (20 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, 80 °C and 100 °C) were used at an aim heat input of 1. 7 kJ/mm to investigate the effect of welding conditions on the transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> behaviour of the weld metal deposited on BIS 812 EMA steel. The microstructures, hardness values and fracture surfaces of the weld metals, have been examined in detail using optical and electron microscopy and microhardness testing. The characteristics of non-metallic inclusions in the weld metals have been determined using scanning electron microscopy and automatic image analysis. The continuous cooling transformation diagrams of the base metal and the weld metals have been developed using dilatometry and microstructural observation. Additionally, precipitation hardening by alloy carbides has been studied by tempering of weld metals. It was found that, below a critical preheat temperature, weld metal transverse cracks developed in the self restrained G-BOP test at least five minutes after welding and initiated below 150 °C, confirming that the weld metal transverse <b>cracking</b> was <b>cold</b> <b>cracking.</b> Shielding with Ar- 20 %C 02 mixture resulted in significantly lower susceptibility to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> than shielding with Ar- 5 %C 02 mixture. However, the microstructures of the weld metals deposited with the two different Ar-C 02 shielding gas mixtures were similar and mainly consisted of acicular ferrite and bainitic ferrite. Comparing the two weld metals, the higher oxygen potential of the Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture caused reduction of hardenability elements such as carbon, boron, manganese and silicon in the weld metal; and the higher oxygen absorption during welding resulted in a higher non-metallic inclusion volume fraction and a slightly larger mean particle size and number of particles per unit volume. These factors led to phase transformation during cooling at higher temperature in weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02, a slightly coarser microstructure with more bainitic ferrite, and a significantly lower hardness than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02. In addition, the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture had a lower diffusible hydrogen level and less nitrogen in solid solution. These characteristics combined with the lower hardness value of the weld metal are considered to be the main factors contributing to the lower susceptibility to transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 compared with Ar- 5 %C 02 under the same welding conditions. Three types of fracture morphologies were found {{to be associated with the}} weld metal transverse cold cracking: microvoid coalescence (MVC) fracture, quasi-cleavage (QC) fracture and intergranular (IG) fracture. IG was more prevalent in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture while MVC dominated in the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02. These trends are consistent with the difference in weld metal hardness (strength). The susceptibility to weld metal transverse <b>cold</b> <b>cracking,</b> based on the G-BOP test, decreased with increasing preheat temperature for both shielding gas mixtures. No cracking was observed for the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 shielding gas mixture for a preheat of 40 °C, but a preheat of 100 °C was required for crack-free welding using Ar- 5 %C 02 shielding gas mixture. However, it is concluded that the finer microstructure of the weld metal deposited with Ar- 5 %C 02 is capable of both higher strength and lower <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility than the weld metal deposited with Ar- 20 %C 02 provided the hardnesses are similar and below a critical level of about 290 HV...|$|R

40|$|High-strength {{steel grades}} with high wear {{resistance}} and high toughness are potential candidates to reduce weight in heavy construction, agricultural machinery and shipbuilding. Weldability of HSS grades has limitations {{due to the}} loss of material properties caused by the complex thermomechanical treatments (i. e. increase of hardness and reduction of toughness caused by martensite formation within the weld seam and the resulting increment of the <b>cold</b> <b>crack</b> probability). The existing limitations can be overcome by the use of appropriate welding methods, such as laser welding combined with induction heating. In the present work, the effect of inductive heating on the microstructure and mechanical properties of fusion and heat-affected zones in butt-joints of the structural steel S 690 QL (3. 0 - 6. 0 mm sheet thicknesses) produced by CO(ind 2) laser welding is studied by optical microscopy and hardness measurements. The results reveal that laser welding without induction heating causes heavy martensite formation in the fusion and heat affected zones, which results in a strong increase of hardness when compared with the parent material. Inductive annealing produces tempered martensite in the fusion zone, thus, leading to a significant and homogeneous reduction of hardness. The effect decreases with increasing sheet thickness. The most promising results are obtained by induction pre- and post-heat-treatments, where the hardness in the fusion zone is similar to that found in the parent material for both thin and thick sheets. However, the hardness distribution is not homogeneous and thermal martensite is formed in the heat-affected zone due to still fast cooling times...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Facing {{with the}} {{practical}} limitation in lowering diffusible hydrogen content, the possible modification of weld microstructure would alleviate the flux cored arc (FACW) weld deposits from {{the risk of}} weld metal cold cracking. Therefore, it was aimed to identify and evaluate the effect of weld microstructure on cold cracking susceptibility of FCAW weld metals, and then to give a basic guideline for designing new welding consumables from the microstructural point of view. Design/methodology/approach: In order {{to figure out the}} parameter(s) that can quantify the microstructural susceptibility of multi-pass weld deposit, two sets of FCAW deposits having tensile strength of about 600 MPa were prepared by controlling the Ni content to allow a sufficient variation in weld microstructure but with little change in weld metal strength. <b>Cold</b> <b>crack</b> susceptibility of those two chemistries was evaluated by ‘multi-pass weld metal cracking test’ at various levels of diffusible hydrogen content. Findings: All of the cold cracks developed were Chevron-type cracks and the occurrence of such cracks was depending on the proportion of grain boundary ferrite as well as the diffusible hydrogen content. In fact, at the same level of diffusible hydrogen, 1. 5 %Ni wire showed better resistance to cold cracking than the 0 %Ni even though that was higher in strength and carbon equivalent. This result could be explained by the difference in grain boundary ferrite content between those two welds based on the microstructural characteristics of Chevron cracking that preferentially propagates along grain boundary ferrite. Research limitations/implications: Detrimental effect of grain boundary ferrite against cold cracking has been addressed for Chevron-type cracks that is commonly developed in the ferritic weld metals having 600 MPa strength level so that present result may not be valid for higher strength welds over 700 MPa which shows vertical-type cracks. Practical implications: In addition to hydrogen control approach, microstructural modification in a way to reduce the proportion of grain boundary ferrite can be pursued for developing welding consumables with improved resistance to cold cracking. Originality/value: Proportion of grain boundary ferrite was proposed as a parameter that can quantify the microstructural susceptibility of multi-pass weld deposit. This fact can be used for users and manufacturers in selecting and designing welding consumables with better resistance to cold cracking...|$|E

The impact of the electrode shape and heat input on the arc motion, and heat affected zone, the size of which determines the <b>cold</b> <b>cracks</b> formation and deposited metal flaking has been found. The arc moves along the electrode end face along the longitudinal axis or perpendicular to the weld pool in dependence on the ribbon position. The arc movement governs the heat input in the pool and if the surfacing regime is constant, the heating and cooling rates of the molten metal and heat affected zone as well. At surfacing with a perpendicular ribbon the heat affected zone decreases; at surfacing with a longitudinal ribbon and wire the heat affected zone increases. At surfacing with a composite electrode the heat affected zone reduces sharply while resistance to cracking and wearing increases. With the heat input reduction in weld pool side edges the heat affected zone reduces as well. At high speed surfacing with low heat input, the heat affected zone reduces, the tendency to <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> and deposited metal flaking decrease, welding stresses and specific pressure decrease, what results in resistance to cracking increase {{as well as the}} increase in wearing resistance. When energy decreases the deposited metal quality increases. Energy minimum results in maximum quality. The process of energy-saving high-speed deposition with low heat input, which provides microstructure reduction, heat input in the base metal and heat affected zone decrease, prevent <b>cold</b> <b>cracking</b> and deposited metal flaking increases both rolling mill back-up cracking resistance and wearing resistance has been develope...|$|R

Provedena su ispitivanja simulacijom toplinskog zavarivačkog ciklusa na simulatoru tipa Smitweld TCS 1405, te metodama Implant i Tekken u svrhu utvrđivanja sklonosti mikrolegiranih i poboljšanih čelika hladnim pukotinama. Na koncu su predloženi parametri zavarivanja koji pretpostavljaju zavareni spoj bez hladnih pukotina.

50|$|A {{year later}} in March 1981, the investigative report {{concluded}} that the rig collapsed owing to a fatigue crack {{in one of its}} six bracings (bracing D-6), which connected the collapsed D-leg {{to the rest of the}} rig. This was traced to a small 6 mm fillet weld which joined a non-load-bearing flange plate to this D-6 bracing. This flange plate held a sonar device used during drilling operations. The poor profile of the fillet weld contributed to a reduction in its fatigue strength. Further, the investigation found considerable amounts of lamellar tearing in the flange plate and <b>cold</b> <b>cracks</b> in the butt weld. <b>Cold</b> <b>cracks</b> in the welds, increased stress concentrations due to the weakened flange plate, the poor weld profile, and cyclical stresses (which would be common in the North Sea), seemed to collectively play a role in the rig's collapse.|$|R
