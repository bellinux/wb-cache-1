40|$|Geoengineering (the {{intentional}} {{modification of}} Earth's climate) {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} reducing CO 2 -induced climate warming while greenhouse gas emissions continue. Most proposals involve managing incoming solar radiation such that future greenhouse gas forcing is counteracted by reduced solar forcing. In this study, we assess the transient climate response to geoengineering under a business-as-usual CO 2 emissions scenario by using an intermediate-complexity global climate model that includes an interactive carbon cycle. We find that the climate system responds quickly to artificially reduced insolation; hence, there may be little cost to delaying the deployment of geoengineering strategies until such a time as “dangerous” climate change is imminent. Spatial temperature patterns in the geoengineered simulation are comparable <b>with</b> <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperatures,</b> although this is not true for precipitation. Carbon sinks in the model increase in response to geoengineering. Because geoengineering acts to mask climate warming, there is a direct CO 2 -driven increase in carbon uptake without an offsetting temperature-driven suppression of carbon sinks. However, this strengthening of carbon sinks, combined with the potential for rapid climate adjustment to changes in solar forcing, leads to serious consequences should geoengineering fail or be stopped abruptly. Such a scenario could lead to very rapid climate change, with warming rates up to 20 times greater than present-day rates. This warming rebound would be larger and more sustained should climate sensitivity prove to be higher than expected. Thus, employing geoengineering schemes with continued carbon emissions could lead to severe risks for the global climate system...|$|R

This decrease has {{a negative effect on}} calcification in hermatypic corals and other calcifying organisms. We report the results of three laboratory experiments designed specifically to separate the effects of the different carbonate chemistry parameters (pH, CO 3 - 2, CO 2 [aq], total alkalinity [AT], and total inorganic carbon [CT]) on the calcification, photosynthesis, and respiration of the hermatypic coral Acropora eurystoma. The carbonate system was varied to change pH (7. 9 - 8. 5), without changing CT; CT was changed keeping the pH constant, and CT was changed keeping the pCO 2 constant. In all of these experiments, calcification (both light and dark) was positively correlated with CO 3 - 2 concentration, suggesting that the corals are not sensitive to pH or CT but to the CO 3 - 2 concentration. A decrease of ~ 30 % in the CO 3 - 2 concentration (which is equivalent to a decrease of about 0. 2 pH units in seawater) caused a calcification decrease of about 50 %. These results suggest that calcification in today's ocean (pCO 2 = 370 ppm) is lower by ~ 20 % <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> <b>preindustrial</b> time (pCO 2 = 280 ppm). An additional decrease of ~ 35 % is expected if atmospheric CO 2 concentration doubles (pCO 2 = 560 ppm). In all of these experiments, photosynthesis and respiration did not show any significant response to changes in the carbonate chemistry of seawater. Based on this observation, we propose a mechanism by which the photosynthesis of symbionts is enhanced by coral calcification at high pH when CO 2 (aq) is low. Overall it seems that photosynthesis and calcification support each other mainly through internal pH regulation, which provides CO 3 - 2 ions for calcification and CO 2 (aq) for photosynthesis...|$|R

Here we use a high-resolution regional climate model with a realistic ice-sheet surface representation to assess the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet during the Eemian. Our simulations show that Eemian climate led to an 83 % lower surface mass balance, <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>preindustrial</b> simulation. Our sensitivity experiments show that only about 55 % of this change in surface mass balance can be attributed to higher ambient temperatures, with the remaining 45 % caused by higher insolation and associated nonlinear feedbacks.

40|$|A three-dimensional, process-based {{model of}} the ocean's carbon and {{nitrogen}} cycles, including 13 C and 15 N isotopes, is used to explore effects of idealized changes in the soft-tissue biological pump. Results are presented from one preindustrial control run (piCtrl) and six simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with increasing values of the spatially constant maximum phytoplankton growth rate μmax, which accelerates biological nutrient utilization mimicking iron fertilization. The default LGM simulation, without increasing μmax and with a shallower and weaker Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and increased sea ice cover, leads to 280 [*]Pg more respired organic carbon (Corg) storage in the deep ocean with respect to piCtrl. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the colder glacial thermocline increase, which reduces water column denitrification and, with delay, nitrogen fixation, thus increasing the ocean's fixed nitrogen inventory and decreasing δ 15 NNO 3 almost everywhere. This simulation already fits sediment reconstructions of carbon and nitrogen isotopes relatively well, but it overestimates deep ocean δ 13 CDIC and underestimates δ 15 NNO 3 at high latitudes. Increasing μmax enhances Corg and lowers deep ocean δ 13 CDIC, improving the agreement with sediment data. In the model's Antarctic and North Pacific Oceans modest increases in μmax result in higher δ 15 NNO 3 due to enhanced local nutrient utilization, improving the agreement with reconstructions there. Models with moderately increased μmax fit both isotope data best, whereas large increases in nutrient utilization are inconsistent with nitrogen isotopes although they still fit the carbon isotopes reasonably well. The best fitting models reproduce major features of the glacial δ 13 CDIC, δ 15 N, and oxygen reconstructions while simulating increased Corg by 510 – 670 [*]Pg <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> the <b>preindustrial</b> ocean.

The model used is the ECHAM 5 -HAM atmospheric aerosol–climate model, driven with sea-surface temperatures and sea ice cover simulated using the CSIRO Mk 3 L coupled climate system model. The focus is on isolating the 10 Be production signal, driven by solar variability, from the weather- or climate-driven noise in the 10 Be deposition flux during different stages of climate. The production signal varies at lower frequencies, dominated by the 11 year solar cycle within the 30 year timescale of these experiments. The climatic noise is of higher frequencies than 11 years during the 30 year period studied. We first apply empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to global 10 Be deposition on the annual scale and find that the first principal component, consisting of the spatial pattern of mean 10 Be deposition and the temporally varying solar signal, explains 64 % of the variability. The following principal components {{are closely related to}} those of precipitation. Then, we apply ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) analysis to the time series of 10 Be deposition at GRIP and at Law Dome, which is an effective method for adaptively decomposing the time series into different frequency components. The low-frequency components and the long-term trend represent production and have reduced noise compared to the entire frequency spectrum of the deposition. The high-frequency components represent climate-driven noise related to the seasonal cycle of e. g. precipitation and are closely connected to high frequencies of precipitation. These results firstly show that the 10 Be atmospheric production signal is preserved in the deposition flux to surface even during climates very different from today's both in global data and at two specific locations. Secondly, noise can be effectively reduced from 10 Be deposition data by simply applying the EOF analysis {{in the case of a}} reasonably large number of available data sets, or by decomposing the individual data sets to filter out high-frequency fluctuations. © Author(s) 2014...|$|R

40|$|International audienceImproved {{estimates}} of the radiative forcing from tropospheric ozone increases since the preindustrial have been calculated with the tropospheric chemistry model used at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) within the GISS general circulation model (GCM). The chemistry in this model has been expanded to include simplified representations of peroxyacetylnitrates and non-methane hydrocarbons in addition to background NO x -HO x -O x -CO-CH 4 chemistry. The GCM has improved resolution and physics in the boundary layer, improved resolution near the tropopause, and now contains a full representation of stratospheric dynamics. Simulations of present-day conditions show that this coupled chemistry-climate model is better able to reproduce observed tropospheric ozone, especially in the tropopause region, which is critical to climate forcing. Comparison <b>with</b> <b>preindustrial</b> simulations gives a global annual average radiative forcing due to tropospheric ozone increases of 0. 30 W/m 2 with standard assumptions for preindustrial emissions. Locally, the forcing reaches more than 0. 8 W/m 2 {{in parts of the}} northern subtropics during spring and summer, and is more than 0. 6 W/m 2 through nearly all the Northern subtropics and mid-latitudes during summer. An alternative <b>preindustrial</b> simulation <b>with</b> soil NO x emissions reduced by two-thirds and emissions of isoprene, paraffins and alkenes from vegetation increased by 50 % gives a forcing of 0. 33 W/m 2. Given the large uncertainties in preindustrial ozone amounts, the true value may lie well outside this range...|$|R

40|$|Three {{potential}} mechanisms behind centennial-scale Holocene cooling {{events are}} studied in simulations {{performed with the}} coupled climate model ECBilt-CLIO: (1) internal variability, (2) solar forcing, and (3) freshwater forcing. In experiments <b>with</b> constant <b>preindustrial</b> forcings, three centennial-scale cooling events occur spontaneously in 15, 000 years. These rare events represent an unstable internal mode of variability that is characterised by a weaker thermohaline circulation, a more southward location of the main site of deep-water formation, expanded sea-ice cover and cooling of 10 °C over the Nordic Seas. This mode is visited more frequently when the climate is cooled by abruptly reducing the solar constant by 5 or 3 W...|$|R
40|$|The 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change commits signatories to {{preventing}} ‘dangerous anthropogenic {{interference with the}} climate system’, leaving unspecified the level of global warming that is dangerous. In the late 1990 s, a limit of 2 °C global warming above <b>preindustrial</b> <b>temperature</b> was proposed as a ‘guard rail’ below {{which most of the}} dangerous climate impacts could be avoided. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord recognized the scientific view ‘that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius’ despite growing views that this might be too high. At the same time, the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions in the past decade and the delays in a comprehensive global emissions reduction agreement have made achieving this target extremely difficult, arguably impossible, raising the likelihood of global temperature rises of 3 °C or 4 °C within this century. Yet, there are few studies that assess the potential impacts and consequences of a warming of 4 °C or greater in a systematic manner. Papers in this themed issue provide an initial picture of the challenges facing a world that warms by 4 °C or more, and the difficulties ahead if warming is to be limited to 2 °C with any reasonable certainty. Across many sectors—coastal cities, agriculture, water stress, ecosystems, migration—the impacts and adaptation challenges at 4 °C will be larger than at 2 °C. In some cases, such as farming in sub-Saharan Africa, a + 4 °C warming could result in the collapse of systems or require transformational adaptation out of systems, as we understand them today. The potential severity of impacts and the behavioural, institutional, societal and economic challenges involved in coping with these impacts argue for renewed efforts to reduce emissions, using all available mechanisms, to minimize the chances of high-end climate change. Yet at the same time, {{there is a need for}} accelerated and focused research that improves understanding of how the climate system might behave under a + 4 °C warming, what the impacts of such changes might be and how best to adapt to what would be unprecedented changes in the world we live in...|$|R
40|$|Past {{temperature}} variations {{are usually}} inferred from proxy data or estimated using general circulation models. Comparisons between climate estimations derived from proxy records and from model simulations help {{to better understand}} mechanisms driving climate variations, and also offer the possibility to identify deficiencies in both approaches. This paper presents regional temperature reconstructions based on tree-ring maximum density series in the Pyrenees, and <b>compares</b> them <b>with</b> the output of global simulations for this region and with regional climate model simulations conducted for the target region. An ensemble of 24 reconstructions of May-to-September regional mean temperature was derived from 22 maximum density tree-ring site chronologies distributed over the larger Pyrenees area. Four different tree-ring series standardization procedures were applied, combining two detrending methods: 300 -yr spline and the regional curve standardization (RCS). Additionally, different methodological variants for the regional chronology were generated by using three different aggregation methods. Calibration verification trials were performed in split periods and using two methods: regression and a simple variance matching. The resulting set of temperature reconstructions was <b>compared</b> <b>with</b> climate simulations performed with global (ECHO-G) and regional (MM 5) climate models. The 24 variants of May-to-September temperature reconstructions reveal a generally coherent pattern of inter-annual to multi-centennial temperature variations in the Pyrenees region for the last 750 yr. However, some reconstructions display a marked positive trend for {{the entire length of}} the reconstruction, pointing out that the application of the RCS method to a suboptimal set of samples may lead to unreliable results. Climate model simulations agree with the tree-ring based reconstructions at multi-decadal time scales, suggesting solar variability and volcanism as the main factors controlling <b>preindustrial</b> mean <b>temperature</b> variations in the Pyrenees. Nevertheless, the comparison also highlights differences with the reconstructions, mainly in the amplitude of past temperature variations and in the 20 th century trends. Neither proxy-based reconstructions nor model simulations are able to perfectly track the temperature variations of the instrumental record, suggesting that both approximations still need further improvements...|$|R
