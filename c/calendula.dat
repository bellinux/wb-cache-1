5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as <b>calendula</b> and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E
5|$|Grass and shrub seeds {{form the}} bulk of the diet, and leaves, flowers, fruit and scale insects are also eaten. The {{turquoise}} parrot has been recorded feeding on seeds of various plant species; more commonly consumed items include the fruit of common fringe-myrtle (Calytrix tetragona), seeds and fruit of erect guinea-flower (Hibbertia riparia), daphne heath (Brachyloma daphnoides), seeds of common raspwort (Gonocarpus tetragynus), Geranium species, black-anther flax-lily (Dianella revoluta) and grass species such as the introduced big quaking grass (Briza maxima) and little quaking grass (B. minor) and members of the genus Danthonia, members of the pea genus Dillwynia, and small-leaved beard-heath (Leucopogon microphyllus). Seed of the introduced common chickweed (Stellaria media) and capeweed (Arctotheca <b>calendula)</b> are also consumed. Nectar of Grevillea alpina, and spores from moss have been recorded as food items.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} {{typically}} uses the native Australian everlastings and other daisies as a host and food plant. However, it also feeds on several introduced species, including capeweed (Arctotheca <b>calendula),</b> Scotch thistle (Onopordum acanthium), and lavender (Lavandula angustifolia). The adults {{feed on the}} nectar of flowers.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} Achaemenid era, adar—as the quintessence of the Yazata Adar—was {{incorporated}} in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of angels. In that position, Adar is a helper of Asha Vahishta (Avestan, middle Persian: Ardvahisht), the Amesha Spenta responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Zoroastrian angels, Adars is the marigold (<b>calendula)</b> (Bundahishn 27.24).|$|E
500|$|Popular {{flowers in}} the {{traditional}} cottage garden included florist's flowers which were grown by enthusiasts—such as violets, pinks, and primroses—and those grown with a more practical purpose. For example, the <b>calendula,</b> grown today almost entirely for its bright orange flowers, was primarily valued for eating, for adding color to butter and cheese, for adding smoothness to soups and stews, and {{for all kinds of}} healing salves and preparations. Like many old cottage garden annuals and herbs, it freely self-sowed, making it easier to grow and share. Other popular cottage garden annuals included violets, pansies, stocks, and mignonette.|$|E
2500|$|Two insects, four mammals, nine {{birds and}} one lizard were named after Joseph Grinnell.

She directed several successful plays, displaying certain political implications. She also devoted herself to film: she wrote, along with Carlos Monsiváis, a documentary, México de mis amores, for the cinema, which she directed herself in 1979.|$|R
50|$|A knot {{garden is}} {{a garden of}} very formal design in a square frame, {{consisting}} {{of a variety of}} aromatic plants and culinary herbs including germander, marjoram, thyme, southernwood, lemon balm, hyssop, costmary, acanthus, mallow, chamomile, rosemary, <b>Calendulas,</b> Violas and Santolina. Most knot gardens now have edges made from box (Buxus sempervirens), whose leaves have a sweet smell when bruised. The paths in between are usually laid with fine gravel. However, the original designs of knot gardens did not have the low box hedges, and knot gardens with such hedges might more accurately be called parterres.|$|R
2500|$|The {{process of}} homeopathic {{dilution}} results in no objectively detectable active ingredient in most cases, but some preparations (e.g. <b>calendula</b> and arnica creams) do contain pharmacologically active doses. One product, Zicam Cold Remedy, which was marketed as an [...] "unapproved homeopathic" [...] product, contains two ingredients {{that are only}} [...] "slightly" [...] diluted: zinc acetate (2X = 1/100 dilution) and zinc gluconate (1X = 1/10 dilution), which means both are present in a biologically active concentration strong enough to have caused some people to lose their sense of smell, a condition termed anosmia. Zicam also listed several normal homeopathic potencies as [...] "inactive ingredients", including galphimia glauca, histamine dihydrochloride (homeopathic name, histaminum hydrochloricum), luffa operculata, and sulfur.|$|E
2500|$|The Athabasca Plain {{ecoregion}} in the Boreal Shield provides {{breeding grounds}} for the Bohemian waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus), white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera), Cape May warbler (Dendroica tigrina), Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata). In the south west area of the Boreal Shield ecozone lays the Churchill River Upland which has the second highest population of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). [...] This Upland area is home to waterfowl, such as the common loon (Gavia immer), red-breasted merganser (Mergus serrator), {{as well as other}} ducks, and geese on the many lakes of the region. The raven (Corvus corax), spruce grouse, gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), Connecticut warbler (Oporornis agilis), northern three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and hawk owl (Surnia ulula) can be sighted in the boreal forests. The Mid-Boreal Upland ecoregion features these characteristic birds: white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), bufflehead (Bucephala albeola), ovenbird, (Seiurus aurocapillus) and hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus). The ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), Canada warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus <b>calendula)</b> and white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), American white pelican (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are common sightings in the Mid-Boreal Lowland ecoregion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Calendulas</b> are {{considered}} by many gardening experts as among the easiest and most versatile flowers to grow in a garden, especially because they tolerate most soils. In temperate climates, seeds are sown in spring for blooms that last throughout the summer and well into the fall. In areas of limited winter freezing, seeds are sown in autumn for winter color. Plants will wither in subtropical summer. Seeds will germinate freely in sunny or half-sunny locations, but plants do best if planted in sunny locations with rich, well-drained soil. Pot marigolds typically bloom quickly from seed (in under two months) in bright yellows, golds, and oranges.|$|R

25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), red spider mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma <b>calendulae</b> f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|R
40|$|Accounts of the sporidial {{stages of}} members of the genus Entyloma are very confusing, {{and the role of the}} sporidia in the life cycles of these fungi is uncertain. A sporidial stage {{described}} by Stempell (1935) for E. <b>calendulae</b> has been stated by Derx (1948) and Olive (1952) to represent a fungus, Itersonilia perplaxans, independent of the life cycle of the Entyloma, and present on the lesions as a contaminant. The accounts of Derx (1930) and Hyland (1950) of the widespread occurrence of Tilletiopsis spp. on the leaves of "healthy" plants suggests that members of this genus may likewise have been occasionally assigned to Entyloma. Exploratory work on nine species of Entyloma revealed that "sporidia" approximating to Derx's and Olive's descriptions of Itersonilia perplexans are prevalent on lesions of Entyloma, but are also widespread on lesions of other fungal pathogens and occasionally present on "healthy" leaves. Fungi approximating to Nyland's descriptions of Tilletiopsis washingtonensis and T. minor are present on most leaves, whether or not attacked by Entyloma. A detailed investigation of E. <b>calendulae</b> and E. dahliae showed that needle-shaped and allantoid sporidia are formed when the chlamydospore germinates, and are discharged at the surface of the lesions of the smut. Inoculation experiments proved that the disease Is reproduced by the needle-shaped sporidia; all other Inoculation experiments had negative results. The allantoid sporidia superficially resemble the ballistospores of Tilletiopsis washingtonensis, but the two kinds of spore can be distinguished when they germinate.

40|$|Venous leg ulcers {{represent}} a significant {{public health problem}} that will increase as the population ages. A wide variety of agents are available {{for the treatment of}} venous leg ulcers, including ointments and dressings. Numerous herbs and their extracts are potentially conducive to wound healing, including the ability to serve as an antimicrobial, antifungal, astringent and etc. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish the healing effects of herbal therapy on non-infected venous leg ulcers. The major components of the DermaplantG were extract of Allii bulbus, Hyperici herba and extract of <b>Calendulae</b> flos. In the study were included 18 patients with venous leg ulcers treated by DermaplantG herbal therapy. Our investigation focused on the five controls (baseline, 1 st, 3 rd, 5 th 7 th weeks) of the parameters changes important for ulcer healing: wound surface area and reduction of venous leg ulcer score (fibrin deposits, exudation and eczema). Within-treatment analysis showed that, following DermaplantG herbal treatment, there was a significant decrease in surface leg ulcer and venous leg ulcer score after 7 th treatment week (P < 0. 05). The results of this pilot study demonstrate healing and antimicrobiologic efects of herbal therapy on non-infected venous leg ulcer...|$|R
40|$|Endophyllum osteospermi is an autoecious, endocyclic rust fungus, {{which has}} only been {{recorded}} on Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. monilifera (Asteraceae, <b>Calendulae),</b> a perennial woody shrub. Both organisms are indigenous to South Africa. Because E. osteospermi is being considered for release in Australia as a biocontrol agent against C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, {{it was necessary to}} determine its host range and natural distribution in South Africa. To address this, natural stands of Chrysanthemoides species, as well as other South African asteraceous plants, were monitored for E. osteospermi between 1992 and 2003. A morphological and molecular comparison of specimens referable to Endophyllum was undertaken. Based on these results, E. osteospermi was recorded on C. monilifera sspp. monilifera, pisifera, rotundata, canescens, and subcanescens, C. incana, and an undescribed taxon. E. osteospermi was also recorded on Osteospermum ciliatum, O. pollgaloides, and O. potbergense. Furthermore, a closely related but previously undescribed species, E. dimorphothecae sp. nov. is described on Dimorphotheca cuneata. Aecidium elytropappi is transferred to Endophyllum as E. elytropappi comb. nov., being recorded on Elytropappus rhinocerostis and Stoebe plumosa. This study shows that in South Africa E. osteospermi is restricted to a small group of related plant species in the Calenduleae. This rust is therefore considered suitable as a candidate agent for the biocontrol of C. monilifera ssp. monilifera, and pending the results of host specificity testing, would most likely be safe to introduce into Australia...|$|R

40|$|Venous leg ulcers {{represent}} a significant {{public health problem}} that will increase as the population ages. Numerous herbs and their extracts are potentially conducive to wound healing, including the ability to serve as antimicrobial, antifungal, astringent etc. The aim {{of the study was}} to establish the in-vivo antimicrobial effects of herbal hydrogel formulation DermaplantG. The major components of the DermaplantG were the extracts of Allii bulbus, Hyperici herba and extract of <b>Calendulae</b> flos. A total of 12 patients with non-infected venous leg ulcers were treated twice daily, for 5 weeks, with new hydrogel formulation. All ulcers showed clinical signs of contamination or colonization without signs of systemic infection. Premoistening the swab with sterile saline was considered when the surface of the wound was dry. The tip of the swab was rolled on its side in a zigzag pattern for at least one full rotation. Standard methods for isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were used. On baseline assessment, a large number of different types of bacteria were detected in all venous leg ulcers. S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were isolated from almost all controls. On baseline, mixed bacterial flora (50 %) was isolated in six venous leg ulcers (five ulcers with S. aureus-P. aeruginosa and one ulcer with E. coli-Enterobacter spp-P. aeruginosa). At the end of the treatment in DermaplantG group in 8 venous ulcers were detected S. aureus (66. 66 %) and P. aeruginosa (16. 66 %), and one venous leg ulcers was detected as sterile (8. 33 %). The number of different types of isolated bacterial species decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) after the use of DermaplantG herbal preparations. Therapy in DermaplantG group was administered without any side effects. The preliminary results of this pilot study demonstrate potential antimicrobial effects of herbal therapy on non-infected venous leg ulcers...|$|R
