25|$|Morton {{was born}} in Clifton, Nottingham, the third child of Pamela Freebury, a factory worker, and Peter Morton. She has six half-siblings from her parents' relationships, {{subsequent}} to their 1979 divorce. She lived with her father until she was eight when she was made a ward of court, because neither of her parents <b>could</b> <b>care</b> {{for her and her}} siblings. Her father was an abusive alcoholic and her mother was involved in a violent relationship with her second husband, and as a result, she never lived with her parents again. The next nine years were spent in and out of foster care and children's homes. During that time, she attended West Bridgford Comprehensive School and joined the Central Junior Television Workshop when she was 13, soon being offered small-screen roles in Soldier Soldier and Boon.|$|E

500|$|In a {{retrospective}} {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Shadows" [...] was rated a C+, with the episode being called [...] "exceedingly awkward", while the political context {{was seen as a}} weak point. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, had mixed feeling about the episode, rating it a C+. He felt that the episode's plot worked well, though the supernatural elements seemed [...] "a little corny". Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, was more positive about the episode, calling it [...] "fun viewing" [...] and feeling that [...] "with characters we <b>could</b> <b>care</b> about and a far more rounded plot, this proved one of the better episodes so far. I still wouldn’t call it a particularly brilliant one, though, either".|$|E

Softpedia branded ODST the best first-person shooter of the year; games editor Andrei Dumitrescu wrote that while the game {{occasionally}} felt formulaic, it was bolstered by a good plot, great music, and supporting characters that players <b>could</b> <b>care</b> about. Chris Kohler from Wired ranked ODST as the third best Xbox 360 title of the year, writing that the game [...] "injected a fresh breath into the staid corridors of Bungie's shooter franchise". Halo 3: ODST also won [...] "Best Original Score" [...] at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards.

2500|$|Universal began syndicating {{the show}} in 1979 and aggressively marketed it to local {{stations}} well into the early and middle 1980s. This accounts for its near-ubiquity on afternoon and late-night schedules in those days. From those showings, Rockford developed a following with younger viewers, with the momentum continuing throughout the 1990s and 2000s (decade) on cable. (The Ben Folds Five song [...] "Battle of Who <b>Could</b> <b>Care</b> Less," [...] in which The Rockford Files is mentioned, {{is one example of}} the show's newfound youth following; furthermore, the Rockford Files theme song is played {{at the end of the}} band's concerts.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The song is one out {{of three}} Elliott-produced records on After the Storm, {{commissioned}} by J Records head and executive producer Clive Davis after the release of Elliott's acclaimed studio album Under Construction (2002) and the delay of Monica's original third studio album All Eyez on Me the year before. It was conceived during a studio session week in Miami in early 2003, and was produced as a sequel to [...] "So Gone," [...] another Elliott track. In an interview with MTV News at the 2003 BET Awards, Monica stated that [...] "'Knock Knock' is [...] like a follow-up to 'So Gone,' just saying that, 'All right, we went through all that stuff, now it's time for you to get lost. This {{is the end of the}} road for you.' So, it's kind of like a 'get back' record." [...] Commenting on the recording process, she added: [...] "She [...] doesn't have any fear [...] When she goes in the studio, her goal is to be creative and to give something new and she <b>could</b> <b>care</b> less what else is current. And she creates new trends by doing that." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the album's {{listening}} {{party on}} August 20, 2012 at Germano Studios in Manhattan, New York, Two Elevens executive producer Breyon Prescott revealed {{that there would}} be fifteen songs on the final track listing. Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to {{what the rest of the}} album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in my wildest dreams did I think someone <b>could</b> <b>care</b> 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)." [...] During the course of the song, Norwood mentions herself several times, over the [...] "thawacking percussion" [...] and production.|$|E
2500|$|Whittlesey {{worked her}} entire adult life, {{including}} when pregnant and {{after her husband}} died in 1974. She canvassed door-to-door for her 1972 legislative race while pregnant with her third child, William. In 1985, {{when looking at the}} trendline that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They <b>could</b> <b>care</b> for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] I find myself in many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'
