5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a request from the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli {{in charge of the}} new inquiry.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered it possible that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered it possible that Ljótólfr <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E

The announcement in March 2014 of the {{discovery of}} a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further raised the possibility of an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E
25|$|The {{derivation}} of {{this word}} remains uncertain. It could {{be related to}} the Greek word γρυπός (grypos), meaning 'curved', or 'hooked'. Also, this <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> Anatolian loan word, compare Akkadian karūbu (winged creature), and similar to Cherub. A related Hebrew word is כרוב (kerúv).|$|E
25|$|A further deity with nanism, {{but rarely}} {{depicted}}, was Ptah-Pahtaka ("Ptah, the strong"). He was worshipped {{as a special}} form of Ptah, the god of art, crafts and creativity. Another form of Ptah that was also depicted as a dwarf was Ptah-segem-panem ("Ptah, the listener"). The deity Thoth, god of time, knowledge, mathematics and the moon, was sometimes depicted as a baboon {{with the head of}} a human. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> allusion to dwarfs.|$|E

The vase, however, <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> item which was looted from Avaris after the eventual victory over the Hyksos by Ahmose I.|$|E
25|$|Lord Palmerston {{replied to}} the {{question}} of the Russian ambassador about the reaction of England to a Russian intervention in Hungary, saying: Finish them quickly!, demanding that after they fulfilled their task to return in Russia immediately. Although England worried about a Russian intervention in Hungary, its first concern was that the Russian Empire to not advance in the Balkans, and an important condition for this was a strong Habsburg Empire. So, an independent Hungary <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> impediment for England's world domination policy.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps as a precautionary measure, the Siamese {{decided to}} move their forward base into the upper coast in 1751.

While it remains unclear {{as to whether the}} Siamese ever intended (or possessed the military capability) to go beyond the coast into mainland Lower Burma, the Siamese action nonetheless rang alarm bells in Pegu. Deeply concerned, the Hanthawaddy leadership withdrew two-thirds of their army back down to Lower Burma immediately after they had toppled the last Toungoo king in April 1752.|$|E

25|$|According {{to local}} legends, all Datuks were once humans {{who had a}} {{standing}} in society either for their position or special attributes.

Upon their death, locals and their followers would sometimes offer prayers at their gravestones, {{in line with the}} concept of keramat. Local Malay culture prior to the arrival of a more conservative brand of Islam practised the paying of respects to guardian spirits or penunggu which is believed to reside in seemingly 'unusual' natural formations; a unique shaped rock, an ant mount, a snake's nest, an extraordinarily large tree etc.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Pedro Estévan Tápis {{proposed}} {{establishing a}} mission {{on one of}} the Channel Islands in the Pacific Ocean off San Pedro Harbor in 1784, with either Santa Catalina or Santa Cruz (known as Limú to the Tongva residents) being the most likely locations, the reasoning being that an offshore mission might have attracted potential people to convert who were not living on the mainland, and <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> effective measure to restrict smuggling operations. Governor José Joaquín de Arrillaga approved the plan the following year, however an outbreak of sarampion (measles) killing some 200 Tongva people coupled with a scarcity of land for agriculture and potable water left the success of such a venture in doubt, so no effort to found an island mission was ever made.|$|E

Alternately, Echmarcach <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> member of the Meic Arailt dynasty, and a descendant of Ragnall mac Gofraid, King of the Isles (died 1004/1005).|$|R
25|$|Stenonychosaurus teeth, however, are {{different}} from most other theropods. One comparative study of the feeding apparatus suggests that Stenonychosaurus <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> omnivore. The jaws met in a broad, U-shaped symphysis {{similar to that of}} an iguana, a lizard species adapted to a plant-eating lifestyle. Additionally, the teeth of Stenonychosaurus bore large serrations, each of which is called a denticle. There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for Stenonychosaurus - the grasping hands, large brain and stereoscopic vision, are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous primates and omnivorous Procyon (raccoon).|$|E
25|$|Distinct {{characteristics}} of urban planning from {{remains of the}} cities of Harappa, Lothal, Dholavira, and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilisation (in modern-day northwestern India and Pakistan) lead archeologists to interpret them as the earliest known examples of deliberately planned and managed cities. The streets {{of many of these}} early cities were paved and laid out at right angles in a grid pattern, with a hierarchy of streets from major boulevards to residential alleys. Archaeological evidence suggests that many Harrapan houses were laid out to protect from noise and to enhance residential privacy; many also had their own water wells, probably both for sanitary and for ritual purposes. These ancient cities were unique in that they often had drainage systems, seemingly tied to a well-developed ideal of urban sanitation. Cities laid out on the grid plan <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> outgrowth of agriculture based on rectangular fields.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Ambassadors {{became the}} Detroit Jr. Wings in 1992 {{to put them}} in a state of {{popularity}} with the NHL's Red Wings. The owner of the Detroit Red Wings Mike Ilitch and the owner of the Detroit Jr. Red Wings Peter Karmanos had an ongoing feud. Notably, the Jr. Red Wing and Red Wings both shared the Joe Louis Arena. The rivalry between Ilitch and Karmanos boiled over, and the Jr. Red Wings were unceremoniously evicted from the Joe Louis Arena. When Karmanos bought the Hartford Whalers, the team became the Detroit Whalers, but played out of the tiny Oak Park Arena and the Palace of Auburn Hills, the latter of which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> appropriate venue for the NHL Whalers. Karmanos then had his own arena for his team constructed, Compuware Arena. In 1997, the Detroit Whalers became the Plymouth Whalers, simply because the team played out of Plymouth, Michigan.|$|E

25|$|On 16 of June, the II. corps {{commanded}} by Colonel Lajos Asbóth started their attack, and occupied Zsigárd, Királyrév and Negyed, but than the imperial counterattack with superior troops {{forced them to}} retreat on their initial positions. One unit of the II. corps managed to build a bridge across the Vág at Negyed, and defended it against the enemy attacks. This <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> occasion to the III. corps led by General Károly Knezić to cross Vág {{and to try to}} fulfill their tasks according to the battle plan, but the Hungarian General refused to move, despite the demands of his officers. The attack of the I. corps against the imperials entrenched on the Eastern banks of the Vág at Sempte resulted in a grave defeat. The Hungarian Kosztolányi division which was in Csallóköz advanced to Patas, where it took position. So the Hungarian attack of 16 June ended mostly unsuccessful. Hearing this, Görgei decided to order another attack on 20 June.|$|E
25|$|A {{suggested}} possible naturalistic {{explanation of}} the biblical devouring fire is that Sinai <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> erupting volcano; this has been suggested by Charles Beke, Sigmund Freud, and Immanuel Velikovsky, among others. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai peninsula and Seir, but would make a number of locations in north western Saudi Arabia reasonable candidates. In 1873, Charles Beke proposed that Sinai was the Jabal al-Nour (meaning mountain of light), a volcanic mountain at {{the northern end of}} the Gulf of Aqaba, and which has great significance in Islam for other reasons; Beke died during the following year, but his writings (published posthumously) retracted this identification four years later in favour of Jebel Baggir, with Horeb being argued to be a different mountain - the nearby Jebel Ertowa. Beke's suggestions have not found as much scholarly support as the candidature of Hala-'l Badr; the equation of Sinai with Hala-'l Badr has been advocated by Alois Musil in the early 20th century, Jean Koenig in 1971, and Colin Humphreys in 2003, among others.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{outbreak}} of the English Civil War in 1642, no English troops were available to put down the uprising and the rebels were left in control of most of Ireland. The Catholic majority briefly ruled the country as Confederate Ireland (1642–1649) during the subsequent Wars of the Three Kingdoms in Britain and Ireland. The Confederate regime allied themselves with Charles I and the English Royalists, though they did not sign a formal treaty with them until 1649. Had the Royalists won the English Civil War, the result <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> autonomous Catholic ruled Ireland. However, the Royalists were defeated by the Parliamentarians, Charles I was executed and Oliver Cromwell re-conquered Ireland in 1649–1653 on behalf of the English Commonwealth. The Cromwellian conquest of Ireland was marked by atrocities, such as the massacre of the Royalist garrison at the Siege of Drogheda in 1649. Another policy implemented by the Cromwellian regime was the deportation of prisoners of war to the West Indies. Even worse was a scorched earth policy carried out by Parliamentarian commanders to subdue Irish guerrilla fighters, which caused famine throughout the country.|$|E
