5|$|In stage three, Tom Dumoulin, who {{was second}} in the points <b>classification,</b> wore the green jersey, because first-placed Esteban Chaves wore the red jersey {{as leader of the}} general <b>classification.</b> For the same reason, Walter Pedraza, second in the {{mountains}} <b>classification</b> and Nicolas Roche, third in the combination <b>classification</b> (second-placed Dumoulin already wore the green jersey), wore the polka dot jersey and the white jersey respectively.|$|E
5|$|In stage two, Alexander Kristoff, who {{was second}} in the points <b>classification,</b> wore the green jersey, because Marcel Kittel wore the yellow jersey {{as leader of the}} general <b>classification</b> during that stage. Additionally, Danny van Poppel, who {{was second in}} the young rider <b>classification,</b> wore the white jersey, because Marcel Kittel wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general <b>classification</b> during that stage.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} the term is {{somewhat}} vague as it was used in many contexts: forest <b>classifications</b> (Loucks, 1962), biome <b>classifications</b> (Bailey, 1976, 2014), biogeographic <b>classifications</b> (WWF/Global 200 scheme of Olson & Dinerstein, 1998), etc.|$|R
5|$|In stage two, Cadel Evans, who {{was second}} in the points <b>classification,</b> wore the green jersey, as Philippe Gilbert held the general <b>classification</b> {{as well as the}} points <b>classification</b> and the {{mountains}} <b>classification.</b> Thor Hushovd, who was third in both the general and points classifications, wore the polka dot jersey.|$|E

5|$|The final <b>classification</b> {{was a team}} <b>classification.</b> The team's time on {{each was}} {{calculated}} by taking the best three riders from that team and adding their times together; {{the team with the}} lowest cumulative time was the leader of the <b>classification.</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of aids for programming, errors in programming development remain, and often prove very costly. Much more work is required in error management. This paper shows how error <b>classifications</b> can provide useful error management information. A number of error <b>classifications</b> already exist. Along with {{looking at some of}} these existing <b>classifications,</b> two <b>classifications</b> of looping errors are presented in this paper. The motivation behind the developed <b>classifications</b> is to relate a task under development to an existing repository of programming information which is stored according to the developed <b>classifications.</b> The relation of such information may assist one or more users working on the same or similar programming tasks...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} <b>classifications</b> in powerlifting {{determining}} rank. These typically include Elite, Master, Class I,II,III,IV. The Elite standard {{is considered to}} be within the top 1% of competing powerlifters. Several standards exist, including the United States Powerlifting Association <b>classifications,</b> the IPF/USAPL (single-ply) <b>classifications,</b> the APF (multi-ply) <b>classifications,</b> and the Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU, raw) <b>classifications.</b> Countries in the former Soviet Union use a somewhat different nomenclature for the top classes, distinguishing among Masters of sport, International Class; Masters of Sport; and Candidates for Master of Sport.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, {{a pair of}} Chinese {{scholars}} published {{analysis of}} climate <b>classifications</b> between 1950 and 2010, finding that more than 5% of all land area worldwide had moved from wetter and colder <b>classifications</b> to drier and hotter <b>classifications.</b>|$|R
5|$|The final <b>classification</b> was {{the young}} riders <b>classification.</b> This {{was based on the}} general classification: the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990 was the leader of the <b>classification</b> and was awarded a white jersey.|$|E
5|$|The final {{individual}} <b>classification</b> was {{the combination}} <b>classification.</b> This {{was calculated by}} adding up each rider's position on the other three individual classifications.

40|$|<b>Classifications</b> {{serve as}} shared systems to {{organize}} and handle knowledge in a given domain. They act as infrastructures that "[enforce] a certain understanding of context, place, and time". We therefore look at <b>classifications</b> as {{being one of the}} means to "establish, maintain, and transform mechanisms of power", while these same mechanisms of power are at the same time deeply inscribed into <b>classifications.</b> This mutual dependency of power and <b>classifications</b> raises the question how changes in the roles of the actors who negotiate <b>classifications</b> affect and maybe challenge power relations and hegemonies in a wider sense...|$|R

40|$|Occupation and {{industry}} <b>classifications</b> categorize occupations and industries into clearly defined groups. As such {{they provide a}} common basis for collecting, presenting, and comparing of labour statistics. Occupational <b>classifications</b> group people based on job and tasks performed, and are commonly used in sociology and population studies. Industry <b>classifications</b> group people based on the {{sector of economic activity}} in which they are employed and are mainly used for economic analysis. Although not primarily developed for use in epidemiological studies, occupation <b>classifications,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} industry <b>classifications,</b> are often used in this field. Population-based epi-demiological studies frequently include questions about job title and specific tasks, after which the information is coded using either national or international <b>classifications...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several reverse {{engineering}} techniques classify software system components into subsystems. These techniques {{are designed to}} discover such <b>classifications</b> when the <b>classifications</b> are unknown. The techniques are tested and evaluated, however, by matching the <b>classifications</b> they recover against expected <b>classifications.</b> Several such techniques may be compared by experimentally evaluating their performance on {{the same set of}} software systems. Two things are needed to ensure experiment repeatability: (1) a set of "real-world" software systems whose expected subsystem <b>classifications</b> are known, and (2) an objective criterion to quantitatively determine the similarity of subsystem <b>classifications.</b> This paper contributes to both needs by identifying a set of widely used and easily accessible software systems whose modular decomposition either is documented or can be easily inferred from their design philosophy, and by presenting a measure to quantitatively determine the congruence between hierarchical subsystem <b>classifications...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to a {{study done}} in 1927, the Dewey system {{was used in the}} US in {{approximately}} 96% of responding public libraries and 89% of the college libraries. After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931, administration of the <b>classification</b> was under the Decimal <b>Classification</b> Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation, and the editorial body was the Decimal <b>Classification</b> Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association (ALA), Library of Congress, and Forest Press. By the 14th edition in 1942, the Dewey Decimal <b>Classification</b> index was over 1,900 pages in length and was published in two volumes.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points <b>classification.</b> Riders won points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 on each stage. Flat stages award more points that mountainous stages, meaning that this <b>classification</b> tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints. The winner of the points <b>classification</b> won the red jersey.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a sprints <b>classification,</b> the leader of which was awarded a white jersey. In the sprints <b>classification,</b> riders {{received}} points for finishing {{in the top three}} at intermediate sprint points during each stage. There was also a mountains <b>classification,</b> the leadership of which was marked by a red jersey. Points for this <b>classification</b> were won by the first riders to the top of each categorised climb, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs.|$|E

40|$|Equal {{protection}} heightened scrutiny jurisprudence currently privilegesthe talismanic <b>classifications</b> of race and, to {{a lesser}} extent, sex.

Commonalities between thetwo paradigm <b>classifications</b> thus play a powerful gatekeeping role. Two commonalities emphasized by the courts are that race and sexostensibly mark individuals with immutable and visible traits. Aclassification will therefore {{be less likely to}} receive heightened scrutiny ifits defining traits can be altered or concealed. By withholding protectionfrom these <b>classifications,</b> the judiciary is subtly encouraging groupscomprised by such <b>classifications</b> to assimilate by changing or hiding theirdefining characteristic. This is an assimilationist bias in equal protection,which I will critique in this Article...|$|R
