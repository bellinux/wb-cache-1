40|$|Parties can <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> (request <b>a</b> recusal) {{when they}} have reasons to believe that <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> is not impartial. In {{practice}} this procedure is sometimes abused by lawyers who, for example, want to delay proceedings. Countries have taken different measures to deter the improper use of the procedure to request a recusal, like fines for dismissed requests, or immediately dismissing evidently unfounded requests. In a laboratory experiment we {{examine the effects of}} a summary review whether <b>a</b> <b>challenge</b> is evidently unfounded, with or without fines. We find that a review without fine improves legal protection in practice as well as efficiency by reducing unfounded challenges and increasing <b>challenges</b> that have <b>a</b> substantial chance of success.

50|$|Not all Christians {{interpret}} this reading as forbidding {{all types of}} oaths, however. Opposition to oath-taking among some groups of Christian caused many problems for these groups throughout their history. Quakers were frequently imprisoned because of their refusal to swear loyalty oaths. Testifying in court was also difficult; George Fox, Quakers' founder, famously <b>challenged</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> who {{had asked him to}} swear, saying that he would do so once the judge could point to any Bible passage where Jesus or his apostles took oaths. (The judge could not, but this did not allow Fox to escape punishment.) Legal reforms from the 18th century onwards mean that everyone in the United Kingdom now has the right to make a solemn affirmation instead of an oath. The United States has permitted affirmations since it was founded; it is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Only President Franklin Pierce has chosen to affirm rather than swear at his inauguration.|$|R

40|$|The German law on plea {{bargaining}} (Verständigungsgesetz) {{is unique in}} comparison to its counterparts in other legal systems as it allows the judge to initiate the {{plea bargaining}} procedure in addition to negotiating the sentence with the prosecutor and the defense counsel. Due {{to the design of}} the judge's role in the German law on plea bargaining the principle of judicial impartiality - being {{one of the oldest and}} most significant principles in criminal procedure - faces considerable challenges. Up until now, legal scholars and practitioners have discussed the issue of judicial partiality mainly as a symptom of the plea bargaining practice rather than its structural origins. Moreover, it is a widespread conviction that the right to <b>challenge</b> <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> for fear of bias as provided in section 24 of the German Code of Criminal Procedure serves as an adequate means to ensure judicial impartiality. The work at hand assesses the principle of judicial impartiality from the perspective of criminal procedure and constitutional law as well as from the viewpoint of legal history. In addition to the legal-normative analysis, the different role of the <b>judge</b> in <b>an</b> inquisitorial and adversarial procedure is discussed in the context of the political science theory of a reactive and proactive state. Comparing the role of the judge in German, Italian and US-American plea bargaining, the safeguards for implementing the principle of judicial impartiality in an inquisitorial and adversarial legal system are further elaborated. Finally, the work contributes to the legal policy debate by seeking for alternatives to conceptualize the role of the judge in plea bargaining in compliance with the principle of judicial impartiality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the adjuvant effects of dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA), CpG oligodeoxy-nucleotides (CpG-ODN), and chicken interferon-γ (ChIFN-γ) on a DNA vaccine (pcDNA-VP 243) against the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). A plasmid encoding chicken IFN-ã was constructed. Twice at 2 -week intervals, two-week-old chickens were injected intramuscularly and intraperitoneally with either a DNA vaccine alone or a DNA vaccine together with the respective adjuvants. On week 2 after the second immunization, the chickens were orally challenged with the highly virulent IBDV. The groups that received the DNA vaccines plus either DDA or CpG-ODN showed significantly lower survival rates than the group that received the DNA vaccine alone. However, the survival rates for the DNA vaccine alone and for the DNA vaccine plus ChIFN-γ were similar. The chickens had no detectable antibodies to the IBDV before the challenge but all the surviving chickens in all groups except for the normal control group showed the induction of antibodies to the IBDV at day 10 after the <b>challenge.</b> <b>As</b> <b>judged</b> by the lymphocyte proliferation assays using the a WST- 8 solution performed on the peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes, the stimulation indices (SI) of the peripheral blood lymphocytes in all groups except for the normal control group were similar immediately before the challenge. At 10 days post-challenge, the SI for DNA vaccine plus either CpG-ODN or ChIFN-γ {{was similar to that}} of the DNA vaccine control group. For splenic lymphocytes, the SI in the DNA vaccine plus CpG-ODN and DNA vaccine plus ChIFN-γ groups were higher than for the DNA vaccine control. These results suggest that DDA actually compromises the protection against the IBDV by DNA vaccine, and CpG-ODN and IFN-γ had no significant effect. Key words: chicken IFN-γ, CpG-ODN, DDA, DNA vaccine, infectious bursal disease viru...|$|R
40|$|When <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> or jury is {{presented}} with {{evidence in a}} criminal trial, they must apply some sort of reasoning process to draw a conclusion from this evidence. For instance, from a witness testimony they might conclude that the suspect was at the crime scene, and from fingerprints on a murder weapon they might conclude that the suspect used the weapon. With the rise of modern forensic techniques such as DNA profiling, such legal evidence often comes {{with some sort of}} probabilistic information. For example, when forensic experts report on a DNA match, they will typically report a so-called random match probability: the probability that the match would be found if the suspect were not the source of the DNA trace that was tested. <b>A</b> <b>challenging</b> task for <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> or jury is {{to take into account the}} whole case, while incorporating probabilistic information on elements of the case. In this thesis we developed a method in which probabilistic evidence can be modelled in the context of scenarios. Scenarios provide an intuitive way for <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> or jury to make sense of the case as a whole. Using so-called Bayesian networks as an existing modelling technique, in our method scenarios are used to construct a probabilistic model of the case and scenarios can also be used to explain this model to <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> or jury. Our proposed method lays the foundations for a software support system, for instance in the form of a computer programme to support <b>a</b> <b>judge</b> or jury in their reasoning process...|$|R

40|$|The 1958 Constitution is France’s fifteenth {{since the}} Great Revolution. Over {{two centuries of}} turmoil and change, one feature of French constitutionalism {{remained}} remarkably stable: the sovereignty of la Loi within the juridical order. In the Republican tradition, Parliamentary acts were understood to incarnate la Volonté générale, and la Volonté générale comprised its own higher law ideology. Separation of powers doctrines subjugated the courts to legislative authority, prohibiting the judicial review of statutes. Under the Fifth Republic, Parliament lost its centrality, but legislative sovereignty remained intact in an important formal sense. Statutes could only enter into force {{with the consent of}} Parliament and, once promulgated, no law could be <b>challenged</b> before <b>a</b> <b>judge.</b> On July 22, 2008, legislative sovereignty died a painless death, when Deputies and Senators gave the Conseil constitutionnel the power to review the constitutionality of laws on the books, in collaboration with the Cour de cassation and the Conseil d’état. The Council will now become a bonafide member of the family of European constitutional courts. The 2008 constitutional revision completes the “transformation” of the Fifth Republic, a process initiated by the Council’s 1971 “freedom of association” decision. The political parties have, in effect, ratified the “juridical coup d’état” that took place when the Council successfully incorporated a charter of rights into the Constitution. In this brief article, I examine the effects of this transformation on the exercise of legislative and judicial power, focusing on the authority of the Council within the constitutional order. Looking ahead, the 2008 revision will open a new phase {{in the evolution of the}} Fifth Republic, one of pluralism and fragmented authority in the process of protecting and developing fundamental rights...|$|R

40|$|T {{cells from}} mice painted with picryl {{chloride}} inhibit secondary IgG anti-TNP antibody responses of normal mice to the sensitizer. Like other suppressor T cells produced after painting which inhibit DNA synthesis and {{the generation of}} cytotoxic T cells, these cells could be produced in adult thymectomized mice but not by mice treated with high doses of cyclophosphamide (250 mg/kg). The cells had to be injected within 48 h of a primary painting to inhibit the response to challenge 2 - 3 weeks later. This associated with their ability to inhibit DNA synthesis in draining lymph nodes after a primary painting.
