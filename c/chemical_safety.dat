In a press conference held on February 17, 2008, one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004.|$|E

The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons, the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven, and the Hayes Lemmerz automotive parts plant explosion killed one, prompting the report. Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries.

40|$|In {{response}} to societal concerns about major disasters in the chemical process industries, chemical engineering departments have been attempting to incorporate <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> into their curricula. Pressure is also coming from ABET; the AIChE Program Criteria in EC 2000 require a {{working knowledge of}} the <b>safety</b> aspects of <b>chemical</b> processes. There are three ways of incorporating <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> into the <b>chemical</b> engineering curriculum: (1) a course or courses devoted to process safety, (2) integration of <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> into existing courses and (3) {{a combination of the}} two approaches. Having a separate course in <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> puts process safety in a prominent position in the curriculum, forces the students to focus on process safety, and is the best way to deal with certain safety topics such as toxicology, industrial hygiene, dispersion models and design of relief systems. However, the students may compartmentalize safety and treat it as a topic separate from their other chemical engineering activities. Furthermore, the students may not experience a “hands-on ” exposure to process <b>safety.</b> Finally, many <b>chemical</b> engineering departments do not have extra credits available in their curricula to permit a separate course in process <b>safety.</b> Integrating <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> into existing <b>chemical</b> engineering courses has the advantage of exposing the students to <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> “in context”. The unit operations laboratory and the process design courses are ideal settings for integration of process safety. The instructional materials developed by SACHE make it possible to spread aspects of <b>chemical</b> process <b>safety</b> throughout the entire chemical engineering curriculum. The biggest difficulty with this approach is getting all the chemical engineering faculty to follow through with the implementation...|$|R
