40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} storage methods on the {{shelf-life}} of dried beef product (Kilishi) were studied under ambient {{conditions for a}} period of forty-two days to compare traditional production and packaging system with a potassium sorbate (anti-fungal agent) treatment and modern packaging system. Changes in proximate composition and microbial counts for the control and treated samples were significant. Moisture and water activity results indicated that the experimental kilishi was sufficiently dried to minimize microbial growth. Fat oxidation levels measured by percent free fatty acid (FFA) on extracted fats were unacceptably high and may be a reflection of the quality of peanut <b>cake</b> <b>paste</b> added as a condiment in dried beef processing. A decrease in mineral nutrient of kilishi was also observed [...] Results suggest that treatment of kilishi with 10 % (w/v) potassium sorbate led to low and acceptable level of mould growth during the storage period, indicating that kilishi is not susceptible to excessive mould contamination. Aflatoxin levels far exceeded recommended safe limits and {{may be due to the}} peanut <b>cake</b> <b>paste</b> used as a condiment.

40|$|Kilishi, a {{traditionally}} sun-dried roasted meat product usually produced using raw meat, Tunkusa (a locally defatted groundnut <b>cake</b> <b>paste),</b> {{in combination with}} spices and condiments in the mix was produced after substitution with conventional defatted groundnut flour. This study was undertaken to establish the potential use of conventional defatted groundnut flour in place of Tunkusa in making a better quality and shelf- stable Kilishi. The yield, quality and storage stability of the product were evaluated using standard assay techniques. Yield was estimated as the ratio of weight of Kilishi over the fresh beef. Quality was {{measured in terms of}} proximate composition which included protein, fat, carbohydrate, fibre and ash contents, and the amount of calorie obtained from the Kilishi was calculated based on these constituents. Sensory quality attributes were also measured in terms of colour/appearance, flavour, crispiness, texture and overall acceptability. Microbial counts such as total plate, yeast and mould and coliform were measured. Storage stability was evaluated in terms of thiobarbituric acid (TBA), free fatty acid (FFA) and Peroxide value (PV) values prior and following storage in ambient (25 - 32 °C) or refrigerator (7 ± 1 °C) for 12 weeks. Yield of the Kilishi (GFK) produced from conventional defatted groundnut flour ingredients was 87. 3 % compared to 83. 7 % of traditionally defatted groundnut cake (Tunkusa) Kilishi (TK) (control).

Many of the Yokuts' {{mortar and pestle}} sites are still visible today {{in the form of}} rounded depressions on granite outcrops along the river. They claimed the water rights of the entire Kaweah, although tribes from the Mono Basin east of the Sierra Nevada came over the Sierra and settled in the high mountain valleys of the Kaweah. Mineral King, a valley on the East Fork Kaweah River, was a summer settlement for the Yokut. However, years before the arrival of Europeans, the valley became taboo to them for an unknown reason.|$|R

50|$|Leverhulme's {{plan was}} to build an ice-making plant in Stornoway, {{building}} refrigerated cargo ships to take fish to a depot at Fleetwood, where he would build herring-curing facilities, a canning factory and a plant installed to make fish <b>cakes,</b> fish <b>paste,</b> glue, animal feed and fertiliser. To create a market for the fish, he started buying up independent fishmongers throughout Britain, rebranding them Mac Fisheries. But in 1919, servicemen demobilised from World War I and promised land, started occupying plots on the Isle of Lewis. Leverhulme protested and took legal action against the people he considered squatters, but the Scottish Office took {{the side of the}} ex-servicemen, leaving Leverhulme's plan in tatters. Leverhulme announced that he would leave Lewis in 1923, offering to gift the Isle to the locals. But suspicion ran so high, that he was forced to sell again to long-term absentee landlords.|$|R

40|$|Objectives : This {{research}} examined about dietary therapy on the diarrhea {{based on}} the literary findings, for clinical treatment and prevention of the diarrhea. Methods : This Research examined on histories, compositions, applications, and effects of the diarrhea on about 100 cases of dietary therapy of the diarrhea from recent Chinese literatures Results : 1. Various vegetables, animals and mineral materials including herbs, grains, vegetables, fruits, food and drink {{were used for the}} dietary therapy. 2. Methods of the preparation for use as therapeutics were decoction, pulvis, gruel, medicinal wine, <b>cake,</b> tea, <b>paste</b> and gelatin and etc. 3. Frequently used materials were sesame oil, honey, ear mushroom, shiitake mushroom, kelp, walnut seed, hemp seed, groundnut, glutinous rice, apricot stone, yellow bean peel, radish, potato, spinage, and spring onion. Conclusion : Though dietary therapy for the diarrhea is not based on clinical or experimental data, but through experience. It is mostly based on Yin-Yang and five elements, visceral manifestation, channels and their collateral channels and chinese herbal medicine theories. If we use them properly according to oriental medicine method, it will be effective on treating and preventing the diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives: 5 -Hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF) {{is known}} as an {{indicator}} of quality deterioration {{in a wide range of}} foods. The current study covered 70 samples taken from domestically produced foods and drinks available on the Iranian market (including honey, jam, fruit <b>cakes</b> tomato <b>paste,</b> ketchup, syrup, fruit juice, canned fruit, ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk, instant coffee, and jelly powder). Materials and Methods: HMF levels were determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultraviolet (UV) detector. Results: The mean recovery values ranged from 84. 4 to 105. 8 %. Varying amounts (11. 42 - 929 mg kg- 1) of HMF were found in 48 out of the 70 (87 %) samples analyzed. High levels of HMF were mainly seen in commercial honey (20. 55 – 928. 96 mg kg- 1), jams (51. 10 to 245. 97 mg kg- 1), fruit cakes (nd- 171. 50 mg kg- 1), and ketchup (32. 70 - 72. 19 mg kg- 1). No HMF content was detected in UHT milk, instant coffee, and jelly powder. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that, apart from honey, a number of other food commodities, including those containing fruit and/or sugar, hold considerable amounts of HMF. Therefore monitoring of HMF levels in foods seems to be necessary...|$|R
50|$|Shizuoka oden is a {{variation}} of oden, a stew-like Japanese food consisting of fish <b>paste</b> <b>cakes,</b> boiled eggs, daikon, potatoes, kelp rolls, konnyaku, and other ingredients that are first boiled then kept simmering in a broth until consumption. Shizuoka oden differs from other types of oden in two ways: {{the preparation of the}} broth and the way every ingredient is skewered on a stick. The broth is made with beef sinew (instead of the dried skipjack flakes used in other types of oden) and seasoned with strong soy sauce. Because the simmering broth is only replenished rather than discarded, it takes on a very deep, brown-black color; but this process of adding new broth to old is what gives Shizuoka oden the distinctive flavor that many people find so delicious.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cocoa paste {{pressing}} has a function {{to separate the}} fatty component of cocoa from its <b>cake.</b> Cocoa <b>paste</b> is further processed into cocoa powder using grinding machine for cocoa cake. The cooled cone type of cocoa grinding machine is used {{to solve the problem}} of plug in the maschine caused by melting of fat in cocoa cake due to hot effect as a result of friction in the grinding machine. Grinding machine of cocoa has conical form of cylinder for grinding and stator wall wrapped by source of cold and closed with jacket wool. Research was conducted at Kaliwining Experimental Garden of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) using cocoa cake containing 26. 75 % originated from Forastero type of cocoa seed. The capacity and recovery of the machine was influenced by space between rotor cylinder and stator wall. Grinding machine operated at cooling temperature of 25. 5 o C and space between rotor – stator 0. 9 cm and the capacity of 187. 5 kg/hour with recovery of 200 mesh cocoa powder as much as 24 %. The maximum  power of machine required  was 2. 5 kW with efficiency of  energy transfer of 97 %. Results of proximate analysis showed that there was no change of protein content, but protein and carbohydrate content increased after processing, i. e. from 5. 70 % and 59. 82 % into 5. 80 % and 61. 89 % respectively.

50|$|Cutex {{produced}} the first nail tints in 1914. In 1917, using a “paint” derived from automobile paint finish, Cutex introduced a liquid nail polish. Prior to this time nail polish {{in the form}} of <b>paste,</b> <b>cake</b> or powder hadn’t change much from ancient times. By 1925, due to the example of Cutex, liquid was virtually the only type of nail polish. By 1928, Cutex introduced an acetone based nail polish remover, safe for home use, removing the last obstacle to mass adoption of nail polish. Its remover was sold in tandem with its newest liquid polishes. Then in 1934, Cutex released a new remover formulation called “Cutex Oily Polish Remover” that included special oils that mitigated the effects of acetone and conditioned nails and cuticles. Also introduced in 1934 was a new cream polish that was more opaque and glossier than other polishes on the market. Following that, in 1938 Cutex released the first nail treatment product. Called Polish Foundation, it was a treatment with wax that smoothed ridges, protected nails and allowed nail polish to last longer with less chipping.|$|R
5000|$|Poles though take small boxes {{containing}} chalk, a gold ring, incense and a {{piece of}} amber, in memory of the gifts of the Magi, to church to be blessed. Once at home, they inscribe [...] "K+M+B+" [...] and the year with the blessed chalk above every door in the house, according to tradition, to provide protection against illness and misfortune for those within. The letters, with a cross after each one, are said to stand either for the traditionally applied names of the Three Kings in Polish - Kacper, Melchior and Baltazar - or for a Latin inscription meaning [...] "Christ bless this house." [...] They remain above the doors all year until they are inadvertently dusted off or replaced by new markings the next year. On January 6, as in much of Europe, a Polish style Three Kings cake is served with a coin or almond baked inside. The one who gets it is king or queen for the day, signified by wearing the paper crown that decorates the cake. According to Polish tradition this person will be lucky in the coming year. Recipes vary by region. Some serve a French-type puff pastry <b>cake</b> with almond <b>paste</b> filling, others favor a sponge cake with almond cream filling, and yet others enjoy a light fruitcake.|$|R
