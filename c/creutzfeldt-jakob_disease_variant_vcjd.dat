40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{involved in}} human cellular susceptibility to prion infection remain poorly defined.

We have, therefore, examined the susceptibility of a human tonsil-derived follicular dendritic cell-like cell line (HK) to prion infection. HK cells were found to display a readily detectable, time-dependent increase in cell-associated abnormal prion protein (PrPTSE) when exposed to medium spiked with <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> brain homogenate, resulting in a coarse granular perinuclear PrPTSE staining pattern. Despite their high level of cellular prion protein expression, HK cells failed to support infection, as judged by longer term maintenance of PrPTSE accumulation. Colocalization studies revealed that exposure of HK cells to brain homogenate resulted in increased numbers of detectable lysosomes and that these structures immunostained intensely for PrPTSE after exposure to <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> brain homogenate. Our data suggest that human follicular dendritic-like cells and perhaps other human cell types are able to avoid prion infection by efficient lysosomal degradation of PrPTSE...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. The neurodegenerative <b>diseases</b> such as <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>diseases,</b> Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, Fatal Familial Insomnia, Kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} (or 'mad-cow' disease) and chronic wasting disease in cattle belong to prion diseases. By now there have not been some effective therapeutic approaches to treat all these prion diseases. Dogs, rabbits and horses were reported to be resistant to prion diseases. By the end of year 2010 all the NMR structures of dog, rabbit and horse prion proteins (X-ray for rabbits too) had been finished to release into protein data bank. Thus, at this moment it is very worth studying the NMR and X-ray molecular structures of horse, dog and rabbit prion proteins to obtain insights into their immunity prion diseases. The author found that dog and horse prion proteins have stable molecular dynamical structures whether under neutral or low pH environments, but rabbit prion protein has stable molecular dynamical structures only under neutral pH environment. Under low pH environment, the stable α-helical molecular structures of rabbit prion protein collapse into β-sheet structures. This article focuses the studies on rabbit prion protein (within its C-terminal NMR, Homology and X-ray molecular structured region RaPrP^C (120 - 230)), compared with human and mouse prion proteins (HuPrP^C (125 - 228) and MoPrP^C (124 - 226) respectively). The author finds that some salt bridges contribute to the structural stability of rabbit prion protein under neutral pH environment.

40|$|Jennifer T Burchell, Peter K Panegyres Neurodegenerative Disorders Research Pty Ltd, West Perth, Western Australia, Australia Abstract: Transmissible spongiform encephathalopathies or prion {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} neurological disorders characterized by neuronal loss, spongiform degeneration, and activation of astrocytes or microglia. These diseases affect humans and animals with an extremely high prevalence in some species such as deer and elk in North America. Although rare in humans, they result in a devastatingly swift neurological progression with dementia and ataxia. Patients usually die {{within a year of}} diagnosis. Prion diseases are familial, sporadic, iatrogenic, or transmissible. Human {{prion diseases}} include Kuru, sporadic, iatrogenic, and familial forms of <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker disease, and fatal familial insomnia. The causative agent is a misfolded version of the physiological prion protein called PrPSc in the brain. There are a number of therapeutic options currently under investigation. A number of small molecules have had some success in delaying disease progression in animal models and mixed results in clinical trials, including pentosan polysulfate, quinacrine, and amphotericin B. More promisingly, immunotherapy has reported success in vitro and in vivo in animal studies and clinical trials. The three main branches of immunotherapy research are focus on antibody vaccines, dendritic cell vaccines, and adoptive transfer of physiological prion protein-specific CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. Vaccines utilizing antibodies generally target disease-specific epitopes that are only exposed in the misfolded PrPSc conformation. Vaccines utilizing antigen-loaded dendritic cell have the ability to bypass immune tolerance and prime CD 4 + cells to initiate an immune response. Adoptive transfer of CD 4 + T-cells is another promising target as this cell type can orchestrate the adaptive immune response. Although more research into mechanisms and safety is required, these immunotherapies offer novel therapeutic targets for prion diseases.

40|$|Prion {{diseases}} are transmissible fatal neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and animals. A central step in disease progression is {{the accumulation of}} a misfolded form (PrP Sc) of the host encoded prion protein (PrP C) in neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. The involvement of peripheral tissues in preclinical states {{increases the risk of}} accidental transmission. On the other hand, detection of PrP Sc in non-neuronal easy-accessible compartments such as muscle may offer a novel diagnostic tool. Primate models have proven invaluable to investigate prion diseases. We have studied the deposition of PrP Sc in muscle and central nervous system of rhesus monkeys challenged with sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (sCJD), <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in preclinical and clinical stage using biochemical and morphological methods.

40|$|While the {{neuropathology}} of kuru is well defined, {{there are}} few data concerning the distribution of disease-related prion protein in peripheral tissues. Here we report the investigation of brain and peripheral tissues from a kuru patient who died in 2003. Neuropathological findings were compared with those seen in classical (sporadic and iatrogenic) <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (CJD) and <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD). The neuropathological findings of the kuru patient showed all the stereotypical changes that define kuru, with the occurrence of prominent PrP plaques throughout the brain. Lymphoreticular tissue showed no evidence of prion colonization, suggesting that the peripheral pathogenesis of kuru {{is similar to that}} seen in classical CJD rather than vCJD. These findings now strongly suggest that the characteristic peripheral pathogenesis of vCJD is determined by prion strain type alone rather than route of infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{hippocampus}} (HC) {{and adjacent}} gyri are implicated in dementia in several neurodegenerative disorders. To compare HC pathology among disorders, densities of ‘signature’ pathological lesions were measured at a standard location in eight brain regions of 12 disorders. Principal components {{analysis of the}} data suggested that the disorders could be divided into three groups: (1) Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Down’s syndrome (DS), sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> and <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> in which either β-amyloid (Aβ) or prion protein deposits were distributed in all sectors of the HC and adjacent gyri, with high densities being recorded in the parahippocampal gyrus and subiculum; (2) Pick’s disease, sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP- 43 immunoreactive inclusions, and neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease in which relatively high densities of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were present in the dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells; and (3) Parkinson’s disease dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and multiple system atrophy in which densities of signature lesions were relatively low. Variation in density of signature lesions in DG granule cells and CA 1 were the most important sources of neuropathological variation among disorders. Hence, HC and adjacent gyri are differentially affected in dementia reflecting either variation in vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to specific molecular pathologies or in the spread of pathological proteins to the HC. Information regarding the distribution of pathology could ultimately help to explain variations in different cognitive domains, such as memory, observed in various disorders...|$|R
40|$|The laminar {{distributions}} of the pathological {{changes in the}} cerebral cortex were compared in the prion <b>diseases</b> sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (sCJD) and <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD). First, in some cortical regions the vacuolation (‘spongiform change’) was more generally distributed across the cortex in sCJD. Second, there was greater neuronal loss in the upper cortex in vCJD and in the lower cortex in sCJD. Third, the ‘diffuse’ and ‘florid’ prion protein (PrPsc) deposits were more frequently distributed in the upper cortex in vCJD and the ‘synaptic’ deposits in the lower cortex in sCJD. Fourth, {{there was a significant}} gliosis mainly affecting the lower cortex of both disorders. The data suggest that the pattern of cortical degeneration is different in sCJD and vCJD which may reflect differences in aetiology and the subsequent spread of prion pathology in the brain...|$|R
40|$|Human prion {{diseases}} are rare fatal neurodegenerative conditions that occur as acquired, familial, or idiopathic disorders. A key event in their pathogenesis is {{the accumulation of}} an altered form of the prion protein, termed PrPSc, in the central nervous system. A novel acquired human prion <b>disease,</b> <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> is thought to result from oral exposure to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent. This disease differs from other human {{prion diseases}} in its neurological, neuropathological, and biochemical phenotype. We have used immunohistochemistry and Western blot techniques to analyze the tissue distribution and biochemical properties of PrPSc in peripheral tissues in a unique series of nine cases of <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> We have compared this with the distribution and biochemical forms found {{in all of the}} major subtypes of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> and in a case of iatrogenic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> associated with growth hormone therapy.

However, the situation of microglia in other genetic prion diseases such as fatal familial insomnia (FFI) and familial CJD remains less understood. The brain microglia was evaluated comparatively between the FFI, G 114 V and sCJD cases in the study. Methods: Specific Western blots, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent assays were used to detect the changes of microglia and ELISA tests were used for levels of inflammatory cytokines. Results: Western blots, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent assays illustrated almost unchanged microglia in the temporal lobes of FFI and G 114 V gCJD, but obviously increased in those of sCJD. The Iba 1 -levels maintained comparable in six different brain regions of FFI and G 114 V cases, including thalamus, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, parietal cortex, occipital cortex and temporal cortex. ELISA tests for inflammatory cytokines revealed significantly up-regulated IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNF-α in the brain homogenates from sCJD, but not in those from FFI and G 114 V gCJD. Conclusion: Data here demonstrates silent brain microglia in FFI and G 114 V gCJD but obviously increased in sCJD, which reflects various pathogenesis of different human prion diseases subtypes...|$|R
40|$|Prion <b>diseases</b> (e. g. <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (CJD), <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker {{syndrome}} (GSS), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI) and Kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE or `mad-cow' disease) and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cattles) are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. However, by now there have not been some effective therapeutic approaches or medications to treat all these prion diseases. Rabbits, dogs, and horses are the only mammalian species reported to be resistant to infection from prion diseases isolated from other species. Recently, the β 2 -α 2 loop {{has been reported to}} contribute to their protein structural stabilities. The author has found that rabbit prion protein has a strong salt bridge ASP 177 -ARG 163 (like a taut bow string) keeping this loop linked. This paper confirms that this salt bridge also contributes to the structural stability of horse prion protein. Thus, the region of β 2 -α 2 loop might be a potential drug target region. Besides this very important salt bridge, other four important salt bridges GLU 196 -ARG 156 -HIS 187, ARG 156 -ASP 202 and GLU 211 -HIS 177 are also found to greatly contribute to the structural stability of horse prion protein. Rich databases of salt bridges, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts for horse prion protein can be found in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{diseases}} (PDs) or {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} (TSEs) are {{a family}} of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. PDs are distinguished pathologically by spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss {{and the failure to}} produce an inflammatory response. A prion is a transmissible agent that is able to induce abnormal folding of cellular proteins in the brain, leading to brain damage and the characteristic signs and symptoms of the disease. Known prion diseases have long incubation periods, primarily involve the central nervous system, and are always fatal. The prototypic human PD is kuru. Other examples include <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (CJD) and <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (vCJD). Examples of animal prion diseases include bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cows, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer, moose, and elk. As of December 29, 2006, suspected or confirmed cases of human prion diseases are reportable by health care providers and laboratories to the Alaska Section of Epidemiology (SOE). The estimated annual rate of PDs in the United States is one case per one million persons; this rate has remained stable for over 20 years. Globally, 200 patients have been diagnosed with vCJD, including three residents of the United States, all of whom had previously lived for extended periods in the United Kingdom or the Middle East...|$|R
40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with the influence of the brain microcirculation {{on the development of the}} pathological changes in <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (CJD). Hence, the spatial correlations between the vacuolation, prion protein (PrP) deposits, and the blood vessel profiles were studied in immunolabelled sections of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum in two subtypes of CJD, viz., sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (sCJD) and <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD). In sCJD, both the vacuolation and the ‘synaptic-type’ PrP deposits were spatially correlated with the blood vessels; the PrP deposits being the more strongly correlated than the vacuoles. In vCJD, there were no significant spatial correlations between either the vacuolation or the diffuse-type of PrP deposit and the microvessels. By contrast, a consistent pattern of spatial correlation was observed in gyri of the cerebral cortex between the florid PrP deposits and blood vessels. In both sCJD and vCJD, the frequency of positive spatial correlations was similar in the different gyri of the cerebral cortex and in the upper compared with the lower laminae. In conclusion, the microcirculation appears to be more significantly involved in determining the pathological changes in sCJD than in vCJD. The spatial correlations of the florid PrP deposits in vCJD and the synaptic deposits in sCJD and the blood vessels may be attributable to factors associated with the microcirculation which enhance the aggregation of PrP molecules rather than representing a possible haematogenous spread of the disease...|$|R
5|$|Many {{different}} mammalian {{species can}} be affected by prion diseases, as the prion protein (PrP) is very similar in all mammals. Due to small differences in PrP between different species it is unusual for a prion disease to transmit from one species to another. The human prion <b>disease</b> <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> however, {{is believed to be}} caused by a prion that typically infects cattle, causing Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and is transmitted through infected meat.|$|R
40|$|We used {{different}} anti-prion protein (anti-PrP) monoclonal {{antibodies to}} capture either full-length or truncated PrP species and then used biotinylated lectin {{to compare the}} nature of the glycans on bound PrP species present in control, sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (sCJD), or <b>variant</b> CJD (vCJD) brains. When full-length PrP species in these three groups were compared, {{no significant difference in the}} binding of concanavalin A or Aleuria aurantia lectin was detected. However, the binding of Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA) to sCJD and vCJD samples was significantly increased. In contrast, when only truncated PrP species were compared, only vCJD samples had more RCA binding activity. Therefore, while most of the RCA binding activity in sCJD is restricted to the full-length PrP species, the RCA binding activity in vCJD is associated with truncated and full-length PrP species. Furthermore, the RCA binding activity in sCJD and vCJD samples is mostly associated with proteinase K-resistant PrP species, a known signature of infectious prion. Therefore, PrP species in sCJD and vCJD have dissimilar lectin immunoreactivity, which reflects differences in their N-linked glycans. These differences may account for the distinct phenotypes of sCJD and vCJD...|$|R
40|$|Six clinico-pathological phenotypes of {{sporadic}} <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> {{have been}} characterized which correlate {{at the molecular}} level with the type (1 or 2) of the abnormal prion protein, PrPTSE, present in the brain and with the genotype of polymorphic (methionine or valine) codon 129 of the prion protein gene. However, to what extent these phenotypes with their corresponding molecular combinations (i. e. MM 1, MM 2, VV 1 etc.) encipher distinct prion strains upon transmission remains uncertain. We studied the PrPTSE type and the prion protein gene in archival brain tissues from the National Institutes of Health series of transmitted <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> and kuru cases, and characterized the molecular and pathological phenotype in the affected non-human primates, including squirrel, spider, capuchin and African green monkeys. We found that the transmission properties of prions from the common sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> MM 1 phenotype are homogeneous and significantly differ from those of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> VV 2 or MV 2 prions. Animals injected with iatrogenic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> MM 1 and genetic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> MM 1 linked to the E 200 K mutation showed the same phenotypic features as those infected with sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> MM 1 prions, whereas kuru most closely resembled the sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> VV 2 or MV 2 prion signature and neuropathology. The findings indicate that two distinct prion strains are linked to the three most common <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> clinico-pathological and molecular subtypes and kuru, and suggest that kuru may have originated from cannibalistic transmission of a sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> of the VV 2 or MV 2 subtype...|$|R

40|$|Human prion {{diseases}} can occur as an idiopathic disorder (sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease)</b> {{or can be}} acquired, {{as is the case}} for <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> These disorders are characterized by the accumulation of a protease-resistant form of the host-encoded prion protein termed PrP Sc in the brains of affected individuals. PrP Sc has been proposed to be the principal, if not sole, component of the infectious agent, with its accumulation in the central nervous system the primary event leading to neurodegeneration. A major question remains as to whether self-propagating structural differences in PrP Sc might account for the clinicopathological diversity evident in <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> and whether different prion protein types underlie the existence of different strains of causative agent. Here, we describe the results of a large-scale biochemical study of PrP Sc from autopsy-proved cases of <b>variant</b> <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (n = 59) and compare these with cases of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> (n = 170) in the United Kingdom over the period 1991 to 2002.

We explore the relationship between spontaneous <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> and HIV. Case report: A 66 -year-old man with long-standing, well-controlled HIV infection presented with 3 [*]months of progressive, subacute neurocognitive decline. His symptoms included conceptual apraxia, apathy, memory impairment, and gait disturbance, and were initially attributed to depressive “pseudo-dementia. ” Unfortunately, the patient’s symptoms rapidly progressed and he ultimately succumbed to his illness.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with chronic and previously well-controlled HIV infection dying from a prion disease. Despite the very different epidemiology and pathophysiology of HIV and spontaneous <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease,</b> this case does raise questions of whether certain host genetic factors could predispose to both conditions, albeit currently, there is no clear causal link between HIV and spontaneous <b>Creutzfeldt–Jakob</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{molecular}} subtypes of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> {{have been}} identified and electroencephalogram and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers {{have been reported to}} support clinical diagnosis but with variable utility according to subtype. In recent years, a series of publications have demonstrated a potentially important role for magnetic resonance imaging in the pre-mortem diagnosis of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging signal alterations correlate with distinct sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> molecular subtypes and thus might contribute to the earlier identification of the whole spectrum of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> cases. This multi-centre international study aimed to provide a rationale for the amendment of the clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> Patients with sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> and fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging were recruited from 12 countries. Patients referred as ‘suspected sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease' but with an alternative diagnosis after thorough follow up, were analysed as controls. All magnetic resonance imaging scans were assessed for signal changes according to a standard protocol encompassing seven cortical regions, basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were evaluated in 436 sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> patients and 141 controls. The pattern of high signal intensity with the best sensitivity and specificity in the differential diagnosis of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> was identified. The optimum diagnostic accuracy in the differential diagnosis of rapid progressive dementia was obtained when either at least two cortical regions (temporal, parietal or occipital) or both caudate nucleus and putamen displayed a high signal in fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging magnetic resonance imaging. Based on our analyses, magnetic resonance imaging was positive in 83 % of cases. In all definite cases, the amended criteria would cover the vast majority of suspected cases, being positive in 98 %. Cerebral cortical signal increase and high signal in caudate nucleus and putamen on fluid attenuated inversion recovery or diffusion-weight imaging magnetic resonance imaging are useful in the diagnosis of sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease.</b> We propose an amendment to the clinical diagnostic criteria for sporadic <b>Creutzfeldt-Jakob</b> <b>disease</b> to include findings from magnetic resonance imaging scan...|$|R
