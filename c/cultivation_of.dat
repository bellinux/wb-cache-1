5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Banana <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> Musa acuminata, {{including}} hybridization, {{dates back}} to 5,000 BC, and possibly to 8,000 BC, in Papua New Guinea. Bees were kept for honey in the Middle East around 7,000 BC.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{studied the}} {{possibility}} of using phytoextraction as an alternative method for degradation of drug residues from the environment. Studied material - fluoxetine is one of the widely used antidepressant, whose consumption is extremely increasing. In relation, the danger of fluoxetine and its metabolites penetrating in the surface waters increases and aquatic and terrestrial organisms can be influenced. Sterile plant <b>cultivations</b> <b>of</b> maize (Zea mays) and pea (Pisum sativum) were cultivated on media containing fluoxetine (ca 15 mg/l), and cultivations were sampled every 24 hours for a period of one week. The decrease of concentration of fluoxetine in media was monitored by the reverse-phase HPLC/UV at 226 nm. The decrease of concentration was about 10 - 20 % per day in <b>cultivations</b> <b>of</b> pea and maximally 10 % per day in <b>cultivations</b> <b>of</b> maize. The ability of the plants to extract fluoxetine was a mean of 0, 03 mg per 1 g fresh weight maize and 0, 01 mg per 1 g fresh weight for pea...|$|R
5|$|A {{changing}} legal imperative (transatlantic {{slave trade}} outlawed by Britain in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire {{for political and}} social stability) led most European powers to support widespread <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in the Deep South, and along with it, the slave population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the Motul Ecological Park, the site was used for agriculture, specifically the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> maize. The site has been damaged several times by wildfires caused by uncontrolled stubble burning in 1986, 1987 and again in 1998. This last fire badly damaged the stelae in the site core.|$|E

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs.

The fruit bodies are readily overlooked as they blend in with their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts was {{originally}} inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family {{such as the}} Wampanoag, Narragansett, Nipmuc, Pocomtuc, Mahican, and Massachusett. While <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> crops like squash and corn supplemented their diets, these tribes were generally dependent on hunting, gathering and fishing {{for most of their}} food. Villages consisted of lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses, and tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{measures}} were {{undertaken by the}} Ayyubids to increase agricultural production. Canals were dug to facilitate the irrigation of agricultural lands throughout the empire. <b>Cultivation</b> <b>of</b> sugarcane was officially encouraged to meet the great demand of it by both the local inhabitants and the Europeans. Several new plants were introduced to Europe in trade with both the Zengids and Ayyubids, including sesame, carob, millet, rice, lemons, melons, apricots, and shallots.|$|E

5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The impetus for the <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the first}} {{published}} {{information on the}} <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> Dryandra appeared in the magazine Australian Plants in June and September 1961. D.sessilis was among the species treated, but as there was not yet any experimental data on cultivation, information was restricted to its aesthetic qualities and the soil in which it naturally occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{book has}} also become popular among {{political}} leaders and those in business management.

60|$|It appeared, {{that in the}} {{progress}} <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> and <b>of</b> increasing rents, {{it was not necessary}} that all the instruments of production should fall in price at the same time; and that the difference between the price of produce and the expense <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> might increase, although either the profits of stock or the wages of labour might be higher, instead of lower.|$|R

5|$|The crop {{substitution}} programs successfully {{encouraged the}} <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> tea, coffee, corn, and fruit trees, replacing the opium poppies {{that had previously}} been grown.

5|$|The fight choreographers Justo Dieguez and Andy Norman, {{used the}} Keysi Fighting Method or Keysi, which itself gained fame {{after it was}} used in the movie and its sequel, The Dark Knight; however, the method was {{modified}} in The Dark Knight Rises due to Batman's age and physical condition and in order to match Bane's fighting style.

50|$|Despite the {{presence}} <b>of</b> famous <b>cultivations</b> <b>of</b> lemons (the {{meaning of the}} city's name in Italian), the town's name is probably derived from the ancient lemos (elm) or limes (Latin: boundary, referring to the communes of Brescia and the Bishopric of Trento).
