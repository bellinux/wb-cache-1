50|$|One common {{reason to}} test the parity flag is to check an {{unrelated}} FPU flag. The FPU has four <b>condition</b> <b>flags</b> (C0 to C3), {{but they can not}} be tested directly, and must instead be first copied to the flags register. When this happens, C0 is placed in the carry flag, C2 in the parity flag and C3 in the zero flag. The C2 flag is set when e.g. incomparable floating point values (NaN or unsupported format) are compared with the FUCOM instructions.|$|E

This causes the control to go into ISR and check for the <b>condition</b> <b>flags.</b> The basic task of interrupt service routine includes acquiring instantaneous GPS data and creating an SMS with the coordinates of vessel within it. This SMS is sent through the GMS modem which is attached and thereby causing an SOS message to be broadcast.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{design of}} {{instruction}} sets {{is a fundamental}} aspect of computer architecture. A critical requirement of instruction set design is to allow for concurrent execution, avoiding those constructs that may produce data dependencies among instructions. Therefore, {{it is important to}} count on methods and tools for the evaluation of the behavior of instruction sets and quantify the influence of particular features of its architecture into the overall available parallelism. We propose an analysis method that applies graph theory to gather metrics to evaluate the impact of different characteristics of instruction sets as sources of coupling thus quantifying available parallelism. We present a case study using the x 86 instruction set and obtain some measures of the influence of <b>condition</b> <b>flags</b> in code coupling...|$|E

50|$|A {{half-carry}} flag (also {{known as}} an auxiliary flag or decimal adjust <b>flag)</b> is a <b>condition</b> <b>flag</b> bit in the status register of many CPU families, such as the Intel 8080, Zilog Z80, the x86, and the Motorola 68000 series, among others. It indicates when a carry or borrow has been generated out of the least significant four bits of the accumulator register following the execution of an arithmetic instruction. It is primarily used in decimal (BCD) arithmetic instructions.|$|R

The beginning of H forms the array of contexts. An assembly language-like program is called once for each coded or decoded byte with that byte as input in A. The final context seen by the COMP section is the computed context combined with the previously seen bits of the current byte.|$|R

For example, applying transformations to signed integer pixel co-ordinates without any overflow detection may result in pixels rendering at unexpected negative co-ordinates, summing a large array of signed or unsigned integers without overflow detection can result in bogus totals, or performing arithmetic operations on packed bitfields without overflow detection could result in corruption of data in adjacent bitfields.

5000|$|The X1 allowed {{conditional}} {{execution of}} every instruction, not just branches {{as is the}} case in most computers. A similar capability existed in the Zuse Z22 and the ZEBRA, and much later in the ARM architecture. The approach used in the X1 is more flexible than these others: it makes execution conditional on the current state of the <b>condition</b> <b>flag</b> that is set by a previous instruction if it includes a modifier for that purpose, but untouched otherwise. [...] As a result, conditional execution can be based on tests made some number of lines earlier, rather than being conditional only based on the result of the most recent arithmetic operation. This allowed for compact expression of programs. The following example demonstrates the loading of the value of memory at n into the accumulator A, calling a subroutine (which presumably uses that value in A), and finally setting A to be the absolute value of the number read: ...|$|R

No change in catalase activity was observed in either flag or basal leaves from these same plants.

40|$|We generalize {{the work}} of Fomin, Greene, Reiner, and Shimozono on {{balanced}} labellings in two directions: (1) we define the diagrams of affine permutations and the balanced labellings on them; (2) we define the set-valued version of the balanced labellings. We show that the column-strict balanced labellings on the diagram of an affine permutation yield the affine Stanley symmetric function defined by Lam, and that the column-strict set-valued balanced labellings yield the affine stable Grothendieck polynomial of Lam. Moreover, once we impose suitable <b>flag</b> <b>conditions,</b> the <b>flagged</b> column-strict set-valued balanced labellings on the diagram of a finite permutation give a monomial expansion of the Grothendieck polynomial of Lascoux and Schützenberger.

Two varieties (IR 72 and IR 65598 - 112 - 2 [BSI 206]) were grown {{in the field in}} the Philippines during the dry season under highly irrigated, well-fertilized <b>conditions.</b> <b>Flag</b> leaves {{were examined}} 60 and 100 d after transplanting. Because of the upright nature of 60 -d-old rice leaves, patterns of photosynthesis were determined by solar movements: light falling on the exposed surface in the morning, a low incident angle of irradiance at midday, and light striking {{the opposite side of the}} leaf blade in the afternoon. There was an early morning burst of CO 2 assimilation and high levels of saturation of photosystem II electron transfer as incident irradiance reached a maximum level. However, by midday the photochemical efficiency increased again almost to maximum. Leaves that were 100 d old possessed a more horizontal orientation and were found to suffer greater levels of photoinhibition than younger leaves, and this was accompanied by increases in the de-epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle. Older leaves had significantly lower chlorophyll content but only slightly diminished photosynthesis capacity...|$|R
