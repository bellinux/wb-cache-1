40|$|The greater cane rat is a {{recently}} domesticated monogastric herbivore, {{and the importance}} of the caecum in the functioning of its digestive tract has frequently been mentioned. This experiment aimed to study digestive anatomy and cæcal fermentation of the growing cane rat. Twenty four cane rats were used from weaning to 103 days of age. They received a pelleted diet contained 12. 5 % of crude protein and 16. 7 % of ADF. Twelve animals were in a collective pen while 12 others were bred in individual cages for growth and feed intake measurements. At weaning, 82 and 103 days of age, six animals were sacrificed for gut parameters measurements and <b>caecal</b> <b>sampling.</b> The growth rate increased with age (P 0. 05). The caecum represented the largest compartment of the digestive tract with more than 40 % of total gut contents. Acetate was the most abundant volatile fatty acid with more than 70 % of total, followed by propionate and butyrate. Acetate proportion increased with age (P 0. 05). It is concluded that the caecum has a major fermentative activity in the growing cane rat...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Owing to {{the spread}} of {{antibiotic}} resistance among human infectious agents, {{there is a need to}} research antibiotic alternatives for use in animal agricultural systems. Antibiotic-free broiler chicken production systems are known to suffer from frequent outbreaks of necrotic enteritis due in part to pathogenic type A Clostridium perfringens. Hop (Humulus lupulus) bitter acids are known to possess potent antimicrobial activity. Lupulone was evaluated for in vivo antimicrobial activity to inhibit C. perfringens in a chick gastrointestinal colonization model. Methods: Using a week- 2 per os inoculated C. perfringens chicken colonization model, C. perfringens counts in mid-intestinal and caecal contents were compared between chickens administered lupulone at 62. 5, 125 and 250 ppm in drinking water versus 0 ppm control. Results: At day 22, post-hatch intestinal C. perfringens counts of lupulone-treated chickens were sig-nificantly lower (P < 0. 05) than water-treated control groups in both jejunal and <b>caecal</b> <b>sampling</b> sites across all lupulone dosages tested. Conclusions: Lupulone administered through water inhibits gastrointestinal levels of inoculated patho-genic clostridia within the chicken gastrointestinal tract. Lupulone was effective within the chemically complex mixture of material within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby making this agent a target of further research as an antibiotic alternative for this and possibly other intestinal infections...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to improve the {{diagnostic}} applicability of genus- and serovar- (S. Enteritidis and S.

Peptone broth pre-enrichment cultures of the samples were tested by PCR. In faecal and <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> from broiler chicks a strong inhibitory action was frequently observed. This could be reduced markedly by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) acting as amplification facilitator. The results of testing pre-enrichment cultures from artificially contaminated faecal, poultry feed and poultrymeat samples (using S. Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium and S.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli among broilers {{at the time of}} slaughter in and around Bareilly, India. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were screened by conventional plating in modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar with incubation at 42 °C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions. The characteristic colonies were confirmed by morphological and biochemical characteristics and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) assay targeting lpxA gene. Results: Out of 100 chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>samples,</b> 32 yielded isolates with typical phenotypic of Campylobacter species. The hippurate hydrolysis test found to be positive for 2 isolates, categorized as C. jejuni and negative for 30 isolates. The mPCR assay targeting lpxA gene also confirmed 2 (6. 25 %) isolates as C. jejuni, and 30 (93. 75 %) isolates as C. coli. Conclusion: The present study showed broilers to an important source of Campylobacter in the region with predominance of C. coli than C. jejuni indicating a shift in the prevalence of important species of Campylobacter.

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between the incidence of salmonellas in pigs and feeding stuffs in England and Wales and in Denmark. In Denmark there is veterinary legislation requiring the sterilization of imported and home produced feed ingredients of animal origin. There is no such legislation in England and Wales. In Denmark 0 · 3 % of resterilized imported meat and bone meal was contaminated with salmonellas. This compared with 23 % of meat and bone meal in England and Wales and 20 - 27 % of other ingredients of animal origin. In England and Wales salmonellas were isolated from 7 % of <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> and 6 % of lymph node samples, while in Denmark they were isolated from 3 % of <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> and 4 % of lymph node samples. In England and Wales 25 serotypes were found in both pigs and feeds and these included nearly all the most prevalent human pathogens. In Denmark {{four of the six}} serotypes in pigs had been found in resterilized feed. One notable difference between the two studies was the very wide range of serotypes found in pigs in England and Wales and the narrow range in Denmark.

Although much {{is known about the}} mechanisms and route of Campylobacter spp. colonization in poultry the literature is scarce on antibiotic-free solutions to combat Campylobacter spp. colonization in poultry. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the role of TYPLEX® Chelate, a novel feed additive, in inhibiting Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) biofilm formation and reducing C. jejuni and Escherichia coli (E. coli) colonization in broiler chickens at market age. In an in vitro study, the inhibitory effect on C. jejuni biofilm formation using a plastic bead assay was investigated. The results demonstrated that TYPLEX® Chelate significantly reduces biofilm formation. For in vivo study, 800 broilers (one-day old) were randomly allocated to 4 dietary treatments in a randomised block design, each having 10 replicate pens with 20 birds per pen. At day 21, all birds were challenged with C. jejuni via seeded litter. At day 42, <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were collected and tested for volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, C. jejuni and E. coli counts. The results showed that TYPLEX® Chelate reduced the carriage of C. jejuni and E. coli in poultry by 2 and 1 log₁₀ per gram <b>caecal</b> <b>sample,</b> respectively, and increased caecal VFA concentrations.

40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to obtain data on {{microbiological}} contamination of pig carcasses and environments in three large-scale Italian slaughterhouses (identified as A-B-C) located in Northern Italy. Each slaughterhouse was visited six times. Five carcasses and three different sites of the slaughterhouse (before and during slaughter) were sampled on each sampling day. A single pooled <b>caecal</b> <b>sample</b> was taken on each sampling day. A total of 90 carcasses, 108 environmental <b>samples</b> and 18 <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were collected. Samples from pig carcasses and slaughterhouse environment were analyzed for Total Viable Count (TVC), Enterobacteriaceae count (EBC) and Salmonella. The caecal contents were examined for Salmonella. Carcasses from slaughterhouse A presented the greatest TVC and EBC mean log value, whereas environmental samples collected during slaughter activities from slaughterhouse C showed the greatest TVC and EBC mean log value. As far as the environmental samples collected before slaughter activities are concerned, an average up to 6 log 10 CFU/cm 2 TVC in two slaughter plants (A and C) and 5 log 10 CFU/cm 2 TVC in one slaughter plant (B) was detected. Salmonella was recovered in two slaughterhouses (A and B). Four different Salmonella serotypes were detected in the positive samples (11). Within serotype S. Rissen and S. Typhimurium monophasic-variant isolates, two PFGE patterns were identified. The findings in this survey suggest that carcass contamination {{is influenced by the}} slaughterhouse plant and this could be a result of differences in line speed.

40|$|Examination of neck {{skin and}} <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> taken at a {{commercial}} processing plant from 15 randomly chosen poultry flocks showed that all flocks were contaminated initially with thermophilic Campylobacter spp., {{even in the}} apparent absence of caecal carriage. During processing, numbers of campylobacter on skin samples were reduced by between 10 and 1000 -fold. To improve hygiene control generally, chlorinated-water sprays were used to limit microbial contamination on equipment and working surfaces. In addition, chlorine concentrations in process water were increased and any unnecessary carcass contact surfaces in the processing plant were removed. When comparing flocks {{before and after the}} changes, it was found that numbers of campylobacter on packaged carcasses were significantly lower after the changes had been made (P 0. 001).

This study represents a proof-of-concept that the use of an existing collection of different immune-modulating poxviruses may represent an innovative tool in gut microbiome research. To this end, 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and RNAseq transcriptome profiling were employed as proxies for microbiota composition and gut immunophysiological status in the analysis of <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> from control mice and mice infected with various poxvirus types.

We here report the characterisation of the biotype and the resistance to antimicrobial agents of 60 strains of E. coli isolated from 150 rabbits affected by diarrhoeic enteropathy. Parasitological, bacterioscopical, bacteriological and histological examinations were performed on <b>caecal</b> <b>samples.</b> Biotyping was made according to CAMGUILHEM and MILON (1989), and the antibiotic resistance against 18 different antibiotics was evaluated using the Kirby-Bauer method.

Twelve different biotypes were identified, among which B 12 and B 14 biotypes were constantly present. Antibiotic resistance patterns varied considerably among the biotypes and within the same biotype among the rabbitries. Only fluoroquinolones resulted highly efficacious against E. coli. The results suggest to adopt quarantine measures for restocking rabbits in order to identify potential reservoirs of EPEC as well as to determine the prevalent biotype/biotypes and its/their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of 16 S-rDNA sequences {{to assess the}} bacterial community composition of a sample is a widely used technique that has increased {{with the advent of}} high throughput sequencing.

To address this, amplicons derived from 16 S-rDNA were generated from chicken caecal content DNA using different annealing temperatures, primers and different DNA extraction procedures. The amplicons were pyrosequenced to determine the optimal protocols for capture of maximum bacterial diversity from a chicken <b>caecal</b> <b>sample.</b> Even at very low annealing temperatures there was little effect on the community structure, although the abundance of some OTUs such as Bifidobacterium increased. Using shorter primers did not reveal any novel OTUs but did change the community profile obtained.

The present study aimed {{to identify the}} prevalence of Campylobacter in broiler flocks and meat contamination at retail shops, and {{determine the influence of}} semi-automated and wet market processing on Campylobacter contamination of neck skin samples. Samples were collected from semi-automated plants (n = 102) and wet markets (n = 25). From each batch of broilers, pooled <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> and neck skin samples were tested for Campylobacter. Broiler meat purchased from retail outlets (n = 37) was also tested. The prevalence of Campylobacter colonized broiler flocks was 67 %. The contamination of meat at retail was 59 %.

The E. faecium strains were isolated from <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> that had been randomly collected from six slaughterhouses. Moreover, between the sample collection in 1998 and the sample collection in 1999, virginiamycin and the macrolide antibiotics (of which erythromycin is a member) have been banned in The Netherlands from use in broiler feeds as growth promoter. In the logistic regression analysis we used the internationally accepted cut-off values to determine whether bacteria were resistant or not. In the survival analysis, inhibition of bacterial growth was the event and time to event was replaced by concentration of antibiotic to event. As a consequence, changes in the growth of bacteria can be tested over an entire range of concentrations and no cut-off value for resistance has to be determined. We performed the survival analysis by use of a Cox logistic model with an odds ratio (OR) for the increase of the odds of the basic hazard rate as outcome. Both the logistic regression and the survival analyses showed that resistance to erythromycin and virginiamycin decreased during the study period. In the logistic regression model the ORs associated with the fraction of bacteria inhibited by the antibiotics in 2001 as compared to 1998 were 3. 76 (2. 57 ¿ 5. 49) for erythromycin and 11. 65 (7. 68 ¿ 17. 66) for virginiamycin...|$|R

Rats (8 weeks old, n 40) were divided into five (n 8 each) groups and fed diets differing only in Fe concentration during an Fe-depletion period (12 weeks) and an Fe-repletion period (4 weeks) as follows: (1) Fe-sufficient diet throughout the study period; (2) Fe-sufficient diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet; (3) Fe-depleted diet throughout the study period; (4) Fe-depleted diet followed by 35 mg Fe/kg diet; (5) Fe-depleted diet followed by 70 mg Fe/kg diet. Faecal and <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were analysed for gut microbiota composition (quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing) and bacterial metabolites (HPLC), and intestinal tissue samples were investigated histologically. Fe depletion did not significantly alter dominant populations of the gut microbiota and did not induce Fe-deficiency anaemia in the studied rats. Provision of the 35 mg Fe/kg diet after feeding an Fe-deficient diet significantly increased the abundance of dominant bacterial groups such as Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium cluster IV members compared with that of an Fe-deficient diet.

40|$|Aims: This study {{evaluated}} the antibiotic-induced changes in microbial ecology, intestinal dysbiosis and low-grade inflammation; and the combined effect of four different Lactobacillus species on recovery of microbiota composition and improvement of gut barrier function in mice. Methods and Results: Administration of the antibiotic ampicillin for 2 weeks decreased microbial community diversity, induced caecum tumefaction and increased gut permeability in mice. Application of a probiotic cocktail of four Lactobacillus species (JUP-Y 4) modulated the microbiota community structure and promoted {{the abundance of}} potentially beneficial bacteria such as Akkermansia. Ampicillin administration led {{to a decline in}} Bacteroidetes from 46. 6 ± 3. 91 % to 0. 264 ± 0. 0362 %; the addition of JUP-Y 4 restored this to 41. 4 ± 2. 87 %. This probiotic supplementation was more effective than natural restoration, where the levels of Bacteroidetes were only restored to 29. 3 %± 2. 07 %. Interestingly, JUP-Y 4 treatment was more effective in the restoration of microbiota in faecal <b>samples</b> than in <b>caecal</b> <b>samples.</b> JUP-Y 4 also significantly reduced the levels of D-lactate and endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in the serum of mice, and increased the expression of tight-junction proteins while reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 6, MCP- 1, IFN-γ and IL- 1 β) in the ileum and the colon of antibiotic-treated mice. Conclusions: JUP-Y 4 not only promoted recovery from antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis, but also enhanced the function of the gut barrier, reduced inflammation, and lowered levels of circulating endotoxin in mice. Significance and Impact of Study: Consumption of a mixture of Lactobacillus species may encourage faster recovery from antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis and gut microbiota-related immune disturbance...|$|R

Using media supplemented with vancomycin {{an increase in}} the proportion of samples from Swedish broilers positive for vancomycin resistant enterococci has been detected. The situation at farm level is largely unknown. The aims of this study were to obtain baseline knowledge about environmental contamination with vancomycin resistant enterococci in Swedish broiler production and the association between environmental contamination and colonisation of birds. Methods Environmental samples were taken before, during and after a batch of broilers at three farms. Samples were cultured both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively for vancomycin resistant enterococci. In addition, caecal content from birds in the batch following at each farm was cultured qualitatively for vancomycin resistant enterococci. Results The number of samples positive for vancomycin resistant enterococci varied among the farms. Also the amount of vancomycin resistant enterococci in the positive samples and the proportion of <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> containing vancomycin resistant enterococci varied among the farms. Still, the temporal changes in environmental contamination followed a similar pattern in all farms. Conclusion Vancomycin resistant enterococci persist in the compartments even after cleaning and the temporal changes in environmental contamination were similar among farms. There were however differences among farms regarding both degree of contamination and proportion of birds colonized with vancomycin resistant enterococci. The proportion of colonized birds and the amount of vancomycin resistant enterococci in the compartments seems to be associated. If the factor(s) causing the differences among farms could be identified, {{it might be possible to}} reduce both the risk for colonisation by vancomycin resistant enterococci of the subsequent flock and the risk for spread of vancomycin resistant enterococci via the food chain to humans. </p...|$|R

The aim was to identify sources for cross-contamination within a flock and between consecutively slaughtered flocks. In this study, neck skin, scalding water, caecum and slaughter line samples were taken {{during and after the}} slaughter of 11 broiler batches. The neck skin samples were collected at four different stages of slaughter: immediately after defeathering, after evisceration, after the inside-outside washer and after cooling of carcasses. As general hygiene parameters the aerobic colony count and the number of Enterobacteriaceae of the neck skin and scalding water samples were determined. For each neck skin, scalding water and <b>caecal</b> content <b>sample</b> a semiquantitative determination of Campylobacter numbers (modified according to ISO 10272 - 3 : 2010) and Salmonella numbers (ISO/TS 6579 - 2 : 2012 (E)) was performed. For the swab samples of the slaughter line a qualitative detection of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. was carried out. Confirmed isolates were typed by sequencing the flaA gene (Campylobacter spp.) or by macrorestriction analysis by Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Salmonella spp.). The {{results of the present study}} indicate that contamination of carcasses occured especially after the slaughter of Salmonella- or Campylobacter-positive broiler flocks. In both slaughterhouses low Salmonella numbers from 0. 14 to 260 MPN/g (slaughterhouse A) or from 0. 14 to 470 MPN/g (slaughterhouse B) were detected in the positive caecal content and neck skin samples. The median MPN value of Campylobacter spp. in the neck skin samples was 3. 4 log MPN/g in slaughterhouse A and 2. 4 log MPN/g in slaughterhouse B. The differences between the individual process steps in the number of Campylobacter spp. were not statistically significant. Depending on the slaughterhouse the evisceration, washing and chilling process steps showed different and partly significant impact on the general hygiene parameters. Within each sample drawing one Salmonella serotype with matching PFGE profile (> 95 % similarity) or one to four Campylobacter flaA types were detected. In both slaughterhouses usually only one Campylobacter flaA type or Salmonella serotype dominated at various sampling points. In flocks where Salmonella or Campylobacter were detected in the <b>caecal</b> <b>samples,</b> related genotypes were also detected on the carcasses. By sampling three consecutively slaughtered flocks in slaughterhouse B, the same Campylobacter flaA types were partly detected in all three flocks. As potential sources of cross-contamination, the scalding water, the picking fingers and the evisceration equipment were identified. More research and technological development in the process of scalding, defeathering and evisceration is needed to reduce the risk of contamination in broiler slaughter...|$|R
40|$|The {{digestive}} tract of broiler chickens contains a highly complex microbiota, generally consisting of body beneficial bacteria and, in some cases, of pathogen bacteria. To reduce {{the quantity of}} pathogen bacteria, the structure of this microbiota can be changed by using some feed additives, such as probiotics. The purpose of the experiment was to establish {{the influence of the}} additional level of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota in broiler chickens. Probiotics administration (Lactobacillus paracasei J. R., Lactobacillus rhamnosus 15 b, Lactobacillus lactis y and Lactobacillus lactis FO was made in different combination and at different age of broilers, respectively hatching until 42 days and only in the last week growth. In addition to probiotics, two of the experimental groups used two synthetic aminoacids, namely L threonine and DL methionine, used in excess of the broiler chicken requirements. At the end of the experiment (42 days), <b>caecal</b> content <b>samples</b> were taken. After isolating the caecum, the <b>caecal</b> content was <b>sampled</b> in sterile cryotubes and frozen to - 80 °C pending DNA extraction. The resulting DNA was subsequently used to detect the differences between the groups with and without probiotics by examining the microbiota composition. At the beginning, the phylogenetic differences were analyzed to establish dominant genders. The investigations performed showed that the use of probiotic microorganisms in various combinations entails changes in the intestinal microbiota. The pyrosequencing method was used to quantify the abundance of microorganisms with probiotic potential in the microbiota composition. Also, the number of microorganisms with probiotic potential changes after the use of probiotic microorganisms...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{xylanase}} and cellulase supplementation in palm kernel meal (PKM) based diet on growth performance, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and the caecal bacterial populations of broiler chickens were investigated. Seventy five day old male Cobb broiler chicks were randomly allocated to three dietary treatment groups receiving T 1 (20 % PKM-based diet without enzyme), T 2 (20 % PKM-based diet with xylanase) and T 3 (20 % PKM-based diet with cellulase). Each enzyme was supplemented at an amount of 200 U/kg of feed. Weekly body weight gain and feed intake were recorded. All chickens were slaughtered on day 35 and the caecum content was aseptically collected for VFAs quantification and bacterial enumeration. Supplementation of xylanase and cellulase in PKM diets had different effect on the growth performance, the number of caecal bacterial population and VFAs produced. A significant reduction in the cumulative feed intake of birds fed cellulase-supplemented PKM compared to xylanse-supplemented and unsupplemented PKM diet was observed. However, the final body weights gain and cumulative feed conversion ratio (FCR) {{were not significantly different}} between the treatment groups. Determination of VFAs production of the caecal contents demonstrated {{a significant difference in the}} production of iso-butyric and n-valeric acid among treatment groups. The number of total viable bacteria, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coliform in <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were also enumerated. Significant difference was observed in the number of caecal bacteria population between the treatment groups. The effect of xylanase and cellulase on weight gain of broiler chickens was strongly related to the feed intake rather than due to the decrease in the number of pathogenic bacteria in the caeca. Xylanase supplementation was beneficial in enhancing cumulative feed intake, weight gain and FCR of the broiler chickens, but did not entirely reduce the number of pathogenic caecal bacteria. However, cellulase supplementation reduced all parameters observed for growth performance and the number of caecal bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The adult {{intestinal}} microbiota comprises a microbial ecosystem of approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, with specific bacterial communities holding distinct metabolic capabilities. Bacteria produce {{a range of}} bioactive compounds to survive unfavourable stimuli and to interact with other organisms, and generate several bioactive products during degradation of dietary constituents the host is not capable of digesting. This thesis addressed the impact of feeding potential probiotic bacteria and other dietary strategies such as pure fatty acids and prebiotics, on gut microbiota composition, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and modulation of metabolism in animal models. In the first experimental chapter (Chapter 2) a gas chromatography method for the quantification of SCFA was optimized and applied {{in the analysis of}} <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> obtained in animal studies described in other chapters of this thesis. In Chapter 3, t 10, c 12 CLA supplementation was shown to significantly alter murine gut microbiota composition and SCFA production rather than no supplementation. These changes were suggested to be extra factors affecting host lipid metabolism. Chapter 4 described the contrasting effects of CLA-producing strains, Bifidobacterium breve DPC 6330 and B. breve NCIMB 702258, on murine fat distribution/composition and gut microbiota composition, suggesting that these changes were most likely strain-dependent. In Chapter 5, dietary GABA-producing strain Lactobacillus brevis DPC 6108 was shown to significantly increase (p< 0. 05) serum insulin in healthy rats, leading to a second experiment using a type 1 diabetes rat model. Lb. brevis DPC 6108 administration did not change insulin levels in diabetic rats, but attenuated high levels of glucose when compared to diabetic control. However, an auto-immune-induced diabetes model was suggested as a better model to study GABA-related effects on diabetes. In Chapter 6 bovine milk oligosaccharides, 6 ’sialyllactose and Beneo Orafti P 95 oligofructose supplementations were associated with depletion or reduction of less favourable bacteria, demonstrating that ingestion of these oligosaccharides might be a safe and effective approach to modulate populations of the {{intestinal microbiota}}.

40|$|Abstract Background In the EU {{conventional}} cages for {{laying hens}} are forbidden beginning in January 2012, however concerns about a higher transmission rate of Salmonella in alternative cages {{systems have been}} raised. The extent to which cage systems may affect the intestinal microbiota of laying hens is not known, and different microbiota may demonstrate different resistance towards colonization with Salmonella. To investigate this, ileal and <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> from two experimental studies where laying hens were inoculated with Salmonella Enteritidis and housed in different systems (conventional cage, furnished cage or aviary), were compared using Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP). The distribution of genera in the microbiota in caecum was furthermore described by next generation sequencing of 16 S rDNA libraries. Results Hens in the same cage type developed similar T-RFLP fingerprints of the ileal and caecal microbiota, and these could be separated from layers in the other cages types. No {{significant difference in the}} fingerprint profiles could be observed between Salmonella positive and negative samples from same cage. By deep sequencing of 16 S rDNA libraries from caecum, 197 different Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) were identified, and 195 and 196 OTU respectively, were found in hens in aviary and furnished cages, but only 178 OTU of these were recovered from conventional cages. The ratio between the dominating phyla or families and genera in the microbiota remained fairly constant throughout the study. Faecalibacterium and Butyricimonas were the most prevalent genera found in the caecal microbiota of layers irrespective of the cage type. Conclusions Hens confined in the same cage group tend to develop similar microbiota in their ileum and caecum possibly due to isolation, while differences in the microbiota between cages may be caused by environmental or individual bird factors. Although the cages type had influence on composition of the microbiota in the layers by promoting higher diversity in furnished and aviary systems, we did not observe differences in colonization and excretion pattern of Salmonella from these groups. We suggest, that differences in group size and exposure to a more faecally contaminated environment in the alternative systems may explain the observed differences in diversity of the caecal microbiota. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Campylobacter jejuni is {{the leading}} {{bacterial}} food-borne pathogen within the European Union (EU), and poultry meat is the primary route for transmission to humans. Material and methods: This study examined the impact of partial depopulation (thinning), season, and farm performance (economic, hygiene, and biosecurity) on Campylobacter prevalence in Irish broilers over a 13 -month period. Ten <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were taken per flock, {{for a total of}} 211 flocks from 23 farms during the duration of the study. Campylobacter was isolated and enumerated according to modified published ISO methods for veterinary samples. Biosecurity was evaluated through a questionnaire based on risk factors for Campylobacter identified in previous studies. Hygiene compliance was assessed from audit records taken over the course of 1 year. All information relating to biosecurity and hygiene was obtained directly from the processing company. This was done to ensure farmers were unaware they were being monitored for Campylobacter prevalence and prevent changes to their behaviour. Results and discussion: Farms with high performance were found to have significantly lower Campylobacter prevalence at first depopulation compared with low-performance farms across all seasons (P≤ 0. 01). Peak Campylobacter levels were observed during the summer season at first thin in both the high- and low-performance groups. Campylobacter prevalence was found to increase to ≥ 85 % in both high- and low-performance farms across all seasons at final depopulation, suggesting that Campylobacter was introduced during the first depopulation. On low-performance farms, four biosecurity interventions were found to significantly reduce the odds of a flock being Campylobacter positive (physical step-over barrier OR= 0. 17, house-specific footwear OR= 0. 13, absence of water body within 0. 5 km OR= 0. 13, two or more broiler houses on a farm OR= 0. 16), compared with farms without these interventions. For high-performance farms, no single biosecurity intervention was identified as significant as this group had full compliance with multiple factors. High-performance farms had significantly better feed conversion ratios compared with low-performance farms (1. 61 v 1. 67 (P≤ 0. 01)). No differences in flock mortality rates were observed (P≥ 0. 05). This highlights the impact of season, biosecurity, partial depopulation, and farm performance on Campylobacter prevalence in Irish broilers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Following {{increased}} {{rates of}} human campylobacteriosis {{in the late}} 1990 's, and their apparent association with increased consumption of fresh chicken meat, a longitudinal {{study was conducted in}} Iceland to identify the means to decrease the frequency of broiler flock colonization with Campylobacter. Our objective in this study was to identify risk factors for flock colonization acting at the broiler farm level. Methods Between May 2001 and September 2004, pooled <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained from 1, 425 flocks at slaughter and cultured for Campylobacter. Due to the strong seasonal variation in flock prevalence, analyses were restricted to a subset of 792 flocks raised during the four summer seasons. Flock results were collapsed to the farm level, such that the number of positive flocks and the total number of flocks raised were summed for each farm. Logistic regression models were fitted to the data using automated and manual selection methods. Variables of interest included manure management, water source and treatment, other poultry/livestock on farm, and farm size and management. Results The 792 flocks raised during the summer seasons originated from 83 houses on 33 farms, and of these, 217 (27. 4 %) tested positive. The median number of flocks per farm was 14, and the median number of positive flocks per farm was three. Three farms did not have any positive flocks. In general, factors associated with an increased risk of Campylobacter were increasing median flock size on the farm (p ≤ 0. 001), spreading manure on the farm (p = 0. 004 to 0. 035), and increasing the number of broiler houses on the farm (p = 0. 008 to 0. 038). Protective factors included the use of official (municipal) (p = 0. 004 to 0. 051) or official treated (p = 0. 006 to 0. 032) water compared to the use of non-official untreated water, storing manure on the farm (p = 0. 025 to 0. 029), and the presence of other domestic livestock on the farm (p = 0. 004 to 0. 028). Conclusion Limiting the average flock size, and limiting the number of houses built on new farms, are interventions that require investigation. Water {{may play a role in}} the transmission of Campylobacter, therefore the use of official water, and potentially, treating non-official water may reduce the risk of colonization. Manure management practices deserve further attention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{concurrent}} rise in {{consumption of}} fresh chicken meat and human campylobacteriosis {{in the late}} 1990 's in Iceland led to a longitudinal study of the poultry industry to identify the means to decrease the frequency of broiler flock colonization with Campylobacter. Because horizontal transmission from the environment {{is thought to be}} the most likely source of Campylobacter to broilers, we aimed to identify broiler house characteristics and management practices associated with flock colonization. Between May 2001 and September 2004, pooled <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained from 1, 425 flocks at slaughter and cultured for Campylobacter. Due to the strong seasonal variation in flock prevalence, analyses were restricted to a subset of 792 flocks raised during the four summer seasons. Logistic regression models with a farm random effect were used to analyse the association between flock Campylobacter status and house-level risk factors. A two-stage process was carried out. Variables were initially screened within major subsets: ventilation; roof and floor drainage; building quality, materials and repair; house structure; pest proofing; biosecurity; sanitation; and house size. Variables with p ≤ 0. 15 were then offered to a comprehensive model. Multivariable analyses were used in both the screening stage (i. e. within each subset) and in the comprehensive model. Results 217 out of 792 flocks (27. 4 %) tested positive. Four significant risk factors were identified. Campylobacter colonization was predicted to increase when the flock was raised in a house with vertical (OR = 2. 7), or vertical and horizontal (OR = 3. 2) ventilation shafts, when the producer's boots were cleaned and disinfected prior to entering the broiler house (OR = 2. 2), and when the house was cleaned with geothermal water (OR = 3. 3). Conclusion The increased risk associated with vertical ventilation shafts might be related to the height of the vents and the potential for vectors such as flies {{to gain access to the}} house, or, increased difficulty in accessing the vents for proper cleaning and disinfection. For newly constructed houses, horizontal ventilation systems could be considered. Boot dipping procedures should be examined on farms experiencing a high prevalence of Campylobacter. Although it remains unclear how geothermal water increases risk, further research is warranted to determine if it is a surrogate for environmental pressures or the microclimate of the farm and surrounding region. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Deoxycholic acid (DCA), {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of gall stones and colorectal cancer, is mainly formed by bacterial deconjugation (cholylglycine hydrolase (CGH)) and 7 α-dehydroxylation (7 α-dehydroxylase (7 α-DH)) of conjugated cholic acid (CA) in the caecum/proximal colon. Despite this, most previous studies of CGH and 7 α-DH have been in faeces rather than in caecal contents. In bacteria, CA increases 7 α-DH activity by substrate-enzyme induction but {{little is known about}} CA concentrations or CA/ 7 α-DH induction in the human colon.  AIMS AND METHODS—Therefore, in fresh "faeces", and in caecal aspirates obtained during colonoscopy from 20  patients, we: (i) compared the activities of CGH and 7 α-DH, (ii) measured 7 α-DH in patients with "low" and "high" percentages of DCA in fasting serum (less than and greater than the median), (iii) studied CA concentrations in the right and left halves of the colon, and examined the relationships between (iv) 7 α-DH activity and CA concentration in <b>caecal</b> <b>samples</b> (evidence of substrate-enzyme induction), and (v) 7 α-DH and per cent DCA in serum.  RESULTS—Although mean CGH activity in the proximal colon (18. 3  (SEM 4. 40) × 10 − 2 U/mg protein) was comparable with that in "faeces" (16. 0  (4. 10) × 10 − 2 U/mg protein), mean 7 α-DH in the caecum (8. 54  (1. 08) × 10 - 4 U/mg protein) was higher (p< 0. 05) than that in the left colon (5. 72  (0. 85) × 10 - 4 U/mg protein). At both sites, 7 α-DH was significantly greater in the "high" than in the "low" serum DCA subgroups. CA concentrations in the right colon (0. 94  (0. 08) µmol/ml) were higher than those in the left (0. 09  (0. 03) µmol/ml; p< 0. 001) while in the caecum (but not in the faeces) there was a weak (r= 0. 58) but significant (p< 0. 005) linear relationship between 7 α-DH and CA concentration. At both sites, 7 α-DH was linearly related (p< 0. 005) to per cent DCA in serum.  INTERPRETATION/SUMMARY—These results: (i) confirm that there are marked regional differences in bile acid metabolism between the right and left halves of the colon, (ii) suggest that caecal and faecal 7 α-DH influence per cent DCA in serum (and, by inference, in bile), and (iii) show that the substrate CA induces the enzyme 7 α-DH in the caecum.    Keywords: deoxycholic acid; 7 α-dehydroxylation; gall stones; colorectal cance...|$|R
