We don't know what's going to end up on the album but it was an absolute you know honor... For me being such a fan for so long it was so exciting to hear her vocal in the room right next to me, <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head really sounding exactly like all those records we all love and she's a pleasure to work with because she's so in tune with who she is and what she wants to sing.

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cabin, the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E

50|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books had a {{religious}} or moral theme and her style was considered very true to life, with well drawn characters. Publishers <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books include Lee & Shepard. The wave of evangelical feeling that passed over New England consequent on the preaching of Dr. Finney, the evangelist, powerfully affected Baker, {{and turned her}} literary activities in religious channels. In the heyday <b>of</b> <b>her</b> success, the <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> books was looked upon as an event by her readers, and it was thought nothing remarkable to strike off an edition of 10,000 copies on the first appearance of a story whose title page bore the name of Madeline Leslie. Annual sales varied from 250,000 to 500,000.|$|R

She didn’t want to do it, {{but she had no}} choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
500|$|... "Theatricality" [...] was {{originally}} intended to air on June 1, 2010, but was switched in the schedule with the episode [...] "Funk". The impetus for the Lady Gaga tribute comes from Tina's conflict, with Ushkowitz explaining that the storyline reflects Tina [...] "slowly <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> box. Making {{her way out of}} her shell." [...] As well as allowing Glee the rights to her songs, Lady Gaga also loaned the series her costume designer to recreate her signature looks. Series creator Ryan Murphy, who also directed the episode, stated that, because of the elaborate staging and costuming, the performance of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was the show's most expensive number to date. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] took six hours to film, with Murphy describing it as [...] "big and athletic and hard." [...] Michele damaged her knee from exertion during the performance. In a statement released to Entertainment Weekly, Gaga eagerly anticipated the covers of her songs: [...] "I love Glee. I love the cast and the creativity of the writers. I went to a musical theatre school, and used to dream that someday the students would be singing my songs. Can’t wait for [...] "Bad Romance" [...] + [...] "Poker Face" [...] in Glee fashion!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mabui {{can leave}} the body, {{resulting}} in [...] with various physical results. [...] The 2002 Okinawan film Hotel Hibiscus portrays many traditional Ryukyuan beliefs; among them, that {{of the loss of}} mabui. [...] In the film, a young girl named Meiko loses her mabui after a fight with her father and a peaceful encounter with the ghost of her dead aunt. [...] She becomes unresponsive, only <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> trance-like state to talk again with her dead aunt. [...] This portrayal of the loss of mabui is somewhat accurate.|$|E

After listening attentively, Ulysses thanked his good friend, and resumed his way. But he had taken only a few steps, when, recollecting some other questions which he wished to ask, he turned round again, and beheld nobody on the spot where Quicksilver had stood; for that winged cap of his, and those winged shoes, {{with the help of the}} winged staff, had carried him quickly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight.|$|R

The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime. Her arms were long and lean, her shoulders uneven, and some of her teeth were <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth like tusks.... She did, however, have pretty eyes, nose, and a good complexion...." ...|$|E

50|$|Brooks {{wanted a}} famous actress from the 1950s {{to play the}} role of Mother, and {{originally}} offered the role to retired actresses Nancy Reagan and Doris Day. Day turned down the offer; Reagan loved the script and considered <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> retirement for <b>her</b> first acting role in more than 40 years, but decided instead to stay home and care for her husband, Ronald Reagan, who was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Brooks then asked his good friend Carrie Fisher if she could send the script to her mother, Debbie Reynolds, who accepted the part. Reynolds hadn't had a starring role since the late 1960s.|$|R

During the last years of their {{underground}} life, Dohrn and Ayers resided in Chicago, where they used the aliases Christine Louise Douglas and Anthony J. Lee. In the late 1970s, the Weatherman group split into two factions, the [...] "May 19 Coalition" [...] and the [...] "Prairie Fire Collective", with Dohrn and Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hiding, with members facing the criminal charges against them, while the May 19 Coalition remained in hiding.

50|$|According to Bill Ayers in {{the late}} 1970s, the Weatherman group further split into two factions — the May 19th Communist Organization and the Prairie Fire Collective — with Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hiding and {{establishing}} an above-ground revolutionary mass movement. With most WUO members facing the limited criminal charges (most charges had been dropped {{by the government in}} 1973) against them creating an above ground organization was more feasible. The May 19 Communist Organization continued in hiding as the clandestine organization. A decisive factor in Dohrn's <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hiding were <b>her</b> concerns about her children. The Prairie Fire Collective faction started to surrender to the authorities from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The remaining Weather Underground members continued to attack US institutions.|$|R

Chausson also enjoyed her teammate Laëtitia Le Corguillé taking home the silver in 38.042, as she finished the race behind the leader by nearly seven hundredths of a second (0.07) and also, handed the French squad a straight 1-2 finish on the medal podium.

People pay a lot to see you and orchestras line up to get you on their stage. But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be home ... eating ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary."
