5|$|The DB9 was {{facelift}}ed July 2008. This facelift {{was mainly}} {{the increase in}} engine power, to 350kW (476hp) and a redesigned <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> Externally, the DB9 remained virtually unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Building on the Omega, the SV6 is {{equipped}} with the more powerful High Output variant of the Alloytec V6 engine, coupled to a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Air conditioning, a key feature missing on the launch Omega, came standard on the SV6. A body kit and sports suspension similar to the V8 Commodore SS/SS V variants is also fitted. The SV6 sports the Performance interior look, characterised by an accentuated matte black <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> and red lighting, {{as opposed to the}} silver Functional-style interior of the Omega.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, wood grain highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for use when towing a boat or trailer for example.|$|E

50|$|Faurecia is the 8th largest {{international}} {{automotive parts}} manufacturer in the world; in 2013 it was #1 for vehicle interiors and emission control technology. One in four automobiles is equipped by Faurecia. It designs and manufactures seats, exhaust systems, interior systems (dashboards, <b>centre</b> <b>consoles,</b> door panels, acoustic modules) and decorative {{aspects of a}} vehicle (aluminium, wood).|$|R
50|$|Like the {{original}} concept car, its interior is heavily aviation inspired and available with two <b>centre</b> <b>consoles,</b> {{one of which}} is located on the roof directly above the other. With a head up display in front of the driver, the cabin is designed to resemble a jet aeroplane. Emphasising its links to aviation, and {{the original}} Citroën DS model, the carmaker recreated an old photoshoot of the car with Concorde.|$|R
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled <b>centre</b> <b>console,</b> plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
50|$|Jensen-Healey {{interiors}} {{started out}} comparatively austere and functional, with plastic <b>centre</b> <b>consoles</b> and all-black colour schemes. (Some earlier models do sport brown interiors, however.) In August 1973, aesthetic extras {{such as a}} clock, wood grain on the dashboard and glove-box and padding as well as air conditioning as an option were added. 1976 Jensen GT models went even further by offering an elaborate burr walnut wood dashboard and paisley-patterned cloth seats, with leather as an option.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{ergonomic}} adjusting {{capabilities are}} lacking on <b>centre</b> <b>consoles</b> of small high-speed crafts {{with respect to}} the crew height. The <b>centre</b> <b>consoles</b> are normally constructed to fit the mean height of the operators to cover as many end users as possible. Issues might therefore arise for the operators who deviate from the mean height. This master thesis report covers the design, implementation and evaluation of a set of mechanisms which are to enable the operator work space of an 8 -meter high speed craft to be longitudinally movable as well as ergonomically adjustable for operators with a length 160 to 200 cm, which include more than 90 % of the Swedish population. The resulting design is to make out a part of the Aevotec 800 which is an 8 -meter high-speed craft which is being designed by Poseidon Konsult. The development during the project included several phases; a concept phase, feasibility phase and the main design phase. The main design phase contains several cycles which were evaluated based by peak load calculations, fatigue analyses, ISO design calculations, design review/feedback sessions, anthropometrical measurement and mock-up/end-user review. Based on the executed evaluations of the project, a feasible system has been designed capable of handling the requirements set for the project. The superstructure has been successfully designed by ISO 12215 - 5 and fulfils parts of the DNV-GL regulations regarding ergonomics for high-speed light crafts...|$|R
40|$|An in-car {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine different input techniques for list-based scrolling tasks and the effectiveness of haptic feedback for in-car touchscreens. The use of physical switchgear on <b>centre</b> <b>consoles</b> is decreasing which allows designers to develop new ways to interact with in-car applications. However, these new methods need to be evaluated to ensure they are usable. Therefore, three input techniques were tested: direct scrolling, pressure-based scrolling and scrolling using onscreen buttons on a touchscreen. The results showed that direct scrolling was less accurate than using onscreen buttons and pressure input, but took almost half the time when compared to the onscreen buttons and was almost three times quicker than pressure input. Vibrotactile feedback did not improve input performance but was preferred by the users. Understanding the speed vs. accuracy trade-off between these input techniques will allow better decisions when designing safer in-car interfaces for scrolling applications...|$|R
25|$|Interior updates {{included}} velour highlighted door {{cards and}} seat trimming. A red theme across the dashboard displays, carpet and seat roping was standard as was a <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> Electric adjustable mirrors were also added.|$|E
25|$|November 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette GL {{with sports}} wheels with 175 x 70 SR tyres, bumper over riders, and higher {{equipment}} level including new <b>centre</b> <b>console,</b> front door pockets and velour interior door panels.|$|E
25|$|The {{landing gear}} is of {{tricycle}} configuration {{and all three}} sprung gear legs are made from 4130 chrome-molybdenum steel alloy. The nose wheel is free-castering. On early versions the nose wheel steering was by differential braking via two finger-controlled brake handles mounted on the <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> On later versions more conventional toe brakes were installed.|$|E
5000|$|Changes to Continental GT Speed include {{increased}} {{top speed}} to 331 kph mph, increased engine power to [...] and 840 Nm@2000-5000rpm, carbon fibre at fascia, <b>centre</b> and roof <b>consoles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rear 2 {{seats were}} {{individually}} reclining {{using the same}} reclining hinges and latches as the front seats except that the rear latches were in the middle.A <b>centre</b> padded vinyl <b>console</b> was between the 2 rear seats and the seat belts clipped into it when not in use.The spare tyre sat vertically at the very rear of the cargo area under a vinyl cover.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{versions}} {{were made}} in limited numbers. [...] "Black Line" [...] was sold with a pop-up sunroof, Hella clear rear lighs, tinted windows all-around, power door locks, tachometer, digital clock in the <b>centre</b> overhead <b>console,</b> smart intermittent wipers, leather-wrapped steering wheel and gearchange knob, Hella headlight washer, and a Blaupunkt stereo with 4 speakers. The car is recognisable from the all-black paint, and the factory 13" [...] Ronal F-Series alloy wheels. [...] "Silver Line" [...] was similar, only in metallic silver colour with a black fascia around the back window and the B pillars. These packages were available with both hatchback and estate body styles. [...] "Solitaire" [...] was very rare, including {{all of the above}} plus spoiler on the rear door, factory alarm system, power front windows and fuel injection. The other special versions came with either carburetted or fuel-injected engines.|$|R
25|$|A major {{facelift}} {{occurred in}} June 2001 (Phase 2) which saw the exterior restyled (most visibly the headlights were made more angular), the interior quality improved {{with a new}} dashboard and <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> including the availability of digital climate control air-conditioning and satellite navigation on top models and a 1.5L common rail Diesel engine added.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} interior {{builds on}} a deeply scalloped upper dashboard and simple <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> All {{of the main}} controls and displays are angled towards the driver in typical Italian sports car style, although this can sometimes be awkward for passengers who will struggle to see the interior clock. Despite being a family car, the interior design lacks cup holders, which normally come standard in saloons.|$|E
25|$|Also {{produced}} by Star Custom Vehicles, {{based on the}} Chevette L hatchback specification, with black, silver and orchid livery, colour impregnated front air dam, flexi rear spoiler, alloy wheels with locking option, head restraints, black four-spoke sport steering wheel, <b>centre</b> <b>console,</b> burled walnut fascia, hinged glove box and door capping, removable tinted glass sun hatch, and two-wave band radio / stereo cassette player with door speakers.|$|E
25|$|Suppliers for the 2006 Range Rover's {{components}} include Continental Automotive for {{the complete}} cockpit module which incorporates the Denso touch screen navigation unit. Continental also supply the <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> unit. Other suppliers include Alpine car audio for integrated head unit rear seat entertainment. Connaught Electronics Limited (CEL) provides the Rear View Camera (RVC) and Wireless Camera (VentureCam) systems and PTI telephone capabilities are provided by Nokia.|$|E
25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the front quarter panels.|$|E
25|$|The Gallardo LP 570-4 Super Trofeo Asia (亞洲限量版) was {{a limited}} (3 units, 1 in Taiwan) {{version of the}} LP 570-4 Super Trofeo 2013 for the Asian market. It {{included}} matt black carbon fibre tail wing, matt black carbon fibre engine cover, yellow body colour, high gloss carbon fibre door pedal, rear diffuser, rear view mirror cover; red ceramic carbon fibre brake caliper, Alcantara interior upholstery, 'Super Trofeo Asia' plaque at red rear window frame interior border with serial number, red stitching, carbon fibre upholstery at door trim, racing seats, <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mark IV {{brought the}} most {{comprehensive}} changes to the Spitfire. It featured a completely re-designed cut-off rear end, giving a strong family resemblance to the Triumph Stag and Triumph 2000 models, {{both of which were}} also Michelotti-designed. The front end was also cleaned up, with a new bonnet pressing losing the weld lines on top of the wings from the older models, and the doors were given recessed handles and squared-off glass in the top rear corner. The interior was much improved: a proper full-width dashboard was provided, putting the instruments ahead of the driver rather than over the <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> This was initially black plastic however was replaced with wood in 1973.|$|E
25|$|It was {{a version}} of the Gallardo LP 550-2 for the Europe, Middle East, and Asian Pacific markets, commemorating the 150th anniversary of Italian unification. It {{included}} green, white, and red stripes (representing the flag of Italy) from cargo bay to engine cover; white body colour, carbon fibre rear view mirror and side skirts taken from the Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera, matte black front air intake grille from the Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera, black interior, green, white, red stripes at left seat aligned to the exterior tricolor stripes; 'Tricolore' embroidering at driver seat, e-gear panel and steering wheel in carbon fibre, Alcantara upholstery at <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> and door trim, Nero Perseus black leather upholstery, 'Tricolore' plaque at door sill, seat side and inner window frame.|$|E
25|$|Interior design {{improvements}} {{were another}} {{main focus of}} the LRX concept though {{the interior of the}} production Evoque changed significantly from the concept LRX. Notable interior features in the LRX included ambient interior lighting that changed according to Terrain Response settings, and vehicle data which was presented to the driver through a ‘floating’ three-dimensional LCD display. An aluminium <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> with an iPhone docking station stretched the length of the cabin, separating the four seats and the tailgate. Seats with open frameworks were used to give the impression of an airy interior while also creating useful under-seat and under-floor stowage areas. Electric motors folded the rear seats forward providing enough room for two mountain bikes to be fitted upright, with front wheels removed and stored in dedicated slots in the floor.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in the front passenger seat can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E
500|$|From the inside, the [...] "New Edge" [...] {{interior}} of the AU was discarded in favour of a contemporary style, based upon European designs. Marcus Hotblack, the director of interior design, focused on improving user friendliness. The resulting design was an ergonomically-correct interior command centre, highlighted by the satin-finish <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> The theme was further extended by the audio and cruise control switches' location on the steering wheel.|$|E
500|$|Additional detail touches {{were added}} to the VE, such as a new four-strut hinge system for the boot to replace space intrusive, much {{maligned}} [...] "gooseneck" [...] hinges as used on previous Commodores. High-specification variants see expandable door pockets and a Saab-like [...] "blackout" [...] feature which illuminates only the speedometer at night to enhance driver focus on the road. An innovative flush-fitting handbrake set into a symmetrical <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> means the lever can be easily reversed to sit {{on the opposite side of}} console for left-hand drive export markets, minimising redesign costs.|$|E
500|$|The [...] VY {{mid-cycle}} {{update of}} 2002 represented {{the first major}} styling shift since the 1997 VT. Designers discarded the rounded front and rear styling of the VT and VX models, adopting more aggressive, angular lines. The same approach {{was applied to the}} interior, whereby the curvaceous dashboard design was orphaned in favour of an angular, symmetrical design. Satin chrome plastic now dominated the façade of the <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> stack, and high-end models received fold-out cup holders borrowed from fellow GM subsidiary Saab. Leaving Eurovox behind, Holden turned towards German electronics manufacturer Blaupunkt to source audio systems—an arrangement that remains in place today.|$|E
500|$|... 2010 saw {{the arrival}} of the E3 HSV range which brought with it a raft of {{interior}} changes shared with the VE Series II upgrade of HSV's donor vehicle, the Holden Commodore, such as the new Holden iQ audio/infotainment system and safety features such as Side Blind zone alert. It also brought HSV's Enhanced Driver Interface (EDI) system to the Senator, a system that constantly streams real-time vehicle dynamics and performance information to the touch screen in the <b>centre</b> <b>console.</b> The exterior remained mostly unchanged from the E2 model apart from the move to a 20" [...] forged alloy that was available in Dark Stainless or Gloss Black. The LS3 was upgraded to [...] with the fitment of the E2 GTS' bi-modal exhaust system. The E3 was also available with the upgraded 6-piston brakes from the GTS and had the option of a modern LPG fuel system called LPI (Liquid Propane Injection) to help reduce the running costs.|$|E
500|$|Launched in 2006 after GM's 2003 {{abandonment}} {{of their last}} European rear-drive sedan, the Opel Omega, the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia, {{as opposed to being}} based on an adapted Opel-sourced platform. Given this and high public expectations of quality, the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded [...] Underpinned by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform, the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near-even 50:50 weight distribution, leading to improved handling. Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model. However, a new six-speed GM 6L80-E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants, replacing the old four-speed automatic now relegated to base models. The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs, such as a symmetrical <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> that houses a flush-fitting hand brake lever to facilitate its conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega, along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 (discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand).|$|E
500|$|MY11: {{revisions}} to the styling identify this update, marketed by Holden as the [...] "Series II". Announced on 31 August 2010, and launched on 10 September, MY11 heralded styling changes across the range by way of new front fascias, the addition of aerodynamic lip detailing to the decklids of sedans, and new alloy wheel designs on the Berlina specification and higher. Front-end changes comprise partially reshaped headlamps, redesigned bumpers, and an enlarged grille with restyled inserts that differ throughout the model range. Inside, the interiors receive a redesigned <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> stack incorporating a new 6.5-inch touchscreen, new dashboard, rearranged controls, reconfigured ventilation outlets, and updates to trimmings and illumination colours. SV6, SS and SS V interiors are differentiated via the application of circular air vents. Standard on all models is the 6.5-inch infotainment system developed primarily by Siemens VDO. Dubbed [...] "Holden-iQ", this integrates media playback and control functions. The iQ head unit replaces the previous mechanical CD stacker with a single slot and built in storage for approximately 15 CDs worth of music (internal storage optional on the Omega). The system also features full iPod integration, USB and auxiliary input, and incorporates Bluetooth handsfree telephone compatibility and music streaming. On V-Series specifications, iQ incorporates satellite navigation with live traffic updates, speed zone alerts and traffic camera notification. Sedans and wagons specified with navigation also receive a reversing camera.In terms of powertrain, the MY11 brought flex-fuel capability for the 3.0-litre V6 and 6.0-litre V8, allowing them to run on E85 bio-ethanol (see above). With the MY11 update, Holden also introduced a new [...] "Redline" [...] sports package as an option on V-Series models. The package includes lightweight, forged and polished 19-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels from the Pontiac G8 GXP. Other Redline additions encompass four-piston Brembo high-performance brakes, stiffer [...] "FE3" [...] suspension and chromed window surrounds for sedans, and the fitment of the tyre inflater kit on the Redline Ute.|$|E
2500|$|Interior light {{lock-out}} switch (<b>Centre</b> <b>console</b> mounted button, isolates glovebox light, {{boot and}} interior dome and map reading lights) ...|$|E
2500|$|On the inside, {{the hidden}} folding cup holder that {{popped out of}} the <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> in {{previous}} models {{was replaced by a}} simpler and more durable in-console design with sliding covers [...] similar in concept, but higher quality, to those in the Range Rover Sport. The ignition switch was moved from {{the lower part of the}} <b>centre</b> <b>console</b> up to the dashboard, next to the steering wheel and the Range Rover received the Range Rover Sport / LR3's Terrain Response system as well as a redesigned four-wheel drive control panel.|$|E
