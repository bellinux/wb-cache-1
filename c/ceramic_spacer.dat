40|$|Vacuum {{insulation}} with cylindrical <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer</b> insulators {{has been}} studied with respect to changes of its ac flashover voltage with time. The distributions of times to failure, which were found to confirm Weibull's distribution, were used for plotting the regression curves for times up to 350 h. The results show that even at rather low stresses the flashover voltage decreased in time. This phenomenon is connected with the recorded deposition of metal particles from the electrodes {{on the surface of}} the spacers during the tests. This possibility of the decrease of the flashover voltage, induced by the deconditioning effects of contaminating conducting particles generated under the working stress by the system itself, must be taken into account when considering the suitableness of using special means of increasing the short-time flashover voltage of vacuum insulation for cryocables...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties including surface hardness, flexural strength, and flexural modulus of two dual-cured resin luting agents (New Resin Cement [NRC] and Variolink II [VLII]) irradiated through four different thickness of leucite ceramics (0, 1, 2, and 3 mm) and their shear bond strength to zirconia ceramic (Cercon) using each ceramic primer. Materials and Methods: Knoop hardness was measured on a thin layer of resin luting agent on the ceramic surface. Three-point bending tests were performed after 24 h storage at 37 °C. Two different-shaped zirconia ceramic specimens with or without sandblasting with alumina were treated with each primer. The specimens were then cemented together with each resin luting agent. Half of the specimens were stored in water at 37 °C for 24 h and the other half were thermocycled 5, 000 times. Results: VLII revealed statistically higher Knoop hardness and flexural modulus than NRC for each thickness of ceramic. No significant differences in flexural strength were observed between VLII and NRC for each <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer.</b> Reduction of the mechanical properties with increase of ceramic thickness varied for each property. However, these properties were similar between the two materials. Blasting with alumina was significantly effective for increasing shear bond strength of both resin luting agents before and after thermal cycling. The use of New Ceramic Primer showed the highest shear bond strength and maintained bond durability after 5, 000 thermocycles. Conclusion: Mechanical properties of NRC dual-cured resin luting agent appear adequate for ceramic restorations.

40|$|The present {{investigations}} {{deal with the}} study of the effect of water chemistry of spent fuel storage bay on corrosion properties of cladding materials of research reactor. Coupons of four different alloys of stainless steel (SS 316) and aluminium alloys (Al 6063, Al 6061 and Al 1100) in form of discs were assembled on a rack forming galvanic couples and crevice sandwiches. The rack was immersed in the spent fuel storage bay for a period of one year exposure. The monthly inspection of specimens was conducted out based on visual observation and photography. The analyses of water were done on weekly basis. After exposure of one year the rack was withdrawn and disassembled in the laboratory. The surface of each individual coupon was observed visually and by means of optical microscope. Visual observation revealed relatively more deposits of scale on aluminium samples in the galvanic couples compared to stainless steel (SS) samples.

40|$|Background/Purpose: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy/ossification of {{posterior}} longitudinal ligament can {{be treated}} by anterior or posterior decompression. For multiple levels, {{it is common to}} perform posterior decompression by laminoplasty. Hirabayashi described his open-door expansive laminoplasty in 1977, which soon became popular. Spring back of the lamina has always been a problem. Many methods including suturing to soft tissue, suture anchors, bone grafts, hydroxyapatite blocks, and <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacers</b> were used to prevent this problem, but with considerable failure. Recently, miniplates were used to prevent spring back. Methods: Twenty-nine consecutive patients who had underwent Hirabayashi open-door expansive laminoplasty in a single centre were recruited in this retrospective study. Miniplates were used to keep the laminae open. In addition, the spinous processes of lower cervical vertebrae were excised and used as local bone grafts to fill the gap between the cut laminae. Computerized tomography scans were performed postoperatively for all patients to assess bone union and spring back. Results: A total of 126 levels of laminoplasty and 51 local bone grafts were studied. The minimal follow-up period was 12  months. Signs of bone union were demonstrated in 123 hinges (97. 6 %) and 51 bone grafts (100 %). No spring back was detected. The clinical outcome in terms of Hirabayashi recovery rate was 47. 2 %.

40|$|Study Design: Narrative review. Objectives: Anterior {{cervical}} discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is {{a reliable}} procedure, commonly used for cervical degenerative disc disease. For interbody fusions, autograft was {{the gold standard}} for decades; however, limited availability and donor site morbidities have led to a constant search for new materials. Clinically, {{it has been shown that}} calcium phosphate ceramics, including hydroxyapatite (HA) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP), are effective as osteoconductive materials and bone grafts. In this review, we present the current findings regarding the use of ceramics in ACDF. Methods: A review of the relevant literature examining the clinical use of ceramics in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion procedures was conducted using PubMed, OVID and Cochrane. Result: HA, coralline HA, sandwiched HA, TCP, and biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics were used in combination with osteoinductive materials such as bone marrow aspirate and various cages composed of poly-ether-ether-ketone (PEEK), fiber carbon, and titanium. Stand-alone <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacers</b> have been associated with fracture and cracks. Metallic cages such as titanium endure the risk of subsidence and migration. PEEK cages in combination with ceramics were shown to be a suitable substitute for autograft. Conclusion: None of the discussed options has demonstrated clear superiority over others, although direct comparisons are often difficult due to discrepancies in data collection and study methodologies.

An integration concept for such a device was developed, and the materials and methods used to implement this concept were investigated. We developed a multi-level hybrid assembly process that used the Utah Electrode Array (UEA) as a circuit board. The signal processing IC was flip-chip bonded to the UEA using Au/Sn reflow soldering, and included amplifiers for up to 100 channels, signal processing units, an RF transmitter, and a power receiving and clock recovery module. An under bump metallization (UBM) using potentially biocompatible materials was developed and optimized, which consisted of a sputter deposited Ti/Pt/Au thin film stack with layer thicknesses of 50 / 150 / 150 nm, respectively. After flip-chip bonding, an underfiller was applied between the IC and the UEA to improve mechanical stability and prevent fluid ingress in in vivo conditions. A planar power receiving coil fabricated by patterning electroplated gold films on polyimide substrates {{was connected to the}} IC by using a custom metallized <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer</b> and SnCu reflow soldering. The SnCu soldering was also used to assemble SMD capacitors on the UEA. The mechanical properties and stability of the optimized interconnections between the UEA and the IC and SMD components were measured. Measurements included the tape tests to evaluate UBM adhesion, shear testing between the Au/Sn solder bumps and the substrate, and accelerated lifetime testing of the long-term stability for the underfiller material coated with a a-SiCx:H by PECVD, which was intended as a device encapsulation layer.

40|$|An {{improvement}} {{has been}} made to the design of the hollow cathode geometry that was created for the rare-earth electron emitter described in Compact Rare Earth Emitter Hollow Cathode (NPO- 44923), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (March 2010), p. 52. The original interior assembly was made entirely of graphite in order to be compatible with the LaB 6 material, which cannot be touched by metals during operation due to boron diffusion causing embrittlement issues in high-temperature refractory materials. Also, the graphite tube was difficult to machine and was subject to vibration-induced fracturing. This innovation replaces the graphite tube with one made out of refractory metal that is relatively easy to manufacture. The cathode support tube is made of molybdenum or molybdenum-rhenium. This material is easily gun-bored to near the tolerances required, and finish machined with steps at each end that capture the orifice plate and the mounting flange. This provides the manufacturability and robustness needed for flight applications, and eliminates the need for expensive e-beam welding used in prior cathodes. The LaB 6 insert is protected from direct contact with the refractory metal tube by thin, graphite sleeves in a cup-arrangement around the ends of the insert. The sleeves, insert, and orifice plate are held in place by a <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer</b> and tungsten spring inserted inside the tube. To heat the cathode, an insulating tube is slipped around the refractory metal hollow tube, which can be made of high-temperature materials like boron nitride or aluminum nitride. A screw-shaped slot, or series of slots, is machined in the outside of the ceramic tube to constrain a refractory metal wire wound inside the slot that is used as the heater. The screw slot can hold a single heater wire that is then connected {{to the front of the}} cathode tube by tack-welding to complete the electrical circuit, or it can be a double slot that takes a bifilar wound heater with both leads coming out the back. This configuration replaces the previous sheathed heater design that limited the cycling-life of the cathode...|$|E
40|$|A {{pressure}} cell apparatus has been designed, constructed and commissioned {{to measure the}} dielectric strength of liquid helium {{as a function of}} pressure for various temperatures in He I and He II. Breakdown experiments between a set of stainless steel parallel plate Rogowski profile electrodes with a separation of 1. 27 mm have been made for temperatures ranging between 1. 7 K to 4. 2 K and applied pressures of SVP to ~ 2. 2 bar. All pressure data taken above and below the λ-point exhibit similar features. At low pressure, near the SVP, breakdown voltage rapidly increases with applied pressure. This behaviour is linear for all temperatures and has an average gradient of 0. 176 ± 0. 0096 kVtorr- 1. This regime changes at a pressure dependant kink point. Above this point a more gradual increase in breakdown voltage with pressure is observed. Data for all temperatures normalised to 50 kV and 1200 torr have an average gradient of 0. 01693 ± 0. 00092 kVtorr- 1 with an average intercept of 29. 69 ± 0. 88 kV. A linear relationship is observed between the normalised kink pressure and the density of the helium (- 34. 4 ± 1. 4 kg m- 3 torr- 1 and intercept of 5130 ± 200 kg m- 3). The normalised kink pressure as a function of SVP produces a linear relationship with a gradient consistent with unity (0. 97 ± 0. 04 torr 2 with an intercept of 88 ± 13 torr). High voltage breakdown initiating at the cathode triple junction (CTJ) has been investigated in He I, He II and LN 2 under SVP. Breakdown tests were made between parallel plate Rogowski profile electrodes with an Al 2 O 3 <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer</b> between them. Chips, cracks and tracks across the ceramic have been observed. LN 2 breakdown tests cause catastrophic damage.

This work has been carried out within the UK CryoEDM Collaboration and was aimed at understanding better the parameters which will ultimately limit the E-field in the Ramsey Cell of the main experiment...|$|E
40|$|Proper thermal {{management}} {{is important for}} optimum performance and durability of most electric-vehicle batteries. For high-temperature cells such as sodium/sulphur, a very efficient and responsive thermal control system is essential. Heat must be removed during exothermic periods and retained when the batteries are not in use. Current {{thermal management}} approaches rely on passive insulation enclosures with active cooling loops that penetrate the enclosure. This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of an enclosure with variable conductance insulation (VCI). VCI uses a hydride with an integral electric resistance heater to expel and retrieve {{a small amount of}} hydrogen gas into a vacuum space. By controlling the amount of hydrogen gas, the thermal conductance can be varied by more than 100 : 1, enabling the cooling loop (cold plate) to be mounted on the enclosure exterior. By not penetrating the battery enclosure, the cooling system is simpler and more reliable. Also, heat can be retained more effectively when desired. For high temperatures, radiation shields within the vacuum space are required. <b>Ceramic</b> <b>spacers</b> are used to maintain separation of the steel enclosure materials against atmospheric loading. Ceramic-to-ceramic thermal contact resistance within the spacer assembly minimizes thermal conductance.

40|$|There are {{multiple}} techniques for depositing thin films in nanoelectronics and semiconductor industries. Each technique {{has its own}} advantage and disadvantage. Of the many techniques, chemical deposition is the most favorable since materials can be deposited in high aspect ratios and give full coverage across uneven surfaces. However the most conventional technique in chemical deposition, named chemical vapor deposition (CVD), has some limiting properties like high temperature and uncontrollable film growth. To {{have the advantage of}} chemical deposition and also being able to control film growth in monolayer resolution, a new technique has been introduced, named Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). This technique gives a very good control on layer-by-layer film growth. It can work at low temperatures and high pressures. In manufacturing nanoantennas and MIM diodes there is a need, for having an ultra thin film with full coverage across select areas. ALD is a promising solution for ultra-thin film fabrication problems. In this work we designed, modeled, manufactured, and tested a novel ALD system. Our system is designed to do more exotic film depositions than the small-range accessible with industrially available ALDs. A typical ALD process starts with entraining a precursor in a carrier gas that brings it inside the reactor where it adsorbs on the substrate’s surface. The second step is removing the extra precursor from the chamber by purging it. The third step is adding another precursor gas to the reactor. The two precursors will react with each other on the substrate’s surface. In the fourth step a purge is used to remove excessive precursors and by-products from the reactor chamber. A well-designed reactor for this process needs {{to have the ability to}} operate under high vacuum, high temperatures, and intense reactions. In the designed reactor within this project, a showerhead, a stage heater, a <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacer,</b> and stage holder were designed and manufactured. There are four gas inlets from a top flange that feed into showerhead, which helps better gas dispersion. Also in the showerhead each of the inlets can be used to bring different gases inside the reactor for CVD processes. The designed reactor is a cross reactor, which minimizes the gas entrapment. All the flanges were designed in a way to have good ability to control the system. The tubing in this system is used to bring precursors inside the reactor. To have a good control on the flow rate of precursors, individual mass flow controllers, i. e. four ALD Solenoid Valves, are used to regulate the flow of each precursor. Bubblers are used to contain precursors at the entry point of the gas delivery line. Each bubbler has a dipping tube that extends the length of the bubbler container to give the carrier gas the ability to entrain precursors and bring them inside reactor. ALD Valve- 4 is designed in a way that can switch the system from ALD to CVD. This gives us the ability to have multiple depositions in different techniques in a single run. ALD Valve- 3 is designed for vacuum bubblers in case there is a precursor with very low volatility or very sensitive to high temperatures. Controlling the entire system, all at the same time, is crucial to the success of ALD. The parameters that needed to be controlled are temperature, pressure, gas flow, and each of the ALD Valves. There are five parts in the designed system that have separate thermocouples and heaters. Each of bubblers, tubings, the reaction chamber’s body, and substrate stage can get to a separate temperature using PID controllers. Finally a box designed for all the PID controllers and relays to read all the temperatures side-by-side. In addition, there is a terminal box that connects all the tubings’ heaters and chamber heaters together. Low vacuum pressure can be read by either of the two thermocouple gauges installed on the system. One of the thermocouple gauges reads the pressure of the reaction chamber and the other reads the pressure inside turbopump. Also there is an ion gauge, which has the ability to read pressures less than 10 - 3 Torr. To control gas flow and ALD Valves, a software program was developed that can send digital signals to DAQ cards and the cards can change it to analog signal and send to MFCs and Valves. A control box is designed that contains all the four DAQ cards and a circuit that gives us the ability to control the valves by low currents. Finally the manufactured ALD was tested for process of depositing Al 2 O 3 on top of silicon substrate. The test were performed in two batches, EDS test were performed to prove the deposition of Al 2 O 3 also AFM test showed very flat films with 1. 2 nm RMS were fabricated. The results of tests ensured the ability of the ALD to deposit films...|$|E

All the tasks under this delivery order have been successfully completed within budget and schedule. A number of development hardware parts have been designed and fabricated jointly by MSFC and UAH for the engineering model of SXI. The major parts include a nickel electroformed mirror and a mirror mount, plating and coating of the <b>ceramic</b> <b>spacers,</b> and gold plating of the contact rings and fingers for the camera assembly. An aluminum model of the high accuracy sun sensor (HASS) was also designed and fabricated. A number of fiber optic tapers for the camera assembly were also coated with indium tin oxide and phosphor for testing and evaluation by MSFC. A large number of the SXI optical bench parts were also redesigned and simplified for a prototype telescope. These parts include the forward and rear support flanges, front aperture plate, the graphite epoxy optical bench and a test fixture for the prototype telescope. More than fifty (50) drawings were generated for various components of the prototype telescope. Some of these parts were subsequently fabricated at UAH machine shop or at MSFC or by the outside contractors. UAH also provide technical support to MSFC staff for a number of preliminary and critical design reviews. These design reviews included PDR and CDR for the mirror assembly by United Technologies Optical Systems (UTOS), and the program quarterly reviews, and SXI PDR and CDR.

METHODS. Twenty-one adult sheep (age 1 – 2 years, mean weight 70 kg) were used in this experiment. Surgery consisted of anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L 2 – 3 and L 4 – 5, insertion of an HAC spacer (10 * 13 * 24 mm) with three different porosities (0, 3, and 15 %), and single-rod anterior instrumentation. At 4 and 6 months postoperatively, the lumbar spines were harvested. Bonding conditions at the bone–HAC spacer interface were evaluated using neuroimages and biomechanically. A histological evaluation was also conducted to examine the state of bone ingrowth at the surface of the HAC spacer. Biomechanical testing showed that the bonding strength of HAC at 6 months postoperatively was 0. 047 MPa in 0 % porosity spacers, 0. 39 MPa in 3 %, and 0. 49 MPa in 15 % porosity spacers. The histological study showed that there was a soft-tissue layer at the surface of the HAC spacer with 0 % porosity. Direct bonding was observed between bone and spacers with 3 or 15 % porosity. Micro–computed tomography scans showed direct bonding between the bone and HAC with 3 or 15 % porosity. No direct bonding was observed in HAC with 0 % porosity. CONCLUSIONS. Dense (0 %) HAC anterior vertebral spacers did not achieve direct bonding to the bone in the sheep model. The HAC vertebral spacers with 3 or 15 % porosity showed proof of direct bonding to the bone at 6 months postoperatively.
