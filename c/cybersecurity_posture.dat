5000|$|Archuleta faced {{criticism}} from both Democrats and Republicans at a June 16, 2015, {{hearing of the}} United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{in the wake of}} the revelation of the Office of Personnel Management data breach in 2015. Republican Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz said to her, [...] "your systems were vulnerable, the data was not encrypted, it could be compromised, they were right!" [...] and asked her why she ignored a recommendation to shut the system down in light of its vulnerability. Democrat Stephen Lynch said that he knew less coming out of the hearing than going in, and Archuleta was doing a better job of keeping information from Congress than of keeping it from hackers. The next day, both Chaffetz and Democrat Ted Lieu called on Archuleta to resign. Democrat James Langevin also called for her resignation on June 17, saying [...] "Since 2007, the OPM Inspector General has continuously pointed out serious deficiencies in OPM's <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture.</b> OPM's response has been glacial." [...] However, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that President Obama still had confidence in her.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Data-driven {{understanding}} of <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture</b> {{is an important}} problem {{that has not been}} adequately explored. In this paper, we analyze some real data collected by CAIDA’s network telescope during the month of March 2013. We propose to formalize the concept of <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture</b> from the perspectives of three kinds of time series: the number of victims (i. e., telescope IP addresses that are attacked), the number of attackers that are observed by the telescope, and the number of attacks that are observed by the telescope. Char-acterizing <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture</b> therefore becomes investigating the phenomena and statistical properties exhibited by these time series, and explaining their cy-bersecurity meanings. For example, we propose the concept of sweep-time, and show that sweep-time should be modeled by stochastic process, rather than ran-dom variable. We report that the number of attackers (and attacks) from a certain country dominates the total number of attackers (and attacks) that are observed by the telescope. We also show that substantially smaller network telescopes might not be as useful as a large telescope...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of {{e-government}} implementation {{is to improve}} the effectiveness, efficiency and quality of public service delivery using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, its success is dependent on the provision of information security goals such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and trust. Therefore, cybersecurity is vital for the successful adoption of e-government systems. This paper presents an assessment of cybersecurity practices, cyber threats and other factors affecting effective implementation of cybersecurity program in government organizations in Bhutan. Selected cybersecurity practices included in the study were cyber policy, risk management, training and awareness, and access controls for protection of network including mobile computing devices. Out of 280 potential respondents, 157 respondents completed the survey. The results show that, in many organizations, there is very limited use of or a lack of formal cybersecurity policy, risk management, awareness, or incident management practices. The results also indicate that many organizations have either suffered from, or been affected by, cybersecurity threats such as malware, hacking and phishing scams. The study recommends both managerial and technological practices to improve <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture</b> of government organizations and to improve people’s level of trust and confidence in e-government services...|$|E
40|$|Your National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC) {{has been}} asked to provide input to Dr. Melissa Hathaway’s Sixty-Day Cyber Study Group by {{answering}} four specific questions. We are pleased {{to have the opportunity to}} support this important work and feel we can provide valuable insight given our focus national security. In approaching this work we reviewed a considerable body of previous NSTAC work that has lead to the responses in the attached document. We have also included some broader policy issues not previously addressed by your NSTAC that may warrant additional exploration as your Administration sets its cybersecurity agenda. It is important to note that several themes continue to emerge that we believe are of particular significance: Integration of Federal cybersecurity activities under a single, central organizing governance structure. This is foundational to making meaningful progress. Collaboration with industry in the development of a legal framework to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure from cyber threats. Continued commitment to foster a strong public/private partnership in order to strengthen our national <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture.</b> On behalf of the NSTAC Principals, thank you for this opportunity and we look forward to our continued work with you and your Administration on this and other issues critical to our national security...|$|E
40|$|Bhutan is {{becoming}} increasingly dependent on Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs), especially the Internet for performing the daily activities of governments, businesses, and individuals. Consequently, information systems and networks are becoming more exposed and vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. This paper highlights {{the findings of the}} survey study carried out to understand the perceptions of cybersecurity implementation among government organizations in Bhutan. About 280 ICT personnel were surveyed about the effectiveness of cybersecurity implementation in their organizations. A questionnaire based on a 5 point Likert scale was used to assess the perceptions of respondents. The questions were asked on cybersecurity practices such as cybersecurity policies, awareness and training, and risk management. The survey results show that less than 50 % of respondents believe that the cybersecurity implementation is effective: cybersecurity policy (40 %), risk management (23 %), training and awareness (28 %), system development life cycle (34 %); incident management (26 %), and communications and operational management (40 %). The findings suggest that many of the cybersecurity practices are inadequately implemented and therefore, there exist a gap in achieving a required <b>cybersecurity</b> <b>posture.</b> This study recommends government organizations to establish a comprehensive cybersecurity program with emphasis on cybersecurity policy, risk management, and awareness and training. In addition, the research study has practical implications to both government and private organizations for implementing and managing cybersecurity...|$|E
