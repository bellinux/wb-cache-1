However, their use is limited in part because these transducers are known to be nonlinear.

Two feedback control models are proposed and one is used to obtain expressions for predicting the change in harmonic amplitudes of displacement and acceleration as functions of frequency and parameters for the <b>controller,</b> <b>load,</b> and transducer. An approach based on magnetostrictive transduction modeling is presented for experimentally determining appropriate transducer model parameters for use in the feedback control model. Experimental measurements using simple, analog, PD (proportional plus derivative) acceleration feedback control are presented to validate the expressions. The closed loop feedback control system model resulted in predicted changes in harmonic acceleration amplitudes ranging from + 2 to- 30 dB, (depending upon the frequency of the disturbance input) that were verified experimentally.

For large data centers hosting many hun-dreds of thousands of servers, there are few thousands of switches {{that need to be}} managed in a centralized fashion, which cannot be done using a single controller node. Previous works have proposed distributed controller architectures to address scalability issues. A key limitation of these works, however, is that the mapping be-tween a switch and a controller is statically configured, which may result in uneven load distribution among the controllers as traffic conditions change dynamically. To address this problem, we propose ElastiCon, an elastic dis-tributed controller architecture in which the controller pool is dy-namically grown or shrunk according to traffic conditions. To ad-dress the load imbalance caused due to spatial and temporal varia-tions in the traffic conditions, ElastiCon automatically balances the load across controllers thus ensuring good performance at all times irrespective of the traffic dynamics. We propose a novel switch mi-gration protocol for enabling such load shifting, which conforms with the Openflow standard.

Bio-implantable devices are electronic devices which are used for treatment and monitoring brain implants, pacemakers, cochlear implants, retinal implants and so on. The inductive coupling link is used to transmit power and data between the primary and secondary sides of the biomedical implanted system, in which efficient power amplifier is very much needed to ensure the best data transmission rates and low power losses. However, {{the efficiency of the}} implanted devices depends on the circuit design, <b>controller,</b> <b>load</b> variation, changes of radio frequency coil’s mutual displacement and coupling coefficients. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on various power amplifier classes and their characteristics, efficiency and controller techniques that have been used in bio-implants. The automatic frequency controller used in biomedical implants such as gate drive switching control, closed loop power control, voltage controlled oscillator, capacitor control and microcontroller frequency control have been explained. Most of these techniques keep the resonance frequency stable in transcutaneous power transfer between the external coil and the coil implanted inside the body. Detailed information including carrier frequency, power efficiency, coils displacement, power consumption, supplied voltage and CMOS chip for the controllers techniques are investigated and summarized in the provided tables. From the rigorous review, it is observed that the existing automatic frequency controller technologies are more or less can capable of performing well in the implant devices; however, the systems are still not up to the mark. Accordingly, current challenges and problems of the typical automatic frequency controller techniques for power amplifiers are illustrated, with a brief suggestions and discussion section concerning the progress of implanted device research in the future.

Results The force vector prediction of the obtained model had small RMS errors with respect to the actual measured force vectors (0. 22 ± 0. 17 N for the healthy subjects; 0. 17 ± 0. 13 N for the stroke subjects). The stroke subjects showed a limited work range due to limited force production of the individual muscles.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State UniversityAdvancements in the communication, control, {{computation}} {{and information}} technologies have driven {{the transition to}} the next generation active power distribution systems. Novel control techniques and management strategies are required to achieve the efficient, economic and reliable grid. The focus of this work is energy management and control of active distribution systems (ADS) with integrated renewable energy sources (RESs) and demand response (DR). Here, ADS mean automated distribution system with remotely operated controllers and distributed energy resources (DERs). DER as active part of the next generation future distribution system includes: distributed generations (DGs), RESs, energy storage system (ESS), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and DR. Integration of DR and RESs into ADS is critical to realize the vision of sustainability. The objective of this dissertation is the development of management architecture to control and operate ADS in the presence of DR and RES. One of the most challenging issues for operating ADS is the inherent uncertainty of DR and RES as well as conflicting objective of DER and electric utilities. ADS can consist of different layers such as system layer and building layer and coordination between these layers is essential. In order to address these challenges, multi-layer energy management and control architecture is proposed with robust algorithms in this work. First layer of proposed multi-layer architecture have been implemented at the system layer. Developed AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) generates fair price for all DR and non-DR loads which is used as a control signal for second layer. Second layer controls DR load at buildings using a developed look-ahead robust <b>controller.</b> <b>Load</b> aggregator collects information from all buildings and send aggregated load to the system optimizer. Due to the different time scale at these two management layers, time coordination scheme is developed. Robust and deterministic controllers are developed to maximize the energy usage from rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation locally and minimize heat-ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) consumption while maintaining inside temperature within comfort zone. The performance of the developed multi-layer architecture has been analyzed using test case studies and results show the robustness of developed controller in the presence of uncertainty.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references: p. 111 - 114. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Distributed systems have become a popular computing environment. Due to their high potentials in improving performance and resource sharing, the evolution and maturing of technologies such as networks and computer hardware, have led to more realizations of distributed computing capabilities. One of the key factors that impacts the system's performance is how load sharing is handled. Most of the work done in load sharing algorithms focused on either one of two approaches: the static approach, or the dynamic approach. Static load sharing is characterized with its simplicity and minimal overhead induced on the system when performing load distribution. This is attributed to the fact that their load sharing decisions do not require any information exchange between nodes. However, static algorithms are not capable of adapting to traffic changes. Hence, this will affect the distributed system adaptability and stability features against load alteration. The second approach in load sharing algorithums is the dynamic approach. In this approach, nodes base their sharing decisions on the knowledge of the status on other nodes. This knowledge enables nodes to make improved decisions when selecting a remote execution site. Therefore, these algorithms provide the distributed system with adaptability and stability. Nevertheless, information exchange between nodes has proven to be expensive. The problem lies in the communication and processing overheads which these algorithms impose on the system. This research work presents a Semi-Adaptive load sharing approach that attempts to lay a common ground between the dynamic and the static approaches. This approach provides the system with adaptability features at are supplied with tools to control the level of adaptability and information exchange in the system. It is argued that this approach is adaptable, scalable, stable, fault tolerant, and will generate low and controlled system overheads. Two implementations of the Semi-Adaptive approach are presented: The <b>Controller</b> <b>Load</b> Sharing Protocol (CLSP) and The Pool Load Sharing Protocol (PLSP). The study of CLSP and PLSP include simulating their performance under various conditions. The simulation include comparing the performance of these two protocols against two load sharing algorithms representing the static and dynamic families. Furthermore, the properties of CLSP and PLSP are investigated. Finally, based on the study and analysis of both protocols, the research work proposes possible areas of improvement in the final conclusion...|$|E
