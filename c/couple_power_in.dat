40|$|I {{plan to make}} a few {{historical}} {{comments on}} early research in antennas for submillimeter waves, as the area was known in the 1970 's. The initial focus was on understanding the limits of the tungsten whiskers that were then used as antennas. However, as integrated-circuit technology improved, it became clear that planar antennas on semiconductor substrates were needed. However, these antennas interact strongly with substrate modes. One way to eliminate the substrate modes is to put a lens {{on the back of the}} substrate and to <b>couple</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> through the lens. These substrate-lens coupled antennas are widely used today in laboratory instruments and radio astronomy. Another approach to suppressing the substrate modes is through a periodic antenna structure. This is the basis for the grid amplifier, which combines the outputs of large numbers of transistors in free space. This allows much more transmitter power than was previously possible from solid-state devices. The Wavestream Corporation was founded to develop this technology. The company's best-selling product is a 50 -W amplifier for 30 -GHz satellite uplinks. Several thousand amplifiers have been sold to date...|$|E

40|$|In {{the hollow}} core {{photonic}} bandgap fibers, modal losses are strongly differentiated, potentially enabling effectively single mode guidance. However, {{in the presence}} of macro-bending, due to mode <b>coupling,</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> the low-loss mode launched into a bend is partially transferred into the modes with higher losses, thus resulting in increased propagation loss, and degradation of the beam quality. We show that coupled mode theory formulated in the curvilinear coordinates associated with a bend can describe correctly both the bending induced loss and beam degradation. Suggested approach works both in absorption dominated regime in which fiber modes are square integrable over the fiber crossection, as well as in radiation dominated regime in which leaky modes are not square integrable. It is important to stress that for multimode fibers, full-vectorial coupled mode theory developed in this work is not a simple approximation, but it is on par with such "exact" numerical approaches as finite element and finite difference methods for prediction of macro-bending induced losses.

40|$|Fused-tapered {{single-mode}} fibre couplers are available {{which have a}} flattened wavelength response and which are therefore useful in applications requiring a near-constant power-splitting ratio over a range of wavelengths. They are made by inducing an asymmetry in the constituent fibres, for example by pre-tapering or pre-etching one or both fibres prior to coupler fabrication, or by using two dissimilar fibres. The maximum <b>coupled</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> these couplers {{has been shown to}} decrease with increasing asymmetry. Couplers made from dissimilar fibres could also be useful for integrating systems made from different fibres, and it may be necessary for such a coupler to exhibit complete power transfer despite the asymmetry in fibre type. Complete power transfer has only previously been shown to be possible in dissimilar fibre couplers by differentially etching the fibres used to make the coupler, in order to adjust the extent of cladding diameter asymmetry. It would be advantageous to be able to adjust the splitting ratio of these couplers without requiring close control over the cladding diameter asymmetry of the constituent fibres. We demonstrate that the maximum <b>coupled</b> <b>power</b> of an asymmetric coupler is strongly dependent on the degree-of-fusion in the coupler, and {{that it is possible to}} obtain near-total power transfer (or indeed any level of power transfer) for a given cladding diameter asymmetry by controlling the degree-of-fusion of the coupler.

40|$|Real-time {{diamagnetic}} flux {{measurements are}} now available on ASDEX Upgrade. In contrast {{to the majority of}} diamagnetic flux measurements on other tokamaks, no analog summation of signals is necessary for measuring the change in toroidal flux or for removing contributions arising from unwanted coupling to the plasma and poloidal field coil currents. To achieve the highest possible sensitivity, the diamagnetic measurement and compensation coil integrators are triggered shortly before plasma initiation when the toroidal field coil current is close to its maximum. In this way, the integration time can be chosen to measure only the small changes in flux due to the presence of plasma. Two identical plasma discharges with positive and negative magnetic field have shown that the alignment error with respect to the plasma current is negligible. The measured diamagnetic flux is compared to that predicted by TRANSP simulations. The poloidal beta inferred from the diamagnetic flux measurement is compared to the values calculated from magnetic equilibrium reconstruction codes. The diamagnetic flux measurement and TRANSP simulation can be used together to estimate the <b>coupled</b> <b>power</b> <b>in</b> discharges with dominant ion cyclotron resonance heating...|$|R
