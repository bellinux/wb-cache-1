60|$|Now, {{this second}} large class does {{not so much}} admit of {{subdivision}} into two as present {{a great variety of}} intermediaries between two extremes. I propose to give distinctive names to these extremes, with the very clear proviso that they are not antagonised, and that the great multitude of this second, anti-conservator class, this liberal, more novel class modern conditions have produced falls between them, and is neither the one nor the other, but partaking in various degrees of both. On the one hand, then, we have that type of mind which is irritated by and distrustful of all <b>collective</b> <b>proceedings</b> which is profoundly distrustful of churches and states, which is expressed essentially by Individualism. The Individualist appears to regard the extensive disintegrations of the Normal Social Life that are going on to-day with an extreme hopefulness. Whatever is ugly or harsh in modern industrialism or in the novel social development of our time he seems to consider as a necessary aspect of a process of selection and survival, whose tendencies are on the whole inevitably satisfactory. The future welfare of man he believes in effect may be trusted to the spontaneous and planless activities of people of goodwill, and nothing but state intervention can effectively impede its attainment. And curiously close to this extreme optimistic school in its moral quality and logical consequences, though contrasting widely in the sinister gloom of its spirit, is the socialism of Karl Marx. He declared the contemporary world to be a great process of financial aggrandisement and general expropriation, of increasing power for the few and of increasing hardship and misery for the many, a process that would go on until at last a crisis of unendurable tension would be reached and the social revolution ensue. The world had, in fact, to be worse before it could hope to be better. He contemplated a continually exacerbated Class War, with a millennium of extraordinary vagueness beyond as the reward of the victorious workers. His common quality with the Individualist lies in his repudiation of and antagonism to plans and arrangements, in his belief in the overriding power of Law. Their common influence is the discouragement of collective understandings upon the basis of the existing state. Both converge in practice upon laissez faire. I would therefore lump them together under the term of Planless Progressives, and I would contrast with them those types which believe supremely in systematised purpose.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} the first {{in-depth}} academic discussion of the key aspects of the enhanced collective redress mechanisms introduced recently in relation to competition law infringements in the UK by the Consumer Rights Act. The legislation is a particularly significant development because of the historical and contemporary focus on the ‘consumer’ {{at the heart of}} competition/antitrust law and because the reforms also reflect more recent debates generally in legal practice about ‘access to justice’. The article first recounts the pivotal role played by ‘class actions’ in US antitrust enforcement before outlining the recent debate on encouraging and facilitating private enforcement in the EU, particularly in relation to collective redress, culminating in the (anodyne) Commission Recommendation of June 2013. As the article notes, most of the collective redress mechanisms introduced across the EU Member States to date have been opt-in models, but these have been criticised for their limited impact and effectiveness, and an opt-out representative model has been introduced in some Member States and discussed in others. The article will reflect on the limited provision in the UK on collective redress in relation to competition law infringements prior to the Consumer Rights Act, in particular the limitations in the opt-in follow-on procedure under s 47 B of the Competition Act 1998, as demonstrated by CA v JJB. The article will then focus on the Act’s provisions (and associated Tribunal rules) in relation to opt-in/opt-out <b>collective</b> <b>proceedings</b> and settlements (in both follow-on and stand-alone actions). The article will outline the new statutory provisions in sections 47 B and 49 A and B of the Competition Act 1998, for <b>Collective</b> <b>Proceedings</b> and Collective Settlements respectively. The Tribunal rules on certification will be considered, noting the potential difficulties in their practical application, before further analysis of two key problematic aspects of the proposed opt-out collective redress scheme, which may limit its effectiveness and uptake. The first concerns the appointment of the class/settlement representative and the second concerns the potential funding arrangements in relation to opt-out <b>collective</b> <b>proceedings.</b> The article questions whether the combination of these two aspects may dis-incentivise and unnecessarily limit the effectiveness of the new opt-out provisions, although it is accepted that this will also greatly depend on the Competition Appeal Tribunal interpretation and application of its new Tribunal Rules in relation to <b>Collective</b> <b>proceedings,</b> in particular regarding certification, appointment of the class/settlement representative and determination of the appropriate costs and expenses incurred in pursuing a collective claim...|$|E

As in the previous set of papers, the robustness of this conception rests upon the binary choice provided by the judicial perspective: either the company is sound or it is insolvent.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the private enforcement of EU competition law and forum shopping with a particular focus on cross-border collective end-consumer redress. There is no coherent framework across the EU for these types of cases. This lack of uniformity has the potential to create recourse to different national courts. Lawyers may engage in forum shopping when filing lawsuits on behalf of the victims of mass torts. Such practices can provide Member States with incentives to amend their laws to attract <b>collective</b> <b>proceedings</b> and create competition between national judicial systems. However, forum shopping is not the only concern. There appears to be a paucity of cross-border collective claims. This is coupled with an apparent lack of motivation for end-consumers to seek a remedy, particularly if the only choice is to litigate outside their own legal regime. Addressing this situation is vital given that end-consumers regularly suffer harm in the form of higher prices, lower output, reduced quality and limited innovation as a result of antitrust infringements but they are rarely compensated due to legal and practical obstacles. To each end-consumer the harm may indeed be de minimis. However, the aggregate harm can amount to a considerable sum. In the absence of effective redress procedures, infringing undertakings retain the spoils of their unlawful conduct. Against this background, this thesis {{examines the}} extent to which the conflicts-of-laws rules encourage forum shopping and considers the appropriate forum and the appropriate procedural measures that need to be adopted in order to facilitate effective and equal access to justice for end-consumer victims of EU competition law violations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current {{trends in the}} view of various national states and their on the application of <b>collective</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> also called bankruptcy procedure in common language, by analysing their main pieces of legal regulation, extremely useful both for specialists as well as for creditors and debtors. The fact is that thanks to this procedure, businesses which {{are in a state of}} financial crisis, either actual or upcoming can be placed under court protection from creditors which results in blocking enforcement and increasing interest and penalties, allowing them a new start through a reorganization of their activities. Reorganizaing the activities of insolvent debtors activity may also be in the interest of creditors, if they cannot obtain sufficient repayment through the debtor’s bankruptcy. Thus, requests to open insolvency proceedings by them will appear as a means to preserve their rights and to avoid irreversible deterioration of the situation of the deptor. On the other hand, an aggressive insolvency procedure may be used by creditors as a means of pressure in order to obtain a quick settlement of their receivables from solvent borrowers acting in a state of panic created by the existence of an application to open a bankruptcy procedure. And not least, the paper presents how the situation has seriously deteriorated regarding the criteria allowing businesses to apply for an insolvency procedure and the proper use of the benefits of this procedure. bankruptcy, crises, insolvency, insolvability...|$|R

We {{are concerned with the}} following question: Can we realize the information theoretically secure symmetric key cipher under "the finite secret key" based on quantum-optical communications? A role of quantum information theory is to give an answer for such a question. As an answer for the question, a new quantum cryptography was proposed by H. P. Yuen, which can realize a secure symmetric key cipher with high speeds(Gbps) and for long distance(1000 Km). Although some researchers claim that Yuen protocol(Y- 00) is equivalent to the classical cryptography, they are all mistaken. Indeed it has no classical analogue, and also provides a generalization even in the conventional cryptography. At present, it is proved that a basic model of Y- 00 has at least the security such as H(X|Y_E) =H(K|Y_E) =H(K), H(K|Y_E,X) ∼ 0 under the average photon number per signal light pulse: ∼ 10000.

40|$|Caractérisée à ses débuts par l'autonomie des syndicats locaux et plus tard par l’importance du rôle des conseils centraux et surtout des fédérations, la Confédération des Syndicats Nationaux s'est transformée graduellement en une vaste union multi-industrielle. A l’aube d'une {{nouvelle}} révolution industrielle au Québec, à l'heure de la révolution tranquille et des problèmes causés par l’automation et face à ses responsabilités nouvelles dans le contexte québécois, la C. S. N. a commencé à effectuer de profonds changements dans ses structures et ses services. Since a few years, one {{can observe}} {{more and more}} that union leaders speak with insurance {{in the name of}} their members. But there has been among all those interventions from union leaders many abuses of administrative authority especially regarding political statements. We are thus interested in the present paper in the phenomena of the concentration of powers in union centrals and their consequences on union democracy. Because of the many difficulties brought by such a study, I have prefered to consider the distribution of powers in a Quebec union central, the Confederation of the National Trade Union. STRUCTURE OF ORGANIZATIONOne can find in the sociological literature many different definitions of the word structure. We can state for example those of Durkeim, Maclver, Page, Radcliffe-Brown, Willems, Hart, etc. But to our knowledge it is Siegfried Frederick Nadel who has presented the most complete one :«  [...] . in studying 'structure' we study essentially the interrelation or arrangements of 'parts in some total entity or whole'.  »It would be useful to mention that in the following lines, {{the use of the word}} structure will refer to the structure of powers i. e. the distribution of powers between the different parties involved within the CNTU. Let us now state the different factors influencing a structure :a) The nature of the group, its aims and roles (temporary or permanent). b) The personnality of the leaders. c) The communications. The unions have a structure exactly in the same sense as other groups. If one considers the structure of an union central such as the CNTU, he will have to study the arrangement of its different parts such as the local union, the trades council, the industrial federation, etc., in the total entity of the union organisation. We cannot allow ourself to try to outline a general model of a structure of powers in union organizations. In fact the distribution of powers changes considerably from one union to the other. In order to simplify things, I will present a simplified typology which will serve as landmarks in the study of the distribution of powers at the CNTU. The structure of powers in an union organization can take two extreme forms : decentralization and centralization. The powers can thus be distributed according to two principles and this as well in a union organization as in any other kind of organization. A labor movement could have a decentralized structure of powers i. e. based upon the principles of exclusive jurisdiction and autonomy of the parties, of their right to organize committees in order to negotiate collective agreements without the intervention of superior members. This was the picture of the UAW a few years after its foundation. However one can observe in an organization a concentration of powers at the top. This concentration tends to reduce the importance of the role of the composants and to annihilate any kind of initiative. It was the case of the- United Steelworkers under Phillip Murray. Usually, when established, the labor organizations have a decentralized structure of powers. But the more it grows, the more powers pass from the hand of the members to the full time specialists employed by the union. TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONLet us say at the beginning that there are many principles of organizations or combinations of many principles ; the trade unions, the industrial unions, the general union, the associated trades, the semi-industrial unions and the multi-industrial unions. We will however consider only the three main principles of organization : territorial, professional and industrial. Those three forms of organization seem to have succeeded one another throughout the history of the labor movement. Because of those differences in organization, it is not surprising to see major differences taking place between the leaders and the permanent employees of each of those types of organization. Let us summarize in a few words the thoughts of Friedman & Naville of this subject : the permanent employees of territorial union are little specialized while those of professional unions rapidly become key men. At last, the presence of bureaucracy in industrial union lead to give responsability to the superiors and promotion following competence. Because of the emergence of bureaucracy, it would be interesting to study one of the crucial problems that it brought up : The concentration of powers and the factors favorising it. THE CONCENTRATION OF POWERS IN UNIONISM : ITS FACTORSThe concentration of powers is a general phenomena in our Society and unionism cannot escape from it. However there are a few fundamental factors at the basis of this centralization in any kind of union central :a) The enlargement of markets. b) The dimensions of modem firms. c) The nature of the organization. d) Complexity and experts. e) The first structural form. f) The increasing role of intermediate bodies. THE DIFFERENT STEPS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF POWERS AT THE CNTU 1 st step : 1921 - 1936 According to article III of the Constitution and By-laws of the CCCL (1921), the CCCL left autonomy to its composant groups. It is to be noted that local unions must be members of a central group in order to be affiliated to the CCCL. If there is no such group existing, they can be affiliated directly but only on a provisory manner. In this three level structure, the Confederal Congress held the greatest powers. The Constitution of 1921 does not say a word about the powers given to central organizations such as the federations and the central councils. However a resolution of the General Meeting of 1929 notes the role of the federation in the negotiation of <b>collective</b> agreements. The <b>proceedings</b> of the general meeting of 1935 gave the central councils the right to organize local unions. It took a long time to central organization to react to this decentralization of powers and services at the level of local unions. The local unions often did not affiliate to federations, often went on strike without any authorization from the Confederal Bureau and neglected to pay their per capita to the Confederation and central organizations. 2 nd step : 1937 - 1960 The Constitution was revised at the general meeting of 1937. It was decided that only union federations, district unions, central councils and trades council were allowed to be affiliated directly to the Confederation. The administrative power was given to the Confederal Bureau now formed by the executive of the CCCL, the directors representing the federations, district unions and central councils. The executive power stayed in the hands of the executive while the legislative power was in the hands of the general assembly. The general meeting of 1939 decided that local unions were to present any resolution to their central council or federation. After the Second World War, it appeared to the leaders that since the revision of the Constitution in 1937, the central organizations have done whatever they have wanted : this has led to a lack of coordination in the organization work. The general meetings of 1946, 1948, 1949 and 1950 took little by little autonomy away from the federations and central councils. It thus seems that during this twenty four years period has been characterized by a growing importance of the intermediate bodies, professional and territorial, by an autonomy drive from local unions, by the inaction of the Confederal Bureau and by more administrative routine work at the level of the executive. An attempt has been made by the end of this period to increase the importance of the CCCL role. But it will only be in 1961 that we will assist to a real edification of the central as the main responsible of decisions. 3 rd step : 1961 - 1967 The special general meeting of 1961 gave the central its actual orientation. It abandoned the name of the Catholic and Canadian Confederation of Labor for the Confederation of National Trade-Unions. A very important decision was taken. Still admitting the existence of the central bodies, the general meeting decided to take all their powers away by centralizing the services. THE CONCENTRATION OF POWERS AT THE CNTU : ITS FACTORSThere are a few factors explaining the ascension of powers from the local union to the federation and finally to the central itself : 1. —the increase in membership ; 2. —complexity and efficiency ; 3. —unionism in a socialized context ; 4. —inter union rivalry ; 5. —other factors :a) the coming of industrial and multi-industrial unionism ;b) the merger of the other Canadian labor union centrals ;c) the concentration of membership on an homogeneous territory. CONCLUSIONIn its beginning the CCCL was characterized by the autonomy of its local unions and later by the important role of it central councils. But the CNTU has changed step by step to become a vast multi-industrial union. The tensions at the level of the doubleheaded direction of the CNTU and the quarrels between the intellectuals and those coming from the rank and file have kept the reform from being total. It seems however that the CNTU will be over with it in a few years...|$|R
