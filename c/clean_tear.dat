5000|$|His first EP Polarize was {{released}} on April 23, 2012 on the British drum and bass label Viper Recordings. The EP includes six tracks, which incorporate a blend of genres such as dubstep, drum and bass, and house. Shaz Sparks is a guest vocalist on three of the tracks. The EP was largely well-received, and his song, [...] "Below Us" [...] was featured as Zane Lowe’s ‘Hottest Record In The World,’ with Lowe writing about the song, [...] "fresh sounding production marries an ethereal vocal with some <b>clean</b> <b>tear</b> out riffs." [...] After releasing Polarize, Seven Lions had several Beatport #1s (four in the dubstep chart) in 2012, with remixes for artists such as Above & Beyond, Matrix & Futurebound, Paul Van Dyk and Delirium.|$|E
25|$|The eye is also <b>cleaned</b> by <b>tear</b> {{secretions}} {{from the}} lachrymal gland and protected by an oily substance from the Harderian glands which coats the cornea and prevents dryness. The {{eye of a}} bird is larger compared {{to the size of}} the animal than for any other group of animals, although much of it is concealed in its skull. The ostrich has the largest eye of any land vertebrate, with an axial length of 50mm (2in), twice that of the human eye.|$|R
50|$|At the 2010 Commonwealth Games she {{competed in}} the 48 {{kilogram}} event, snatching 73 kilograms, which was an Oceania record, but unfortunately was injured during the warm up for the <b>clean</b> and jerk, <b>tearing</b> the internal ligament in her elbow, and {{was not able to}} secure a clean and jerk result.|$|R
50|$|Wadcutter bullets for center-fire {{firearms}} {{often have}} a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a <b>clean</b> cut without <b>tearing</b> of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut {{the surface of the}} rubber mat.|$|R
40|$|Fragment of yellowed woven wool fabric with 2. 8 cm wide green/blue band {{near the}} center. There are {{remnants}} of four rows of countered weft twining. The twining loops go over {{two or three}} warps. One is 0. 3 cm above the band, the others are 0. 2 cm below the band and a pair 2 cm below the band. The fabric was folded and sewn with two rows of stitching, possibly a repair. There is a third row of stitches along one side.; One minor stain, otherwise <b>clean.</b> One interior <b>tear.</b> Some damaged wefts have left exposed warps. Edges frayed...|$|R
60|$|Holden {{could neither}} eat nor sleep. The heavens sent down eight {{inches of rain}} in that night and washed the earth <b>clean.</b> The waters <b>tore</b> down walls, broke roads, and scoured open the shallow graves on the Mahomedan burying-ground. All next day it rained, and Holden sat still in his house {{considering}} his sorrow. On {{the morning of the}} third day he received a telegram which said only, 'Ricketts, Myndonie. Dying. Holden relieve. Immediate.' Then he thought that before he departed he would look at the house wherein he had been master and lord. There was a break in the weather, and the rank earth steamed with vapour.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of October 6, 1998, Shepard met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson at the Fireside Lounge in Laramie, Wyoming; the three men were in their early twenties. McKinney and Henderson decided to give Shepard a ride home. They {{subsequently}} drove the car to a remote, rural area, and proceeded to rob, pistol-whip, and torture Shepard, tie him to a fence, and leave him to die. Media reports often contained the graphic account of the pistol-whipping and his fractured skull. It was reported that Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except {{where it had been}} partially washed <b>clean</b> by his <b>tears.</b> Both of the assailants' girlfriends testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson was under the influence of drugs or alcohol {{at the time of the}} attack. McKinney and Henderson testified in court that they discovered Shepard's address and intended to steal from his home as well.|$|R
60|$|And he {{went across}} to her, and {{gathered}} {{her like a}} belonging in his arms. She was so tenderly beautiful, he {{could not bear to}} see her, he could only bear to hide her against himself. Now; washed all <b>clean</b> by her <b>tears,</b> she was new and frail like a flower just unfolded, a flower so new, so tender, so made perfect by inner light, that he could not bear to look at her, he must hide her against himself, cover his eyes against her. She had the perfect candour of creation, something translucent and simple, like a radiant, shining flower that moment unfolded in primal blessedness. She was so new, so wonder-clear, so undimmed. And he was so old, so steeped in heavy memories. Her soul was new, undefined and glimmering with the unseen. And his soul was dark and gloomy, it had only one grain of living hope, like a grain of mustard seed. But this one living grain in him matched the perfect youth in her.|$|R
6000|$|It is pathetic. There {{are other}} duels in my list, but I find in [...] each {{and all of}} them one and the same ever-recurring defect--the [...] {{principals}} are never present, but only their sham [...] representatives. The real principals in any duel are not the [...] duellists themselves, but their families. They do the mourning, the [...] suffering, theirs is the loss and theirs the misery. They stake all [...] that, the duellist stakes nothing but his life, and that is a [...] trivial thing compared with what his death must cost those whom he [...] leaves behind him. Challenges should not mention the duellist; he [...] has nothing much at stake, and the real vengeance cannot reach him. [...] The challenge should summon the offender's old gray mother, and his [...] young wife and his little children,--these, or any to whom he is a [...] dear and worshipped possession--and should say, [...] "You have done me [...] no harm, but I am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to [...] crush the happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of [...] pain and grief, in order that I may wash <b>clean</b> with your <b>tears</b> a [...] stain which has been put upon me by another person." ...|$|R
60|$|Ulysses was now {{the only}} Greek chief that still fought in the centre. The Greeks all fled, and he {{was alone in the}} crowd of Trojans, who rushed on him as hounds and hunters press round a wild boar that stands at bay in a wood. 'They are cowards that flee from the fight,' said Ulysses to himself; 'but I will stand here, one man against a multitude.' He covered the front of his body with his great shield, that hung by a belt round his neck, and he smote four Trojans and wounded a fifth. But the brother of the wounded man drove a spear through the shield and {{breastplate}} of Ulysses, and <b>tore</b> <b>clean</b> through his side. Then Ulysses turned on this Trojan, and he fled, and Ulysses sent a spear through his shoulder and out at his breast, and he died. Ulysses dragged from his own side the spear that had wounded him, and called thrice with a great voice to the other Greeks, and Menelaus and Aias rushed to rescue him, for many Trojans were round him, like jackals round a wounded stag that a man has struck with an arrow. But Aias ran and covered the wounded Ulysses with his huge shield till he could climb into the chariot of Menelaus, who drove him back to the ships.|$|R
50|$|The devils are now frightened; they curse and {{cry that}} people were already under their rule, and the local songs and {{language}} were almost exterminated. Dīterihs announces that only Kangars can help them and orders the devils to search for Kangars among the Latvian people. The devils try to convince Koknesis to join them, but he refuses, saying that Lāčplēsis is his friend and Lāčplēsis can count on him. After that, Laimdota appears and Lāčplēsis asks her why she is crying. She answers that she is dishonoured and dirty. Lāčplēcis tells her that she will become <b>clean</b> in his <b>tears</b> and they are both reborn through each other's tears; then they are married. Meanwhile Kangars has finally discovered the weakness of Lāčplēsis and reveals it to the enemy: Lāčplēsis' power is in his ears, because he hears his motherland and feels her every movement with his ears. If they make Lāčplēsis deaf, he will be unbelieving and unremembering and therefore easy to defeat. Only then does Kangars realise {{what he has done}} and cries that he loves Latvia. The crusaders arrange a tournament for Lāčplēsis and the Black Knight, a creature that has no eyes, no ears and no language: belief and memories are drawn out of anyone who comes near him. Lāčplēsis feels doomed but still asks his motherland to call him. The narrator says that his fight with the Black Knight has not ended yet but there will come a time when Lāčplēsis will kill him.|$|R
