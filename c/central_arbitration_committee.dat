2500|$|Though legal, {{derecognition}} (UK) or decertification (US) of a {{trade union}} may {{be referred to as}} union busting by trade unions, even when it is initiated by members of the union. [...] Derecognition/decertification must be accomplished according to statutory guidelines. [...] Workers in the UK may derecognize a union which no longer has support from members or if union membership falls below 50%. [...] Employers may derecognize a union if they no longer employ 21 or more workers. [...] Generally in the UK an application for derecognition must be made to the CAC or <b>Central</b> <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Committee</b> which declares that a derecognition/decertification ballot election will be held. [...] However a company may decide to unilaterally derecognize, as long as it has a non-CAC recognition agreement in force.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, if workers organise a union, {{their last}} resort {{to get an}} {{employer}} {{to the bargaining table}} was to threaten collective action, including exercising their right to strike. In addition, the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 Schedule A1 contains a statutory procedure for workers to become recognised for collective bargaining. To use this procedure, first, a trade union must be certified as independent and the workplace must have a minimum of 21 workers. Second, there must not already be a recognised trade union. This caused particular problems in R (National Union of Journalists) v <b>Central</b> <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Committee</b> as the Court of Appeal held that a recognised union which lacked any significant support could block the bargaining claim of a union with support. Third, the union must identify an appropriate [...] "bargaining unit" [...] for a collective agreement, which a government body named the <b>Central</b> <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Committee</b> (CAC) can verify and approve. On the union's proposal, the CAC must take into account whether the proposed bargaining unit is [...] "compatible with effective management", as well as the employer's views and the characteristics of the workers. The CAC has broad discretion, and may only be challenged by an employer under the general principles of natural justice in administrative law. In R (Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd) v CAC the Court of Appeal found that the CAC's determination that the appropriate bargaining unit was all of Kwik Fit's workers within the M25 London ring road. The union's recommendation is the starting point and the CAC is entitled to prefer this over an employer's alternative, especially since the employer will often attempt to define a larger [...] "unit" [...] so as to limit the likelihood of union members holding greater majority support. Fourth, once the bargaining unit is defined, the CAC may be satisfied that there is majority support for the union to represent the workforce and will make a recognition declaration. Alternatively, fifth, it may determine that the position is less clear and that a secret ballot is in the interests of good industrial relations. Sixth, if a ballot takes place both the union and the employer should have access to employees, and be able to distribute their arguments, and threats, bribes or undue influence are forbidden. Seventh, when a vote takes place the union must have at least 10 per cent membership, and win 50 per cent of the vote, or least 40 per cent of those entitled to vote. If the union wins a majority, the eighth and final step is that if the parties do not reach an agreement the CAC will regulate the collective agreement for the parties and the result will be legally binding. This contrasts to the basic position, under TULRCA 1992 section 179, which presumes that collective agreements are not intended to create legal relations. The long, problematic procedure, was partly based on the model of the US National Labor Relations Act 1935, but because of its cumbersome nature it strongly encourages the parties to seek voluntary agreement in the spirit of cooperation and good faith.|$|E
