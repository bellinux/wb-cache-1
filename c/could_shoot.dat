5|$|Another song {{sequence}} ("Suraj Hua Maddham") involving Khan and Kajol {{was shot}} with {{the backdrop of}} the Pyramids of Giza in the city of Cairo in Egypt. Due to the lighting conditions, the crew <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> only between 7 and 9am in the morning. As a result, the song took several days to film. In addition, Kajol suffered from a minor injury while filming for the song, as she had experienced a bad fall.|$|E
5|$|In the 37th minute, Bahr took a {{long shot}} from twenty-five yards out, but as Williams moved to his right to intercept, Gaetjens dived headlong near the penalty spot, and grazed the ball enough to {{put it to the}} left of the English goalkeeper, whose {{momentum}} prevented him from changing direction, and into the back of the net. The crowd exploded as the U.S. improbably led 1–0. As the half drew to a close, Finney had a chance to equalize, but the whistle blew before he <b>could</b> <b>shoot.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the scholar-officials viewed {{military}} {{soldiers as}} lower {{members in the}} hierarchic social order, a person could gain status and prestige in society by becoming a high-ranking military officer {{with a record of}} victorious battles. At its height, the Song military had one million soldiers divided into platoons of 50 troops, companies made of two platoons, battalions composed of 500 soldiers. Crossbowmen were separated from the regular infantry and placed in their own units as they were prized combatants, providing effective missile fire against cavalry charges. The government was eager to sponsor new crossbow designs that <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> at longer ranges, while crossbowmen were also valuable when employed as long-range snipers. Song cavalry employed a slew of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, spears, and 'fire lances' that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the {{threshold}} of Suk El Gharb, a village defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias coming up from the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda, Yarze, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene. The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a {{reduction in the number of}} attacks on the Marines.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{was laid}} down on 17 December 1906 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. Her {{completed}} hull was launched on 26 May 1908; she was christened after the 26th state by Mrs. F. W. Brooks, daughter of Secretary of the Navy Truman Newberry. Fitting out work {{was completed by}} 4 January 1910, when she was commissioned into the US Navy. After entering service, she {{was assigned to the}} Atlantic Fleet. She then began a shakedown cruise down to the Caribbean Sea that lasted until 7 June. Michigan joined training maneuvers off New England beginning on 29 July. A training cruise to Europe followed; she departed Boston, Massachusetts on 2 November and stops included Portland in the United Kingdom and Cherbourg, France. She arrived in the latter port on 8 December and remained there until the 30th, when she left for the Caribbean. The ship reached Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on 10 January 1911 and continued on to Norfolk, arriving four days later. During this period, future naval aviation pioneer John Henry Towers served aboard the ship as a spotter for the main guns. The long range of the guns, which <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> further than the horizon, convinced Towers of the need for spotter aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a yellow card in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a high pass to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he <b>could</b> <b>shoot.</b> Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Other enemies {{were created}} to add more variety. Large, indestructible Hulks, {{inspired}} by an enemy in Berzerk, were added to kill the humans on the stage. Though they cannot be destroyed, the developers decided to have the protagonist's projectiles slow the Hulk's movement {{as a way to}} help the player. Levitating Enforcers were added as enemies that <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> back at the main character; Jarvis and DeMar liked the idea of a floating robot and felt {{it would be easier to}} animate. A projectile algorithm was devised for Enforcers to simulate enemy artificial intelligence. The developers felt a simple algorithm of shooting directly at the protagonist would be ineffective because the character's constant motion would always result in a miss. Random elements were added to make the projectile more unpredictable; the Enforcer aims at a random location in a ten pixel radius around the character, and random acceleration curves the trajectory. To further differentiate Enforcers, Jarvis devised the Spheroid enemy as a robot that continually generated Enforcers, rather than have them already on the screen like other enemies. Brains were conceived as robots that could capture humans and brainwash them into enemies called Progs. DeMar devised the final enemies as a way to further increase the game's difficulty; Tanks that fire projectiles which bounce around the screen, and Quarks as a tank-producing robot.|$|E
25|$|The Prussians {{had more}} modern breech loading rifles that <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> {{faster than the}} Danish muzzle loading rifles. Thus the Prussians had a bigger firepower, {{than the number of}} {{soldiers}} points out, and the relative strength is shifted to their advantage. Especially old sources point to this difference that incidentally is repeated everywhere in the Second War of Schleswig.|$|E

25|$|Having {{very limited}} {{resources}} meant {{much about the}} filmmaking process relied heavily on the pragmatism of the filmmakers and their determination to get it done. Pre-production focussed on having a great script, finding a great cinematographer, actors, and music. The directors were inspired by the mumblecore movement of filmmakers. Alex Lisman the cinematographer had a documentary background so the directors knew he <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> fast and solidly.|$|E

25|$|At sea, {{manoeuvres}} {{were slightly}} different {{and more complex}} because the operator would {{need to find a}} proper and stable place to fire. Some Hwacha operators preferred to be on the rowers' deck where they were able to shoot from the windows, while others preferred to be on the main deck so they <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> at the sails of the enemy ships. These kind of manoeuvres were particularly seen on Korean Panokseon warships.|$|E
25|$|Together with an {{increasing}} centralisation {{of government in}} the Scandinavian countries, the old system of leidang—a fleet mobilisation system, where every skipen (ship community) had to deliver one ship and crew—was discontinued. Changes in shipbuilding {{in the rest of}} Europe led to the demise of the longship for military purposes. By the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> down into the relatively low longships.|$|E
25|$|When {{the writing}} team worked on an episode, each writer took a {{character}} {{and wrote the}} individual scenes surrounding them. These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode, and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> more scenes at a location. Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location. To do this, several scripts had to be ready. Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was important in a serialized drama because one has to know where each character's development is heading.|$|E

25|$|However, unnamed U.S. {{officials}} {{continued to}} deny that the shooting down of the satellite {{was in response to}} China’s ASAT test one year prior, or that they were trying to protect classified satellite technology. U.S. Officials pointed out that the U.S. had no reason to prove that it <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> down a satellite, as the U.S. had already publicly done so in the 1980s. Another key difference pointed out by General Cartwright was that this intercept happened at a much lower altitude, whereas China’s ASAT weapon destroyed a target at a much higher altitude, which resulting in the creation of debris which continues to pose a potential hazard to other spacecraft. Finally, U.S. officials again affirmed that the mission’s intent was to preserve human life.|$|E
25|$|The largest gun was a minion cannon {{which was}} brass, weighed about 1,200 pounds (545 kg), and <b>could</b> <b>shoot</b> a 3.5 pound (1.6 kg) {{cannonball}} almost a mile (1,600 m). The Mayflower also had {{on board a}} saker cannon of about 800 pounds (360 kg), and two base cannons that weighed about 200 pounds (90 kg) which shot a 3 to 5 ounce ball (85–140 g). She carried at least ten pieces of ordnance on the port and starboard sides of her gun deck: seven cannons for long range purposes, and three smaller guns often fired from the stern at close quarters that were filled with musket balls. Later at New Plymouth, Mayflower Master Jones unloaded four of the pieces to help fortify the colony against invaders, {{and would not have}} done so unless he was comfortable with the armament that he still had on board.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} called {{more than}} 130 witnesses and introduced more than 400 {{pieces of evidence}} intended to prove that Muhammad undertook the murders and ordered Malvo to help carry it out.

50|$|At the October 1924 {{trial of}} the sergeant, federal {{prosecutors}} argued that the <b>shooting</b> <b>could</b> not have been accidental, because the distance and angle from which Alexander Cronkhite was shot {{made it impossible for}} him to have done it himself. During his testimony, Caffey, who had been friendly with Alexander Cronkhite, demonstrated that not only <b>could</b> the <b>shooting</b> have been accidental, but that it was easy to create a series of plausible events which could have resulted in Alexander Cronkhite pulling the trigger by mistake. The prosecution's case collapsed, the sergeant was acquitted, and charges against the captain were soon dropped.|$|R
