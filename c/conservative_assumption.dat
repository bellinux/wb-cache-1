40|$|Many {{reactive}} systems must {{be designed}} and analyzed prior to deployment {{in the presence}} of considerable epistemic uncertainty: the precise nature of the external environment the system will encounter, as well as the run-time behavior of the platform upon which it is implemented, cannot be predicted with complete certainty prior to deployment. The widely-studied Vestal model for mixed-criticality workloads addresses uncertainties in estimating the worst-case execution time (WCET) of real-time code. Different estimations, at different levels of assurance, are made about these WCET values; it is required that all functionalities execute correctly if the less <b>conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> hold, while only the more critical functionalities are required to execute correctly in the (presumably less likely) event that the less <b>conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> fail to hold but the more <b>conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> do. A generalization of the Vestal model is considered here, in which a degraded (but non-zero) level of service is required for the less critical functionalities even in the event of only the more <b>conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> holding. An algorithm is derived for scheduling dual-criticality implicit-deadline sporadic task systems specified in this more general model upon preemptive uniprocessor platforms, and proved to be speedup-optimal...|$|R

50|$|This type of {{analysis}} {{is useful to}} determine how effective various test processes are at the detection of latent and dormant faults. The method used to accomplish this involves {{an examination of the}} applicable failure modes {{to determine whether or not}} their effects are detected, and to determine the percentage of failure rate applicable to the failure modes which are detected. The possibility that the detection means may itself fail latent should be accounted for in the coverage analysis as a limiting factor (i.e., coverage cannot be more reliable than the detection means availability). Inclusion of the detection coverage in the FMEA can lead to each individual failure that would have been one effect category now being a separate effect category due to the detection coverage possibilities. Another way to include detection coverage is for the FTA to conservatively assume that no holes in coverage due to latent failure in the detection method affect detection of all failures assigned to the failure effect category of concern. The FMEA can be revised ifnecessary for those cases where this <b>conservative</b> <b>assumption</b> does not allow the top event probability requirements to be met.|$|E
40|$|The Zero Power Physics Reactor (ZPPR) {{operated}} from April 18, 1969, until 1990. ZPPR operated at {{low power}} for testing nuclear reactor designs. This paper examines {{the temperature of}} Pu content ZPPR fuel while it is in storage. Heat is generated in the fuel due to Pu and Am decay and is a concern for possible cladding damage. Damage to the cladding could lead to fuel hydriding and oxidizing. A series of computer simulations were made to determine the range of temperatures potentially occuring in the ZPPR fuel. The maximum calculated fuel temperature is 292 °C (558 °F). <b>Conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> in the model intentionally overestimate temperatures. The stored fuel temperatures are dependent {{on the distribution of}} fuel in the surrounding storage compartments, the heat generation rate of the fuel, and the orientation of fuel. Direct fuel temperatures could not be measured but storage bin doors, storage sleeve doors, and storage canister temperatures were measured. Comparison of these three temperatures to the calculations indicates that the temperatures calculated with <b>conservative</b> <b>assumptions</b> are, as expected, higher than the actual temperatures.
