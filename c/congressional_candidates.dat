5|$|Brown had {{stated that}} {{win or lose}} in his 2014 New Hampshire Senatorial bid, he planned to remain a New Hampshire {{resident}} {{for the rest of}} his life. In January 2015, it was revealed that shortly after losing to Shaheen, Brown, age 55, filed an application to the Massachusetts State Retirement Board to claim a state pension. Brown has not ruled out running for office again in the future. Brown is also working as a contributor for Fox News Channel and as an on-call host for Fox & Friends.

5|$|Eric Sundwall, Chair of the New York Libertarian Party, was the Libertarian {{candidate}} for the seat. However, he {{was removed from the}} ballot on March 25, after 3,786 of the 6,730 signatures his campaign had collected were ruled invalid. Under state election law, independent <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> must collect at least 3,500 valid signatures to be on the ballot. Two Saratoga County residents challenged over 6,000 of Sundwall's signatures; Sundwall blamed Tedisco for the effort to have him removed from the ballot. The vast majority of the rejected signatures were from voters who put down their mailing address instead of the municipality in which they physically lived. Votes for Sundwall on absentee ballots, which were mailed out before he was removed from the ballot, were voided. On March 27, Sundwall announced that he would vote for Murphy in the election and urged his supporters to join him.|$|E

Treen of New Orleans, in {{a second}} race against Hale Boggs; William Stewart Walker of Winnfield, in a challenge to Speedy O. Long in the since defunct 8th district; Robert Angers of Lafayette, who opposed Edwin E. Willis of St. Martinville in the 3rd district, and Floyd O. Crawford of Baton Rouge, making a race against James H. Morrison. While Goldwater defeated Johnson in Louisiana and won some parishes by 5-1 margins or better, particularly in the northern tier, none of the <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> fared better than Walker's 46 percent showing against Speedy Long.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Republican <b>Congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> ran on a {{platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform. These measures and others formed the famous Contract with America, which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election. The Contract promised to bring all points up for a vote {{for the first time in}} history. The Republicans passed some of their proposals, but failed on others such as term limits.|$|E

Campaign laws forced Tancredo to resign from Team America PAC. The PAC was noted for targeting incumbent Congressman Chris Cannon in the 2006 Republican primary. In 2009, reporters discovered that Marcus Epstein, the Executive Director of Team America, had assaulted an African American woman in 2007, and had used a racial epithet. Tancredo kept Epstein on his staff despite the guilty plea.|$|E

UFCWâ€™s PAC spent $673,309 in independent expenditures promoting the election of Barack Obama in 2008 and contributed $1.8 million to Democratic federal candidates in 2008 and $1.7 million to Democratic <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> in 2010. In early 2011, the Obama administration granted waivers to 28 different UFCW healthcare plans, allowing them to avoid full compliance with the Affordable Care Act for a year.|$|E

500|$|After being elected, Jackson {{attempted}} to parlay his popularity into {{a seat on}} the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, using the leverage of his ability to perform voter registration drives.

500|$|The Democratic {{takeover}} of Congress during the 2006 Mid-term elections {{was a victory}} for Bayh, who had helped three Iowan <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> win their races during campaigning, and whose efforts culminated in a Democratic majority in the state's legislature. In regards to the election, he stated that [...] "we (the Democrats) won by turning the red states of the heartland blue". In mid-November, the candidate traveled to the West Coast for a fundraising tour. Late in the month, polls revealed that Bayh had a 43.3% likability rating among the American public, slightly ahead of the last placed finisher John Kerry at 39.6%.|$|E
500|$|William and Mary Bryan {{returned}} to Lincoln on November 1, {{two days before}} the election. [...] He was not yet done with campaigning, however; on November 2, he undertook a train journey across Nebraska in support of Democratic <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates.</b> [...] He made 27speeches, including seven in Omaha, the last concluding a few minutes before midnight. [...] His train reached Lincoln after the polls opened; he journeyed from train station to polling place to his house escorted by a mounted troop of supporters. [...] He slept much of the evening of election day, to be wakened by his wife with telegrams showing the election was most likely lost.|$|E
500|$|Hay {{continued}} to devote {{much of his}} energy to Republican politics. [...] In 1884, he supported Blaine for president, donating considerable sums to the senator's unsuccessful campaign against New York Governor Grover Cleveland. [...] Many of Hay's friends were unenthusiastic about Blaine's candidacy, to Hay's anger, and he wrote to editor Richard Watson Gilder, [...] "I {{have never been able}} to appreciate the logic that induces some excellent people every four years because they cannot nominate the candidate they prefer to vote for the party they don't prefer." [...] In 1888, Hay had to follow his own advice as his favored candidate, Ohio Senator John Sherman, was unsuccessful at the Republican convention. [...] After some reluctance, Hay supported the nominee, former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison, who was elected. [...] Though Harrison appointed men whom Hay supported, including Blaine, Reid, and Robert Lincoln, Hay was not asked to serve in the Harrison administration. In 1890, Hay spoke for Republican <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates,</b> addressing a rally of 10,000 people in New York City, but the party was defeated, losing control of Congress. Hay contributed funds to Harrison's unsuccessful re-election effort, in part because Reid had been made Harrison's 1892 running mate.|$|E

500|$|Bryan's {{nomination}} was denounced by many establishment Democrats. [...] President Cleveland, {{stunned by the}} convention's repudiation {{of him and his}} policies, decided against open support for a bolt from the party, either by endorsing McKinley or by publicly backing a rival Democratic ticket. [...] Nevertheless, Gold Democrats began plans to hold their own convention, which took place in September. [...] Many Cleveland supporters decried Bryan as no true Democrat, but a fanatic and socialist, his nomination procured through demagoguery. [...] Some of the Democratic political machines, such as New York's Tammany Hall, decided to ignore the national ticket and concentrate on electing local and <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates.</b> Large numbers of traditionally Democratic newspapers refused to support Bryan, including the New York World, whose circulation of 800,000 was the nation's largest, and major dailies in cities such as Philadelphia, Detroit, and Brooklyn. [...] Southern newspapers stayed with Bryan; they were unwilling to endorse McKinley, the choice of most African Americans, though few of them could vote in the South. [...] Newspapers that supported other parties in western silver states, such as the Populist Rocky Mountain News of Denver, Colorado, and Utah's Republican The Salt Lake Tribune, quickly endorsed Bryan.|$|E

2500|$|After {{considerable}} {{discussion and}} debate the PHL and PNH parties responded to pressures from labor, {{business and the}} military. On January 7, 1971, they signed a political pact agreeing to establish a national-unity government after the March elections. The purposes of the pact were twofold. The first was to present a single slate of <b>congressional</b> <b>candidates</b> that would divide the Congress equally between the PLH and PNH (each party would run its own candidate for the presidency).|$|E
