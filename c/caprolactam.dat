2500|$|Although rather unreactive, {{cyclohexane}} undergoes {{catalytic oxidation}} to produce cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol. [...] The cyclohexanonecyclohexanol mixture, called [...] "KA oil", is a {{raw material for}} adipic acid and <b>caprolactam,</b> precursors to nylon.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclohexane is a {{cycloalkane}} {{with the}} molecular formula C6H12 (the alkyl is abbreviated Cy).

2500|$|Sulfuric acid is {{used for}} a variety of other {{purposes}} in the chemical industry.

Much [...] is used in petroleum refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of isobutane with isobutylene to give isooctane, a compound that raises the octane rating of gasoline (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also often used as a dehydrating or oxidising agent in industrial reactions, such as the dehydration of various sugars to form solid carbon.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Caprolactam</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in the late 1800s when it was prepared by the cyclization of ε-aminocaproic acid, {{the product of the}} hydrolysis of <b>caprolactam.</b> Given the commercial significance of Nylon-6, many methods have been developed for the production of <b>caprolactam.</b> Most of the <b>caprolactam</b> is synthesised from cyclohexanone (1), which is first converted to its oxime (2).

50|$|<b>Caprolactam</b> (CPL) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (CH2)5C(O)NH. This colourless solid is a lactam (a cyclic amide) of caproic acid. Approximately 4.5 billion kilograms are produced annually. <b>Caprolactam</b> is the precursor to Nylon 6, a widely used synthetic polymer.|$|E
50|$|Nylon 6 can be {{modified}} using comonomers or stabilizers during polymerization to introduce new chain end or functional groups, which changes the reactivity and chemical properties. It’s often done to change its dyeability or flame retardance. Nylon 6 is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of <b>caprolactam.</b> <b>Caprolactam</b> has 6 carbons, hence 'Nylon 6'. When <b>caprolactam</b> is heated at about 533 K in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen for about 4-5 hours, the ring breaks and undergoes polymerization. Then the molten mass is passed through spinnerets to form fibres of nylon 6.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} works, {{owned by}} Nypro UK (a {{joint venture between}} Dutch State Mines (DSM) and the British National Coal Board (NCB)) had originally produced fertiliser from by-products of the coke ovens of a nearby steelworks. Since 1967, it had instead produced <b>caprolactam,</b> a chemical used {{in the manufacture of}} nylon 6. The <b>caprolactam</b> was produced from cyclohexanone. This was originally produced by hydrogenation of phenol, but in 1972 additional capacity was added built to a DSM design in which hot liquid cyclohexane was partially oxidised by compressed air. The plant was intended to produce 70,000 tpa (tons per annum) of <b>caprolactam</b> but was reaching a rate of only 47,000 tpa in early 1974. Government controls on the price of <b>caprolactam</b> put further financial pressure on the plant.|$|E
