40|$|Objective. To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of unmet health <b>care</b> demands among rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, and to determine if these unmet demands indicate underuse. Methods.

Factors associated with greater psychosocial problems of the primary caregivers include having an affected person at home, the carer being a spouse, demanding behaviours of the cared person such as depression, behavioural disturbances, hallucinations, sleep problems or walking disruptions and social isolation. Regarding economic problems, family caregivers often give up time from work to spend 47 hours per week on average with the person with AD, while the costs of <b>caring</b> for them are high.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} perceptions of competence affect the <b>care</b> of older persons, {{and the values}} ​​and vocational conceptions of <b>care</b> work and <b>care</b> recipients that {{are tied to the}} perceptions of what skills that are needed and why. Competence is defined by three parts with relevance for the content of <b>care</b> work: what knowledge the <b>care</b> workers should have, what tasks they should perform and how they should respond to <b>care</b> recipients. The aim of this dissertation is to analyse how the <b>care</b> managers' and <b>care</b> workers' perceptions of competence form the direction of the <b>care</b> work and how that direction relates to the <b>care</b> recipients’ perceptions of and expectations on the <b>care</b> work.   The <b>care</b> work is characterised by what is analysed as an activation of the recipients - that the recipients themselves should perform as much of the <b>care</b> work as possible. The activation aims at managing the decay of the aging body and is motivated by a vocational conception of the <b>care</b> recipients as different from others, with designations as grateful and passive. This conception is analysed as generation character based on an idea among the <b>care</b> managers and <b>care</b> workers that the society in which the recipients grew up gave them certain cognitive prerequisites that have to be managed in the practical <b>care</b> work.   The <b>care</b> recipients in the study have opposing conceptions and perceptions of <b>care</b> work compared with the <b>care</b> managers and <b>care</b> workers. The recipients’ central objective with the <b>care</b> work is to prevent what has been interpreted as the disrepair of the home. The <b>care</b> recipients’ position in the organisation raises the problem of loyalty towards the <b>care</b> workers and in some sense the <b>care</b> managers. Their loyalty reduces their ability to complain and to influence their situation to the better.   Keywords: <b>care</b> of older persons, <b>care</b> needs, <b>care</b> work, <b>care</b> relationship, <b>care</b> receivers, <b>care</b> workers, <b>care</b> managers, competence, technologies, activation, generation characte...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} <b>care</b> goals set by <b>care</b> providers, their associated factors, and assess the process of <b>care</b> goal setting in facilities for elderly people. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with <b>care</b> providers (e. g., physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, <b>care</b> managers, caregivers), and responses were qualitatively analyzed and categorized by content. Results: A total of 30 <b>care</b> providers from seven facilities were interviewed. Six themes emerged pertaining to <b>care</b> goals for elderly residents. “Daily <b>care</b> goals” and “long-term <b>care</b> goals” reflected the conditions of residents and their <b>care</b> goals. “Staff awareness of residents and work”, “relationships among <b>care</b> providers”, and “relationships between <b>care</b> providers and families of residents” influenced <b>care</b> goals. The categories “difficulty of setting <b>care</b> goals”, “difficulty of evaluation”, and “hesitancy in getting involved” were reflected in “conflicts and complaints about ideal <b>care</b> and the feasibility of setting goals”. Conclusion: <b>Care</b> providers were conflicted in <b>care</b> goal setting given the coexistence of long- and short-term <b>care</b> goals, both of which were influenced by several factors.
