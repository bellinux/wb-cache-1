5000|$|The terms piracy {{and theft}} are often {{associated}} with copyright infringement. The original meaning of [...] is [...] "robbery or illegal violence at sea", but the term has been in use for centuries as a synonym for acts of copyright infringement.

However, copyright {{is a type of}} intellectual property, an area of law distinct from that which covers robbery or theft, offenses related only to tangible property. Not all copyright infringement results in <b>commercial</b> <b>loss,</b> and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that infringement does not easily equate with theft.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are seven}} {{different}} species of Botrytis associated with onions in storage but the rot induced by B. allii and B. aclada causes the greatest <b>commercial</b> <b>loss.</b> The two can be distinguished microscopically; the conidia of B. allii have a maximum length of 15 μm and mean size of 10.2 × 5.7 μm, while the conidia of B. aclada have a maximum length of 12 μm and mean size of 8.6 × 4.6 μm. The infection {{is present in the}} field but does not manifest itself until after harvest, however there may be a falling off of vigour while the crop is still growing, particularly in cool, moist weather. In the stored crop, the rot typically starts in the neck of the bulb but can occur in other parts if there is physical injury. [...] The scales inside the bulb become progressively translucent and watery and a mycelium develops between them. A mass of grey conidiophores and conidia develop on the mycelium and blackish sclerotia form {{at the site of the}} initial infection.|$|E
50|$|While it {{may seem}} logical to {{attribute}} the reduction in transportation prices to the Trans-Iranian Railway, in reality it contributed minimally. Initially, British and Russian observers considered the implantation of railroads as the ultimate solution to the immense transportation problems Iran faced due to sparsely settled population, the lack of rivers, high mountains, and inhospitable desert regions of the country. Many Americans and British opposed the Trans-Iranian Railway, suggesting more efficient and less expensive modes of transportation, such as the U.S. Army’s Motor Transport Service, which hauled about a fourth of the volume hauled by the railway to the Soviet border. Some British critics, including General Percy Sykes, opposed the railway because it ran north to south, rather than from west to east. The west to east route was preferred because it would allow the British direct access to their military bases in India and Mesopotamia, {{and at the same}} time, avoiding the threat of <b>commercial</b> <b>loss</b> of profit to Russia and any foreign rival. There were also Iranians opposed to the building of the railway as well, believing that the money could instead be much more effectively used on roads. However, if a cabinet minister was caught criticizing the extensive tax burden the railway produced, he could be placed in prison on counts of being a British collaborator, decidedly attempting to keep Iran backwards for his own financial and strategic goals.|$|E
50|$|Reliability or {{electricity}} supply is very low, linked both to technical and institutional {{deficiencies in the}} sector, with total losses close to 40% and <b>commercial</b> <b>losses</b> of about 30%.

40|$|Transmitting {{sensitive}} data over non-secret channels has always required encryption technologies {{to ensure that}} the data arrives without exposure to eavesdroppers. The Internet has made it possible to transmit vast volumes of data more rapidly and cheaply and to a wider audience than ever before. At the same time, strong encryption makes it possible to send data securely, to digitally sign it, to prove it was sent or received, and to guarantee its integrity. The Internet and encryption make bulk transmission of data a commercially viable proposition. However, there are implementation challenges to solve before commercial bulk transmission becomes mainstream. Powerful have a performance cost, and may affect quality of service. Without encryption, intercepted data may be illicitly duplicated and re-sold, or its commercial value diminished because its secrecy is lost. Performance degradation and potential for <b>commercial</b> <b>loss</b> discourage the bulk transmission of data over the Internet in any commercial application. This paper outlines technical solutions to these problems. We develop new technologies and combine existing ones in new and powerful ways to minimise <b>commercial</b> <b>loss</b> without compromising performance or inflating overheads...|$|E

Humanity finds itself confronting an enormous energy Challenge which shows that current patterns of energy use are environmentally unsustainable. Overwhelming reliance on fossil fuels, in particular, threatens to alter the Earth’s climate to an extent that could have grave consequences on the integrity of vital human and natural systems. At the same time, access to energy continues to divide the ‘haves ’ from the ‘have-nots’, as a greater {{part of the world}} especially Africa still lacks access to one or several types of basic energy services, including electricity, clean cooking fuels and adequate means of transportation.

40|$|AbstractProblems {{associated}} with mal operation of relays or Non operation of relays results in larger outage time and huge <b>commercial</b> <b>loss</b> in process industries and power plants. This paper proposes {{a new technique}} for set-ting all Over Current (OC) relays in substations, process industries with cogeneration and distribution system with Embedded Renewable Generation. This technique is more suitable {{where there is a}} drastic change in the fault current based on the network topology and configuration. It is based on an appropriate equivalent circuit of the power grid to estimate the required short-circuit currents. This technique is used in setting the OC relays of an IEEE 30 Bus system, Real time steel industry and a Real time distribution system with Embedded Renewable Generation. Plug setting, Time Dial setting and Type of curve are optimized which results in better coordination in terms protection of components and maintaining the time interval between down stream and upstream relays. There is a significant reduction in fault clearing time which reduces the damage and enhance the stability. In addition, it also prevents all the mal operation of relays and nuisance tripping. This concept will helpful in developing the auto setting relays in the future.

40|$|How can a {{computer}} program developer ensure that a program actually implements its intended purpose? This article describes a method for checking the correctness of certain types of computer programs. The method is used commercially {{in the development of}} programs implemented as integrated circuits and is applicable to the development of “control-intensive ” software programs as well. “Divide-and-conquer ” techniques central to this method apply to a broad range of program verification methodologies. Classical methods for testing and quality control no longer are sufficient to protect us from communication network collapses, fatalities from medical machinery malfunction, rocket guidance failure, or a half-billion dollar <b>commercial</b> <b>loss</b> due to incorrect arithmetic in a popular integrated circuit. These sensational examples are only the headline cases. Behind them are multitudes of mundane programs whose failures merely infuriate their users and cause increased costs to their producers. A source of such problems is the growth in program complexity. The more a program controls, the more types of interactions it supports. For example, the telephone “call-forwarding ” service (forwarding incoming calls to a customer-designated number) interacts with the “billing ” program that must determine whether the forwarding number or the calling number gets charged for the additional connection to the customer-designated number. At the same time, call-forwarding interacts with the “connection ” program that deals with the issue o...|$|E
