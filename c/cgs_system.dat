500|$|Four {{years after}} the Indian Government {{announced}} its metrication programme, SI was published. The result was that the initial metrication programme was a conversion to the <b>CGS</b> <b>system</b> of units and the subsequent adoption of SI has been haphazard. Originally the Indian Government had planned to replace all units of measure with metric units by 1960. In 1976 a new Weights and Measures Act replaced the 1956 Act which, amongst other things, [...] required that all weighing devices be approved before being released onto the market place.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel path {{sampling}} method {{based on the}} Onsager-Machlup (OM) action by generalizing the multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) technique suggested by Moritsugu and coworkers (J. Chem. Phys. 133, 224105 (2010)). The basic idea of this method is that the system we want to study (for example, some molecular system described by molecular mechanics) is coupled to a coarse-grained (<b>CG)</b> <b>system,</b> which can move more quickly and computed more efficiently than the original system. We simulate this combined <b>system</b> (original + <b>CG</b> <b>system)</b> using (underdamped) Langevin dynamics where different heat baths are coupled to the two systems. When the coupling is strong enough, the original system is guided by the <b>CG</b> <b>system,</b> and able to sample the configuration and path space more efficiency. We need to correct the bias caused by the coupling, however, by employing the Hamiltonian replica exchange where we prepare many path replica with different coupling strengths. As a result, an unbiased path ensemble for the original system {{can be found in}} the weakest coupling path ensemble. This strategy is easily implemented because a weight for a path calculated by the OM action is formally the same as the Boltzmann weight if we properly define the path "Hamiltonian". We apply this method to a model polymer with Asakura-Oosawa interaction, and compare the results with the conventional transition path sampling method. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figures, submitted to J.

500|$|During {{the next}} eighty years {{a number of}} Parliamentary select {{committees}} recommended {{the adoption of the}} metric system, each with a greater degree of urgency, but Parliament prevaricated. A Select Committee report of 1862 recommended compulsory metrication, but with an [...] "Intermediate permissive phase"; Parliament responded in 1864 by legalising metric units only for 'contracts and dealings'. The United Kingdom initially declined to sign the Treaty of the Metre, but did so in 1883. Meanwhile, British scientists and technologists were {{at the forefront of the}} metrication movement – it was the British Association for the Advancement of Science that promoted the <b>CGS</b> <b>system</b> of units as a coherent system and it was the British firm Johnson Matthey that was accepted by the CGPM in 1889 to cast the international prototype metre and kilogram.|$|E
500|$|Both {{the degree}} {{and rate of}} {{adoption}} of SI varied from country to country—countries that had not adopted the metric system by 1960 and subsequently adopted SI did so directly {{as part of their}} metrication programs while others migrated from the <b>CGS</b> <b>system</b> of units to SI. In 1960, the world's largest economy was that of the United States, followed by the Soviet Union (although an accurate estimate of 1960 GDP for this country is not available), West Germany, France, Japan, China and India. The United States and the United Kingdom were non-metric, Soviet Union was metric, France and Germany had been using the metric system for about a century, and China had been using the metric system for 35 years, while India and Japan had adopted the metric system within the preceding five years. [...] Other non-metric countries were those where the United Kingdom or the United States had considerable influence. [...] These differences are brought out in the examples below: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1837 {{the metric}} system was re-adopted by France, and also {{during the first}} half of the 19th century was adopted by the {{scientific}} community. In the middle of the century, James Clerk Maxwell put forward the concept of a coherent system where a small number of units of measure were defined as base units, and all other units of measure, called derived units, were defined in terms of the base units. Maxwell proposed three base units: length, mass and time. This concept worked well with [...] mechanics, but attempts to describe electromagnetic forces in terms of these units encountered difficulties. By the end of the 19th century, four principal variants of the metric system were in use for the measurement of electromagnetic phenomena: three based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (<b>CGS</b> <b>system),</b> and one on the metre-kilogram-second system of units (MKS system). This impasse was resolved by Giovanni Giorgi, who in 1901 proved that a coherent system that incorporated electromagnetic units had to have an electromagnetic unit as a fourth base unit.|$|E

The long-term cropping systems on a Gray Luvisol at Breton were studied. They included: (i) an agro-ecological 8 -yr rotation (AER), established in 1981, which involved addition of both fababean green manure and manure from livestock fed with forages and fababeans grown in the rotation: (ii) a continuous grain (barley) <b>system</b> (<b>CG),</b> with fertilizer N at 90  kg ha− 1 y− 1, established in 1981; (iii) a classical Breton 5 -yr rotation (CBR) involving forages and cereals, with no return of crop residues or manure, established in 1930. Mean barley yields were 16 – 19 % higher in the AER (P ≤  0. 05) than in the <b>CG</b> <b>system,</b> and yield on either was about double that of the CBR.
