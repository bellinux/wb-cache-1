40|$|Temporal {{specification}} languages {{provide an}} {{efficient way to}} express events comprised of complex temporal scenarios. Assertions based on these languages are used to detect violations of the specification and monitor coverage events. In this paper, we propose to extend temporal specification languages, and assertions based on these languages with auxiliary variables. We attach these variables to sub-expressions and assign them values when the subexpressions are evaluated. The use of auxiliary variables enables the implementation of large cross-product <b>coverage</b> <b>models,</b> using small number of assertions. This simplifies the definition and implementation of <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> and helps reduce the simulation overhead caused by assertions, thus increasing the efficiency of simulation resources...|$|R
40|$|Test {{coverage}} {{is a key}} qualification tool for driving schematic design, board layout and test program development for enabling the best production yield. A number of different test <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> ranging from MPS to PCOLA/SOQ and PPVS have been developed in defining how the coverage metric is calculated using different fault <b>models.</b> These test <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> have been invariably {{used to determine the}} level of test coverage using structural test strategies, such as AOI, AXI, FPT, ICT, and Boundary-Scan. This paper will discuss the contribution of functional board test (FT) strategy to detect structural defects in production and as a strategy to validate the design or the function. ...|$|R
5000|$|As some {{of these}} {{encoding}} formats are not capable of incorporating all metadata making up a coverage, the <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> foresees a multipart MIME encoding (see Figure) where the first component encodes the coverage description (domain extent, range type, metadata, etc.) {{and the second part}} consists of the range set [...] "payload" [...] using some encoding format.|$|E
5000|$|Early GIS {{systems were}} often characterised as either 'raster' or 'vector' systems, {{depending}} on the underlying approach to handling geometry. Raster GIS {{could be interpreted as}} using a regular discrete <b>coverage</b> <b>model,</b> while Vector GIS are more feature-oriented. The term [...] "coverage" [...] was most notably applied to the legacy Arc/INFO format developed by ESRI. At that time this was a novel concept, extending CAD formats into more spatially aware data that featured linked attributes. This usage was consistent with the coverage concept discussed here, in the sense that an Arc/Info coverage provided a one-to-one mapping from space to the thematic value or classification for each layer or coverage. However, Arc/Info coverages had a particular topological approach to ensure completeness and uniqueness, processed using the BUILD and CLEAN commands are 2D planar datasets that maintain topological information, thus a polygon [...] "knows" [...] which segments of its perimeter it shares with adjacent polygons. Due to the lack of processing power in computing {{at the time of its}} development, the <b>Coverage</b> <b>model</b> employs indexed binary files to store spatial and attribute data separately as opposed to utilizing a RDBMS.|$|E

In 1950 Poe joined McCeney as co-publisher and business partner of The News Leader, while remaining its editor.|$|E
40|$|Coverage {{analysis}} {{is used to}} monitor {{the quality of the}} verification process. Reports provided by coverage tools help users identify areas in the design that have not been adequately tested. Because of their sheer size, the analysis of large <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> can be an intimidating and time-consuming task. Practically, it can only be done by focusing on specific parts of the model. This paper presents a method for defining views onto the coverage data of cross-product functional <b>coverage</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed method allows users to focus on certain aspects of the coverage data to extract relevant, useful information, thereby improving the quality of the coverage analysis. A number of examples are provided that show how the proposed method improved the verification of actual designs...|$|R

The cost of testing is usually between 4080 % of the development process (70 % for Microsoft) as compared with less than 20 % for the coding itself [4].

40|$|Sensor networks, which {{consist of}} sensor nodes each capable of sensing {{environment}} and transmitting data, {{have lots of}} applications in battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, industrial diagnostics, etc. Coverage {{which is one of}} the most important performance metrics for sensor networks reflects how well a sensor field is monitored. Individual sensor <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> are dependent on the sensing functions of different types of sensors, while network-wide sensing coverage is a collective performance measure for geographically distributed sensor nodes. This article surveys research progress made to address various coverage problems in sensor networks. We first provide discussions on sensor <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> and design issues. The coverage problems in sensor networks can be classified into three categories according to the subject to be covered. We state the basic coverage problems in each category, and review representative solution approaches in the literature. We also provide comments and discussions on some extensions and variants of these basic coverage problems...|$|R
50|$|Coverages {{represent}} digital {{geospatial information}} representing space/time-varying phenomena. OGC Abstract Topic 6 - which {{is identical to}} ISO 19123 - defines an abstract model of coverages. Many implementations are conceivable which all conform to this abstract model while not being interoperable.This abstract <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> is concretized {{to the level of}} interoperability by the OGC standard GML 3.2.1 Application Schema - Coverages (often referred to as GMLCOV) which in turn is based on the Geography Markup Language (GML) 3.2, an XML grammar written in XML Schema for the description of application schemas as well as the transport and storage of geographic information.|$|E
50|$|Pocket Communications {{began in}} San Antonio, TX in June 2006, {{including}} the Pocket mascot Harry the chimp and has followed an expansion strategy towards south Texas ever since. Besides covering the greater San Antonio area, they {{service to the}} north along major roads, reaching as far as Fredericksburg, Texas, and to the south including Laredo, Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. Also, an unconfirmed call to Pocket customer service suggests that other major Texas markets will be covered in the future. Pocket started service in Hartford, Connecticut and Springfield, Massachusetts. Pocket seems to pursue a monolithic <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> like Sprint or T-Mobile, where all markets are connected by cellular coverage, rather than having islands of service across the nation like MetroPCS and Cricket do. They have now released roaming capability via a partnership with MetroPCS to boost coverage and sold at most Pocket stores in Rio Grande valley and San Antonio TX in over 120 locations including 42 local HEB stores. According to information advertised by Pocket over 170,000 have subscribed to its first month free service as of May 12, 2008, just after twenty months {{of being in the}} business. 1xRTT data access was available while unlimited directory assistance was also available at an additional charge. Additionally, Pocket offers a prepaid funds account, also known as the Value Pocket, from which can be drawn such features as international calling, long distance, outgoing text messaging (incoming messages are free) and picture messages if such features are not added to the subscriber's plan. Pocket recently expanded its operations to the northeastern part of the United States adding a regional headquarters in Bloomfield, CT and are {{now in the process of}} extending their coverage to Corpus Christi, Texas. In September 2010, Pocket announced that they would shutter their operations in Connecticut and Massachusetts due to the weak economy, competition and high cost of building an infrastructure. Pocket announced that service in these areas would be discontinued in late October. The New England spectrum and network were sold to MetroPCS after being shut down. MetroPCS relaunched service on the former Pocket network in March 2011.|$|E
30|$|Target {{tracking}} {{is another}} important property of border intrusion detection. It is still a problem to illustrate which kind of <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> is the most efficient one. We presented an one-directional <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> for border intrusion detection. Specifically, we discussed both one intruder scene and multiple intruder scene. Furthermore we also proposed the possibility of heterogeneous sensors cooperative for intrusion detection. Energy efficiency is not only reflected in the barrier construction algorithm, but also the network <b>coverage</b> <b>model.</b> The experimental results shows that the proposed algorithm could be extend the lifetime of the wireless sensor network.|$|E

40|$|We are {{interested}} in phase transitions in certain percolation models on point processes and their dependence on clustering properties of the point processes. We show that point processes with smaller void probabilities and factorial moment measures than the stationary Poisson point process exhibit non-trivial phase transition in the percolation of some <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> based on level-sets of additive functionals of the point process. Examples of such point processes are determinantal point processes, some perturbed lattices, and more generally, negatively associated point processes. Examples of such <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> are k-coverage in the Boolean <b>model</b> (<b>coverage</b> by at least k grains) and SINR-coverage (coverage if the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio is large). In particular, we answer in affirmative the hypothesis of existence of phase transition in the percolation of k-faces in the Čech simplicial complex (called also clique percolation) on point processes which cluster less than the Poisson process. We also construct a Cox point process, which is "more clustered" than the Poisson point process and whose Boolean model percolates for arbitrarily small radius. This shows that clustering (at least, as detected by our specific tools) does not always "worsen" percolation, {{as well as that}} upper-bounding this clustering by a Poisson process is a consequential assumption for the phase transition to hold.

40|$|Coverage and {{connectivity}} are {{two important}} performance metrics in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we study the sensor placement problem to achieve both coverage and connectivity. Instead {{of using the}} simplistic disk <b>coverage</b> <b>model,</b> we use our recently proposed confident information <b>coverage</b> <b>model</b> as the sensor <b>coverage</b> <b>model.</b> The grid approach is applied to discretize the sensing field, and our objective is to place the minimum number of sensors to form a connected network and to provide confident information coverage {{for all of the}} grid points. We first formulate the sensor placement problem as a constrained optimization problem. Then, two heuristic algorithms, namely the connected cover formation (CCF) algorithm and the cover formation and relay placement with redundancy removal (CFRP-RR) algorithm, are proposed to find the approximate solutions for the sensor placement problem. The simulation results validate their effectiveness, and the CCF algorithm performs slightly better than the CFRP-RR algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- To {{systematically}} {{establish that}} a design satisfies its requirements, the design model is analyzed {{with respect to}} a set of test cases to establish a measure of so-called <b>model</b> <b>coverage.</b> If less than 100 % <b>coverage</b> of <b>model</b> behavior is achieved, the design contains unintended functionality or there may be lacking test cases, which in turn may be because of missing requirements. This paper presents the use of <b>model</b> <b>coverage</b> in education, illustrated by the design of an aircraft attitude control system. <b>Model</b> <b>coverage</b> provides a measure of quality of a design task performed by a student while it can help obtain insight into details of critical behavior of a design and how to correct problems discovered.

40|$|Aeromedical {{and ground}} {{ambulance}} services often team up {{in responding to}} trauma crashes, especially when the emergency helicopter is unable to land at the crash scene. We propose location <b>coverage</b> <b>models</b> and a greedy heuristic for their solution to simultaneously locate ground and air ambulances, and landing zones (transfer points). We provide a coverage definition based on both response time and total service time, and consider three coverage options; only ground Emergency Medical Services (EMS) coverage, only air EMS coverage, or joint coverage of ground and air EMS in which the patient is transferred from an ambulance into an emergency helicopter at a transfer point. To analyze this complex coverage situation we develop two sets of models which are variations of the Location Set Covering Problem (LSCP) and the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP). These models address uncertainty in spatial distribution of motor vehicle crash locations by providing coverage to a given set of both crash nodes and paths. The models also consider unavailability of ground ambulances by drawing upon concepts from backup <b>coverage</b> <b>models.</b> We illustrate our results on a case study that uses crash data {{from the state of}} New Mexico.
