Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic <b>cleavages</b> that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these <b>cleavages</b> and fostering the emergence of new and distinct social identities.|$|E

25|$|As <b>cleavage</b> is a {{function}} of crystallography, {{there are a variety of}} <b>cleavage</b> types. <b>Cleavage</b> occurs typically in either one, two, three, four, or six directions. Basal <b>cleavage</b> in one direction is a distinctive property of the micas. Two-directional <b>cleavage</b> is described as prismatic, and occurs in minerals such as the amphiboles and pyroxenes. Minerals such as galena or halite have cubic (or isometric) <b>cleavage</b> in three directions, at 90°; when three directions of <b>cleavage</b> are present, but not at 90°, such as in calcite or rhodochrosite, it is termed rhombohedral <b>cleavage.</b> Octahedral <b>cleavage</b> (four directions) is present in fluorite and diamond, and sphalerite has six-directional dodecahedral <b>cleavage.</b>|$|R

The mature nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B) generation relies on the activity of viral proteinases. The NS2/NS3 junction is cleaved by a metal dependent autocatalytic proteinase encoded within NS2 and the N-terminus of NS3. The remaining <b>cleavages</b> downstream from this site are catalysed by a serine proteinase also contained within the N-terminal region of NS3.|$|E

5000|$|Disjunctive <b>cleavage</b> {{describes}} {{a type of}} spaced <b>cleavage</b> where the microlithons are not deformed into microfolds, and formation is independent from any previous foliation present in the rock. A common outdated term for disjunctive <b>cleavage</b> is fracture <b>cleavage.</b> It is recommended that this term be avoided because of the tendency to misinterpret {{the formation of a}} <b>cleavage</b> feature.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the nature}} of <b>cleavage</b> is {{dependent}} on scale, slaty <b>cleavage</b> is defined as having 0.01 mm or less of space occurring between layers. Slaty <b>cleavage</b> often occurs after diagenesis and is the first <b>cleavage</b> feature to form after deformation begins. The tectonic strain must be enough to allow a new strong foliation to form, i.e. slaty <b>cleavage.</b>|$|R

The polyprotein is first cut to yield P1, P2 and P3. P1 becomes myristylated at the N terminus before being cleaved to VP0, VP3 and VP1, the proteins that will form procapsids; VP0 will later be cleaved to produce VP2 and VP4. Other cleavage products include 3B (VPg), 2C (an ATPase) and 3D (the RNA polymerase).|$|E
25|$|Mujib's {{six points}} ran {{directly}} counter to President Ayub's plan for greater national integration. Ayub's anxieties were {{shared by many}} West Pakistanis, who feared that Mujib's plan would divide Pakistan by encouraging ethnic and linguistic <b>cleavages</b> in West Pakistan, and would leave East Pakistan, with its Bengali ethnic and linguistic unity, {{by far the most}} populous and powerful of the federating units. Ayub interpreted Mujib's demands as tantamount to a call for independence. After pro-Mujib supporters rioted in a general strike in Dhaka, the government arrested Mujib in January 1968.|$|E
25|$|Minerals {{with many}} <b>{{cleavage}}s</b> might not break equally well {{in all of}} the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three direction, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave in two directions at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave in two directions separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} a novel Zn 2 +-catalyzed <b>cleavage</b> site between nucleotides C 3 and U 4 {{in the catalytic}} core of the hammerhead ribozyme. In {{contrast to}} previously described divalent metal-ion-dependent <b>cleavage</b> of RNA, U 4 <b>cleavage</b> is only observed {{in the presence of}} Zn 2 +. This new <b>cleavage</b> site has an unusual pH dependence, in that U 4 <b>cleavage</b> products are only observed above pH 7. 9 and reach a maximum yield at about pH 8. 5. These data, together with the fact that no metal ion-binding site is observed in proximity to the U 4 <b>cleavage</b> site in either of the crystal structures, point toward a pH-dependent conformational change in the hammerhead ribozyme. We have described previously Zn 2 +-dependent <b>cleavage</b> between G 8 and A 9 in the hammerhead ribozyme and have discovered that U 4 <b>cleavage</b> occurs only after A 9 <b>cleavage.</b> To our knowledge, this is the first example of sequential <b>cleavage</b> events as a possible regulatory mechanism in ribozymes...|$|R
50|$|The {{affinity}} of {{estradiol valerate}} (before <b>cleavage)</b> for the estrogen receptor is approximately 50 times {{lower than that}} of estradiol (after <b>cleavage).</b> In addition, estradiol valerate (before <b>cleavage)</b> is unable to reach target tissues in any concentration of significance, if at all. As such, estradiol valerate (before <b>cleavage)</b> is essentially inactive in terms of estrogenic effect itself, acting solely as a prodrug to estradiol (after <b>cleavage).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{cleavage}} {{area between}} the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest. Breast and buttock <b>cleavages,</b> sharing a similarity between their appearances, {{are considered to be}} very sexual. British zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks. Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Jagged1 (JAG1) {{is one of}} five cell surface {{proteins}} (ligands) that {{interact with}} 4 receptors in the mammalian Notch signaling pathway. The Notch Signaling Pathway is a highly conserved pathway that functions to establish and regulate cell fate decisions in many organ systems. Once the JAG1-NOTCH (receptor-ligand) interactions take place, a cascade of proteolytic <b>cleavages</b> is triggered resulting in activation of the transcription for downstream target genes. Located on human chromosome 20, the JAG1 gene is expressed in multiple organ systems in the body and causes the autosomal dominant disorder Alagille syndrome (ALGS) resulting from loss of function mutations within the gene. JAG1 has also been designated as CD339 (cluster of differentiation 339).|$|E
25|$|The {{complement}} system {{consists of a}} number of small proteins found in the blood, in general synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating as inactive precursors (pro-proteins). When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further <b>cleavages.</b> The end result of this complement activation or complement fixation cascade is stimulation of phagocytes to clear foreign and damaged material, proxy inflammation to attract additional phagocytes, and activation of the cell-killing membrane attack complex. Over 30 proteins and protein fragments make up the {{complement system}}, including serum proteins, serosal proteins, and cell membrane receptors. They account for about 10% of the globulin fraction of blood serum and can serve as opsonins.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a localized calcium (Ca) signal at the growing end of the <b>cleavage</b> furrow triggers <b>cleavage</b> furrow formation in large eggs. We have examined the possible role of a Ca signal in <b>cleavage</b> furrow formation in the Xenopus laevis egg during the first <b>cleavage.</b> We were able to detect two kinds of Ca waves along the <b>cleavage</b> furrow. However, the Ca waves appeared after <b>cleavage</b> furrow formation in late stages of the first <b>cleavage.</b> In addition, <b>cleavage</b> was not affected by injection of dibromoBAPTA or EGTA into the eggs at a concentration sufficient to suppress the Ca waves. Furthermore, even smaller classes of Ca release such as Ca puffs and Ca blips do not occur at the growing end of the <b>cleavage</b> furrow. These observations demonstrate that localized Ca signals in the <b>cleavage</b> furrow {{are not involved in}} cytokinesis. The two Ca waves have unique characteristics. The first wave propagates only in the region of newly inserted membrane along the <b>cleavage</b> furrow. On the other hand, the second wave propagates along the border of new and old membranes, suggesting that this wave might be involved in adhesion between two blastomeres...|$|R

25|$|If F is a fibred E-category, it {{is always}} possible, for each {{morphism}} f: T → S in E and each object y in FS, to choose (by using the axiom of choice) precisely one inverse image m: x → y. The class of morphisms thus selected is called a cleavage and the selected morphisms are called the transport morphisms (of the cleavage). A fibred category together with a cleavage is called a cleaved category. A cleavage is called normalised if the transport morphisms include all identities in F; {{this means that the}} inverse images of identity morphisms are chosen to be identity morphisms. Evidently if a cleavage exists, it can be chosen to be normalised; we shall consider only normalised <b>cleavages</b> below.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{confining}} {{his analysis}} of social relations and change to voluntaristic agency or strictly in terms of class as a structural relation, Bourdieu uses the agency-structure bridging concept of field: any historical, non-homogeneous social-spatial arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. Much of Bourdieu's work observes the semi-independent role of educational and cultural resources in the expression of agency. This makes his work amenable to liberal-conservative scholarship positing the fundamental <b>cleavages</b> of society as amongst disorderly factions of the working class, in need of disciplinary intervention where they have assumed excessive privilege. Unsurprisingly given his historical and biographical location, however, Bourdieu was in practice both influenced by and sympathetic to the Marxist identification of economic command as a principal component of power and agency within capitalist society, in contrast {{to some of his}} followers or the influential sociologist Max Weber.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company had {{overtaken}} Portugal as the dominant player in the spice and silk trade, and in 1652 founded a colony at the Cape of Good Hope on the southern African coast, as a victualing station for its ships on the route between Europe and Asia. Dutch immigration in the Cape rapidly swelled as prospective colonists were offered generous grants of land and tax exempt status in exchange for producing the food needed to resupply passing ships. The Cape authorities also imported a number of Europeans of other nationalities, namely Germans and French Huguenots, as well as thousands of slaves from the East Indies, to bolster the local Dutch workforce. Nevertheless, there was a degree of cultural assimilation between the various ethnic groups due to intermarriage and the universal adoption of the Dutch language, and <b>cleavages</b> were likelier to occur along social and racial lines.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTrochoblasts of the molluscPatella vulgatadifferentiate {{early in}} {{development}} into ciliated cells {{due to a}} cell intrinsic developmental capacity. The third <b>cleavage</b> appears to be decisive for their specification. Permanent inhibition of <b>cleavage</b> after the third <b>cleavage,</b> as induced by a continuous incubation with the drug Cytochalasin B, {{had no effect on}} trochoblast-specific gene expression later in development. However, permanent inhibition of <b>cleavage</b> before third <b>cleavage</b> abolished trochoblast differentiation including trochoblast-specific gene expression. Inhibition of just the third <b>cleavage</b> itself was sufficient to repress trochoblast-specific gene expression. In contrast, inhibiting the second or fourth <b>cleavage</b> did not effect trochoblast-specific gene expression. Correct formation of micromeres at the third <b>cleavage</b> is required to obtain trochoblast-specific gene expression as was shown in experiments in which the formation of micromeres during third <b>cleavage</b> was suppressed by pressure. In addition, centrifugation before or during the third <b>cleavage</b> disturbs trochoblast-specific gene expression, whereas centrifugation after the third <b>cleavage</b> does not affect trochoblast-specific gene expression. Thus, during the third <b>cleavage</b> a decisive step in the determination of developmental fate of trochoblasts takes place, likely resulting in a segregation of activating and inhibitory determinants. Trochoblast-specific markers inPatellawere only expressed in embryos that were division arrested after third <b>cleavage.</b> This suggests that a segregation of differentiation potentials has to take place before trochoblast differentiation markers are expressed. The restriction of differentiation potentials in the cleaving stage embryo is thus required to enable trochoblast-specific gene expression...|$|R

40|$|Although {{bivalves}} develop through spiral <b>cleavage</b> patterns, {{similar to}} other lophotrochozoans, the <b>cleavage</b> pattern of D lineage blastomeres is unique, since 2 d shows four rounds of stereotypic unequal <b>cleavage</b> before bilateral <b>cleavage</b> of the largest derivative of 2 d: 2 d 1121. This unique modification of spiral <b>cleavage</b> is directly associated with the characteristic morphology of bivalves, namely, bilaterally separated shell plates, because the bilateral shell plates {{are thought to be}} derived from the bilateral derivatives of 2 d 1121. In this report, to determine whether the unique <b>cleavage</b> pattern of bivalves is regulated depending on the interaction with other cells or by cell autonomous mechanisms, we performed cell isolation experiments and observed subsequent <b>cleavage</b> patterns of isolated blastomeres. When focusing on the largest derivatives of D blastomeres, 8 % of isolated D blastomeres followed the <b>cleavage</b> pattern of normal development up to bilateral <b>cleavage.</b> Importantly, the remainder of the partial embryos ended <b>cleavage</b> before that stage, and none of the isolated blastomeres showed abnormal <b>cleavage</b> patterns. We also examined the development of isolated blastomeres and found that isolated D blastomeres could develop shell plates, whereas larvae developed from AB blastomeres never had shell plates.
