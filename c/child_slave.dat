25|$|The 2010 {{documentary}} The Dark Side of Chocolate brought {{attention to}} purchases of cocoa beans from Ivorian plantations that use <b>child</b> <b>slave</b> labour. The children are usually 12 to 15 {{years old and}} some are trafficked from nearby countries. The first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998. In late 2000, a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children {{in the production of}} cocoa in West Africa. Other media followed by reporting widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. In September 2001, Bradley Alford, Chairman and CEO of Nestlé USA, signed the Harkin–Engel Protocol (commonly called the Cocoa Protocol), an international agreement aimed at ending child labour in the production of cocoa.|$|E
2500|$|In The Realms of the Unreal, Elsie is {{imagined}} as Annie Aronburg, {{the leader}} of the first <b>child</b> <b>slave</b> rebellion. [...] "The assassination of the child labor rebel Annie Aronburg... was the most shocking child murder ever caused by the Glandelinian Government" [...] and was the cause of the war. Through their sufferings, valiant deeds and exemplary holiness, the Vivian Girls are hoped {{to be able to help}} bring about a triumph of Christianity. Darger provided two endings to the story, one in which the Vivian Girls and Christianity are triumphant and another in which they are defeated and the godless Glandelinians reign.|$|E

2500|$|Henry Joseph Darger, Jr. ( [...] ; c. April 12, 1892 – April 13, 1973) was a reclusive American {{writer and}} artist {{who worked as}} a {{hospital}} custodian in Chicago, Illinois. He has become famous for his posthumously discovered 15,145-page, single-spaced fantasy manuscript called The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What Is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm, Caused by the <b>Child</b> <b>Slave</b> Rebellion, along with several hundred drawings and watercolor paintings illustrating the story. The visual subject matter of his work ranges from idyllic scenes in Edwardian interiors and tranquil flowered landscapes populated by children and fantastic creatures, to scenes of horrific terror and carnage depicting young children being tortured and massacred. Much of his artwork is mixed media with collage elements. Darger's artwork {{has become one of the}} most celebrated examples of outsider art.|$|E
2500|$|The {{large part}} of the book, The Story of the Vivian Girls, in What is Known as the Realms of the Unreal, of the Glandeco-Angelinian War Storm Caused by the <b>Child</b> <b>Slave</b> Rebellion, follows the adventures of the daughters of Robert Vivian, seven princesses of the Christian nation of Abbieannia who assist a daring {{rebellion}} against the child slavery imposed by John Manley and the Glandelinians. Children take up arms in their own defense and are often slain in battle or viciously tortured by the Glandelinian overlords. The elaborate mythology includes the setting of a large planet, around which Earth orbits as a moon (where most people are Christian and mostly Catholic), and a species called the [...] "Blengigomeneans" [...] (or Blengins for short), gigantic winged beings with curved horns who occasionally take human or part-human form, even disguising themselves as children. They are usually benevolent, but some Blengins are extremely suspicious of all humans, due to Glandelinian atrocities.|$|E
2500|$|Though Elsie's mysterious {{disappearance}} {{and death}} were once {{the subject of}} intense police investigation and journalistic focus, her story faded into obscurity until the death of Henry Darger in 1973. Michael Bonesteel, an art historian examining Darger's work, found repeated reference in Darger's Story of the Vivian Girls novel to Annie Aronburg, leader of a <b>child</b> <b>slave</b> rebellion, and to an inspirational picture of her that had been lost. Miss Aronburg had met a shocking yet heroic death {{at the hands of}} her captors. (The murder is described in detail, and is nothing like Elsie's death.) According to his diary, Darger really had lost a picture of a little girl and was desperate to get it back or replace it. He did not give the name but said it had appeared in the [...] "Chicago Daily Noise (sic), May, June, or July, 1911." [...] Bonesteel's search in the newspaper archives revealed Elsie Paroubek and her story. A portrait of Annie Aronburg by Darger shows a somewhat older blonde-haired girl. Her hair ribbon and the distinctive collar of her dress are similar to Elsie's in the photograph. In the novel, Darger describes children who are kidnapped and mistreated by adults, while the heroic little Vivians, Annie Aronburg and others form [...] "rescue squads" [...] to save them.|$|E

My wife has long desired to have a Christian slave, and as Allah has blessed my efforts it was but right that I should gratify her, though in truth I do not know what work I shall set him to do at present. Let him first have a bath, and see that he is clad decently, then let him have a good meal. I doubt if he has had one since he was captured. He has been sorely beaten by the corsair, and from no fault of his own, but only because he opposed the man's brutality to a <b>child</b> <b>slave.</b> If any of his wounds need ointment, see that he has it.
