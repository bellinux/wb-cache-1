In the Yoruba culture of Nigeria, millipedes {{are used in}} pregnancy and business rituals, and crushed millipedes are used to treat fever, whitlow, and <b>convulsion</b> in children. In Zambia, smashed millipede pulp is used to treat wounds, and the Bafia people of Cameroon use millipede juice to treat earache. In certain Himalayan Bhotiya tribes, dry millipede smoke is used to treat haemorrhoids. Native people in Malaysia use millipede secretions in poison-tipped arrows. The secretions of Spirobolus bungii have been observed to inhibit division of human cancer cells. The only recorded usage of millipedes as food by humans comes from the Bobo people of Burkina Faso, who consume boiled, dried millipedes in tomato sauce.|$|E

The MDA levels in the forebrain and cerebellum were lower after <b>convulsions,</b> but returned to the interictal period level 6 hours aftre <b>convulsions.</b> In the experimental status epileptics induced by ECS, the MDA levels in the brainstem and cerebellum were higher. The brainstem MDA level was also higher after daily maximal ECS for 8 days in ddY mice. The cerebellum MDA level was higher after ECS (10 mA), and the brainstem was lower after ECS (7 mA). In the case of pentylenetetrazol induced <b>convulsions,</b> the cerebellum MDA level was higher before <b>convulsions,</b> and the forebrain level was lower before, during and after <b>convulsions.</b> The brainstem level was also lower 30 min after <b>convulsions.</b> In addition, the cerebellum level was lower during <b>convulsions</b> induced by dibenzoylguanidine (DBG), and the brainstem level was lower after <b>convulsions</b> by DBG.

40|$|Evaluation of 446 {{infants and}} young {{children}} (6 months to 5 years olds) with malaria parasitaemia showed a significant relationship (Z 5 < 0. 05 -< 0. 001) (a) between coma and age, pattern of <b>convulsions,</b> haematocrit, and blood glucose, and (b) between the severity of parasitaemia and risk of <b>convulsions,</b> prevalence of hepatosplenomegaly, and severe anaemia.

25|$|When {{used in the}} {{systemic}} therapy, IFNs are mostly administered by an intramuscular injection. The injection of IFNs in the muscle or under the skin is generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse effects are flu-like symptoms: increased body temperature, feeling ill, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, <b>convulsion,</b> dizziness, hair thinning, and depression. Erythema, pain, and hardness on the spot of injection are also frequently observed. IFN therapy causes immunosuppression, in particular through neutropenia and can result in some infections manifesting in unusual ways.|$|E
25|$|ECT {{was invented}} in Italy in 1938.

Although soon established as especially useful {{in the treatment of}} depression, it was also used on people {{with a wide variety of}} mental disorders. There was large variation in the amount of ECT used between different hospitals. As well as being used therapeutically, ECT was used to control the behaviour of patients. Originally given in unmodified form (without anaesthetics and muscle relaxants) hospitals gradually switched to using modified ECT, a process that was accelerated by a famous legal case.|$|E

25|$|After a great {{political}} <b>convulsion</b> {{such as the}} Norman conquest, and the following wholesale confiscation of landed estates, William needed to reassert that {{the rights of the}} Crown, which he claimed to have inherited, had not suffered in the process.

The successful trial of Odo de Bayeux at Penenden Heath less than a decade after the conquest was one example of the Crown's growing discontent at the Norman land-grab of the years following the invasion. Historians believe the survey was to aid William in establishing certainty and a definitive reference point as to property holdings across the nation, in case such evidence was needed in disputes over Crown ownership.|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} psychiatric practice, ECT is used {{mainly in}} the treatment of depression. It is occasionally used {{in the treatment of}} other disorders such as schizophrenia. When undergoing modern ECT, a patient is given an anaesthetic and a muscle relaxant. A brief-pulse electric current of about 800 milliamperes is passed between two electrodes on the head for several seconds, causing a seizure. The resulting <b>convulsion</b> is modified by the muscle relaxant. ECT is usually given on an inpatient basis; about one in five treatments are given on an outpatient basis. Treatment is usually given twice a week (occasionally three times a week) for a total of 6–12 treatments, although courses may be longer or shorter. About 70 per cent of ECT patients are women. About 1,500 ECT patients a year in the UK are treated without their consent under the Mental Health Acts or the provisions of common law.|$|E
25|$|ECT {{soon became}} {{more popular than}} cardiazol <b>convulsion</b> therapy in mental {{hospitals}} in the UK. It was quickly identified as being especially useful {{in the treatment of}} affective psychosis. The therapeutic value of ECT in schizophrenia was recognised as limited, but some psychiatrists saw it as useful to control the behaviour of institutionalised patients who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Some psychiatrists thought that ECT should be restricted to the treatment of depression; others used it in the treatment {{of a wide variety of}} disorders, for example, schizophrenia, epilepsy, neurosis, and hysteria. It was also used on people who had suffered war trauma. By the mid 1950s there was a 20 fold difference in the rate of ECT use in mental hospitals in the UK, and a similar difference in its rate of use in teaching hospitals. In the 1940s and 1950s ECT machines used sine-wave current and patients were given a shock lasting a fraction of a second.|$|E

25|$|John Knox (1505–1572), a Scot who {{had spent}} time {{studying}} under Calvin in Geneva, returned to Scotland and urged his countrymen to reform the Church in line with Calvinist doctrines. After a period of religious <b>convulsion</b> and political conflict culminating in {{a victory for the}} Protestant party at the Siege of Leith the authority of the Catholic Church was abolished in favour of Reformation by the legislation of the Scottish Reformation Parliament in 1560. The Church was eventually organised by Andrew Melville along Presbyterian lines to become the national Church of Scotland. King James VI and I moved the Church of Scotland towards an episcopal form of government, and in 1637, James' successor, Charles I and William Laud, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to force the Church of Scotland to use the Book of Common Prayer. What resulted was an armed insurrection, with many Scots signing the Solemn League and Covenant. The Covenanters would serve as the government of Scotland for nearly a decade, and would also send military support to the Parliamentarians during the English Civil War. Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II, despite the initial support that he received from the Covenanters, reinstated an episcopal form of government on the church.|$|E
