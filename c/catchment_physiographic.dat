40|$|The general {{structure}} of a new methodology, named IDRAIM (sistema IDRomorfologico di valutazione, AnalisI e Monitoraggio dei corsi d’acqua), aimed at a hydromorphological assessment and analysis of streams is presented. In particular, a stream Morphological Quality Index (MQI) developed for the hydromorphological classifi cation required by the European Water Framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (WFD) is illustrated. The methodological approach is based on integration of fi eld surveys with remote sensing and GIS analyses. The complete procedure is composed by three parts: initial setting and classifi cation; evaluation of the present morphological state and monitoring. The initial classifi cation is mainly based on <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> conditions, channel confi nement and morphology. The evaluation of present morphological conditions is carried out by using a series of forms allowing a guided analysis of the following aspects: (a) longitudinal and lateral continuity; (b) channel pattern; (c) crosssectional confi guration; (d) bed structure and substrate; and (e) vegetation in the riparian corridor. The analysis is carried out {{with reference to the}} foregoing fi ve aspects by three components: (1) geomorphic functionality; (2) artifi ciality; (3) channel changes. A scoring system is used to obtain a Morphological Alteration Index (MAI) and a Morphological Quality Index (MQI). It is proposed that the two indices will allow to classify the morphological conditions of a stream. The monitoring phase should then allow for a future assessment of possible variations of the present morphological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Drought {{forecasting}} {{plays an}} important role in the planning and management of water resources. Drought Indices based on meteorology (rainfall) are the most popular tool for monitoring, assessing and predicting drought events. Standardized Hydrological Drought Index (SHDI) is a recently developed index with a greater potential to use in water management due to simplicity and applicability across time and spatial scales. The aim of this study is to assess the hydrological drought defined by SHDI, at 8 hydro-meteorological stations in Northern Victoria of Australia over the period 1970 - 2010. The popular meteorological drought index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) which is similar to SHDI is used as the reference drought index. SPI and SHDI values were calculated at 3 month and 12 month time steps. The study showed that all sub-catchments experienced moderate, severe or extreme drought events in 1971 - 73, 1976 - 77, 1982 - 83, 1994 - 95, 1996 - 97, 2001 - 03 and 2006 - 08 periods based on both indices. SHDI showed a delay in drought onset and termination compared to SPI during the major drought events. Severity of the hydrological drought is higher than that of the meteorological drought when the drought condition is prolonged as in the Millennium drought (2001 - 09). The greatest drought intensity was recorded during the 1982 - 83 drought events in all stations. Hydrological processes such as runoff, infiltration and evapotranspiration which depend on <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> characteristics define the relationship between the meteorological drought and the hydrological drought...|$|E

Sampling locations that best represent <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> variables are identified with the Expectation Maximization algorithm for a Gaussian mixture model. A Gaussian process is then used to model the snow depth in a 1 km 2 area surrounding the network, and additional sensors are placed to minimize the model uncertainty. The aim {{of the study is}} to determine the distribution of sensors that minimizes the bias and RMSE of the model. We compare the accuracy of the snow-depth model using the proposed placements to an existing sensor network at the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory. Each model is validated with a 1 m 2 LiDAR-derived snow-depth raster from 14 March 2010. The proposed algorithm exhibits higher accuracy with fewer sensors (8 sensors, RMSE 38. 3 cm, bias 53. 49 cm) than the existing network (23 sensors, RMSE 53. 0 cm, bias 515. 5 cm) and randomized placements (8 sensors, RMSE 63. 7 cm, bias 524. 7 cm). We then {{evaluate the}} spatial and temporal transferability of the method using 14 LiDAR scenes from two catchments within the JPL Airborne Snow Observatory. In each region, the optimized sensor placements are determined using the first available snow raster for the year. The accuracy in the remaining LiDAR surveys is then compared to 100 configurations of sensors selected at random. We find the error statistics (bias and RMSE) to be more consistent across the additional surveys than the average random configuration...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of rainfall-runoff {{in an urban}} area is essential for flood disaster prevention and control. A Storm Water Management Model was therefore applied to four small urban catchments in Damsgård, Bergen, Norway. In an effort to extend the modelling works to the ungauged parts of Damsgård, a technique that integrates a regionalisation concept into model calibration was tested. The SWMM parameters were calibrated along regionalisation-parameters that establish certain mathematical relationships (transfer functions) between selected SWMM parameters and catchment characteristics. The Shuffle Complex Evolution algorithm was integrated into the calibration of the model to estimate {{the parameters of the}} model, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency criterion as an objective performance measure. The calibrated model predicted the observed outputs with reasonable accuracy. Hence, the parameters derived from the transfer functions could be further used to test the applicability of the proposed methodology. A pattern between the <b>catchments</b> <b>physiographic</b> characteristics and the parameter sets of the transfer functions was observed. The two characteristics identified to affect the transferability the most were the number of residents, and the length to outlet.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the joint}} {{research}} project “Development {{of an integrated}} methodology for the sustainable management of river basins – The Saale River Basin example”, coordinated by the Centre of Environmental Research (UFZ), concepts and tools for an integrated management of large river basins are developed and applied for the Saale river basin. The ultimate objective of the project is {{to contribute to the}} holistic assessment and benchmarking approaches in water resource planning, as required by the European Water Framework Directive. The study presented here deals (1) with the development of a river basin information and modelling system, (2) with the refinement of a regionalisation approach adapted for integrated basin modelling. The approach combines a user friendly basin disaggregation method preserving the <b>catchment’s</b> <b>physiographic</b> heterogeneity with a process oriented hydrological basin assessment for scale bridging integrated modelling. The well tested regional distribution concept of Response Units (RUs) will be enhanced by landscape metrics and decision support tools for objective, scale independent and problem oriented RU delineation to provide the spatial modelling entities for process oriented and distributed simulation of vertical and lateral hydrological transport processes. On basis of this RUs suitable hydrological modelling approaches will be further developed with strong respect to a more detailed simulation of the lateral surface and subsurface flows as well as the channe...|$|R
40|$|A water catchment's hydrologic {{response}} is intimately linked to its morphological shape, {{which is a}} signature on {{the landscape of the}} particular climate conditions that generated the hydrographic basin over time. Furthermore, geomorphologic structures influence hydrologic regimes and land cover (vegetation). For these reasons, a basin's characterization is a fundamental element in hydrological studies. Physiographic descriptors have been extracted manually for long time, but currently Geographic Information System (GIS) tools ease such task by offering a powerful instrument for hydrologists to save time and improve accuracy of result. Here we present a program combining the flexibility of the Python programming language with the reliability of GRASS GIS, which automatically performing the <b>catchment's</b> <b>physiographic</b> characterization. GRASS (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) is a Free and Open Source GIS, that today can look back on 30 years of successful development in geospatial data management and analysis, image processing, graphics and maps production, spatial modeling and visualization. The recent development of new hydrologic tools, coupled with the tremendous boost in the existing flow routing algorithms, reduced the computational time and made GRASS a complete toolset for hydrological analysis even for large datasets. The tool presented here is a module called r. basin, based on GRASS' traditional nomenclature, where the "r" stands for "raster", and it is available for GRASS version 6. x and more recently for GRASS 7. As input it uses a Digital Elevation Model and the coordinates of the outlet, and, powered by the recently developed r. stream. * hydrological tools, it performs the flow calculation, delimits the basin's boundaries and extracts the drainage network, returning the flow direction and accumulation, the distance to outlet and the hill slopes length maps. Based on those maps, it calculates hydrologically meaningful shape factors and morphological parameters such as topological diameter, drainage density, Horton's ratios, concentration time, and many more, beside producing statistics on main channel and elevation and geometric features such as centroid's coordinates, rectangle containing the basin, etc. Exploiting Python libraries, such as Numpy and Matplotlib, it produces graphics like the hypsographic and hypsometric curve and the Width Function. The results are exported as a spreadsheet in CSV format and graphics as pngs. The advantages offered by the implementation in Python and GRASS are manifold. Python is a powerful scripting language with huge potential for researchers due to its relative simplicity, high flexibility and thanks to a broad availability of scientific libraries. GRASS, and as a consequence, r. basin, is platform independent, so that it is available for GNU/Linux, MS Windows, Mac, etc. Furthermore, the module is constantly maintained and improved according to users' feedback with the precious help of expert developers. The code is available for review under the official GRASS add-ons repository, allowing hydrologists and researchers to knowingly use, inspect, modify, reuse, and even incorporate it in other projects, such as web services.

40|$|In recent decades, the Brazilian Cerrado biome {{has been}} {{affected}} by intense land-use change, particularly the conversion of natural forest to agricultural land. Understanding {{the environmental impacts of}} this land-use change on landscape hydrological dynamics {{is one of the main}} challenges in the Amazon agricultural frontier, where part of the Brazilian Cerrado biome is located and where most of the deforestation has occurred. This study uses empirical data from field measurements to characterize controls on hydrological processes from three first-order micro-catchments 2 in the Cerrado biome. These micro-catchments were selected on the basis of predominant land use including native cerrado vegetation, pasture grass with cattle ranching, and cash crop land. We continuously monitored precipitation, streamflow, soil moisture, and meteorological variables from October 2012 to September 2014. Additionally, we determined the physical and hydraulic properties of the soils, and conducted topographic surveys. We used these data to quantify the water balance components of the study catchments and to relate these water fluxes to land use, <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> parameters, and soil hydrophysical properties. The results of this study show that runoff coefficients were 0. 27, 0. 40, and 0. 16 for the cerrado, pasture, and cropland catchments, respectively. Baseflow is shown to play a significant role in streamflow generation in the three study catchments, with baseflow index values of more than 0. 95. The results also show that evapotranspiration was highest in the cerrado (986 mm yr − 1) compared to the cropland (828 mm yr − 1) and the pasture (532 mm yr − 1). However, discharges in the cropland catchment were unexpectedly lower than that of the cerrado catchment. The normalized discharge was 55 % higher and 57 % lower in the pasture and cropland catchments, respectively, compared with the cerrado catchment. We attribute this finding to the differences in soil type and topographic characteristics, and low-till farming techniques in the cropland catchment, additionally to the buffering effect of the gallery forests in these catchments. Although the results of this study provide a useful assessment of catchment rainfall–runoff controls in the Brazilian Cerrado landscape, further research is required to include quantification of the influence of the gallery forests on both hydrological and hydrochemical fluxes, which are important for watershed management and ecosystem services provisioning...|$|E

In recognition of the disadvantages of using either of these modeling approaches, namely, detailed data requirements {{in the case of}} distributed modeling, and lack of physical basis of conceptual/lumped model parameters, Reggiani et al. (1998, 1999) derived, from first principles and in a general manner, the balance equations for mass, momentum and energy at what they called the Representative Elementary Watershed (or REW) scale. However, the mass balance equations of the REW approach include mass exchange flux terms which must be defined externally before their application to real catchments. Developing physically reasonable "closure relations'' for these mass exchange flux terms is a crucial pre-requisite for the success of the REW approach. As a guidance to the development of closure relations expressing mass exchange fluxes as functions of relevant state variables in a physically reasonable way, and in the process effectively parameterizing the effects of sub-grid or sub-REW heterogeneity of <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> properties on these mass exchange fluxes, this paper considers four different approaches, namely the field experimental approach, a theoretical/analytical approach, a numerical approach, and a hybrid approach combining {{one or more of the}} above. Based on the concept of the scaleway (Vogel and Roth, 2003) and the disaggregation-aggregation approach (Viney and Sivapalan, 2004), and using the data set from Weiherbach catchment in Germany, closure relations for infiltration, exfiltration and groundwater recharge were derived analytically, or on theoretical grounds, while numerical experiments with a detailed fine-scale, distributed model, CATFLOW, were used to obtain the closure relationship for seepage outflow. The detailed model, CATFLOW, was also used to derive REW scale pressure-saturation (i. e., water retention curve) and hydraulic conductivity-saturation relationships for the unsaturated zone. Closure relations for concentrated overland flow and saturated overland flow were derived using both theoretical arguments and simpler process models. In addition to these, to complete the specification of the REW scale balance equations, a relationship for the saturated area fraction as a function of saturated zone depth was derived for an assumed topography on the basis of TOPMODEL assumptions. These relationships were used to complete the specification of all of the REW-scale governing equations (mass and momentum balance equations, closure and geometric relations) for the Weiherbach catchment, which are then employed for constructing a numerical watershed model, named the C ooperative C ommunity C atchment model based on the R epresentative E lementary W atershed approach (CREW). CREW is then used to carry out sensitivity analyses with respect to various combinations of climate, soil, vegetation and topographies, in order to test the reasonableness of the derived closure relations in the context of the complete catchment response, including interacting processes. These sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the adopted closure relations do indeed produce mostly reasonable results, and can therefore be a good basis for more careful and rigorous search for appropriate closure relations in the future. Three tests are designed to assess CREW as a large scale model for Weiherbach catchment. The first test compares CREW with distributed model CATFLOW by looking at predicted soil moisture dynamics for artificially designed initial and boundary conditions. The second test is designed to see the applicabilities of the parameter values extracted from the upscaling procedures in terms of their ability to reproduce observed hydrographs within the CREW modeling framework. The final test compares simulated soil moisture time series predicted by CREW with observed ones as a way of validating the predictions of CREW.

The prediction of the hydrological effects of land use change is a major challenge in contemporary hydrological model applications.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScPrevious {{studies have}} shown that the use of {{chloride}} mass balance (CMB) method is a suitable and practical approach to estimate groundwater recharge. This enables the prediction of groundwater availability to inform practical strategies for managing groundwater resources. However, such studies have largely applied the chloride mass balance method on national and catchment scales with limited focus on quaternary catchment level (QCL). Neglecting the chloride mass balance method at quaternary catchment level limits practical management and utilization of water resources at quaternary catchment level. The goal of the current study was to prove that 1) the chloride mass balance method should be applied at quaternary catchment level to ensure practical assessment of groundwater availability and that 2) chloride mass balance assessment should be accompanied with supplementary methods for its application in quaternary <b>catchments</b> of similar <b>physiographic</b> and hydrogeologic conditions. To achieve these goals, the present study assessed the application of chloride mass balance method on a pilot scale used alongside rainwater infiltration breakthrough (RIB) and water table fluctuation (WTF) methods to estimate the groundwater recharge as an indicator of groundwater availability. The pilot area (PA) was in the upper Berg River catchment in Western Cape in South Africa. Chloride concentrations were determined in groundwater samples collected from boreholes and rain water in rain gauges in the pilot area. Rainfall and borehole water levels in the pilot area were used in water table fluctuation and rainwater infiltration breakthrough analyses. As quality assurance, the specific yield data obtained from the pumping test were compared to those determined with the linear regression model. This established the reliability of the analysis i. e. the relationship between groundwater level and rainfall. Mean groundwater recharge values calculated using the chloride mass balance, rainwater infiltration breakthrough and water table fluctuation methods were 27. 6 %, 23. 67 %, and 22. 7 % of the total precipitation received in the catchment, respectively. These results indicate that the use of these three methods have potential to estimate groundwater recharge at quaternary level which is the basic unit of water management in South Africa. These findings agree with previous studies conducted in the same catchment that indicate that mean groundwater recharge ranges between 18. 6 % and 28 % of the total precipitation. In the future, these methods could be tested in <b>catchments</b> which have <b>physiographic</b> and hydrogeologic conditions similar to those of the current pilot area. African Union (AU...|$|R
40|$|In the UK, {{perceived}} increases ih {{high impact}} flood events {{over the last}} decade and broad scale recognition of the enhanced flood risks associated with future climate change predictions, have reinforced the need for improved understanding and management of processes governing peak flow responses. This thesis investigates the effects of agricultural land uses on the hydrology of rural areas at a range of spatial and temporal scales. At the catchment scale, 48 catchments and subcatchments distributed across the south western counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Dorset were investigated. A suite of multivariate statistical techniques, including Direct (Redundancy Analysis) and Indirect (Principal Components Analysis) Ordination were used to explore catchment responses to four major storm events, selected from the wet autumn/winter of 2000 - 2001. A Geographic Information System. (GIS) incorporating the Hydrology of Soil Types (HOST) soil classification system and Land Cover Map 2000 satellite imagery data was developed to parameterise <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> variables and calculate the extent of 27 land use classes. Analysis of regional trends in erivironmental variables and two multivariate runoff datasets (R 1 and R 2) identified land use as the principal control of streamflow responses to extreme storm events. Land use, soil and geology parameters together explained 84 % (R 1) and 78 % (R 2) of the Variance in runoff for the same four storms. Grassland and improved grassland were consistent characteristics of catchments generating higher runoff volumes per unit area. Similarities in the hydrological behaviours of the Camel catchment and the De Lank subcatchment supported a dominant control on peak flows by runoff from grazed upland areas. A longer-term study of the River Camel catchment (1965 - 2000) revealed a 20 % increase in the magnitude of the one in 25 year flow. Daily rainfall totals aggregated at monthly, seasonal and annual timescales and agricultural census data for the years 1969, 1979, 1988, 1997 and 2000 were examined to determine the influence of climate and land use changes on the enhanced streamflow response. Increases in the frequency and magnitude of peak flows were attributed to the cumulative impacts of a subtle, long-term rise in October rainfall totals, coupled with local urban development, the expansion of arable cultivation on highly connected slopes in the lower catchment and a rise in the intensity of grazing in the upper catchment At the field scale, characterisation of the textural, structural and ^hydraulic properties of soils subject to different land managements, including continuous cereal cultivation (CC), semi permanent pasture (SPP), permanent pasture (PP) and farm woodland (FW), identified a link between land use 'and the structural stability of the surface horizon. Marked differences in the percentage of water stable aggregates (WSA> 2. 8 mm) between the topsoils of FW (66 %) and. PP (71 %), SPP (11 %) and CC (6 %) helped to explain differences in saturated hydraulic conductivity that were in the order FW>PP>SPP>CC, Laboratory rainfall simulations revealed slower wetting rates and higher average soil moisture percentages at near-saturation in FW and PP soil plots compared to SPP and CC soil plots that resulted from higher total porosities under FW and PP. Agricultural management systems are therefore capable of playing an important role in attenuating peak flow responses to storm events through considered land management which ameliorates or prevents soil structural deterioration and encourages the movement of water into storages within the hillslope. The adoption of specific measures, such as the introduction of buffer strips, widening of hedgerows or the introduction of forested areas to act as sinks, may serve to disconnect hydrofogical pathways from the main channel by providing a barrier to runoff, thereby reducing the upslope contributing area.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{estimation}} of low flows for Irish River catchments, particularly for ungauged catchments and on the estimation of flood flows {{in the context of}} changing climatic conditions, which is believed may be causing non-stationarity in the streamflow time series. The main objectives of the study were to develop a methodology to estimate low-flows for ungauged river catchments in Ireland, to investigate any evidence of the presence of trends in the Annual Maximum Flood (AMF) records and to investigate the effects of trends / non-stationarity on the design floods (on both growth curve and at-site quantiles) estimated from the conventional statistical frequency analysis techniques applied on a regional scale level. The study was carried out in two parts: (i) Part A deals with low-flows estimates, while (ii) Part B deals with the flood flow estimates in the presence of trends. In the low-flow studies for Ireland, it was found that a regression-based 1 -parameter logarithmic type model provides a good approximation to the lower three-quarter part of the Period-of-Record (POR) daily Flow Duration Curves (FDC) at most of the 125 gauging sites in Ireland. Given the complex shape of the observed FDCs and the higher variability in the high-flow sections of the FDCs, this {{study focused on}} modelling of only the lower three-quarter section of FDC (25 %ile to 99. 99 %ile). The parameter of the proposed model has been estimated from the easily measurable/obtainable <b>catchment</b> <b>physiographic</b> and climatological characteristics, such as catchment areas (AREA), mean annual rainfall (SAAR) and mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PE). A sensitivity analysis on the mean daily flow records for 10 Irish River catchments showed that at least 15 to 20 years of observed streamflow records are required to obtain a reliable long-term POR equivalent estimate of the FDCs and associated low-flow indices. The study also showed that the Q 95 flow estimate from 10 years of records at a site in the study region could deviate (under- or over-estimation) by approximately 20 % from the equivalent long-term estimate. In the search for any evidence of the presence of non-stationarity in Irish AMF records, a number of parametric and non-parametric tests were employed. The results showed that the Irish AMF series are in general dominated by positive serialcorrelations. Non-randomness properties were identified at 5 % significance level in 17 % of the sites, while 30 % of sites showed step change in mean (mostly increase) during the post 1976 period. The trend test results identified considerably more trends in Irish AMF records than that would be expected to occur by chance. Significant trends were found at 30 % of sites at 5 % significance level, with increasing trends at 23 % of sites. Some temporal variations in the trend test results are also apparent in the Irish AMF records. The Annual Maximum Rainfall (AMR) records of Ireland (1955 - 2008) also showed significant increasing trends, with longer rainfall durations showing greater tendency of trends. Some evidence of spatial patterns in trends in AMF and AMR series was detected by a mapping exercise which might indicate that the climate change may be responsible for AMF trends. The findings of the simulation experiments carried out to identify the power of different trend identification tests (Mann-Kendall, SpearmanÂ¿s Rho and Standardised Linear Regression tests) showed that, in general, the power of a trend test is an increasing function of the trend slope and sample size, i. e. power increases with the increase in trend slope and sample size. This is true in all three tests. The simulation results also showed that the sample variance plays a very important role in detecting whether trend exists or not in the records. The effects of trends on the regional growth curves and at-site quantiles were investigated through Monte Carlo Simulation techniques and in accordance with the Hosking and Wallis (1997) proposed L-moment algorithm procedures. Two different forms of trends were applied, one additive and the other hybrid, referred to as TF- 1 and TF- 2 respectively, in three different spatial patterns in the region / pooling group. The simulation results show that any trend causes changes in the population parameters, depending on the form and magnitude of trend and type of population distribution. TF- 1 generally causes a flattening of growth curves, while TF- 2 has the opposite effect. These changes can be as large as 16 % at T= 100 and trend slope of 1 %. Trend effect on quantiles is generally positive, largely caused by an increase in the index flood, with increases up to 17 % at T= 100 and 1 % trend slope. Some unrealistic results emerged in the GEV-GEV simulation case where large return period floods showed a decrease caused by the estimated GEV k value being (unexpectedly) positive when estimated from the data containing trends...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} similarity often used in the regionalisation studies of hydrological models. We compare two different visions of similarity: the apparent similarity defined {{on the basis of}} observable catchment properties; and behavioural similarity judged through the use of hydrological models. These two visions are generally assumed to be merged in regionalisation studies: catchments having apparently similar physical characteristics are assumed to have a similar hydrological behaviour. In this paper, we wished to test the validity of this assumption. To this aim, we defined behavioural (hydrological) similarity on the basis of model parameter transferability. Then pools of hydrologically similar catchments are compared to pools of apparently physically similar catchments, as identified on the basis of <b>physiographic</b> <b>catchment</b> descriptors. The overlap between the two pools of similar catchments is analysed, making it possible to judge the efficiency of the physical similarity measure to identify hydrologically similar catchments in an ungauged context. The results show that the overlap between the two pools is significant for only 60 % of the catchments. For the other catchments, two major reasons were identified as contributing to the lack of overlap: (1) these catchments often have a quite specific hydrological behaviour; (2) the role of the underground properties of the catchment on its hydrological behaviour was not found to be accurately described by the available physical descriptors, meaning that more relevant catchment descriptors should be sought to better describe the geological and lithological context in hydrological terms...|$|R

However, many open questions prevail as to aerial diatom reservoir size, depletion and recovery, as well as to their mobilisation and transport processes. Moreover, aerial diatoms remain poorly known compared to freshwater species and new species are still being discovered. Here, we ask whether aerial diatom flushing can be observed in three <b>catchments</b> with contrasting <b>physiographic</b> characteristics in Luxembourg, Oregon (USA) and Slovakia. This is a prerequisite for qualifying aerial diatoms as a robust indicator of the onset/cessation of rapid water flowpaths across a wider range of physiographical contexts. One species in particular, (Hantzschia amphioxys (Ehr.) Grunow), was found to be common to the three investigated catchments. Aerial diatom species were flushed, in different relative proportions, to the river network during rainfall-runoff events in all three catchments. Our take-away message from this preliminary examination is that aerial diatoms appear to have a potential for tracing episodic hydrological connectivity through a wider range of physiographic contexts and therefore serve as a complementary tool to conventional hydrological tracers...|$|R
40|$|Impacts of {{a drought}} are {{generally}} {{dependent on the}} severity of the hydrological drought event, which can be expressed by streamflow drought duration or deficit volume. For prediction and the selection of drought sensitive regions, it is crucial to know how streamflow drought severity relates to climate and catchment characteristics. In this study we investigated controls on drought severity based on a comprehensive Austrian dataset consisting of 44 catchments with long time series of hydrometeorological data (on average around 50. year) and information on a large number of <b>physiographic</b> <b>catchment</b> characteristics. Drought analysis was performed with the variable threshold level method and various statistical tools were applied, i. e. bivariate correlation analysis, heatmaps, linear models based on multiple regression, varying slope models, and automatic stepwise regression. Results indicate that streamflow drought duration is primarily controlled by storage, quantified by the Base Flow Index or by a combination of catchment characteristics related to catchment storage and release, e. g. geology and land use. Additionally, the duration of dry spells in precipitation is important for streamflow drought duration. Hydrological drought deficit, however, is governed by average catchment wetness (represented by mean annual precipitation) and elevation (reflecting seasonal storage in the snow pack and glaciers). Our conclusion is that both drought duration and deficit are governed by a combination of climate and catchment control, but not in a similar way. Besides meteorological forcing, storage is important; storage in soils, aquifers, lakes, etc. influences drought duration and seasonal storage in snow and glaciers influences drought deficit. Consequently, the spatial variation of hydrological drought severity is highly dependent on terrestrial hydrological processes. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Flow Duration Curve (FDC) is a {{classical}} method used to graphically represent {{the relationship between}} the frequency and magnitude of streamflow. In this sense it represents a compact signature of temporal runoff variability that {{can also be used to}} diagnose catchment rainfall-runoff responses, including similarity and differences between catchments. This paper is aimed at extracting regional patterns of the FDCs from observed daily flow data and elucidating the physical controls underlying these patterns, as a way to aid towards their regionalization and predictions in ungauged basins. The FDCs of total runoff (TFDC) using multi-decadal streamflow records for 197 catchments across the continental United States are separated into the FDCs of two runoff components, i. e., fast flow (FFDC) and slow flow (SFDC). In order to compactly display these regional patterns the 3 -parameter mixed gamma distribution is employed to characterize the shapes of the normalized FDCs (i. e., TFDC, FFDC and SFDC) over the entire data record. This is repeated to also characterize the between-year variability of "annual" FDCs for 8 representative catchments chosen across a climate gradient. Results show that the mixed gamma distribution can adequately capture the shapes of the FDCs and their variation between catchments and also between years. Comparison between the between-catchment and between-year variability of the FDCs revealed significant space-time symmetry. Possible relationships between the parameters of the fitted mixed gamma distribution and <b>catchment</b> climatic and <b>physiographic</b> characteristics are explored in order to decipher and point to the underlying physical controls. The baseflow index (a surrogate for the collective impact of geology, soils, topology and vegetation, as well as climate) is found to be the dominant control on the shapes of the normalized TFDC and SFDC, whereas the product of maximum daily precipitation and the fraction of non-rainy days was found to control the shape of the FFDC. These relationships, arising from the separation of total runoff into its two components, provide a potential physical basis for regionalization of FDCs, as well as providing a conceptual framework for developing deeper process-based understanding of the FDCs...|$|R
40|$|Streamflow data is a {{prerequisite}} for planning and management of water resources. However, in many cases, observed streamflow data are not available or the records are too short or of insufficient quality. This undermines the informed planning and management of water resources at a specific site and {{as well as at the}} river basin scale. The study examines the possibility of simulating time series of streamflows for ungauged catchments based on hydrological similarity, using the mountainous, semiarid Karkheh river basin (55, 000 km 2, Iran) as an example. The main research question examined in this paper is whether or not the parameters of a hydrological model applied to gauged catchments can be successfully transferred for simulating streamflows in hydrologically similar ungauged catchments. In this study, the HBV model is applied to simulate daily streamflow with parameters transferred from gauged basin counterparts. Different similarity measures were reviewed and finally the approach based on the shape of the flow duration curve (FDC) was used. FDCs are frequently used for comparing the response of gauged catchments and for estimating hydrological indices for ungauged catchments, but their potential use for the regionalization of conceptual rainfall runoff models to ungauged catchments needs to be explored and is a subject of this paper. FDCs for ungauged basins are defined using developed regional regression relationships between the parameters of a logarithmic FDC model and <b>physiographic</b> <b>catchment</b> characteristics of eleven gauged catchments. The results suggest that the proposed method could be successfully applied for the estimation of ungauged streamflows in the mountainous parts of the Karkheh river basin. Then the estimated ungauged streamflows were used as an input to conduct water balance analysis of main river reaches of Karkheh river system. The utility of this information is demonstrated in closing the water balance, scenario analysis for surface water allocation and identification of river reaches where further hydrological investigations are crucial...|$|R
40|$|The high {{topography}} of southern Africa has {{been attributed to}} a variety of uplift mechanisms. Some suggest southern Africa is supported by recent and ongoing mantle-driven dynamic topography, while others suggest it has been high since at least the Cretaceous. These competing hypotheses can be simplified into three models: 1) recent, rapid uplift of up to ∼ 200 m/My since the Pliocene; 2) slow, ongoing uplift of 3 ̆c 10 m/My; and 3) no Neogene or Quaternary uplift. It has remained difficult to evaluate these models because rates of uplift are poorly constrained and because it is difficult to separate mantle-driven uplift from isostatic rock uplift. ^ To resolve the uplift rate and mechanism, I determined 1) rock uplift from river incision rates and a displaced marine terrace; and 2) modern erosion rates and paleo-erosion rates. River incision rates and paleo-erosion rates were calculated from a flight of strath terraces along the lower Sundays River Valley, located on the southeastern coast of South Africa. I dated the river terraces and the marine terrace with cosmogenic 26 Al and 10 Be measured in quartz sediment, using an isochron burial dating method and standard burial dating methods. The river terraces range in age from ∼ 0. 3 - 4 Ma and vary in tread height from ∼ 6 - 88 m above the present river level, providing an excellent opportunity to evaluate river incision and rock uplift rates over million-year timescales. Dividing the terrace heights by the ages yields a long-term incision rate of 16. 9 ± 1. 2 m/My for the Sundays River. The marine terrace near Durban yields an age of 4. 26 ± 0. 68 Ma. Assuming a sea level highstand of 25 ± 5 m above present sea level at the time of terrace formation yields a rock uplift rate of 10 ± 3 m/My. ^ To estimate the component of uplift attributable to isostasy, I measured modern erosion rates using 10 Be in quartz for <b>catchments</b> representing various <b>physiographic</b> regions: the coastal plain, the escarpment piedmont, the Great Escarpment, the Lesotho Highlands, the inner piedmont, and the interior plateau. Along the coastal plain, erosion rates vary from ∼ 9 - 22 m/My. The escarpment piedmont is eroding at ∼ 12 - 37 m/My, while the Great Escarpment is eroding at ∼ 86 m/My, and the summit of the escarpment is eroding at ∼ 24 m/My. Erosion rates in the Lesotho Highlands are 40 /My, and the interior of South Africa is eroding the slowest at ∼ 5 m/My. The average paleo-erosion rate for the Sundays River is ∼ 6 m/My. ^ These erosion rates can be incorporated into a simple flexural model of the crust to calculate isostatic rebound due to erosional unloading. The model shows an isostatic rebound rate of 9 ± 4. 5 m/My at the Sundays River for a uniform elastic thickness (Te) of either 60 or 80 km. At Durban, isostatic rebound is 8 ± 4 m/My (Te= 60 km) and 9 ± 4. 5 m/My (Te= 80 km). Subtracting the isostatic component from rock uplift rates yields tectonic uplift rate estimates of up to 8 ± 5 m/My at the Sundays River, and 2 ± 5 m/My (Te= 60 km) and 1 ± 5 m/My (Te= 80 km) m/My near Durban. These results are inconsistent with recent and rapid uplift during the past several million years, although they do not preclude ongoing slow, mantle driven uplift, or no uplift and subsidence at Durban. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{becoming}} increasingly clear that human‐induced climate change will impact on almost all facets of the hydrological cycle. Modelling and observational studies are finding evidence of change at the planetary scale, including large increases in atmospheric water vapour; changes to various circulation patterns resulting in shifts in the spatial distribution of precipitation; {{an increase in the}} frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events; an increase in evaporation and changes to soil moisture; and the melting of snow and ice and an increase in ocean heat content which both are causing mean sea levels to rise [see detailed review in Bates et al., 2008]. At least in terms of the global scale, such changes support the expectation of an increase in flood risk. Despite this evidence there is considerable uncertainty about: (1) the absolute magnitude of change to key flood‐producing variables such as extreme rainfall; (2) the much more significant changes of continental and regional‐scale hydroclimatology which are masked by global averages and which may not be as well simulated by general circulation models; and (3) the role of <b>physiographic</b> <b>catchment</b> characteristics in decreasing or augmenting flood risk at the local scale. Thus, while it is now widely accepted that stationarity – the assumption that the future climate will mirror the past climate – may no longer be regarded as the ‘central, default assumption in water‐resource risk assessment and planning’ [Milly et al., 2008], the identification of an alternative framework for flood estimation remains elusive. The objective of this discussion paper is to describe some of the principal issues associated with accommodating climate change into Australian flood estimation practice. Given {{that the vast majority of}} Australia’s historical effort to manage and mitigate flood risk has been underpinned by the assumption of stationarity, the development of an alternative framework that accounts for future changes will form a critical input into how we adapt to future risks. The emphasis of this paper is therefore on summarising the science linking climate change to flooding, and reviewing some of the tools which can be used to quantify future flood risk, as these will form a necessary input in any future adaptation effort. A brief overview will also be provided of official guidance that is currently available on incorporating changes to rainfall and sea level in planning and design, although it should be noted that much more detailed guidance is expected as part of the upcoming revision to Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR [URL] There are a range of broader questions related to how to adapt to the changes that might take place, including the relative roles of engineering solutions (such as levees, reservoirs, storm water drainage, seawalls and so on), planning controls (such as land‐use zoning), and numerous other potential tools that can aid in reducing or better living with flood risk. Further details on these issues will be reserved for future discussion papers. However as this paper will argue, any research on adaptation options must be done in parallel with research which improves our understanding of the hydrology which causes floods to occur in the first place, to ensure that adaptation efforts are deployed wisely and make the best possible use of finite resources in addressing this complex problem. This paper is largely drawn from a discussion paper entitled “Implications of Climate Change on Flood Estimation” [Westra, 2010], which was prepared on behalf of the Department of Climate Change and the ARR technical committee, and was designed to inform the current round of ARR revision projects related to incorporating the impacts of human‐induced climate change into flood estimation practice. That paper was presented at a workshop in Sydney on 30 November 2010, and is currently assisting to inform the next phase of research into how flooding might change under a future climate.
