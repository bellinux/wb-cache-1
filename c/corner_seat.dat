60|$|The train drew in, and {{he found}} her a <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> and stood talking by the window, about common things.|$|E
6000|$|She {{indicated}} {{a place on}} the <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> and when he took it began to talk, carefully avoiding any personal topic, but after a time he interrupted her-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my Gawd," [...] {{said the}} conductor, taking {{him by the}} {{shoulders}} and forcing him down into the <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> [...] "wot am I to do? Carn't somebody sit on 'im?" ...|$|E
60|$|I reached Victoria {{some time}} before B. I secured two <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> in a smoking-carriage, and then paced {{up and down the}} {{platform}} waiting for him.|$|R
5000|$|The building, {{situated}} at a <b>corner,</b> <b>seats</b> 800. Its exterior, painted by Hamburg artists Dieter Glasmacher and Werner Nöfer, was restored in 1995 when {{the building was}} overhauled.|$|R
60|$|Turning round, {{while still}} musing about Society, I ran against B. (literally). He thought I was a clumsy ass at first, and said so; but, on {{recognising}} me, apologised for his mistake. He {{had been there}} for some time also, waiting for me. I told him that I had secured two <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> in a smoking-carriage, and he replied that he had done so too. By a curious coincidence, we had both fixed upon the same carriage. I had taken the <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> near the platform, and he had booked the two opposite corners. Four other passengers sat huddled up in the middle. We kept the seats near the door, and gave the other two away. One should always practise generosity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{on to the}} cabin," [...] {{suggested}} Dick, and led the way. They {{sat down}} on a <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> and there the Rovers told their story, withholding nothing, for they knew they could trust Jack Wumble in every particular.|$|E
60|$|Evelyn {{was talking}} to the young American when they crossed the big hall and she smiled as they passed, but an hour later Thirlwell saw her alone. She beckoned him {{carelessly}} and indicated a place near her in a <b>corner</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [The DUTCH YOUTH laughs, {{and goes}} {{through the motions of}} raising [...] the window. The ENGLISH regard the {{operation}} with uneasy [...] irritation. The GERMAN opens his bag, which reposes on the [...] <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> next him, and takes out a book.] ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Salutsky-Hardman {{as part of}} the {{leadership}} of the Jewish Socialist Federation in 1917 (upper right <b>corner).</b> <b>Seated</b> (L-R): Ben-Tsien Hofman (Tsivion), Max Goldfarb, Morris Winchevsky, A. Litvak, Hannah Salutsky, Moishe Terman. Standing: Shauchno Epstein, Frank Rozenblat, Baruch Charney Vladeck, Moissaye Olgin, Jacob Salutsky (J.B.S. Hardman).|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{is really}} very {{good of you to}} come, Watson," [...] said he. [...] "It makes a {{considerable}} difference to me, having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep the two <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> I shall get the tickets." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had secured}} the <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> next the conductor, where {{his long legs}} made it {{difficult}} for anyone to get in, and at all who passed him he looked resentfully, as if they had no business to be using up his air.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was just}} about to drop down, as propriety demands, into the <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> diagonally {{opposite}} to--and therefore as far as possible away from--her handsome companion, when the stranger rose, and, with a very flushed face, said, in a hasty, though markedly deferential and apologetic tone-- ...|$|E
60|$|The man assented with pleasure--it {{paid to do}} a {{kindness}} for a Strangewey. John {{passed through}} the ticket-office to the platform, where the train was waiting, threw {{open the door of}} a carriage, and flung himself into a <b>corner</b> <b>seat.</b> The whistle sounded. The adventure of his life had begun at last.|$|E

60|$|It {{was a hot}} afternoon, and {{the railway}} {{carriage}} was correspondingly sultry, and the next stop was at Templecombe, nearly an hour ahead. The occupants of the carriage were a small girl, and a smaller girl, and a small boy. An aunt belonging to the children occupied one <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> and the further <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> {{on the opposite side}} was occupied by a bachelor who was a stranger to their party, but the small girls and the small boy emphatically occupied the compartment. Both the aunt and the children were conversational in a limited, persistent way, reminding one of the attentions of a housefly that refuses to be discouraged. Most of the aunt’s remarks seemed to begin with “Don’t,” and nearly all of the children’s remarks began with “Why?” The bachelor said nothing out loud. “Don’t, Cyril, don’t,” exclaimed the aunt, as the small boy began smacking the cushions of the seat, producing a cloud of dust at each blow.|$|E
60|$|The three {{philosophers}} {{had already}} called for some old Rhenish wine on draught. Käthi and Luise brought pewter jugs and more goblets along. Soon Gutter-rat {{and his friends}} were installed at the table, squeezed against one another on the narrow wooden benches. Pythagoras had already rolled off his <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> and was sitting on the floor; Diogenes was perched {{on the corner of the}} table.|$|E
60|$|The four-fifteen express slid softly out of Paddington Station and Ashe Marson settled {{himself in}} the <b>corner</b> <b>seat</b> of his second-class compartment. Opposite him Joan Valentine had begun to read a magazine. Along the corridor, in a {{first-class}} smoking compartment, Mr. Peters was lighting a big black cigar. Still farther along the corridor, in a first-class non-smoking compartment, Aline Peters looked {{through the window and}} thought of many things.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{capacity in}} 1986 was 12,500 permanent {{seats on the}} sidelines with open grass seating behind the end zones, an approximate capacity of 15,000, weather-permitting. Permanent seating for the end zones was installed in 1995, which brought the <b>seating</b> to 18,845. <b>Corner</b> <b>seating</b> in the north end zone opened in 2003 {{and the most recent}} expansion in 2008 to the east grandstand brought the capacity to 25,217.|$|R
60|$|They {{had barely}} {{time to take}} their seats. As my place was next to the window, I felt bound to help the porter hand in the small packages. The man Delora, who was {{wrapped up in a}} fur coat, and who looked ghastly ill, thanked me courteously enough, but the girl ignored my assistance. They took the two <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> at the further end of the carriage. Delora {{immediately}} composed himself to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Taking a <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> she {{smoothed}} the curly locks, {{disturbed by the}} wind, put on her gloves, and settled her books in her lap, then modestly glanced from the old gentleman in the opposite corner to the lady near by. Such a bright little face as I saw under the brown hat-rim, happy blue eyes, dimples in the ruddy cheeks, and the innocent expression which makes a young girl so sweet an object to old eyes.|$|E
60|$|Sally {{saved her}} breath. The train was {{beginning}} to move slowly {{out of the station}} as they sprinted abreast on to the platform. Ginger dived for the nearest door, wrenched it open, gathered Sally neatly in his arms, and flung her in. She landed squarely on the toes of a man who occupied the <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> and, bounding off again, made for the window. Ginger, faithful to the last, was trotting beside the train as it gathered speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "The train {{will be made}} {{up about}} four," [...] a good-natured {{official}} said to him, [...] "and you had best be here by that time so as to get a <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> for I {{can tell you that}} makes all the difference on a journey like this. If you like to take your ticket at once you can register that trunk of yours straight on to Denver, and then you won't have any more trouble about it." ...|$|E
60|$|Two hours. One {{hundred and}} twenty minutes. Anything might be done in that time. Anything. Nothing. Oh, he had had {{hundreds}} of hours, and what had he done with them? Wasted them, spilt the precious minutes as though his reservoir were inexhaustible. Denis groaned in the spirit, condemned himself utterly with all his works. What right had he {{to sit in the}} sunshine, to occupy <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> in third-class carriages, to be alive? None, none, none.|$|R
50|$|The ballpark's age and its cramped {{quarters}} {{began to}} be a notable problem for the minor league club once the minor league explosion of the late 1980s and early 1990s was under way. Various cosmetic renovations were made, such as building a kind of stadium club ("The Grandstand") in the left field <b>corner</b> <b>seats,</b> {{as well as a}} fairly large concession stand outside the third base stands. The stadium also received many seats from Philadelphia's old Shibe Park after Shibe's demolition.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got a {{carriage}} and collared two <b>corner</b> <b>seats.</b> Millie goes down in another. She doesn't like {{the smell of}} smoke when she's travelling. Hope we get the carriage to ourselves. Devil {{of a lot of}} people here this morning. Still, the more people there are in the world, the more eggs we shall sell. I can see with half an eye that all these blighters are confirmed egg-eaters. Get in, sonnie. I'll just see the missis into her carriage, and come back to you." ...|$|R
60|$|They drove {{straight}} to the depot, found two vacant seats in the train, and Quest with a little sigh of relief handed over his charge. Craig, who, though still dumb, had shown signs of intense nervousness since the landing, sank back in his <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> covering {{the upper part of}} his head with his hands. Suddenly Lenora, who had been chatting with French through the window, happened to glance towards Craig. She gave a little cry and stepped back.|$|E
60|$|She took a <b>corner</b> <b>seat,</b> {{with her}} back to the engine; he sat opposite. The guard looked in, thought they were lovers, and did not show other {{travellers}} into that compartment. They talked on strictly ordinary matters; what she thought he did not know, but at every stopping station he dreaded intrusion. Before they were halfway to London the event he had just begun to realize was a patent fact. The Beloved was again embodied; she filled every fibre and curve of this woman's form.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but if {{you take}} my advice you will do as most of them do, get a big basket and lay in a stock of bread and cooked meat, cheese, and {{anything}} you fancy, then you will only {{have to go out and}} get a cup of tea at the stopping-places. It comes a good bit cheaper, and you get done before those who take their meals, and can slip back into the cars again quick and keep your <b>corner</b> <b>seat.</b> There ain't much ceremony in emigrant trains, and it is first come first served." ...|$|E
5000|$|Initially the Bears {{worked with}} the stands that were there. Eventually they {{acquired}} a large, portable bleacher section that spanned the right and center field areas and covered most of the existing bleacher seating {{and part of the}} right field <b>corner</b> <b>seating.</b> This [...] "East Stand" [...] raised Wrigley's football capacity to about 47,000, or a net gain of perhaps 9,000 seats over normal capacity. After the Bears left, this structure would live on for several years as the [...] "North Stand" [...] at Soldier Field, until it was replaced by permanent seating.|$|R
50|$|Other outdoor {{facilities}} {{include the}} 18-hole championship UI Golf Course, directly {{south of the}} Kibbie Dome. The first nine holes debuted in 1937 and the second nine opened in 1970; the 1949 clubhouse was replaced in 1969. West of the Kibbie Dome is the 400 m outdoor track and field stadium, opened in early 1972 and named for newly crowned Olympic champion decathlete Dan O'Brien in September 1996. A concrete grandstand {{at the finish line}} in the southeast <b>corner</b> <b>seats</b> approximately 1,000. The track complex was fully refurbished in 2011 and hosted the WAC outdoor championships in 2012.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{panorama}} of Gilmore Field, {{taken from the}} seats, at the Hollywood Baseball Park on Beverly Boulevard at Fairfax Avenue, 1938. The crowded seats of the stadium fill the left foreground, receding ahead into the distance. More bleachers, also full of spectators, run horizontally across the image at the background. The seating rows stand taller {{at the intersection of}} the left and right seating areas, and a covered overhang shields the <b>corner</b> <b>seats.</b> Stadium lights protrude from the roof of the structure. The baseball diamond sits {{at the center of the}} image, with players at all positions. Trees and a building are visible in the distance on the right...|$|R
