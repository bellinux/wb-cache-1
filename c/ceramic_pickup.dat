50|$|Compared to {{the crystal}} and ceramic pickups, the {{magnetic}} cartridge usually gives improved playback fidelity and reduced record wear by tracking the groove with lighter pressure. Magnetic cartridges use lower tracking forces and thus reduce {{the potential for}} groove damage. They also have a lower output voltage than a crystal or <b>ceramic</b> <b>pickup,</b> {{in the range of}} only a few millivolts, thus requiring greater amplification.|$|E
5000|$|The Sterling {{was created}} as a four-string version of the highly popular StingRay 5, which also uses ceramic magnet pickups and a {{different}} preamp than the StingRay's alnico magnet pickups. New pickup configurations and five-way pickup switching debuted in 2005. Music Man has introduced a five-string version using the same body and pickguard styling as the original four-string since January 22, 2008. On July 24, 2010, Music Man introduced a [...] "Classic Collection" [...] 4 string Sterling featuring a single <b>ceramic</b> <b>pickup</b> wired in parallel, two-band boost/cut EQ, string-through slab body, 7.5" [...] inch fretboard radius, a choice of flamed or birds-eye maple neck with maple or rosewood fingerboard, chrome battery cover, and string mutes.|$|E
50|$|In high-fidelity systems, {{crystal and}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>pickups</b> have been {{replaced}} by the magnetic cartridge, using either a moving magnet or a moving coil.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Gibson {{released}} the new Gibson SG Baritone. This SG comes in Alpine white and has 24 frets. It comes tuned down {{two and a}} half steps to B-E-A-D-F#-B.

50|$|In March 2008, Ernie Ball {{switched}} back to alnico pickups {{for their}} StingRay 5, after having used <b>ceramic</b> <b>pickups</b> for this model since 1991. The alnico pickups, {{which are also}} found in their four-string counterparts, give the instrument a sound more like a StingRay 4. The phantom-coil was also removed (except for the HS model) and the Single-Coil Mode replaced by an Enhanced Parallel setting.|$|R
5000|$|... "Dimebag Darrell" [...] Abbott Washburn's Dean ML-style Dime 333 {{and radical}} Gibson Explorer-like Dime Culprit models {{were the most}} popular. The Dime 333 had a Floyd Rose double-locking tremolo; the 332 variant {{featured}} a stop-tail bridge. The Culprit, with its sliced-up Explorer-style body, featured a Floyd Rose tremolo, a mirror pickguard {{and a pair of}} hot <b>ceramic</b> humbucking <b>pickups</b> with chrome cover.|$|R
5000|$|This 8-string {{signature}} {{model for}} Meshuggah guitarist Fredrik Thordendal {{is essentially a}} hybrid design blending the Iceman body shape with a reverse Gibson Firebird, featuring an ash wing body, 7-piece maple/walnut neck-through construction with KTS™ TITANIUM reinforcement rods, 27" [...] scale length, rosewood fretboard, 24 jumbo frets, FX Edge III-8 locking fixed bridge {{and a pair of}} Lundgren M8P <b>ceramic</b> humbucking <b>pickups.</b> Introduced in 2017, this guitar is available in Weathered Black.|$|R
5000|$|Common to all Spirit {{models is}} the flat top and back. One control cavity is routed {{into the rear}} of the guitar. All spirits have a double-cutaway design, with the upper horn {{slightly}} longer than the lower. The neck is set (glued) into the body and has 22 frets with pearl dot inlays. Some models have flamed/tiger maple tops and transparent/sunburst finishes. Truss rod covers on Spirit models vary, with most simply saying [...] "Spirit" [...] or [...] "Spirit Made By Gibson" [...] (on Epiphone models). Humbuckers are Gibson 1959 Les Paul Reissue models (sometimes called [...] "Tim Shaw" [...] pickups after the Gibson engineer who led the design team). Some of these pickups have white coils and get mistaken for Dirty Fingers, but they are medium-output alnico pickups, whereas Dirty Fingers are high-output <b>ceramic</b> <b>pickups.</b> Early models have the upper strap button located {{on the back of the}} guitar at the neck joint, while later models have a strap button at the tip of the upper horn. Tuners are typically the Kluson-type [...] "tulip" [...] knob tuners, though some Spirits (particularly XPL models) have enclosed tuners.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Pickups</b> are two <b>ceramic</b> Vintage Noiseless <b>pickups</b> with {{nickel-plated}} {{pole pieces}} connected in an S/S configuration. Models produced before 2004 came with Suhr-designed [...] "single pole" [...] stacked humbuckers.It has four knobs; a master volume, a pickup blend pot, a 3-band equalizer {{powered by a}} pair of 9V batteries and an active/passive switch (since 2016).|$|R
50|$|The pickups {{used in the}} Contemporary {{models were}} {{manufactured}} by Fujigen. All of the pickups used on the Contemporary models have alnico magnets instead of <b>ceramic.</b> The humbucking <b>pickups</b> used in the Contemporary models have a DC resistance which is approximately 7.6 kilohms. The single coil pickups used in the Contemporary models have a DC resistance which is approximately 5.6 kΩ. The Contemporary models that use a TBX tone control use 500 kΩ volume pots and use 0.022 µF tone capacitors.|$|R
5000|$|The Jeff Beck model {{features}} an alder body finished in polyurethane or [...] "Thinskin" [...] nitrocellulose lacquer, a thinner C-shape maple neck with rosewood fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, LSR Roller Nut, Schaller locking machine heads (Sperzel TrimLok staggered on the Custom Artist version), an American two-point synchronized vibrato and a contoured heel for {{easier access to}} the higher registers. For electronics, this guitar sports a trio of dual-coil <b>Ceramic</b> Hot Noiseless <b>pickups</b> and five-way pickup switching. Other refinements include aged plastic parts, three-ply parchment pickguard and chrome hardware.|$|R
5000|$|The Les Paul Special II is {{manufactured}} by Epiphone with a retail price starting at under $300 USD. It {{does not have}} Alnico classic humbucking pickups, but instead has <b>ceramic</b> Neck <b>Pickup</b> Epiphone 650R Humbucker, Bridge Pickup Epiphone 700T Humbucker, one master volume knob, one tone knob, a three-way pickup selector switch and a rosewood fretboard (with plastic dot inlays). A Tune-O-Matic bridge and stop-bar tailpiece come standard. It is usually constructed of a basswood body and a bolt-on nato neck and comes in black, white, red, cherry sunburst and vintage sunburst. Company marketing literature occasionally refers to this model as Epiphone's most popular Les Paul model, {{in part because of}} both their classic design, as well as their overall simplicity. Although the design has gone largely unchanged over the years, Special IIs have been manufactured in different locations, including China most recently. [...] Unlike some older models, current Special IIs (which are priced slightly cheaper than in years past), do not bear a [...] "Gibson" [...] labeled truss cover, nor does name appear anywhere on the headstock. Instead the truss cover reads [...] "Special II" [...] in bright lettering. On the used market, some players seek out older models due to this difference. Special IIs comes standard with either nickel-plated chrome or black hardware.|$|R
