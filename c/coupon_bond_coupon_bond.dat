40|$|In {{this work}} we are {{introducing}} a risk neutral valuation formula for {{counterparty default risk}} adjustments in an unilateral and in a bilateral case. In the unilateral case the adjustment is represented by a Credit Valuation Adjust- ment(CVA) and in the bilateral case the adjustment is quantified by a Bilateral Risk Adjustment(BVA). We are incorporating these adjustments into the values of zero <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds,</b> <b>coupon</b> bearing <b>bonds</b> and interest rate swaps. For such an incorporation, risk neutral default probabilities extracted from the market quotes of Credit Default Swaps are needed. A Bootstrap method is used to derive them and a reduced form approach is used to model the default times. In the practical part, we are calculating Greek and Czech risk neutral default probabilities during the years 2008 - 2010.

40|$|Investors in <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds</b> {{evaluate}} them {{based upon}} financial considerations such as coupon rate, time-to-maturity, callability, convertibility, and financial {{condition of the}} issuer. These investors regard promised yield as only a rough measure of the reward a bond offers to compensate them for the pure time-value-of-money and the financial risks {{to which they are}} exposed. Hence, they need a more meaningful measure of reward to facilitate comparisons among <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an alternative heuristic approach to the task of making such comparisons. The approach produces a simple "ordinal" measure of reward, called the 'indifference spread,' that considers implicitly the potential sources of return to, as well as many of the risks associated with, investment in <b>coupon</b> <b>bonds.</b> For any <b>coupon</b> <b>bond,</b> the indifference spread method permits assessment of "relative" reward offered for the combined exposures to price and call risks, while also reasonably accommodating possible sale anytime prior to maturity. Once an investor (e. g., money manager) identifies indifference spreads for all bonds under consideration as of any moment in time, he/she can then draw conclusions regarding their relative values at that time based, in large part, on these spreads.

40|$|When new {{international}} statistical standards {{were published in}} 1993, {{one of the major}} changes to the recommended presentation of the system of national accounts and the balance of payments was the adoption of accruals reporting for income and expenditure. However, as countries have begun to implement these standards, questions have arisen about their exact interpretation in respect of interest flows associated with tradable debt, where the cash flow is fixed at the time of issue but where the price of the instrument fluctuates with market conditions. A clear consensus has yet to emerge. The paper explores the issues involved in using the alternative approaches, the so-called "debtor" and "creditor" approaches. The debtor approach uses the rate implicit at the time of issue, and the creditor approach, the current market rate. The paper concludes that the creditor approach is the only one consistent with accrual principles and market valuation for the debt outstanding.

Along with the formulas for the various statistics proposed, we provide simple examples of their application to some common risk valuation cases. Finally, we present an integrated approach for the simultaneous estimation of a portfolio''s interest rate and exchange rate risk using the VaR methodology.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the importance}} of sovereign risk in determining corporate default premia (yield spreads). It also investigates {{the extent to which}} the practice by rating agencies and banks of not rating companies higher than their sovereign ("country or sovereign ceiling") is reflected in the yields of South African local-currency-denominated corporate bonds. The main findings are: (i) sovereign risk appears to be the single most important determinant of corporate default premia in South Africa; (ii) the sovereign ceiling (in local-currency terms) does not apply in the spreads of the industrial multinational companies in the sample; and (iii) consistent with rating agency policy, however, the sovereign ceiling appears to apply in the spreads of most financial companies in the sample.
