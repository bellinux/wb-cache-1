5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime while in exile.

5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members of the teaching profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians are {{generally}} <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory that Gregory {{was influenced by}} neoplatonism. For example, Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos argues in Life After Death that Gregory opposed all philosophical (as opposed to theological) endeavour as tainted with worldliness. This view is supported by Against Euthonius, where Gregory denounces Euthonius for placing {{the results of his}} systematic Aristotelean philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{was noted}} in his time for being a satirist.

Because of these works he was persecuted and finally imprisoned shortly before his death.|$|E
5|$|He {{also carried}} out studies on {{education}} and on human behavior, in a social-science tradition. Some of his views and theories made him a precursor of evolutionism in the natural and social sciences. In his essays on human nature, he declared for the primacy of science and was relatively <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> influence of religion. These views gained him some critics, as he {{was seen as a}} priest who had abandoned religion.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>critical</b> {{behavior}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random-field Ising {{model has}} been a puzzle for a long time.
