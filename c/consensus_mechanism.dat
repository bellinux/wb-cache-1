The first proposed algorithm calls for the local exchange of support vectors between sensors, while the second technique requires the exchange of all sample vectors that define uniquely and completely the convex hulls of the two classes.

30|$|Blockchain is {{one kind}} of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), which is a novel {{approach}} to recording and sharing data spread across a distributed network of participants (Natarajan et al. 2017).

Without {{the use of a}} central server, blockchain technology eliminates the risk of having one node with superior power that may influence or manipulate the process of consensus establishment in the network. New data can only be added when consensus is reached among a majority of participants. Some commonly used <b>consensus</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are Proof-of Authority (PoA), Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). Tschorsch et al.

40|$|A {{blockchain}} is {{a public}} ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended.

The recent interest in blockchains has revived research on consensus protocols, ranging from the proof-of-work method in Bitcoin 2 ̆ 7 s "mining" protocol to classical Byzantine agreement.

40|$|<b>Consensus</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for {{ensuring}} consistency {{are some of}} the most expensive operations in managing large amounts of data. Often, there is a trade off that involves reducing the oordination overhead at the price of accepting possible data loss or inconsistencies. As the demand for more efficient data centers increases, it is important to provide better ways of ensuring consistency without affecting performance. In this paper we show that consensus (atomic broadcast) can be removed from the critical path of performance by moving it to hardware. As a proof of concept, we implement Zookeeper’s atomic broadcast at the network level using an FPGA. Our design uses both TCP and an application specific network protocol. The design can be used to push more value into the network, e. g., by extending the functionality of middleboxes or adding inexpensive consensus to in-network processing nodes. To illustrate how this hardware consensus can be used in practical systems, we have combined it with a mainmemory key value store running on specialized microservers (built as well on FPGAs). This results in a distributed service similar to Zookeeper that exhibits high and stable performance. This work can be used as a blueprint for further specialized designs...|$|R
