In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy {{should be considered in}} advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day.

40|$|This survey {{describes}} <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace <b>in</b> selected {{health services}} and {{is part of a}} greater study conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. This study describes the views of nurse managers and nurses regarding <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. Human competence, recovery and healing are central to caring. To ensure caring and healing of patients in health services it is of the utmost importance for nurse managers to ensure a healthy and <b>caring</b> environment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> management of nurses. When <b>caring</b> is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace, nurses are more able to render <b>caring</b> nursing practices <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patient <b>care</b> environment. It is clear that to become a caring person, one must be treated <b>in</b> a <b>caring</b> way and that caring may be impaired or reinforced by the environment. The environment of interest to this study was <b>the</b> environment <b>in</b> which nurses practise. A descriptive survey with a convenience sampling explored <b>caring</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace of nurses. The questionnaire was divided into two sections. Section A comprised demographic information and <b>in</b> section B <b>the</b> questionnaire consisted of Likert type questions, open-ended questions and yes/no questions.

Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI have arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.|$|E

5|$|Hospice <b>care</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E

His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
