40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} is a non-destructive and quantitative technique {{used to assess}} the quality of the liquid metal prior to casting. The method has been used in the aluminum foundry to assess the extent of grain refining and the degree of eutectic modification. Although the method has been, to a certain extent, successfully used, it has some serious drawbacks. The most apparent include: (a) poor reproducibility, (b) poor control over heat extraction and cooling rates, (c) a batch operation, and (d) a manual operation which is difficult to automate and <b>computerize.</b> <b>To</b> overcome these shortcomings associated with current thermal analysis methods, a new technique of performing thermal analysis on aluminum alloys has been devised. Besides being semi-continuous, the new system is easier to use, more dependable and, most importantly, capable of performing thermal analysis tests at controlled and variable cooling rates throughout the entire solidification process. The new thermal analysis technique is based on heat pipe principles in which a small quantity of a melt, residing in the core of a heat pipe probe, is solidified, and its cooling curve is acquired. Once the cooling curve has been acquired, the probe is instructed to remelt the sample and await instructions to run another test. The new probe, which resides in the melt and need not be withdrawn, is used to solidify the sample under predetermined and controlled conditions. The operating principles of the new thermal analysis device are based on heat pipe technology. In simple terms, a heat pipe is a high heat transfer device capable of transferring large amounts of heat from a source to a sink by taking advantage of the high heat transfer rates associated with the evaporation and condensation of a working fluid placed inside the pipe. Heat is absorbed at the heat source (evaporator) and dissipated at the heat sink (condenser) at approximately isothermal conditions, and hence the thermal gradient from one extreme end of the pipe to the other is minimal, the amount of heat transferred is large, and the thermal resistance is small. The new thermal analysis device has been used to produce cooling curves of various aluminum alloys. The device has also been shown to detect the extent of grain refinement, degree of eutectic modification, and formation of intermetallic phases. In addition, the device has been used to quantify the amount of iron in aluminum melts. Thermal analysis results obtained with the new technique are in good agreement with those of conventional thermal analysis. In conjunction with the new device, a control scheme has been devised to control the heat extraction and cooling rates during cooling of aluminum alloys. Finally, a heat transfer and solidification model of the heat pipe thermal analyzer is derived and validated based on the acquired experimental data. Thermal analysis results are reported for pure aluminum, three casting alloys: hypeoeutectic aluminum silicon (A 356 and A 319), and a eutectic aluminum silicon (413) alloy, and a wrought alloy of the 6000 series (6061) ...|$|E
