25|$|Ethanol fuel is {{the most}} common biofuel worldwide, {{particularly}} in Brazil. Alcohol fuels are produced by fermentation of sugars derived from wheat, corn, sugar beets, sugar <b>cane,</b> <b>molasses</b> and any sugar or starch from which alcoholic beverages such as whiskey, can be made (such as potato and fruit waste, etc.).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the mechanism of}} stabilization of expansive soil with <b>cane</b> <b>molasses.</b> The main objective {{of the study was}} to establish whether or not sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> can be used as a stabilizing agent for expansive clay soil used for engineering purposes. Other objectives were to carry out analysis of cane molasses; to carry out strength assessment of neat expansive soil and expansive soil mixed with <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> as reflected by California bearing ratio (CBR). <b>Cane</b> <b>molasses</b> was selected for this purpose because it contained some elements/compounds which are known to react with clay minerals and change characteristics of the soil. It was established that 8 % <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> by weight of dry soil was the maximum for effective stabilization of expansive clay soil. On comparison lime stabilized soil specimens gave higher CBR values than <b>cane</b> <b>molasses.</b> The conclusion was that the increase in CBR values for expansive soil mixed with <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> above those of neat expansive soil was an indication that <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> caused the increase in soil strength and therefore it stabilized expansive clay soil. It was also observed that <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> mixed with expansive clay soil could reduce swelling tendencies of the soil. _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|E

40|$|Transglutaminase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyses an acyl {{transfer}} reaction between γ-carboxamide groups of glutaminyl residues and lysine residues in proteins. Due to this property, this enzyme {{is used for}} enhancing textural properties of protein-rich food. The transglutaminase used as food additive is obtained by microorganisms, mainly by Streptoverticillium ladakanum. On the other hand, sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> is a viscous liquid rich in noncrystallized carbohydrates (saccharose, glucose and fructose). In this work, the feasibility of using sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> as a carbon source {{for the production of}} microbial transglutaminase by Streptoverticillium ladakanum NRRL 3191 has been studied. Carbon sources including sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> (60 g of total sugars per L), glycerol (60 g/L) and their mixture in a ratio of 1 : 1 (30 g/L of each) were evaluated. Time course of microbial growth, transglutaminase activity and carbon source consumption were determined every 24 h during 120 h of fermentations at three agitation speeds (200, 300 or 400 rpm). The results showed that with the increase in agitation speed, the biomass concentration increased up to 8. 39 g/L in the medium containing sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> alone or the mixture of molasses and glycerol. The highest transglutaminase activity was obtained at 400 rpm in the medium containing a mixture of molasses and glycerol, reaching 0. 460 U/mL, while in the medium containing sugar <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> alone, the activity was 0. 240 U/mL, and using glycerol alone it was 0. 250 U/mL.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryBradley J. JohnsonResearch {{regarding}} rumen epithelial {{adaptation and}} potential mechanisms {{during the transition}} period of the dairy cow is lacking. The rumen epithelium has a tremendous capacity for the absorption of volatile fatty acids (VFA) produced from microbial fermentation in the rumen. Absorption of VFA from the rumen pool delivers energy substrates to the animal and provides stability to the rumen environment. Increased epithelial surface area from the development and adaptation of rumen papillae facilitates VFA absorption. Manipulation of the diet to alter rumen fermentation can have positive effects upon the rumen papillae development supporting VFA absorption. We hypothesized that enhancing rumen epithelial surface area through dietary alterations could lead to greater VFA absorption and improve rumen stability. Experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects}} of diets formulated with <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> to stimulate the production of ruminal butyrate and thereby increase rumen epithelial surface area and to investigate a potential mechanism for glucagon-like peptide- 2 (GLP- 2) to impact epithelial development. Feeding <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> in the dry period improved dry matter intake during the close-up period and during lactation. Milk production was increased for cows that were fed <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> during the dry period. Ruminal absorption of valerate was greater during the close-up period than the far-off period but was not influenced by the addition of <b>cane</b> <b>molasses.</b> Total VFA concentration measured during the dry period was not affected by the addition of <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> to the diet. The presence of glucagon-like peptide receptor (GLP- 2 R) mRNA was confirmed in bovine tissue obtained from rumen epithelium, omasum, abomasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, large intestine, and pancreas. The greatest level of expression of mRNA for GLP- 2 R was in the small intestine and large intestine. Expression of GLP- 2 R mRNA during the prepartum period tended to be increased with the addition of <b>cane</b> <b>molasses.</b> Postpartum expression of GLP- 2 R was not increased by supplementing <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> in the dry cow diet. Results from these experiments indicate that dry cow diets formulated to contain <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> can positively influence transition cow performance and that the presence of glucagonlike peptide- 2 receptor could play a pivotal role in rumen epithelial development...|$|E

The main feedstocks for producing bioethanol in Thailand are sugarcane, <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> and cassava. Monthly data has been used from January 2006 to March 2014 to conduct this research. The existence of long-run relationships among the four variables i. e. bioethanol production, sugarcane farm gate price, <b>cane</b> <b>molasses</b> export price and cassava farm gate price detected through the Auto Regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) framework.

50|$|By the 1850s, {{sugar beet}} {{production}} had reached Russia and Ukraine. This {{was made possible}} by the protection of the sugar beet industry by bounties, or subsidies, paid to beet sugar producers upon the export of their sugar by their respective governments.

The result was a reduction in the production of <b>cane</b> sugar, <b>molasses</b> and rum until 1915. During World War I, the widespread conflict destroyed large tracts of land that had served as sugar beet producers and repurposed much of the remaining sugar beet land for grain production.
