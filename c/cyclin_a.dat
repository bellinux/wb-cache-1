5|$|Earlier {{cell cycle}} checkpoints such as post-restriction point check between G1 phase and S phase {{similarly}} involve proteasomal degradation of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A,</b> whose ubiquitination is {{promoted by the}} anaphase promoting complex (APC), an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The APC and the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein complex (SCF complex) are the two key regulators of cyclin degradation and checkpoint control; the SCF itself is regulated by the APC via ubiquitination of the adaptor protein, Skp2, which prevents SCF activity before the G1-S transition.|$|E
25|$|When it is {{time for}} a cell to enter S phase, {{complexes}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and cyclins phosphorylate Rb to pRb, allowing E2F-DP to dissociate from pRb and become active. When E2F is free it activates factors like cyclins (e.g. cyclin E and <b>cyclin</b> <b>A),</b> which push the cell through the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinases, and a molecule called proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, which speeds DNA replication and repair by helping to attach polymerase to DNA. The initial phosphorylation is performed by Cyclin D/CDK4/CDK6, followed by additional phosphorylation by Cyclin E/CDK2. pRb remains phosphorylated throughout S, G2 and M phases.|$|E
2500|$|Cyclin D is {{the first}} cyclin {{produced}} in the cell cycle, in response to extracellular signals (e.g. growth factors). Cyclin D binds to existing CDK4, forming the active cyclin D-CDK4 complex. Cyclin D-CDK4 complex in turn phosphorylates the retinoblastoma susceptibility protein (Rb). The hyperphosphorylated Rb dissociates from the E2F/DP1/Rb complex (which was bound to the E2F responsive genes, effectively [...] "blocking" [...] them from transcription), activating E2F. Activation of E2F results in transcription of various genes like cyclin E, <b>cyclin</b> <b>A,</b> DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, etc. Cyclin E thus produced binds to CDK2, forming the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, which pushes the cell from G1 to S phase (G1/S, which initiates the G2/M transition). Cyclin B-cdk1 complex activation causes breakdown of nuclear envelope and initiation of prophase, and subsequently, its deactivation causes the cell to exit mitosis.|$|E
40|$|Colorectal {{carcinoma}} RKO cells expressing reduced {{levels of}} the RNA-binding protein HuR (ASHuR) displayed markedly reduced growth. In synchronous RKO populations, HuR was almost exclusively nuclear during early G 1, increasing in the cytoplasm during late G 1, S and G 2. The expression and half-life of mRNAs encoding <b>cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B 1 similarly increased during S and G 2, then declined, indicating that mRNA stabilization contributed to their cell cycle-regulated expression. In gel-shift assays using radiolabeled cyclin RNA transcripts and RKO protein extracts, only those transcripts corresponding to the 3 ′-untranslated regions of <b>cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B 1 formed RNA–protein complexes in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. HuR directly bound mRNAs encoding <b>cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B 1, as anti-HuR antibodies supershifted such RNA–protein complexes. Importantly, the expression and half-life of mRNAs encoding <b>cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B 1 were reduced in ASHuR RKO cells. Our results indicate that HuR may {{play a critical role}} in cell proliferation, at least in part by mediating cell cycle-dependent stabilization of mRNAs encoding <b>cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B 1...|$|R

40|$|Cyclin B 3 {{has been}} conserved during higher {{eukaryote}} evolution {{as evidenced by}} its identification in chicken, nematodes, and insects. We demonstrate that Cyclin B 3 is present in addition to <b>Cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B in mitotically proliferating cells and not detectable in endoreduplicating tissues of Drosophila embryos. Cyclin B 3 is coimmunoprecipitated with Cdk 1 (Cdc 2) but not with Cdk 2 (Cdc 2 c). It is degraded abruptly during mitosis like <b>Cyclins</b> <b>A</b> and B. In contrast to these latter cyclins, which accumulate predominantly in the cytoplasm during interphase, Cyclin B 3 is a nuclear protein. Genetic analyses indicate functional redundancies. Double and triple mutant analyses demonstrate that <b>Cyclins</b> <b>A,</b> B, and B 3 cooperate to regulate mitosis, but surprisingly single mutants reveal that neither Cyclin B 3 nor Cyclin B is required for mitosis. However, both are required for female fertility and Cyclin B also for male fertility...|$|R
50|$|E2F initiates {{transcription}} of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> by de-repressing the promoter. The promoter {{is bound}} by a repressor molecule called the cell-cycle-responsive element (CCRE). E2F binds to an E2F binding site on the CCRE, releasing the repressor from the promoter and allowing the transcription of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A.</b> Cyclin A/CDK2 will eventually phosphorylate E2F when <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> reaches a certain level, completing the negative feedback loop. Phosphorylation of E2F turns the transcription factor off, providing another level of controlling the transcription of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} protein (pRb) {{is involved in}} the regulation of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> through its interaction with E2F. It exists in two states: hypophosphorylated pRb and hyperphosphorylated pRb. Hypophosphorylated pRb binds E2F, which prevents transcription of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A.</b> The absence of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> prior to the R point is due to the inhibition of E2F by hypophosphorylated pRb. After the cell passes through the R point, cyclin D/E- complexes phosphorylate pRb. Hyperphosphorylated pRb can no longer bind E2F, E2F is released and <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> genes, and other crucial genes for S phase, are transcribed.|$|E

Cyclin A/CDK1 {{is thought to be}} involved in the activation and stabilization of cyclin B/CDK1 complex. Once cyclin B is activated, <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> is no longer needed and is subsequently degraded through the ubiquitin pathway. Degradation of cyclin A/CDK1 induces mitotic exit.|$|E

In vivo, Gi cyclin/kinase complexes enhance the phosphorylation of pRb, and these effeds of cyclin/kinases on pRb can be overcome by the addition of p 21, a wide spedrum inhibitor of Gi kinases.

50|$|The {{interaction}} between the cyclin box, a region conserved across cyclins, and a region of the CDK, called the PSTAIRE, confers {{the foundation of the}} cyclin-CDK complex. <b>Cyclin</b> <b>A</b> is the only cyclin that regulates multiple steps of the cell cycle. <b>Cyclin</b> <b>A</b> can regulate multiple cell cycle steps because it associates with, and thereby activates, two distinct CDKs - CDK2 and CDK1. Depending on which CDK partner <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> binds, the cell will continue through the S phase or it will transition from G2 to the M phase. Association of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> with CDK2 is required for passage into S phase while association with CDK1 is required for entry into M phase.|$|E
50|$|Transcription of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> is {{predominantly}} {{regulated by the}} transcription factor E2F in a negative feedback loop.

50|$|<b>Cyclin</b> <b>A</b> has {{a second}} {{function}} in S phase, {{in addition to}} initiating DNA synthesis, <b>Cyclin</b> <b>A</b> ensures that DNA is replicated once per cell cycle by preventing the assembly of additional replication complexes. This is thought to occur through the phosphorylation of particular DNA replication machinery components, such as CDC6, by the cyclin A/CDK2 complex. Since the action of cyclin A/CDK2 inhibits that of cyclin E/CDK2, the sequential activation of cyclin E followed by the activation of <b>cyclin</b> <b>A</b> is important and tightly regulated in S phase.|$|E

We showed that the cell cycle arrest was not related to beta-catenin translocation into the nucleus.
