5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|While moving little near Puerto Rico, Emily brought {{prolonged}} {{tropical storm}} conditions to {{many parts of}} the island. The heaviest rainfall occurred in southern regions; Caguas recorded a total of 8.22in (209mm) of rain during the storm. High winds damaged an electrical grid, cutting off power to about 18,500customers; roughly 6,000people were left without drinking water during the storm. Dozens of residents evacuated to shelters, in particular those living near risk zones. Torrential rains of up to 10inches (250mm) overflowed three rivers, which resulted in the flooding and subsequent closure of the PR-31 highway and PRI-3 intersection. Throughout the island, multiple other roads were made impassable by landslides and fallen objects; infrastructural damage surmounted $5million, according to preliminary estimates. The two-day suspension of about 280,000employeesabout 30percent of the territory's workforceaffected the local economy significantly, with <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> estimated at $55million.|$|E
5|$|The European {{debt crisis}} {{erupted in the}} wake of the Great Recession around late 2009, and was {{characterized}} by an environment of overly high government structural deficits and accelerating debt levels. When, as a negative repercussion of the Great Recession, the relatively fragile banking sector had suffered large <b>capital</b> <b>losses,</b> most states in Europe had to bail out several of their most affected banks with some supporting recapitalization loans, because of the strong linkage between their survival and the financial stability of the economy. As of January 2009, a group of 10 central and eastern European banks had already asked for a bailout. At the time, the European Commission released a forecast of a 1.8% decline in EU economic output for 2009, making the outlook for the banks even worse. The many public funded bank recapitalizations were one reason behind the sharply deteriorated debt-to-GDP ratios experienced by several European governments {{in the wake of}} the Great Recession. The main root causes for the four sovereign debt crises erupting in Europe were reportedly a mix of: weak actual and potential growth; competitive weakness; liquidation of banks and sovereigns; large pre-existing debt-to-GDP ratios; and considerable liability stocks (government, private, and non-private sector).|$|E

25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. <b>Capital</b> <b>losses</b> (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations.

25|$|A more {{accurate}} method of calculating this price {{is to look}} at the share price and dividend from the after-tax perspective of a share holder. The after-tax drop in the share price (or capital gain/loss) should be equivalent to the after-tax dividend. For example, if the tax of capital gains Tcg is 35%, and the tax on dividends Td is 15%, then a £1 dividend is equivalent to £0.85 of after-tax money. To get the same financial benefit from a capital loss, the after-tax capital loss value should equal £0.85. The pre-tax capital loss would be £0.85/(1-Tcg) = £0.85/(1-35%) = £0.85/65% = £1.30. In this case, a dividend of £1 has led to a larger drop in the share price of £1.30, because the tax rate on <b>capital</b> <b>losses</b> is higher than the dividend tax rate.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{consistent}} definition of natural disaster damage costs, i. e., equivalently, of natural disaster prevention benefits {{in accordance with}} general definition of benefits, Willingness to Pay, more concretely, Equivalent Variation, of any policy such as tax reforms, transportations, environments, infrastructures, etc. In order to formulate the damage cost it needs to model the economic behavior at and after the disaster periods given the disaster physical damages are measured by the equivalent labor loss and the equivalent <b>capital</b> stock <b>loss.</b> The model is composed of two stages. The first is the static general equilibrium given the labor loss and the equivalent <b>capital</b> stock <b>loss</b> measured above, for which this study will adopt the static computable general equilibrium (SCGE). The second is the dynamic macroeconomics which models the recovery process given the initial labor and capital stock for cases with and without disaster, for which this study will adopt the dynamic computable general equilibrium (DCGE). The damage cost or benefit of the disaster {{is defined as the}} present value of the time stream of Equivalent Valuation for the time stream of utility change due to the initial condition change. Then it will be shown that the conventional damage calculation by the reconstruction and/or replacement cost is assumes that the second stage immediately takes place at the disaster time, therefore, the first stage does not happens. Also sometimes the economic impacts on GDP of disaster <b>capital</b> stock <b>loss</b> are calculated but nothing is referred to the damage cost of disaster. This is because there is not yet clear definition of damage cost and lack of recognition of it is a work of only the first stage. Finally it will be discussed how to transform the disaster physical damages to the equivalent labor and <b>capital</b> stock <b>loss.</b> The physical damages are either private <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> or labor loss or output loss or social overhead <b>capital</b> <b>loss,</b> each of which enters to CGE as private <b>capital</b> <b>loss,</b> labor force loss, efficiency parameter reduction due to both output loss and social overhead <b>capital</b> <b>loss.</b> Then assuming constant returns to scale the efficiency parameter change due to both output loss and social overhead <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> can be transformed to the loss of labor and capital stock.

40|$|The high U. S. {{unemployment}} rate after the Great Recession is usually {{considered to be}} a result of changes in factors influencing either the demand side or the supply side of the labor market. However, no matter what factors have caused the changes in the {{unemployment rate}}, these factors should have influenced workers' and firms' decisions. Therefore, it is important to take into account workers' endogenous responses to changes in various factors when seeking to understand how these factors affect the unemployment rate. To address this issue, we estimate a Mortensen-Pissarides style of labor-market matching model with endogenous separation decisions and stochastic changes in workers' human capital. We study how agents' endogenous choices vary with changes in the exogenous shocks and changes in labor-market policy in the context of human capital dynamics. We reach four main findings. First, once workers have accounted for and are able to optimally respond to possible human <b>capital</b> <b>loss,</b> the unemployment rate in an economy with human <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> during unemployment will not be higher than in an economy with no human <b>capital</b> <b>loss.</b> The reason is that the increase in the unemployment rate led by human <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> is more than offset by workers' endogenous responses to prevent them from being unemployed. Second, human capital accumulation on the job is more important than human <b>capital</b> <b>loss</b> during unemployment for both the unemployment rate and output. Third, workers' endogenous separation rates will decline when job-finding rates fall. Fourth, taking into account the endogenous responses, unemployment insurance extensions contributed 0. 5 percentage point to the increase in the aggregate unemployment rate in the 2008 - 12 period...|$|R
