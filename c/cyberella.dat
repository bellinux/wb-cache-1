50|$|Donald Clough Cameron {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the similarly-named Don Cameron, an artist who was also active during the Golden Age of Comic Books, nor with an unrelated Don Cameron, a comics artist who worked on the <b>Cyberella</b> series in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cyberella</b> is an American {{comic book}} series first {{published}} in 1996 {{as part of the}} short-lived DC Comics imprint, Helix. The title was initially scheduled to be an ongoing monthly, but, owing to poor sales figures for both it and the Helix line generally, was cancelled after twelve issues in 1997. Written by Howard Chaykin and drawn by Don Cameron the title has been variously described as a techno-satire and a populist cyberpunk dystopia.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} CrossTalk, an interactive installation {{in which the}} virtual fair hostess <b>Cyberella</b> presents and explains the idea of simulated dialogues among animated agents to present product information. In particular, <b>Cyberella</b> introduces two further virtual agents, Tina and Ritchie who engage in a car-sales dialogue. <b>Cyberella</b> on the one hand, and Tina and Ritchie {{on the other hand}} live on two physically separated screens which are spatially arranged as to form a triangle with the user. The name "CrossTalk" underlines the fact that different animated agents have cross-screen conversations amongst themselves. From {{the point of view of}} information presentation CrossTalk explores a meta-theater metaphor that let agents live beyond the actual presentation, as professional actors, enriching the interactive experience of the user with unexpected intermezzi and rehearsal periods. CrossTalk is designed as an interactive installation for public spaces, such as an exhibition, a trade fair, or a kiosk space...|$|E
