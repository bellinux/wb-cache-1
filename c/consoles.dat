5|$|The Xbox One {{has sold}} poorly in Japan, {{continuing}} {{the trend of}} Microsoft's previous <b>consoles</b> which have struggled against the local Sony and Nintendo. The Xbox One sold a total figure of 23,562 <b>consoles</b> within its launch week. By comparison, the Xbox 360 sold 62,000 <b>consoles</b> in Japan during its opening week in 2005. In the week ending June 14, 2015 the Xbox One sold just 100 <b>consoles</b> in Japan, by way of comparison, in the same week the Wii U sold 16,413 <b>consoles.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Sony boasted in {{a company}} release video that the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita sold a {{combined}} total of 100 million units.

5|$|Sega {{was one of}} {{the primary}} {{competitors}} to Nintendo in the video game console industry. A few of Sega's early <b>consoles</b> outsold their competitors in specific markets, such as the Master System in Europe. Several of the company's later <b>consoles</b> were commercial failures, however, and the financial losses incurred from the Dreamcast console caused the company to restructure itself in 2001. As a result, Sega ceased to manufacture <b>consoles</b> and became a third-party video game developer. The only console that Sega has produced since is the educational toy console Advanced Pico Beena in 2005. Third-party variants of Sega <b>consoles</b> have been produced by licensed manufacturers, even after production of the original <b>consoles</b> had ended. Many of these variants have been produced in Brazil, where versions of the Master System and Genesis are still sold and games for them are still developed.|$|E

5|$|All three <b>consoles</b> provide titles {{from older}} <b>consoles</b> for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's {{internal}} memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for backwards compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of backwards compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation <b>consoles</b> and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E

5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, Retro Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales success that brought Nintendo into the North American market. Most Donkey Kong games have either been arcade games or released for Nintendo <b>consoles</b> and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to {{the current generation of}} video game <b>consoles.</b> However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home <b>consoles</b> and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Home Pong was {{an instant}} success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on the}} home console's success, many of which continued to produce new <b>consoles</b> and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselvesâ€”they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong <b>consoles</b> and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong <b>consoles</b> are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun <b>consoles</b> are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} {{news that}} PlayStation 3 <b>consoles</b> {{would be used}} as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 <b>consoles</b> in racks. Each server is able to support 32 players. The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as volumetric clouds.|$|E
50|$|A second {{generation}} V.Smile <b>console</b> {{was launched in}} 2007. The <b>console</b> is now bundled with a microphone, and a redesigned controller was shipped, which now comes with a graphics tablet built in. However, {{the design of the}} <b>console</b> is still the same as the first generation <b>console</b> apart from the presence of a microphone holder. The internals of the system also appears to be based upon the design of the first generation <b>console,</b> as software meant for the first generation <b>console</b> is playable on the {{second generation}} <b>console,</b> and vice versa, although software that takes advantage of the microphone feature will disable the sections of the software that requires the use of the microphone if played on the first generation <b>console.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{innovation}} was the [...] "Flip-Fold" [...] center <b>console</b> on cars {{not equipped}} with a standard floor <b>console.</b> It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could {{be transformed into a}} <b>console,</b> reducing the seating count by one. The seat cushion folded out into a <b>console</b> with a lockable storage bin and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center <b>console</b> with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold <b>console.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{traditional}} organ <b>console</b> was {{not adequate}} {{to control a}} theatre organ, as {{the large number of}} draw knobs required made the <b>console</b> so huge an organist could not possibly reach all of them while playing. Thus, the horseshoe <b>console</b> was born. Based on a curved French <b>console</b> design and using stop tabs instead of drawknobs, the horseshoe <b>console</b> now allowed the organist to reach any stop or control while playing any piece of music, eliminating the need to move around awkwardly on the bench. The smaller stop tabs also permitted the addition of many more stops on the <b>console</b> than could be added on a traditional <b>console.</b>|$|R

5|$|The X-Men are {{a fictional}} superhero team in Marvel Comics' Marvel Universe. The group debuted in 1963 in an eponymous comic book series.

An earlier game was planned for home computers in 1985, but the developer {{went out of}} business before its launch. The first games were released on 8-bit home platforms, and the series expanded onto handheld <b>consoles</b> and arcades in the early 1990s. Most X-Men games, especially those released in the 2000s, were released on several platforms. Several companies have developed entries in the franchise, including Paragon Software, Software Creations, Konami, and Capcom. The titles are action games that pit the X-Men against Marvel supervillains, typically taking the form of beat 'em up and fighting games. Each game features different groupings of X-Men heroes and villains, and typically allows players to control multiple characters.|$|E
