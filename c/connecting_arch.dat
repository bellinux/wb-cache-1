50|$|What {{visitors}} see nowadays, {{is these}} two outside-oriented side towers and its <b>connecting</b> <b>arch,</b> with only little resemblance {{of the late}} medieval originals. The eventual old gates {{used to be a}} lot narrower and even lower than what is on display now:To reach the necessary improvements in the accessibility of a fast-growing metropolis of the industrial ages, above all considering exploding private traffic and increasing modern public transport (coaches, horse drawn and electrical tramways!), from the late 18th to the early 20th centuries gate tower passages were gradually extended - both in width and height - and sometimes even side walls had to be broken through.|$|E

50|$|The complex {{layout of}} the {{building}} includes a sequence of three <b>connected</b> <b>arched</b> courtyards leading from Rubinstein Street to the embankment of the Fontanka River. The facades of the three main courtyards are decorated as carefully as {{the front of the}} building (although {{on either side of the}} building are less decorated courtyards into which the back doors of the apartments open). The facades use hewed limestone, brick, and stucco.|$|R

50|$|Piers in {{the eastern}} part of the chancel are {{finished}} in about half of the wall above the ground. There is a music gallery on the western side of the church.

50|$|One {{well-known}} court {{house in}} Canada is the Romanesque Revival (Neo-Romanesque) Old City Hall in Toronto, Ontario. Designed by E.J. Lennox, Old City Hall {{was completed in}} 1899 and has been functioning as a municipal building ever since. It was originally constructed to facilitate Toronto’s City Council, legal and municipal offices and the city's courts however following {{the construction of the}} fourth city hall (adjacent to the third, on Queen Street) the building's purpose was limited to being solely a courthouse for the Ontario Court of Justice. This building can be described as Romanesque Revival due to multiple characteristics it shares with Romanesque architecture (despite being constructed seven centuries later in a completely different continent). These characteristics include the materiality in terms of large stone construction, the repetitive rhythmic use of windows containing various sized arches and barrel vaults directing attention towards them, decorated spandrels (wall section <b>connecting</b> <b>arches)</b> and the inclusion of gabled walls (pointed sections). Old City Hall has been designated a National Historical Site since 1989.|$|R
50|$|The deck is <b>connected</b> to the <b>arch</b> by 12 {{pairs of}} {{vertical}} hangers at the arches and the deck intersection point, 60 m from {{the centre of}} the bridge, rigidly joined by a cross brace.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Carlos Fernandez Casado, {{the bridge}} has a main span of 91.2 metres in a Lohse Arch, with {{the peaks of}} the twin <b>arches</b> <b>connected</b> at the crown. These brace one another, {{resulting}} in greater structural rigidity. The deck is <b>connected</b> to the <b>arches</b> with vertical members, which splay outwards at an increasing angle towards {{the centre of the}} span. The sweeping arches are decorated with coloured Philips Color Kinetics LED lighting, while the deck is illuminated with white downlighting. Pedestrians are protected from the prevailing winds by glass sides, coloured blue at foot level and tapering in, following the angle of the arches.|$|R
25|$|The Romanesque round church (charola, rotunda) {{was built}} {{in the second half of}} the 12th century by the Knights Templar, as a 16-side {{polygonal}} structure, with strong buttresses, round windows and a bell-tower. Inside, the round church has a central, octagonal structure, <b>connected</b> by <b>arches</b> to a surrounding gallery (ambulatory). The general shape of the church is modelled after similar round structures in Jerusalem: the Mosque of Omar and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.|$|R
50|$|A Cross brace is the {{cross-beam}} <b>connecting</b> between <b>arches</b> that {{is meant}} to add rigidity {{to the construction of}} mining tunnels. It is often tubular, having a diameter (generally made of lengths of pipes), and modified on the ends with clips or apertures for screw fastening; it serves as a stiffening element for the stability of a design. This brace could also be an ordinary cross-section wooden cross-beam, or even a board.|$|R

40|$|Micro/nano-electromechanical {{resonator}} based mechanical computing {{has recently}} attracted significant attention. This paper reports a realization of a 2 : 1 MUX, a concatenable digital logic element, based on electrothermal frequency tuning of electrically <b>connected</b> multiple <b>arch</b> resonators. Toward this, shallow arch shaped microresonators are electrically connected and their resonance frequencies are tuned {{based on an}} electrothermal frequency modulation scheme. This study demonstrates that by reconfiguring the same basic building block, the arch microresonator, complex logic circuits can be realized...|$|R
50|$|The façade is {{preceded by}} a narthex to which was once annexed the 7th century baptistry, only traces of which remain. On its side is the martyrion, {{dedicated}} to Santa Fosca. The bell tower dates from the 11th century. Also annexed was in origin the Bishop's Palace. The façade has 12 semi-columns <b>connected</b> by <b>arches</b> at the tops. The narthex (11th century) was enlarged in the 13th century. In the middle is the marble portal (1000).|$|R
50|$|All the second-story windows had round <b>arches</b> <b>connected</b> by molded brick stringcourses on {{the south}} (front) and side elevations. Atop them ran another stringcourse, with panels set {{between it and the}} third-story windows. They were topped in {{segmental}} <b>arches</b> <b>connected</b> by another stringcourse, and topped by panels with no top course. On the fourth story the central window had a rounded arch topped by a pediment that protruded into the paneled brick frieze. Another stringcourse connected its sill to those on the flanking windows, rectangular with flat lintels. All windows were set with one-over-one double-hung sash. At the roof there was a parapet with a small pediment in the center. On either side, and at the corner, were finials.|$|R

60|$|There is {{one more}} very curious {{circumstance}} illustrative of the Venetian desire to obtain horizontal pressure. In all the Gothic staircases with which I am acquainted, out of Venice, in which vertical shafts are used to support an inclined line, those shafts are <b>connected</b> by <b>arches</b> rising each above the other, with a little bracket above the capitals, on the side where {{it is necessary to}} raise the arch; or else, though less gracefully, with a longer curve to the lowest side of the arch.|$|R
