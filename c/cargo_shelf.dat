2500|$|The PT Cruiser {{is noted}} for its {{exterior}} design reminiscent of 1930s styling, executed by Bryan Nesbitt, and its interior design featuring a high-roof, high h-point seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations [...] a multi-level <b>cargo</b> <b>shelf</b> as well as fold, tumble and removable rear seating.|$|E
5000|$|DX: The more {{powerful}} DX, with a [...] 1.5 L D15B7 engine, manual passenger side mirror (after '92), tilt steering, intermittent wipers, side mouldings, rear wiper/washer, and rear <b>cargo</b> <b>shelf</b> as standard equipment. Despite the higher hp powerplant, the DX returns real-world mileage of 38 city / 45 hwy.|$|E

50|$|Today {{only one}} Finnish bus operator, the Rovaniemi-based Gold Line (subsidiary of Koiviston Auto), use modern type brucks with tail lift in route traffic. However some other {{operators}} also use {{buses and coaches}} where the rearmost metre or two is a walk-in <b>cargo</b> compartment with <b>shelves.</b> This compartment can be entered by a large door either on the door side or from the rear side.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the rear}} rows of seating was by a large passenger-side sliding door {{enabling}} easy access in confined situations, e.g., parking. Because only one sliding door was offered, the smaller 2nd row bench seat was shifted to the driver's side of the van, facilitating passenger access to the 3rd row seat. To facilitate variable cargo storage behind the rear seat, the seat could be adjusted forward in 2 increments, {{the first of which}} removed roughly 6 in of legroom from the back row passengers, and the second of which would push the bench {{all the way to the}} back of the 2nd row, making the seats unusable. The seat back of the rear bench could also be folded forward, providing a flat <b>cargo</b> <b>shelf.</b> The smaller 2nd row bench was not adjustable, nor foldable; it could only be removed entirely.|$|E
50|$|The design effort went slowly, {{due to the}} {{concentration}} on the design and development of items to meet the requirement of the Vietnam War, although developers initiated projects investigating the feasibility of replacing much of the steel and brass hardware with aluminum or plastic items. On 15 March 1967, an Engineering Concept Review was held at Natick Laboratories. The concept approved at the meeting was for an individual equipment belt to be supported by individual equipment suspenders, to which could be attached component items such as small arms ammunition cases, water canteen covers, entrenching tool carriers, field first aid dressing cases, etc. A field pack somewhat larger than the M-1961 cotton canvas duck field pack was proposed which could be attached for carrying either on the individual equipment belt at the small of the back, or on the shoulders attached to the individual equipment belt suspenders, or attached to a detachable field pack frame. The field pack frame with shoulder straps and a removable <b>cargo</b> <b>shelf</b> would be designed to be worn over the individual equipment belt and suspenders. The end result of this meeting was {{the adoption of the}} nylon M-1967 Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment (MLCE). The field pack design was rejected in the end and a nylon version of the M-1961 field pack was produced instead along with the nylon Tropical Rucksack (FSN 8465-935-6673).|$|E
