5|$|Fishing {{regulations}} include catch {{limits and}} gear restrictions to prevent {{damage to the}} species habitat and population. There are different gear restrictions for commercial and recreational fishers. In 2007, regulations were imposed to reduce the harvesting by one third, {{as a response to}} overfishing in the South Atlantic. The South Atlantic <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> was later increased in October 2012 {{as a response to the}} increased population. The 2013 limits in the southern U.S. Atlantic waters for the species, measured in gutted weight, is currently 405,971 pounds for longline and 135,324 pounds for hook-and-line fishing.|$|E
5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly hunted sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly hunted by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly hunted by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E

50|$|For the New Zealand {{orange roughy}} fisheries, {{productivity}} parameters and resulting estimates of unfished biomass were incorrectly estimated {{in the first}} decade of the fishery. <b>Catch</b> <b>limits</b> exceeded recommended estimates of sustainable yields for a subsequent decade and catches were estimated to have exceeded those <b>catch</b> <b>limits</b> due to burst nets, escape windows in nets, and lost gear.Catch limits were reduced in the mid-1990s, although they were increased again following indications that stocks had begun to rebuild. This was later found not to be the case and a number of fisheries were closed completely or had <b>catch</b> <b>limits</b> reduced to 1 tonne to allow the stocks to rebuild.|$|R
5|$|Whaling {{decreased}} substantially after 1946 when, {{in response}} to the steep decline in whale populations, the International Whaling Commission placed a moratorium which set a <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> for each country; this excluded aboriginal groups up until 2004. As of 2015, aboriginal communities are allowed to take 280 bowhead whales off Alaska and two from the western coast of Greenland, 620 grey whales off Washington state, three common minke whales off the eastern coast of Greenland and 178 on their western coast, 10 fin whales from the west coast of Greenland, nine humpback whales from the west coast of Greenland and 20 off St. Vincent and the Grenadines each year. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, grey whales may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting, but the North Atlantic population is functionally extinct. Conversely, the North Atlantic right whale was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched across the North Atlantic, and only remains in small fragments along the coast of Canada, Greenland, and is considered functionally extinct along the European coastline.|$|E

In Canada, fishing for E. pacifica {{takes place in}} the Strait of Georgia off British Columbia; there is a government-imposed <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> of 500 tonnes per year. Fisheries targeting the Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica), a medium-sized krill reaching body lengths of more than , as well as Tysanoessa raschii (2cm) and T. inermis in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the Scotian Shelf have been proposed, but didn't get beyond early experimental stages. They are limited to harvesting a few hundred tonnes of krill per year, and Nicol & Foster consider it unlikely that any new large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to the opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.|$|E
2500|$|Black abalone have {{dramatically}} declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas. [...] This decline was initiated by overfishing. [...] Following World War II, the California abalone fishery was not managed for individual species. [...] Therefore, {{it resulted in}} a systematic depletion of various abalone species as the fishery over-harvested one species and {{then moved on to}} the next in an attempt to meet demand. [...] Black abalone were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of abalones caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a total allowable <b>catch</b> <b>limit</b> for black abalones. Even though harvesting black abalone is [...] regulated in California, poaching still occurs. Other threats include coastal development for residential areas, harbours and waste discharges, compounded by commercial and recreational fishing of the black abalone.|$|E
