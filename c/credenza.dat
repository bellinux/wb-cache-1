25|$|Inside, Ruetten found Rasmussen dead on {{the living}} room floor, shot three times. There were signs of a struggle, such as a {{porcelain}} vase that had apparently been broken over Rasmussen's head prior to the shooting, a bloody handprint next to the burglar alarm's panic button, and a toppled <b>credenza.</b> It appeared that someone had bound her wrists, or tried to, at some point. She had defensive wounds and bore a bruise on her face that appeared to have been inflicted by the muzzle of a gun. The gun had been fired through a quilt, apparently to muffle the sound. The investigating criminalist also observed a bite mark on Rasmussen's arm, and took a swab from it.|$|E

25|$|By 1633, {{housing to}} the rear of the sacristy had been constructed, using wood and {{recycled}} elements from Furnas; they built a corridor and five cells that accommodated the brothers and two priests. The house of the original hermit and other dependencies were transformed into a pantry and refectory. Meanwhile, towards the coast they built a kitchen and other spaces. When completed, on 17 November 1633, the blessed sacrament from Furnas, which was saved from the fires, was placed on the altar of Nossa Senhora da Conceição; flanking the tabernacle, the clergy placed the images of Nossa Senhora da Conceição (from the hermitage) and Nossa Senhora da Consolação (also brought from the Furnas Valley). Meanwhile, the brothers constructed two niches over the altar, and placed images of Saint Peter and Mary Magadalene, while in smaller niches other saints and crucifixes were placed. The following year the body of Father Diogo da Madre de Deus of Furnas was brought from the Vale de Cabaços, and buried in a tomb within the chancel. But, by the end of December, the chamber was reopened and the bones were deposited in a stone box and placed to the right of the altar's <b>credenza.</b> In 1635, an image of Nossa Senhora das Dores was already located in the presbytery.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>credenza</b> desk (often simply, <b>credenza)</b> is {{a modern}} desk form usually placed next to a wall as a {{secondary}} work surface to that of another desk, such as a pedestal desk, in a typical executive office. When used as an active work surface, the <b>credenza</b> desk is often placed against the wall immediately behind or perpendicular to the main desk, but close enough that the user can reach it from the seated position at the main desk by simply swivelling and wheeling their office chair over to it. When its planned use is to be less frequent, such as holding books or files which are not regularly referenced, or {{to act as an}} extra surface to help facilitate larger meetings, <b>credenza</b> desks are often placed on a wall in some other location of the office, such as adjacent to a conference table if one is present. Many conference rooms which have meeting tables but not desks will also have a <b>credenza</b> desk against one wall. The <b>credenza</b> desk is sometimes flat, like a pedestal desk, {{but more often than not}} it has a stack of shelves, small drawers and other nooks, above its main working surface. The sum of these overhead amenities is usually called a hutch. Hence, the <b>credenza</b> desk is often called a [...] "credenza with hutch".|$|E

5000|$|All the bibliographic {{works are}} in the best {{condition}} since the building is a perfect vault, with a stable environment, throughout the year, from summer to winter. The building was conceived as a library house constructed with exterior walls between 2 - 11 cm thick. The door of the [...] "vault" [...] is constructed of teak, that permits the space maintain a constant temperature of 18 - 20 C. To maintain this stable environment the humidity hovers around 60%, thereby conditioning the wood interior. In addition to issues of humidity and temperature, the stacks are affected by another [...] "enemy": papirófagos, insects that survive on paper. But, the structure is protected by being constructed of oak woods, that, in addition to its dense nature (which makes it difficult for wood penetration, elicits an odor that is repellent to these insects. The books are also protected by a small colony of bats, that during the night consume the insects that appear, eliminating the pest and assisting the maintenance of the stacks. Naturally, these mammals require additional care in order to prevent damage to the grains of the wooden furniture. Nightly, functionaries cover the [...] "bufets" [...] (<b>credenzas)</b> with leather towels, and in the morning, the library is cleaned.|$|R
40|$|Modular systems {{furniture}} is tangible personal property, {{whether or not}} affixed to realty. A contract to sell and install modular systems {{furniture is}} a contract {{for the sale of}} tangible personal property and is not a construction contract. Persons who contract to sell and install modular systems furniture are retailers of the items which they sell and install, and tax applies to the entire contract price less those charges excludable from gross receipts or sales price pursuant to sections 6011 and 6012 of the Revenue and Taxation Code. Retailers who claim a deduction for such charges should maintain complete and detailed records to support the amounts claimed. Such records should include, but not be limited to, a separate accounting of charges for installation labor, such as labor to affix, bolt, fasten, or hardwire panels to realty and labor to fasten or affix fully constructed components to fully constructed panel systems or other components. Charges for fabrication labor, such as labor to attach, assemble, connect, construct, or fabricate panel systems or components, labor to attach or connect one panel to another to form workstations or cubicles, and labor to construct or fabricate the individual panels, components, or accessories are subject to tax. For contracts to sell and install modular systems entered into on or after October 1, 1999, ten percent (10 %) of the total contract price, excluding charges attributable to freestanding desks, <b>credenzas,</b> lateral files, bookcases, worktables, returns, convergents, corner units, storage towers, chairs, footrests, and other property not attached to panels, other components, or realty, but including all other charges, will be presumed to be a charge for labor to install or apply the property sold. Retailers may claim the ten percent (10 %) labor deduction in lieu of separately accounting for the actual installation charges incurred...|$|R
