40|$|The ITER Diagnostic Division is {{responsible}} for designing and procuring the First Wall Blankets that are mounted on the vacuum vessel port plugs at both the upper and equatorial levels This paper will discuss {{the effects of the}} diagnostic aperture shape and configuration on the coolant circuit design. The DFW design is driven in large part by the need to conform the <b>coolant</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{to a wide variety of}} diagnostic apertures combined with the more severe heating conditions at the surface facing the plasma, the first wall. At the first wall, a radiant heat flux of 35 W/cm 2 combines with approximate peak volumetric heating rates of 8 W/cm 3 (equatorial ports) and 5 W/cm 3 (upper ports). Here at the FW, a fast thermal response is desirable and leads to a thin element between the heat flux and coolant. This requirement is opposed by the wish for a thicker FW element to accommodate surface erosion and other off-normal plasma events...|$|E
40|$|From a {{structural}} {{point of view}} a liquid coolant type nuclear reactor consists of a heavy steel vessel containing the core and related mechanical components and filled with a hot fluid. This vessel is protected from the severe environment of the core by a shielding structure, the thermal liner, which is usually a relatively thin steel cylinder concentric with the reactor vessel and separated from it by a gap filled with the <b>coolant</b> fluid. This <b>arrangement</b> leads to a potential vibration problem if the fundamental frequency, {{or one of the}} higher natural vibration frequencies, of this liner system is close to the frequency of some vibration source present in the reactor vessel. The shell rigidly clamped at its base and free at the top was investigated since it is a better description of the conditions encountered in typical reactor designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{film cooling}} {{effectiveness}} and local {{heat transfer coefficient}} for <b>coolant</b> jet holes, <b>arrangement,</b> orientation, and inclination angle have been investigated. The tests were carried out using a single test transient IR thermography technique. Evaluation of the cooling performance is obtained by estimated both film cooling effectiveness and heat flux ratios. Two <b>arrangements</b> of <b>coolant</b> jet holes were tested; one is inline holes {{and the other is}} staggered holes. Three blowing ratios of (BR = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5) were used. In order to predict the flow behavior at the holes region, numerical solutions were introduced. It was found that the interaction and diffusion of the coolant air with hot stream present moderate film temperature beyond the downstream row; this flow is mixed with the coming counter vortex pair from downstream row improved the film cooling effectiveness. Experimentally, staggered <b>arrangement</b> gives better <b>coolant</b> performance than that of inline arrangement. The investigation also showed that using the upstream staggered oriented jet over conventional single jet enhanced the average cooling performance by 20. 7 %, 28. 9 %, and 37. 8 % for BR = 0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{blankets}} are {{key components}} of fusion power plants and determine {{to a large degree}} their attractiveness. There is a large range of possible blanket concepts, characterized by breeding material, structural material, <b>coolant,</b> and geometrical <b>arrangement.</b> On one extreme side there are concepts requiring only a modest extrapolation of the present technology, but with limited attractiveness. On the other side there are concepts with the potential for very attractive plants, but involving a considerable development risk. Therefore, the selection of blanket concepts depends on the overall strategy for fusion power plant development. To ensure sufficient support over the long development time, it has to be shown in a credible way, that (a) there are feasible blanket concepts for fusion power plants which can be developed with a high confidence of success, and (b) the final product will be an attractive power plant which can be operated safely, with minimum impact on the environment, and at an acceptable cost of electricity. This requires an evaluation of the entire range of blanket concepts, starting from near term solutions and reaching up to very advanced designs with a potential for exceptionally high performance. Typical examples of candidate blanket concepts are compared in this study. The blanket development strategy developed in the EU is described as an example...|$|R
