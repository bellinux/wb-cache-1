50|$|The {{cause of}} the fire was traced to a short circuit on Train No. 117. The <b>collector</b> <b>shoe</b> {{assemblies}} on the number five and six cars broke after striking a line switchbox cover which had fallen off a prior train (Train No. 363), resulting in a short circuit and fire.|$|E

5000|$|Five Z 800 105-seater {{electric}} multiple units, {{delivered in}} 1997 (???) by ADTranz and Vevey Technologies, {{in the context}} of a joint purchase with the Ligne de Saint Gervais - Vallorcine. This 1000 kW stock, composed of two motorcars, could run at 70 km/h; it is equipped with a rack and pinion system and pantographs (in addition to the third rail <b>collector</b> <b>shoe),</b> so that it could perform direct runs to Vallorcine and beyond without the need to change trains.|$|E
5000|$|Most EMUs {{had one of}} two {{incompatible}} {{forms of}} electric traction equipment: 750 volts DC (direct current) or 25,000 volts AC (alternating current). The Class 313 and 319 units were equipped for both, although only the latter operated journeys which included both systems. Units equipped for DC traction collected electrical current from a third rail using a <b>collector</b> <b>shoe</b> attached to their bogies, which were in turn connected to traction motors (mostly built in the 1950s, even those used on newer stock). AC-powered EMUs collected power from overhead lines using a pantograph. [...] Standard across NSE's fleet were electropneumatic brakes and either semi-automatic Buckeye couplers or (on some later units) fully automatic couplers.|$|E
40|$|A {{constructional}} point solved in this dissertation work is {{a collector}} system of a trolleybus which is connected with a pneumatic drive. This work was essentially divided into four parts. 1. Optimization of the collector system of the trolleybus with respect of static forces. In this part the pressure force between a <b>collector</b> <b>shoe</b> and a wires of line was made constant {{by means of the}} proper drive (combination of the pneumatic drive + springs) and optimized dimensions of the whole mechanism. A prospect of the automatic drive was also reasoned about. 2. Optimization of the collector system of the trolleybus with respect of dynamic forces. An effect of dynamic forces on right working of the machinery and indication of proper to damp this negative effects through FEM where reasoned about in this chapter. 3.

25|$|On 17 December 2011, {{a similar}} fault caused a 7-hour {{disruption}} between Ang Mo Kio and Marina Bay stations. According to SMRT, the disruption {{was caused by}} damage to the third rail and the trains' <b>collector</b> <b>shoes.</b> Seven trains were damaged in this incident.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{finite element}} simulation, the {{temperature}} field {{model for the}} frictional pair of third rail and <b>collector</b> <b>shoe</b> under the coupling of contact resistor thermal and friction thermal was established. The method of coupling the two kinds of thermal was given in detail, the temperature field was calculated, and the maximum coupled temperature changing under different electric current, velocity, and displacement of the model was studied. The {{results show that the}} temperature raising effect of friction thermal and contact resistor thermal is different. In the process of mechanical friction without electric current, the highest temperature is in the contact center line, the temperature distribution expands around the contact zone in descending tendency. But in couple condition, the temperature distribution with electric current expands around the contact point in descending tendency. In the two conditions, the temperature gradients are all becoming smaller. The maximum coupled temperature increases with the increasing of the electric current, and decreases with the increasing of the velocity under the constant displacement and normal force. The maximum coupled temperature increases linearly with the increasing of displacement under constant electric current, velocity and normal force...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the finite}} element {{software}} COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 b, a temperature field model for an aluminium/stainless steel composite third rail and a copper impregnated carbon <b>collector</b> <b>shoe</b> contact with coupling of joule heat and friction heat was established. A method of coupling the {{two kinds of}} heat was developed, the temperature fields were calculated, and the maximum coupled temperature change under different electric current, normal forces, sliding velocities and sliding distances were studied. The {{results show that the}} temperature distribution expands around the contact area in a descending tendency at positions closer to the electric contact area and the temperature gradients are higher; the maximum coupled temperature increases with an increase of electric current; with an increase of normal force, the maximum coupled temperature initially decreases then increases; the maximum coupled temperature increases initially then gradually becomes stable with an increase of sliding distance; an optimal normal force range exists in frictional sliding with an electric current, at which the maximum coupled temperature is at its lowest; joule heat and friction heat are competitive with each other. When normal force is lower, the joule heat becomes the main heat source, but when normal force is greater, mechanical friction heat becomes the main heat source...|$|E

50|$|This {{station was}} part of the series of 2011 MRT train {{disruptions}} on 15 and 17 December 2011, caused by a misalignment between the trains' current <b>collector</b> <b>shoes,</b> which collect power from the third rail, and the third rail itself. These were Singapore's two largest MRT disruptions at the time of occurrence.|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{gathered}} in the normal manner of <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> which ran {{along the top of}} the third rail. There are two shoes mounted on either side of each bogie which could be retracted when not in use to avoid damage as they were prone to drop out of gauge slightly when not under pressure.|$|R
50|$|A further {{member of}} the class; 33115, {{was used as a}} dead-load test before the {{introduction}} of Eurostar trains running on Southern tracks into Waterloo, with running number 83301. Having been fitted with Eurostar bogies (complete with electric 3rd rail <b>collector</b> <b>shoes),</b> it formed part of a test train where its through-wiring for push-pull work was necessary for the completion of tests.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the Shildon-Newport scheme, Raven set about {{planning}} the electrification of the main line from York to Newcastle, also at 1500 volts DC. Both third rail and overhead power supply systems were considered and some experiments were done with dummy <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> fitted to the bogie of a steam locomotive to assess the mechanical performance at speed. In the end, the overhead system was selected.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of September 27, 2016, a track fault {{resulted}} in the damage of the <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> on 15 train cars. This resulted in multiple delays and disruptions across the entire network and the damaged <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> further damaged the entire network's tracks. During the morning peak of the following day (September 28, 2016), the already damaged track resulted in further disruptions 4 hours after train service started. When the trains did arrive the stations, more problems occurred, including stalled trains, smoke, and stuck doors that staff had to open manually. With damaged tracks {{and half of the}} usual fleet running, the delays were more severe than previous cases this year (2016). Later in the afternoon, SMRT announced on social media, Facebook and Twitter, stating that only Service B is available and no train service towards Choa Chu Kang Station. However, they announced again that train service has been temporarily suspended as engineers were carrying out maintenance and repair works. Train service fully resumes at 5:45pm with only half of the usual fleet operating.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} was two motor coaches with {{a driving}} compartment and [...] "brake" [...] compartment at the outer ends, with a trailer between them. The outer bogie {{at each end}} of the unit was a motor bogie fitted with two axle-hung traction motors rated at 275 hp (205 kW). A bus line ran along the roof of the unit connecting all the current <b>collector</b> <b>shoes,</b> and if two units were coupled, connected the entire train.|$|R

50|$|On 14 November 2007, Eurostar's {{passenger}} {{operations were}} transferred to St Pancras railway station and maintenance operations to Temple Mills depot making the 750 VDC third rail collection equipment redundant and leading to its removal from the fleet. All speed limits on the English Eurostar lines are posted in km/h and the lineside signs on non high speed sections are white numerals on a black background (instead of the UK standard black numerals on a white background) as a reminder. The trains themselves are no longer fitted with a speedometer capable of indicating in miles per hour (the indication used to change automatically when the <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> were deployed).|$|R
50|$|In the Manchester area, the L&YR Bury {{line was}} first {{electrified}} with overhead wires (1913), then changed to third rail (1917; see also Railway electrification in Great Britain) {{and then back}} again in 1992 to overhead wires {{in the course of}} its adaptation for the Manchester Metrolink. Trams in city centre streets, carrying <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> projecting from their bogies, were considered too dangerous for pedestrians and motor traffic to attempt dual-mode technology (in Amsterdam and Rotterdam Sneltram vehicles go out to surface in suburbs, not in busy central areas). The same thing happened to the West Croydon - Wimbledon Line in Greater London (originally electrified by the Southern Railway) when Tramlink was opened in 2000.|$|R
50|$|The {{company also}} {{supplied}} vehicles for the London Underground. In August 1905, they delivered two battery-electric locomotives, which {{were used for}} the construction of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, and subsequently for the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway. They were 50.5 ft long, with a cab at both ends and a compartment behind one of the cabs, which housed braking and traction control equipment. 80 batteries, arranged as two rows of 40, occupied the central section of the vehicle, which was lower than the cabs. Chloride Electrical Storage Company supplied the batteries, which had to be charged at charging stations. The vehicles weighed 55 tons, and were not fitted with current <b>collector</b> <b>shoes,</b> since none of the rails were electrified during construction.|$|R

5000|$|The {{traction}} motors by Siemens were series-wound [...] gearless motors on the axles. The trains ran in a formation of four cars, the two outer vehicles being motor coaches. The motor cars were constructed to allow an early form of multiple unit operation {{and the front}} car's controller was additionally {{able to control the}} rear car's motors. The two motors at each end were connected in series at starting, then reconnected in parallel (using open circuit transition) as the train accelerated in the well established (at that time) method. This required eight cables to be run the length of the train at roof level. A further cable making nine in all linked the <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> at opposite ends of the four-car set to avoid problems with the large gaps in the centrally mounted conductor rail.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{railways}} with third rails, {{or fourth}} rails, in tunnels carry <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> projecting laterally (sideways), or vertically, from their bogies. The contact shoe may slide {{on top of}} the third rail (top running), on the bottom (bottom running) or on the side (side running). The side running contact shoe is used against the guide bars on rubber-tired metros. A vertical contact shoe is used on ground-level power supply systems, stud contact systems and fourth rail systems. A pair of contact shoes was used on underground current collection systems. The contact shoe on a stud contact system is called a ski collector. The ski collector moves vertically to accommodate slight variations in the height of the studs. Contact shoes may also be used on overhead conductor rails, on guide bars or on trolley wires. Most railways use three rails, while the London Underground uses four rails.|$|R
50|$|The {{first two}} battery {{locomotives}} supplied for the London Underground were manufactured by Hurst Nelson and Co Ltd, who were based in Motherwell. They were delivered in August 1905, and were {{used during the}} construction of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, where they were numbered 1B and 2B. The vehicles were 50.5 ft long, with a tube-gauge cab at both ends. Braking and electrical control equipment was housed in a compartment behind one of the cabs, and the central section was lower, housing the 80 batteries, arranged in two rows of 40 either side of a central divide, which also supported metal covers for the battery compartments. The batteries were supplied by Chloride Electrical Storage Company. Each locomotive weighed 55 tons, and could haul a 60-ton load at 7 km/h. They were not fitted with current <b>collector</b> <b>shoes,</b> as none of the rails were electrified during construction. Once their task was completed, they were moved by road to the Hampstead Railway.|$|R
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the {{traction}} current circuits of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to voltage drops caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains move {{in and out of the}} sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where conductor rails cannot be separated by a good distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> for this exact reason.|$|R
50|$|Encouraged by the {{performance}} of the vehicles, the District Railway purchased two of their own in 1909, which were larger as they were built to subsurface-gauge. The manufacturer was W. R. Renshaw and Co Ltd, who were based in Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, and the vehicles were fitted with current <b>collector</b> <b>shoes,</b> so that they could draw power from the rails when it was available. During the First World War, they were used as shunting engines at Ealing Common Depot, where power was always available, and so the batteries were removed, and subsequently neglected. New batteries could not be obtained, as batteries of this type were needed for submarines as part of the war effort. The vehicles were numbered 19A and 20A when supplied, but were renumbered as L8 and L9 in 1929, when the batteries were no longer fitted. As electric locomotives, they were upgraded several times, receiving two new types of motors in 1951 and 1955, and new traction control equipment in 1958. They continued to be used to move stores between Acton Works and Ealing Common Depot, until they were superseded by road vehicles in 1969.|$|R
50|$|William (Boy) Habraken is a <b>shoe</b> <b>collector</b> who {{resides in}} the Netherlands. His {{collection}} is housed in the SONS Museum in Kruishouten, Belgium. In 2006 the Guinness Book of World Records recognized him as having the largest ethnographical shoe collection in the world.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{they have}} one or more {{spring-loaded}} arms that press a <b>collector</b> or contact <b>shoe</b> against the rail or overhead wire. As the vehicle moves, the contact shoe slides along the wire or rail to draw the electricity needed to run the vehicle's motor.|$|R
25|$|In 1968, {{due to a}} {{shortage}} of suitable stock for the Bournemouth electrification scheme, BR formed an eight-carriage 8Vab unit, no. 8001. The unit was formed of carriages from three standard sets, nos. 7739/41/42, plus a conventional locomotive-hauled buffet carriage. Three MBSOs were required within the make-up as the standard 'TRB' was not through-wired for traction power distribution. In view of this the two MBSOs in the five-car portion had <b>collector</b> <b>shoes</b> fitted to one bogie on each. The unit worked on occasions with a 4-TC; this usually had a Class 33 attached to provide ETH and train lighting. in the TC unit as the 8-VAB was not fitted with ETH jumper cables on the unit ends. Its normal running formation was with another 4-VEP to make a 12-car set. The 'TRB' vehicle retained its gas-powered appliances so, unlike 4-REP buffet cars, was able to provide hot food and beverages while on diversions away from third-rail areas. Adjacent MBSO 62203 had most of its doors locked out of use and tables fitted across them for the service of meals on a 2-and-2 basis (across seats intended for five persons normally); this vehicle also had most of its luggage racks removed. The unit was later reclassified as Class 480 following the introduction of TOPS.|$|R
