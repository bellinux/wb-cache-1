5|$|Altrincham {{today is}} an {{affluent}} <b>commuter</b> <b>town,</b> {{partly because of}} its transport links. The town has a strong middle class presence; {{there has been a}} steady increase in Altrincham's middle classes since the 19th century. It is also home to Altrincham F.C. and three ice hockey clubs, Manchester Storm, Altrincham Aces and Trafford Tornados.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{draining}} of the Fens, {{beginning in}} the 17th century and completed in the 19th century, the town's economy {{has been based on}} agriculture and related industry. Due to its proximity to Cambridge, Huntingdon and Peterborough, the town has emerged as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town.</b> The town had a population of 10,453 {{at the time of the}} United Kingdom Census 2011.|$|E
5000|$|The {{expression}} exurb (for [...] "extra-urban") {{was coined}} by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book The Exurbanites, {{to describe the}} ring of prosperous communities beyond the suburbs that are <b>commuter</b> <b>towns</b> for an urban area. Most exurbs serve as <b>commuter</b> <b>towns,</b> but most <b>commuter</b> <b>towns</b> are not exurban.|$|R

5|$|The Bridgewater Canal {{reached the}} town in 1765, {{stimulating}} Sale's urbanisation. The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale's growth as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town</b> for Manchester, leading to an influx of middle class residents; {{by the end of}} the 19th century the town's population had more than tripled. Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed.|$|E
5|$|Sale's {{urban growth}} {{resulted}} in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the Local Government Act 1929. The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935, giving Sale honorific borough status. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town,</b> supported by its proximity to the M60 motorway and the Manchester Metrolink network. Sale Water Park contains an artificial lake used for water sports. Sale FC and Sale Sharks rugby union clubs and Sale Harriers athletics club were founded in Sale, although only the first now remains in the town at their Heywood Road ground.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{reduction}} in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, {{a decision was made}} to concentrate all passenger traffic into a single station. Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated {{on the edge of the}} town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town</b> to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, near the site of the former Cromer High.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town.</b> A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details population changes since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a <b>commuter</b> <b>town.</b> Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that {{of the rest of the}} nation but was biased towards the middle classes, transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.• Retrieved on 1 August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{spoil heap}} of Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, which includes 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and marshalling yards in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a <b>commuter</b> <b>town</b> for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>commuter</b> <b>towns</b> {{increased}} in the US and the UK during the 20th century because of a trend for people {{to move out of}} the cities into the surrounding green belt. Historically, <b>commuter</b> <b>towns</b> were developed by railway companies to create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of development was the Metropolitan Railway (now part of London Underground) which marketed its Metro-land developments. This initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city London to suburbs such as Harrow and out of London itself, to commuter villages in Buckinghamshire or Hertfordshire. <b>Commuter</b> <b>towns</b> have more recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure, thus spurring the development of roads and public transportation systems. These can take the form of light rail lines extending from the city centre to new streetcar suburbs and new or expanded highways, whose construction and traffic can lead to the community becoming part of a larger conurbation.|$|R
