40|$|A {{method for}} {{fabricating}} composite structures at a low-cost, moderate-to-high production rate is disclosed. A first {{embodiment of the}} method includes employing a <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> forming fabrication process. A second embodiment of the method includes employing a pultrusion process for obtaining composite structures. The methods include coating yarns with matrix material, weaving the yarn into fabric to produce a continuous fabric supply, and feeding multiple layers of net-shaped fabrics having optimally oriented fibers into a debulking tool to form an undebulked preform. The <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> forming fabrication process includes partially debulking the preform, cutting the partially debulked preform, and debulking the partially debulked preform to form a netshape. An electron-beam or similar technique then cures the structure. The pultrusion fabric process includes feeding the undebulked preform into a heated die and gradually debulking the undebulked preform. The undebulked preform in the heated die changes dimension until a desired cross-sectional dimension is achieved. This process further includes obtaining a net-shaped infiltrated uncured preform, cutting the uncured preform to a desired length, and electron-beam curing (or similar technique) the uncured preform. These fabrication methods produce superior structures formed at higher production rates, resulting in lower cost and high structural performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{kneading}} and forming process or pasta quality have been investigated. Using the same blend of wheat flour and keeping mixing and drying conditions constant, three types of spaghetti were produced using the following three kneading and forming processes: A) kneading with a <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> and forming by pressure-extrusion; B) kneading and forming by sheeting-rolls; C) kneading by hand and forming with sheeting-rolls. These three processes impart different mechanical work on the dough. The three types of dried spaghetti exhibited differences in cooking requirements and in cooing quality. Spaghetti (A) absorbed water more slowly and showed poor cooking quality. Spaghetti (B) and (C) had a shorter cooking time, no stickiness and good firmness after cooking. Spaghetti compactness seems to control water absorption during cooking, i. e., the greater the compactness, the longer the cooking time. Nevertheless, compactness does not explain differences in cooking quality. On the contrary, this characteristic is clearly related to the different organization of proteins, as transmission and scanning electron microscopy images revealed. In fact both spaghetti (B) and (C) showed a compact and continuous protein network, probably {{as a consequence of}} the mild and ordered kneading obtained by the sheeting process. Spaghetti (A), produced by dough kneading implying strong mechanical stresses, exhibited protein network breakage which may account for its poor cooking quality. The results of the present work indicate that industrial kneading and extrusion, as performed today in the <b>continuous</b> <b>press,</b> are unsuitable for making the best use of poor quality raw materials. The pressure-extrusion process requires technological innovations which could ensure spaghetti with cooking quality comparable to that produced in the traditional sheeting process as well as high productivity...|$|E

25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and <b>continuous</b> <b>presses</b> used in wineries today.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{extraction}} from seeds {{represents an}} important {{process in the}} production of vegetable oils. The efficiency of this step can {{have an effect on the}} economic convenience of the entire production chain of vegetable oils. However, the mechanical presses used for extraction are designed following criteria based more on the experience and intuition of the operators than on rigorous analyses of the physical principles involved in the process. In this study we have tested the possibility of applying a mathematical model that reproduces oil extraction from seeds, on a laboratory type of <b>continuous</b> <b>press.</b> In other words, we have compared the results of our mathematical model with those obtained from real extractions with mechanical presses on sunflower seeds. Our model is based on determining the main operating parameters of mechanical extraction, such as temperature, pressure and compression time, and on the knowledge of some physical characteristics of the solid matrix of the seeds. The results obtained are interesting because they include the role of operating parameters involved in extraction while the application of the mathematical model studied here allows, although with potential for improvement, a mathematical instrument to be developed for optimising the sizing and the operating conditions of mechanical presses...|$|E
40|$|Babassu (Orbignya sp.) is a palm with {{extraordinary}} socioeconomic and ecologic importance found in humid tropical areas in Brazil, especially in frequently burned and degraded landscapes. There are several uses for babassu oil; however, {{its potential for}} providing other industrial products remains unexploited, {{due to the lack}} of scale and production structure.

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 A {{three-dimensional}} model based on fundamental principles to simulate heat and mass transfer and mat densification during hot pressing of wood-based composites is presented. Mechanisms {{included in the}} analysis are water vapor and air transfer by gas convection and molecular gas diffusion, conductive and convective heat transfer, and sorptive effects, as well as densification of the material and development of internal stresses. The implementation of the model enables one to simulate the local evolution of temperature, moisture content, vapor and air pressure, density and internal stresses, as well as overall heat and gas flow patterns. The model consists of a set of constitutive flux equations that are coupled by local energy and mass balances, combined with a one-dimensional rheological model. Nonlinear dependencies of the material and gas properties are accounted for. A particular modeling approach is developed and implemented to simulate the pressing process not only in batch but also in continuous presses. The numerical results of the model are in good agreement with those of experiments performed in a large-size laboratory press and an industrial <b>continuous</b> <b>press.</b> A small selection of topics important during hot pressing is given particular attention by means of model predictions. Among these are considerations of the importance of different heat transfer mechanisms and how they vary over space and time, and changes in gas composition inside the mat throughout the process. The model may be used in the future to optimize the manufacture of existing natural fiber composites and to aid in the development of new products and technology for their production...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a failure analysis performed on a component of a <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> that is a part of a process plant used to produce MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard) panels. This plant is composed of 2 counter rotating belts that are supported, internally, by small steel rollers, connected to each other by small axes. The failure occurred prematurely on rollers. These components undergo to static and dynamic stresses below the yield strength of material. Low alloyed steel is employed for the production of the rollers and the components are carburized on the external surface. The rollers present cracks on the external surface, that is in contact with the wood panels, already after few hours in service. Other components did not undergo cracking even for very long service times (about 5000. h). Both rollers that failed in service and rollers without cracks were characterized by optical and scanning electron microscopy in order to evaluate the microstructure of the components. In particular, the microstructure of the rollers was investigated on the surface and in the core of the rollers. Vickers micro-hardness measurements were employed for the characterization of the mechanical properties of the rollers. Successively, a cross section of a broken roller was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) On the same sample, after microstructural characterization, a micro-hardness profile was acquired from external surface to the core in order to evaluate possible over carburizing or oxidation phenomena. The results obtained from both the microstructural and mechanical characterization of the failed rollers indicate that the possible causes of the in service failure are related to quenching cracks or fatigue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a pressing diagram optimization based on changes in pressure, temperature and distance between frames of a <b>continuous</b> <b>press</b> during Oriented Strand Boards (OSB) pressing. Tests of selected mechanical properties were carried out on OSB/ 3 boards with a nominal thickness of 18 mm - a basic type with urea-formaldehyd (UF) glue in surface layers and isocyanate glue (PMDI) in the central layer and further an ECO type with PMDI glue in all layers produced by a prominent manufacturer of OSB boards in the Czech Republic. OSB/ 3 boards are intended for structural purposes for use in wet environments. Changes in the pressing diagram were carried out at the stage of “press opening”, which signifi cantly affects mechanical and physical properties of OSB boards. In {{order to be able to}} compare the effects of changes in the pressing curve, the same setting of production parameters was used with all tested boards. The results of laboratory tests were compared with the values given in the ČSN EN 300 Standard. Optimization of the pressing process ranks among the most effective measures to increase the quality of particle boards at zero or minimum costs. The control of production processes is increasingly perfect thanks to the development of electronics, control and computer technology. At present, not only in our country but also worldwide, marked development of wooden constructions occurs thanks to the development of new types of wood-based composite materials and to the development of technologies in building industry. OSB boards are an important representative of wood-based composite materials for wooden constructions. As compared to natural material, OSB boards show a homogenous structure not including natural defects typical of solid wood.
