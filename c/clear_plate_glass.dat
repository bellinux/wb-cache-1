40|$|The {{primary goal}} for this thesis {{experience}} {{is to examine}} the connections and correlations between two-dimensional imagery and threedimensional form. The concept for this exploration came from genuine personal interest and sensitivity for multiple materials, techniques, and the dynamics and energy they create in relation to each other and their environment. My intention was to create a total environment in which the viewer receives not just a single frame perspective of a visual image or object, but instead becomes an interactive part of the space. This need to expand my work beyond a single object or pictorial frame of painting or photograph has evolved over the years from many different personal experiences and through my observation of other artists working in non-object orientations. Two artists that I have been particularly influenced by in terms of materials and use of space are the contemporary works of the Czech glass artists Dana Zamecnikova and her husband Marion Karel. Dana 2 ̆ 7 s work successfully utilizes both image and form by creating distinct interactive relationships between the two. She paints abstract yet recognizable imagery of people and animals on silhouettes of <b>clear</b> <b>plate</b> <b>glass</b> and then places them in specific public environments.

5000|$|The [...] "Classic" [...] Cassegrain has a {{parabolic}} primary mirror, and a hyperbolic {{secondary mirror}} {{that reflects the}} light back down {{through a hole in}} the primary. Folding the optics makes this a compact design. On smaller telescopes, and camera lenses, the secondary is often mounted on an optically flat, optically <b>clear</b> <b>glass</b> <b>plate</b> that closes the telescope tube. This support eliminates the [...] "star-shaped" [...] diffraction effects caused by a straight-vaned support spider. The closed tube stays clean, and the primary is protected, at the cost of some loss of light-gathering power.|$|R

Several reticle patterns have been designed and tested, and other patterns are in the planning stage. The device may be used for a variety of applications including determining the optimum locations on a cockpit panel for luminous warning indicators requiring rapid manual responses...|$|R

60|$|We went to {{the little}} brasserie, where poor Mr. Ruck made the lightest {{possible}} breakfast. But if he ate very little, he talked a great deal; he talked about business, going into a hundred details in which I was quite unable to follow him. His talk was not angry nor bitter; it was a long, meditative, melancholy monologue; {{if it had been}} a trifle less incoherent I should almost have called it philosophic. I was very sorry for him; I wanted to do something for him, but the only thing I could do was, when we had breakfasted, to see him safely back to the Pension Beaurepas. We went across the Treille and down the Corraterie, out of which we turned into the Rue du Rhone. In this latter street, as all the world knows, are many of those brilliant jewellers' shops for which Geneva is famous. I always admired their glittering windows, and never passed them without a lingering glance. Even on this occasion, pre-occupied as I was with my impending departure, and with my companion's troubles, I suffered my eyes to wander along the precious tiers that flashed and twinkled behind the huge <b>clear</b> <b>plates</b> of <b>glass.</b> Thanks to this inveterate habit, I made a discovery. In the largest and most brilliant of these establishments I perceived two ladies, seated before the counter with an air of absorption, which sufficiently proclaimed their identity. I hoped my companion would not see them, but as we came abreast of the door, a little beyond, we found it open to the warm summer air. Mr. Ruck happened to glance in, and he immediately recognised his wife and daughter. He slowly stopped, looking at them; I wondered what he would do. The salesman was holding up a bracelet before them, on its velvet cushion, and flashing it about in an irresistible manner.|$|R
