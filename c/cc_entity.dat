50|$|The {{call control}} (CC) {{protocol}} {{is one of}} the protocols of the Connection Management (CM) sublayer. Every mobile station must support the call control protocol. If a mobile station does not support any bearer capability at all then it must respond to a SETUP message with a RELEASE COMPLETE message. In the call control protocol, more than one <b>CC</b> <b>entity</b> are defined. Each <b>CC</b> <b>entity</b> is independent from each other and communicates with the correspondent peer entity using its own MM connection. Different CC entities use different transaction identifiers.|$|E

Herman et al. (2015) noted that the mass media serve as the go-to source of information on CC. This is something that has been validated in our findings.|$|R
40|$|SummaryCarcinoma cuniculatum (CC) {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} {{squamous}} cell carcinoma usually occurring in the lower extremity. Occurrence in the oral cavity is unusual and {{was reported in the}} literature less than 20 times. A 81 year old female presented with pain in the left mandible. Clinical examination showed no pathologic result but panoramic radiograph showed osteolytic lesion. Result of histological study was CC and local resection was done. Eight month later patient presented again with pain in the contralateral side of the mandible and follow up X-ray showed a new osteolytic lesion. Histology confirmed second occurrence of CC. <b>CC</b> is rare <b>entity</b> especially {{in the head and neck}} showing local aggressive behavior but should be considered as differential diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Rough set, GIS, Spatial uncertainty, Rough spatiRough set {{is a new}} {{approach}} to uncertainties in spatial decision-making and analysis in GIS context. In this paper, rough set symbols are simplified and standardized, which are composed of rough interpretation and specialized indication. Rough spatial entities and their topological relationships are also proposed in rough space. Further, a universal intersected equation is developed, and rough membership function is extended with the grey degree of a pixel in a case study. First, rough set is simply reviewed, and a set of simplified rough symbols is advanced on the basis of different kinds of existed rough symbols. It includes both rough interpretation and specialized indication. Second, rough spatial entity is put forward in rough vector space, rough raster space and rough threedimensional space. It is argued that GIS studies the real world as it is, without forcing uncertainties to change into crisp set. Third, rough topological relationships that are disjoint, touch, overlap, equal, cover, covered by, contain and contained by, are studied via rough matrix with their figures. They are divided into three types, <b>CC</b> (crisp <b>entity</b> and crisp entity), RC (rough entity and crisp entity) and RR (rough entity and rough entity). And a universal intersected equation is further proposed. Finally, a case is studied on river thematic map. The maximum and minimum maps of river thematic classification are generated via integrating the reduction of superfluous attributes, rough membership function and rough relationshipsl entity, Rough topological relationship, Rough symbolsDepartment of Land Surveying and Geo-InformaticsRefereed conference pape...|$|R
