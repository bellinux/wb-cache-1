5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present evidence against him. In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E
5|$|Knútr {{may have}} sought the {{submission}} of the assembled kings {{in an attempt}} to protect his northern borders. Additionally, he may have sought to prevent these kings from allowing military aid to reach potential challengers to his authority. If Echmarcach's father was indeed a son of Ragnall mac Gofraid, it would have meant that he was a nephew of Lagmann mac Gofraid. The latter was closely associated with Óláfr Haraldsson (died 1030), and together both lent military assistance to Richard II in the early eleventh century. There is also evidence to suggest that the predecessors of Ragnall mac Gofraid and Lagmann possessed connections with the Normans. In consequence, there is reason to suspect that Knútr sought to counter a potential association between Echmarcach and Richard II. Knútr and Óláfr were certainly at odds. In 1028, only a few years before the meeting of kings, Knútr seized control of Norway after defeating Óláfr. Knútr proceeded to appoint his own nephew, Hákon Eiríksson (died 1029/1030), as regent in Norway. Unfortunately for Knútr, Hákon perished at sea in late 1029 or early 1030. About three years later, Knútr's overlordship in Norway was challenged by a certain Tryggvi Óláfsson (died c.1033). This man apparently possessed connections with Dublin and the Isles, as saga-tradition appears to reveal that his mother, Gyða, was a daughter of Amlaíb Cuarán. Although Tryggvi apparently enjoyed considerable local support when he landed in Norway in about 1033, he was nonetheless overwhelmed by forces loyal to Knútr and killed. Tryggvi is unlikely to have been Knútr's only challenger, and the episode itself evinces the way in which potential threats to Knútr <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> from the Scandinavian settlements in Britain and Ireland.|$|E

50|$|Girondins were {{convinced}} that their opponents aspired to a bloody dictatorship, while the Montagnards believed that the Girondins were ready for any compromise with conservatives, and even royalists, that would guarantee their remaining in power. The bitter enmity soon reduced the Convention {{to a state of}} limbo. Debate after debate degenerated into verbal brawling from which no decision <b>could</b> <b>emerged.</b> The political deadlock, which had repercussions all over France, eventually drove men to accept dangerous allies, royalists in the case of Girondins, Jacobins in that of the Montagnards.|$|R
50|$|It's unknown when exactly {{started the}} {{negotiations}} for a marriage between Sophia and Prince Frederick of Brandeburg, son of Elector Albrecht III Achilles. There is a presumption {{that the idea}} <b>could</b> <b>emerged</b> {{in the summer of}} 1470, when Polish deputies Dziersław z Rytwian and Stanisław Ostroróg visited Brandenburg. In 1473 the Polish royal representants Paweł Jasieński (starost of Chełm and Belz) and Stanisław Kurozwęcki led the negotiations for the marriage between Sophia and Frederick, which ended with the signing of the formal betrothal on 7 December of that year in the city of Cadolzburg.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is intended}} to handle mission profiles typically performed by the U.S. Air National Guard, including domestic interdiction, quick-reaction natural disaster support, air sovereignty patrols, and low-threat battlefield missions. The manufacturer claims it to be low-cost and operate for about US$3,000 per hour. The light attack and reconnaissance roles are typically filled by turboprop airplanes and UAVs, often at lower cost. A concept for U.S. military adoption revolves around the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, a high-cost aircraft for high-threat missions; a requirement <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> for the low-cost Scorpion to handle low-threat missions. It could reopen the historically small market for tactical aircraft; a projected 60 nations may require tactical aircraft but cannot afford high-end types. Nations operating turboprop aircraft may view the Scorpion as a cost-effective jet replacement, and F-16 operators may see a less capable aircraft as being able to meet many of their requirements.|$|E

In Pokémon Puzzle League, Weezing is one of Team Rocket's Pokémon. In , a Koffing serves as a third of Team Skull, acting as a partner to a Zubat and serving as a minor antagonist and for {{the course of the}} game. Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros.

Both had the same effect; upon appearing, they would release streams of toxic gas around them, dealing heavy damage to anyone who got caught. Weezing also appeared in Melee as the 5th float to appear on the Poke' Floats stage, while Koffing returned in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS as an enemy in the Smash Run mode.|$|E
25|$|However, {{before they}} <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> the hoot {{of a car}} horn was heard to the north west. County Inspector Alexander Grey must have {{received}} word of the siege as he assembled between 54 and 67 men at Slane in 17 motorcars which were rushed to Ashbourne {{to put down the}} uprising. The rebels spread out and rushed along the Slane road to stop the convoy reaching Rath Cross and spreading out. The RIC reinforcements took heavy fire from the rebels from all sides. The firefight lasted many hours before volunteer reinforcements arrived from Boranstown. The RIC eventually surrendered to the volunteers. However given that the uprising in Dublin had been put down the Fingal volunteers eventually gave themselves up two days later. Thomas Ashe and his men were sentenced to death for their part in the attack, but this was later commuted to penal servitude for life.|$|E
25|$|China is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} of acetaldehyde in the world, accounting for almost half of global consumption in 2012. Major use has been the production of acetic acid. Other uses such as pyridines and pentaerythritol are expected to grow faster than acetic acid, but the volumes are not large enough to offset the decline in acetic acid. As a consequence, overall acetaldehyde consumption in China may grow slightly at 1.6% per year through 2018. Western Europe is the second-largest consumer of acetaldehyde worldwide, accounting for 20% of world consumption in 2012. As with China, the Western European acetaldehyde market {{is expected to increase}} only very slightly at 1% per year during 2012–2018. However, Japan <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> as a potential consumer for acetaldehyde in next five years due to newfound use in commercial production of butadiene. The supply of butadiene has been volatile in Japan and the rest of Asia. This should provide the much needed boost to the flat market, as of 2013.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, the Blue Line was {{actually}} connected to the Red Line by a direct rail connection (though the color designations of the subway lines had yet to be assigned at that time). Railcars from the Blue Line <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> from a ramp portal surfacing between Joy Street and Russell Street, just beyond Bowdoin station. The railcars would run on former streetcar track down Cambridge Street and then most of the distance to the western end of the Longfellow Bridge, connecting to the Red Line just east of its Cambridge Subway portal, near what is now Kendall/MIT station. Because the tracks were unpowered, individual cars had to be towed along the street at night. This connection was never used in passenger service, but was used to transport Blue Line cars to the Eliot Street Yard maintenance shops then located near Harvard Square station. When the Blue Line eventually got its own maintenance shops, the connection was removed and the ramp portal was permanently covered in 1952.|$|E

[...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do.

Despite the separate histories and conflicting allegiances these regions had during the High Middle Ages, he tended to group the two Principalities and medieval Transylvania together, into a vague non-stately entity he named [...] "the Romanian Land". Iorga cautioned about the emergence of states from a stateless society such as the proto-Romanian one: [...] "The state is a late, very elevated, very delicate form that, under certain conditions, may be reached by a people....

2500|$|The English patent system {{evolved from}} its early medieval origins {{into the first}} modern patent system that {{recognised}} intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution <b>could</b> <b>emerge</b> and flourish. By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually abuse the granting of letters patent for monopolies. After public outcry, King James I of England (VI of Scotland) was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only {{to be used for}} [...] "projects of new invention". This was incorporated into the Statute of Monopolies (1624) in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere.|$|E
