2500|$|A <b>compatible</b> <b>donor</b> {{is found}} by doing {{additional}} HLA-testing {{from the blood}} of potential donors. The HLA genes fall in two categories (Type I and Type II). In general, mismatches of the Type-I genes (i.e. HLA-A, HLA-B, or HLA-C) {{increase the risk of}} graft rejection. [...] A mismatch of an HLA Type II gene (i.e. HLA-DR, or HLA-DQB1) increases the risk of graft-versus-host disease. [...] In addition a genetic mismatch as small as a single DNA base pair is significant so perfect matches require knowledge of the exact DNA sequence of these genes for both donor and recipient. [...] Leading transplant centers currently perform testing for all five of these HLA genes before declaring that a donor and recipient are HLA-identical.|$|E

50|$|When KPD first started, {{the focus}} was only on enrolling {{incompatible}} donor-recipient pairs. As paired exchange grew and the process became faster and more reliable, patients with <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> that wanted a better match, began enrolling in KPD. Researchers have identified that a better matched kidney is correlated with better outcomes. Specifically a better matched kidney lasts longer and may allow for a lower dosage of post-transplant immunosuppressive medications. Also a better matched kidney transplant is correlated with a lower lifetime mortality rate.|$|R
40|$|In kidney paired {{donation}} (KPD), incompatible pairs exchange kidneys so {{that each}} recipient receives a compatible organ. This modality is underutilized {{partly because of the}} difficulty of finding a suitable match among incompatible pairs. Alternatively, recipients with <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> might enter KPD arrange-ments in order to be matched with a donor predicted to give greater allograft durability or for other altru-istic reasons. Using simulated donors and recipients, we investigated the impact of allowing recipients and their <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> to participate in KPD. For KPD programs of any size, the participation of compatible donor/recipient pairs nearly doubled the match rate for incompatible pairs (28. 2 % to 64. 5 % for single-center program, 37. 4 % to 75. 4 % for national program). Le-gal, logistical, and governmental controversies have hampered the expansion of KPD in the United States by delaying the creation of a national program. The inclusion of compatible pairs into small single-center pools could achieve match rates that would surpass that which could be realized by a national list made up of only incompatible pairs. This new paradigm of KPD can immediately be instituted at the single-center level, while the greatest gains will be achieved by incorporating compatible pairs into a national program.

50|$|For {{compatible}} pairs, {{not only}} does a better match lead to a better outcome, but it also directly helps other patients with incompatible donors find a match and get transplanted. A favorable blood type compatible pair (i.e. O donor with non-O recipient) will facilitate at least 1 {{and as many as}} 6 additional transplants. Compatible pair participation is the fastest growing segment of KPD and holds the promise of facilitating better matches for patients with <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> while limiting KPD wait times to less than 12 months for patients that have a cPRA less than 98%.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Highly {{sensitized}} renal transplant candi-dates {{present a}} group {{at high risk}} for acute and chronic rejection. The probability of finding <b>compatible</b> <b>donors</b> for these recipients is significantly lower in comparison to those who have low PRA values.

The degree of donor and recipient HLA compatibility predicts the results of XM.
