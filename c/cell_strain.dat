WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, is used today for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines produced throughout the world including those for poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A. Over one billion vaccinees have received vaccines produced on WI-38 or foreign version of Hayflick's original WI-38.|$|E

Neither the Htk genes nor the hyg genes code for a functional enzyme because each contains an insertion mutation at a unique site, i. e. 8 -bp XhoI linker insertions in the Htk genes and 10 -bp HindIII linker insertions in the hyg genes. These <b>cell</b> <b>strains</b> differ in their level of 06 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), which specifically removes the methyl group from the 06 position of guanine.

To further study the role of 06 -methylguanine in the induction of homologous recombination, we used 06 -benzylguanine to inactivate AGT in two additional human <b>cell</b> <b>strains</b> containing the hyg recombination substrate. After depletion of AGT activity by 06 -benzylguanine, both <b>cell</b> <b>strains</b> showed a significantly elevated level of MNNG-induced homologous recombination.

Cellular senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest characterized by persistent DDR activation. However, some reports suggest that DDR activation is a feature only of early cellular senescence that is then lost with time. This challenges the hypothesis that cellular senescence is caused by persistent DDR activation. To address this issue, we studied DDR activation dynamics in senescent cells. Here we show that normal human fibroblasts retain DDR markers months after replicative senescence establishment. Consistently, human fibroblasts from healthy aged donors display markers of DDR activation even three years in culture after entry into replicative cellular senescence.

These cells appear to retain differentiated functions that {{are present in}} type II alveolar epithelial cells of intact lung. The L- 2 cells are diploid, epithelial cells, they contain osmiophilic lamellar bodies in their cytoplasm and they synthesize lecithin by the same de novo pathway as whole lung...|$|E
40|$|Three {{monoclonal}} antibodies that {{react with}} uracil DNA glycosylase of normal human placenta were tested {{to determine whether}} one of the antibodies {{could be used as}} a negative marker for Bloom syndrome. As defined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, monoclonal antibody 40. 10. 09, which reacts with normal human glycosylase, neither recognized nor inhibited native uracil DNA glycosylase from any of five separate Bloom syndrome <b>cell</b> <b>strains.</b> Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that the denatured glycosylase protein from all five Bloom syndrome <b>cell</b> <b>strains</b> was immunoreactive with the 40. 10. 09 antibody. Further, each native enzyme was immunoreactive with two other anti-human placental uracil DNA glycosylase monoclonal antibodies. In contrast, ELISA reactivity was observed with all three monoclonal antibodies in reactions of glycosylases from 5 normal human cell types and 13 abnormal human <b>cell</b> <b>strains.</b> These results experimentally verify the specificity of the aberrant reactivity of the Bloom syndrome uracil DNA glycosylase. The possibility arises that determination of the lack of immunoreactivity with antibody 40. 10. 09 may have value in the early diagnosis of Bloom syndrome...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cell</b> <b>strains</b> {{derived by}} culture of {{malignant}} glioma (astrocytoma grade III IV) surgical specimens were {{tested for the}} production of DNA interstrand cross-links (ISC) and DNA-protein cross-links following treatment in vitro with l-(2 -ch!oroethyl) -l-nitrosourea, l, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethylH-nitrosourea (BCNU, carmustine), l-(2 -chloroethyl) - 3 -{ 2, 6 dioxo-l-piperidyl) -l-nitrosourea (PCNU), c/s-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) (cisplatin), and 3, 6 -diaziridinyl- 2, 5 -bis(carboethoxyamino) - 1, 4 -benzoquinone (diaziquone). ISC and DNA-protein crosslinks were measured by means of the DNA alkaline elution technique. Large differ ences among the <b>cell</b> <b>strains</b> were observed in DNA cross-linking re sponses to individual agents. The DNA responses to the Chloroethylni trosoureas, cisplatin, and diaziquone were largely independent of eac...|$|R
50|$|Although not {{commonly}} known, {{some species}} form endospores (e.g.Candida species). These are asexual spores that are formed within their mother cell (hyphal or single <b>cell).</b> <b>Strains</b> of Candida and Metschnikowia may also form asexual resting spores called chlamydospores.|$|R
