5|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the original}} combat system was based around the Motorola 68000 family of processors. The replacement combat system consists of the tactical and fire <b>control</b> <b>components</b> from the Raytheon CCS Mk2 system, combined with the sonar interfaces developed for the improved combat system used aboard Sheean and Dechaineux. Countermeasures include a Condor CS-5600 ESM intercept and warning unit, and two SSE decoys. The boats are fitted with a Marconi SDG-1802 degaussing system, and a receive-only Link 11 combat information exchange datalink. In October 2006, Sagem Défense Sécurité was selected to fit the Collins class with SIGMA 40XP gyrolaser inertial navigation systems.|$|E

40|$|When {{implementing}} the high-level <b>control</b> <b>component</b> of an autonomous robot, {{one needs to}} process events, generated by sensory components, to extract the information relevant to the <b>control</b> <b>component.</b> This paper discusses {{the lack of support}} for event-processing when current agent programming languages (APLs) are used to implement the <b>control</b> <b>component</b> of autonomous robots. To address this issue, the use of information flow processing (IFP) systems is proposed to support the development of event-processing components (EPCs) for an autonomous robot. The necessary interaction mechanisms between a <b>control</b> <b>component</b> and EPCs are defined. These mechanisms allow run-time subscription to events of interest, asynchronous reception of events, maintaining necessary histories of events and run-time querying of the histories. Several implementation-related concerns for these interaction mechanisms are discussed...|$|R

25|$|In December 2014, Supercars {{released}} details {{concerning the}} future of the category. New regulations, dubbed Gen2 Supercar, were introduced in 2017 to allow the use of two-door coupé body styles and turbocharged four- or six-cylinder engines. However, no teams elected to build cars for the new regulations until 2018. Cars are still required to be based on front-engined, rear-wheel drive, four-seater production cars that are sold in Australia. The chassis and <b>control</b> <b>components</b> will be carried over from the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, while engine and aerodynamic parity will be reviewed.|$|E
25|$|The {{vehicles}} used in {{the series}} are loosely based on road-going, four-door saloon cars. Cars are custom made using a control chassis, with only certain body panels being common between the road cars and race cars. To ensure parity between each make of car, many <b>control</b> <b>components</b> are utilised. All cars must use a 5.0-litre, naturally aspirated V8 engine. Originally only for Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores, the New Generation V8 Supercar regulations, introduced in 2013, opened up the series to more manufacturers. Nissan were the first new manufacturer to commit to the series with four Nissan Altimas, followed briefly by Erebus Motorsport with three Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs. Volvo entered the series in 2014 with Garry Rogers Motorsport racing the Volvo S60.|$|E
25|$|XP-82 Twin Mustang, AF s/n 44-83887 and FAA tail number N887XP, is {{currently}} under restoration to flying status by the B-25 Group, headed by aircraft restorer Tom Reilly, at Douglas Municipal Airport in Douglas, Georgia. A single fuselage {{and parts of}} the second XP-82 were located for many years on the farm of Walter Soplata in Newbury, Ohio; these were sold in April 2008 to Reilly and shipped to his facility in Douglas. With additional airframe parts sourced from Alaska, Colorado, and Florida; a left-turning engine found in Mexico City; <b>control</b> <b>components</b> from California; and other items fabricated at the Douglas facility, Reilly believes the aircraft can be restored to flying condition. During the restoration process, a number of written notes and graffiti by the original construction workers were found on internal surfaces. These have been preserved and will be reapplied to the interior of the finished aircraft.|$|E
