The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of the River, it certainly is very beautiful.|$|E
500|$|At his {{concert in}} Mendoza, Arjona {{observed}} that [...] "The day I chose this career {{was the day}} I realized that a spoken verse could earn you a slap, but a sung verse <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> sighs." [...] He then sang [...] "Mi Novia Se Me Está Poniendo Vieja", a song he wrote for his mother. [...] "Dime Que No" [...] and [...] "Como Duele" [...] followed; in Santiago de Chile, [...] "Dime Que No" [...] was replaced by [...] "Historia de Taxi". After [...] "Como Duele" [...] in some shows, [...] "Pingüinos En La Cama" [...] was performed before [...] "Señora De Las Cuatro Décadas". [...] "Reconciliación" [...] was performed next, while the set changed to a circus.|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

2500|$|La Païva reigned {{for years}} as a popular hostess known for her lavish open houses, teas, and dinners and salon frequented largely by {{well-known}} male writers, such as Gustave Flaubert, Émile Zola, Paul de Saint-Victor, Arsène Houssaye, and others, including the painter Eugène Delacroix. The bill of fare was so lavish that she overheard two guests discussing how much she could possibly be worth. One posited 10 million francs a year, at which comment La Païva scoffed, [...] "You must be mad. Ten millions? Why that would barely yield an income of 500,000 francs. Do you think I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> peaches and ripe grapes in January on 500,000 francs a year? Why my table alone costs me more than that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Yes, I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> several examples. Near Quilali, {{at about}} 30 {{kilometers}} east of Quilali, {{there was a}} little village called El Coco. The contras arrived, they devastated it, they destroyed and burned everything. They arrived in front of a little house and turned their machinegun fire on it, without bothering to check if there were any people inside. Two children, who had taken fright and hidden under a bed, were hit. I could say the same thing of a man and woman who were hit, this was in the little co-operative of Sacadias Olivas. It was just the same. They too had taken fright and got into bed. Unlike El Coco, the contras had just been on the attack, they had encountered resistance and were now in flight. During their flight they went into a house, and seeing that there were people there, they threw grenade. The man and the woman were killed and one of the children was injured." ...|$|E

'Read it, then,' said Dick, and Alf began intoning {{according}} to the rules of the Board School--'"I <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> love, I <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> loyalty, such as you never dreamed of.

6000|$|... "Come, dearest child!" [...] said Hester encouragingly, and {{stretching}} out both her arms. [...] "How slow thou art! When hast thou been so sluggish before now? Here {{is a friend}} of mine, who must be thy friend also. Thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee!</b> Leap across the brook and come to us. Thou canst leap like a young deer!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... (a.) How do {{they show}} {{themselves}} to be true under the first of these? Answ. By mistrusting our own sufficiency, by crying to God for help, by desiring rather to die than to bring any dishonour to the name of God, and by counting that, if God be honoured in the trial, thou hast gained {{more than all the}} world <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee.</b> (2 Chron 20:12, 14:11, Acts 4, 20:22, 2 Cor 4:17,18, Heb 11:24,25) ...|$|R
