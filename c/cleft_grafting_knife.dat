40|$|OBJECTIVES: To date, a {{great number}} of tissue {{engineering}} strategies have been suggested for alveolar cleft reconstruction; however, autologous bone grafting seems to remain the golden standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted in order to evaluate the clinical evidence pertaining to enhancement or replacement of the autologous bone graft in the alveolar cleft by means of tissue-engineered substitutes; 16 articles were selected for analysis. RESULTS: Tissue engineering strategies for alveolar <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> included enhancing the autologous bone graft by means of platelet-rich plasma addition, the use of barrier membranes and fibrin glue, extension of the autologous graft with calcium phosphate scaffolds, and replacement of the graft using bone morphogenetic protein- 2, mesenchymal stem cells, or calcium phosphate scaffolds. CONCLUSIONS: Selected articles showed a vast heterogeneity in data acquisition and patient selection. Therefore, a meta-analysis could not be performed. Future publications concerning this topic should be methodologically sound and preferably use three-dimensional radiological imaging for pre- and postoperative results.

5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of methods for <b>grafting</b> {{vegetable}} crops. <b>Cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> occurs when a V-shape is cut into the rootstock and a complementing wedge-shaped scion is inserted. The graft is then held with a small clip until healing occurs. [...] Approach grafting involves notching opposing sides of the stems of the rootstock and scion, and then using a clip to hold the stems together while they fuse. Once the graft has healed, the original scion is then cut off of the desired rootstock and the unused rootstock is detached from the scion. [...] Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone tube or clip. [...] This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output. Tube grafting has been adopted as the primary method for vegetable grafting on the farm as it can be easily carried out with small healing chambers with typical success rates ranging from 85 to 90 percent 14.|$|R

Multiplication by seeding gives weaker results and the flourishing is long delayed (after 7 years) and do not preserve the characters of mother plant (color, fragrance, size of the inflorescence, richness of flours, etc) so it is preferred the vegetative multiplication. Researches done had as purpose the diversification of intervention methods regarding the marcottage of wisteria with practical applicability. The experiences were performed in the nursery Mihai Viteazu, within Turda Forest Organization, in the period 2005 - 2006. As materials were used pots in plastic materials of different sizes, bamboo sticks, soil in different compositions, stimulants for roots, <b>grafting</b> <b>knife.</b> It was pursued to obtain some wisteria seeding plants by circular marcottage in pots, using as basis different compositions of organic substrate, as it follows: Alternative 1. – garden soil taken directly {{from the field of}} the nursery; Alternative 2. - 50 % soil from the field of the nursery + 50 % substrate in which the cutting propagation was done; Alternative 3. - 50 % soil from the fiel...|$|R
40|$|An 11 -year-old {{girl was}} {{scheduled}} for alveolar <b>cleft</b> bone <b>grafting</b> with an iliac bone under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was performed with 70 % nitrous oxide, 30 % oxygen, and propofol. On {{the first and second}} postoperative day, persistent hyperthermia was observed. Because the administration of diclofenac sodium had not been effective for the hyperthermia, dantrolene sodium was given. Her body temperature gradually dropped and returned to normal level on the fifth postoperative day. The hyperthermia in the present case might have been caused by a rapidly elevated muscle metabolism in response to pain and stress after the propofol anesthesia. The oral administration of dantrolene sodium successfully lowered the patient's high body temperature...|$|R
40|$|Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) {{has become}} a major {{constraint}} to cassava production in East and Central Africa. The identification of new sources of CBSD resistance is essential to deploy CBSD mitigation strategies as the disease is progressing westwards to new geographical areas. A stringent infection method based on top <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> combined with precise virus titer quantitation was utilized to screen fourteen cassava cultivars and elite breeding lines. When inoculated with mixed infections of Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), the scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26 remained symptom-free during a 16 -week period of virus graft inoculation, while susceptible varieties displayed typical CBSD infection symptoms at 4 weeks after grafting. The identified CBSD resistance was stable under the co-inoculation of CBSV, UCBSV with cassava geminiviruses (CGMs). Double grafting experiments revealed that transmission of CBSV and UCBSV to CBSD susceptible top scions was delayed when using intermediate scions of elite breeding lines KBH 2006 / 18 and KBH 2006 / 26. Nonetheless, comparison of virus systemic movement using scions from KBH 2006 / 18 and a transgenic CBSD resistant 60444 line (60444 -Hp 9 line) showed that both CBSV and UCBSV move at undetectable levels through the stems. Further, protoplast-based assays of virus titers over time showed that the replication of CBSVs is inhibited in the resistant line KBH 2006 / 18, suggesting that the identified CBSD resistance is at least partially based on inhibition of virus replication. Our molecular characterization of CBSD resistance in cassava offers a robust virus–host system to further investigate the molecular determinants of CBSD resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{outcome of}} {{alveolar}} bone grafting in adult patients is sparsely reported. Here, {{we present a}} description of the surgical techniques used in a Nigerian teaching hospital and a preliminary report of the first five cases of adult alveolar <b>cleft</b> bone <b>grafting</b> accomplished with or without repositioning the premaxilla. Although, evidence of bone resorption was observed within 6 months after the operation, satisfactory bone level and aesthetic outcome was recorded in all cases. We concluded that tertiary alveolar bone grafting is desirable for all cases where alveolar clefts have persisted into adulthood to enhance the psyche of the cleft patients and to motivate them for further rehabilitation. Prompt placement of dental implant into the grafted area is recommended to mitigate subsequent resorption of the bone graft...|$|R
30|$|Many {{sources of}} bone both {{autologous}} and alloplastic {{have been studied}} and compared. The question of the preferred donor site for <b>cleft</b> <b>grafts</b> has been debated for many years [13]. Autologous bone graft {{has always been the}} gold standard of bone replacement because it provides osteogenic cells as well as essential factors needed for bone healing and regeneration. It can be taken from the patient’s iliac crest, mandible, or tibia. The choice between these sites is influenced by several factors including the surgeon’s experience, the volume of bone required, and the morbidity of the harvest area [14]. To avoid or reduce such morbidity, surgeons are searching for a bone graft substitute. In 2007, the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) started to be used after the Food and Drug Administration approval as an alternative to autologous bone graft for localized alveolar ridge augmentation [15]. The identification and development of rhBMP- 2 associated with a collagen sponge carrier has allowed the use of alloplastic bone graft. The bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play a role in osteogenesis and chondrogenesis and are also involved in embryonic development and fracture healing [16]. It is important to better understand if rhBMP- 2 graft could represent an autologous bone graft substitute, thus eliminating donor site morbidity [17]. The last systematic review assessing autologous vs. alloplastic bone for SABG in patients with cleft lip and palate was published by Guo et al. in 2011 [18] that included only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing traditional iliac bone graft to rhBMP- 2. Therefore, the objectives of this systematic review are to evaluate volume and bone height and length of hospital stay in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate treated with autologous or rhBMP- 2 secondary bone graft, thus synthesizing the available evidence on the effectiveness of the two types of treatment.|$|R
40|$|Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{that causes}} wilting and cankers, leading to severe economic losses in commercial tomato production worldwide. The disease {{is transmitted from}} infected seeds to seedlings and mechanically from plant to plant during seedling production, grafting, pruning, and harvesting. Because {{of the lack of}} tools for genetic manipulation, very little is known regarding the mechanisms of seed and seedling infection and movement of C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis in grafted plants, two focal points for application of bacterial canker control measures in tomato. To facilitate studies on the C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis movement in tomato seed and grafted plants, we isolated a bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis strain using the modified Tn 1409 containing a promoterless lux reporter. A total of 19 bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis mutants were obtained. All mutants tested induced a hypersensitive response in Mirabilis jalapa and caused wilting of tomato plants. Real-time colonization studies of germinating seeds using a virulent, stable, constitutively bioluminescent strain, BL-Cmm 17, showed that C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis aggregated on hypocotyls and cotyledons at an early stage of germination. In grafted seedlings in which either the rootstock or scion was exposed to BL-Cmm 17 via a contaminated <b>grafting</b> <b>knife,</b> bacteria were translocated in both directions from the graft union at higher inoculum doses. These results emphasize the use of bioluminescent C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis to help better elucidate the C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis-tomato plant interactions. Further, we demonstrated the broader applicability of this tool by successful transformation of C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with Tn 1409 ::lux. Thus, our approach would be highly useful to understand the pathogenesis of diseases caused by other subspecies of the agriculturally important C. michiganensis...|$|R
40|$|The pummelo, Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck, is {{the most}} {{tropical}} of the citrus fruits, yet is poorly distributed, underutilized, and often unknown. It is an excellent fruit, however, which finds ready acceptance wherever tried. Pummelos probably originated in China but were carried to Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, where their evolution has continued and where many varieties are now available. The tree is large and spreading, with large, winged leaves, and frequently with thorns. The flower is very large for a citrus (3 - 5 cm in diameter), and the fruits vary from large to extra large. The rind is often thick. At maturity the sweet to subacid fruit vesicles separate easily from the membrane of the segments and are served in a dish as a dessert fruit. Varieties of pummelo can be classified as Thailand group (best tropical varieties), Chinese group (better suited to subtropics), and Indonesian group (extremely variable and sometimes inferior). The pummelo produces a monoembryonic, normal, sexual seed, and thus can be improved by breeding. Improved varieties are maintained by bud and <b>cleft</b> <b>grafting</b> {{as well as by}} marcotting. Culture {{is similar to that of}} other citrus trees, but the trees need somewhat larger growing areas. Cover crops or cash crops can be planted among the trees until they are too large. Normal chemical treatment schedules for pests and weeds can be used, but have not been adequately tried with the pummelo. Some pummelos are tolerant to foot rot, a disease that always requires careful treatment. Since flowering may occur several times a year, fruiting is irregular, but usually one harvesting season predominates. The fruit is picked just as it yellows or later, and is more flavorful when stored for several months. Because of its thick rind, the pummelo is easy to ship and keeps well even in common storage.
