5000|$|Sweet lemon or {{sweet lime}} refers to many <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> that contain low acid pulp and juice, and are {{identical}} to the common lemon or lime or just similar to them.|$|R
50|$|This <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{has many}} other names, such as Al-zanbu, Khoubs al-Arsa, Koubs al-Arsa, Kubbâd, Robs al-Arsa, Zamboa, Zanbo'a, and Zemboua.|$|E

5000|$|Hassaku orange (八朔, {{also called}} [...] "jagada", [...] ) is Japanese <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> similar to an orange in color {{but with the}} size of a grapefruit.|$|E
50|$|The same {{common names}} {{may be given}} to {{different}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> or mutations. Fruit with similar ancestry may be quite different in name and traits (e.g. grapefruit, common oranges, and ponkans, all pommelo-mandarin hybrids).|$|R
50|$|Interbreeding seems {{possible}} between all citrus plants, and between citrus plants and some plants {{which may or}} may not be categorized as citrus. The ability of <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> to self-pollinate and to reproduce sexually also helps create new varieties.|$|R
50|$|Most {{cultivated}} Citrus seem to {{be natural}} or artificial hybrids of four core ancestral species — the citron, pummelo, mandarine, and papeda (see image). Natural and cultivated <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> include commercially important fruit such as oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and some tangerines.|$|R
50|$|Kalpi (Citrus x webberii) is {{a natural}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> native to Philippines and is today {{one of the most}} common lemons in Hawaii, and is {{sometimes}} called Malayan lemon.|$|E
5000|$|Amanatsu (甘夏) or [...] is a {{yellowish}} orange <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> fruit, a {{group of}} cultivars of Citrus natsudaidai, which were discovered in 1740 in the Yamaguchi prefecture of Japan.|$|E
50|$|Rough lemon (Citrus jambhiri Lush.) is {{the fruit}} and the tree of a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> related to the citron and the lemon, with {{character}} traits similar to rangpur or mandarin orange.|$|E
50|$|Various {{regionally}} based industry associations {{were formed}} to represent growers {{in a national}} process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. CSIRO researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes, developed a range of native <b>Citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> which became available through ANPI.|$|R
50|$|The CSIRO {{has also}} {{developed}} several <b>Citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> by crossing the finger lime with standard <b>Citrus</b> species. These <b>hybrids</b> have created many cultivars which generate finger limes {{in many different}} colors ranging from light pink to deep blue-green. Finger lime {{is thought to have}} the widest range of color variation within any Citrus species. The color of the pulp (juice vesicles) comes in shades of green or pink including pale lime-green, pale pink, coral, and scarlet.|$|R
50|$|Papeda is {{the most}} {{primitive}} group of citruses. Because of generally slow growth and bitter, less palatable fruits than in other citruses, its species had only limited commercial cultivation. Some species, like Ichang papeda, are used in landscaping, while others are important for rootstocking and as genome source for breeding disease-resistant and frost-hardy <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Citrus ×deliciosa (thorny (Australia), amarillo, beladi, Willowleaf Mandarin, Mediterranean Mandarin) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> (mandarin × pumelo), {{though it}} was {{once thought to be}} a pure mandarin. It is related to the ponkan.|$|E
50|$|An oroblanco, oro blanco (white gold) or sweetie (Citrus grandis Osbeck × C. Paradisi Macf.) is a sweet {{seedless}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> fruit {{similar to}} grapefruit. It {{is often referred}} to as oroblanco grapefruit.|$|E
50|$|Procimequat is a {{triploid}} <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> or transgeneric hybrid, {{in which}} the Limequat that itself is a cross between lime and a round kumquat, was backcrossed with a kumquat-like fruit, named Fortunella hindsii.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{is starting to}} make sense of this complex phylogeny. Two citrus fruits have had their full genomes sequenced (sweet orange and clementines). Partial sequences of other cultivars may give contradictory results, as some <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> are not at all well-mixed. Many different phylogenies for the non-hybrid citrus have been proposed, and taxonomic terminology is not yet settled.|$|R
40|$|Several {{observations}} were conductet on different <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> derived from crosses of clementine mandarin x trifoliate orange and of clementine mandarin x sour orange. The principal characteristics of leaves, flowers, and fruits were evaluated in such hybrids {{in order to}} determine the inheritance in F 1 progeny.

5000|$|The tangelo ( [...] or [...] C. reticulata × C. maxima or x C. paradisi), Citrus × tangelo, is a <b>citrus</b> fruit <b>hybrid</b> of {{tangerine}} and pomelo or grapefruit.|$|R
50|$|The ponderosa lemon (Citrus limon × medica) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> of a {{lemon and}} a citron. It {{is not the}} same as the Yuma Ponderosa lemon pomello hybrid, that is used as citrus rootstock.|$|E
50|$|The Key lime (Citrus × aurantiifolia) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> (C. micrantha x C. medica) with a globose (spherical shaped) fruit, 2.5-5 cm in {{diameter}} (1-2 in), that is yellow when ripe but usually picked green commercially.|$|E
5000|$|Citrumelo or Citromelo (X Citroncirus spp.) is {{also called}} Swingle citrumelo trifoliate hybrid, {{because it is}} a cold hardy <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> between a 'Duncan' {{grapefruit}} and a trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.), developed by Walter Tennyson Swingle.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate leaf epidermis morphological characteristics of three <b>citrus</b> somatic <b>hybrids,</b> compared to their parents. Parental and somatic hybrid young leaves were collected and processed for scanning electron microscope observations. <b>Citrus</b> polyploid <b>hybrids</b> have fewer stomata per area and these are larger compared to their diploid parental parents. No differences in internal arrangement of the stomatal cells were detected between parental plants and somatic hybrids. Additional studies may determine if these differences will influence physiological behavior of the plants in the field. 2004 Notas Científica...|$|R
5000|$|Cold-hardy citrus is citrus with {{increased}} frost tolerance {{which may be}} cultivated far beyond traditional citrus growing regions. Citrus species and <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids</b> typically described as cold-hardy generally display an ability to withstand wintertime temperatures below [...] Cold-hardy citrus may be generally accepted 'true' species (e.g. Satsuma mandarin, Kumquat) or hybrids (e.g. Citrange) involving various other citrus species. All citrus fruits are technically edible, though some have bitter flavors often regarded as unpleasant, and this variability is also seen in cold-hardy citrus fruits. Those listed as [...] "inedible fresh" [...] or [...] "semi-edible" [...] can (like all citrus) be cooked to make marmalade.|$|R
50|$|Carl Peter Thunberg {{originally}} classified the kumquats as Citrus japonica in his 1784 book, Flora Japonica. In 1915, Walter T. Swingle reclassified {{them in a}} segregate genus, Fortunella, {{named in}} honor of Robert Fortune. Seven species of Fortunella have generally been recognized—F. japonica, F. margarita, F. crassifolia, F. hindsii, F. obovata and F. polyandra, as well as the recently described F. bawangica. Since the kumquat is a cold hardy species, there are many <b>hybrids</b> between common <b>citrus</b> members and the kumquat (most popularly the calamondin that occurred naturally). Those <b>hybrids</b> are not <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrids,</b> according to Swingle, but reside in a separate hybrid genus which he called × Citrofortunella.|$|R
50|$|The Melogold or Melogold {{grapefruit}} (Citrus grandis Osbeck × C. Paradisi Macf.) is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> {{similar to}} the oroblanco; both result from a cross between the pomelo and the grapefruit and is a fruit similar to a sweet grapefruit.|$|E
5000|$|Ponkan ( [...] ; Citrus poonensis; [...] "Chinese Honey Orange") is a high-yield sweet Citrus {{cultivar}} {{with large}} fruits {{in the size}} of an orange. It is a <b>citrus</b> <b>hybrid</b> (mandarin × pomelo), though it was once thought to be a pure mandarin.|$|E
