40|$|Positional vertigo is {{a common}} {{neurologic}} emergency and mostly the etiology is peripheral. However, central diseases may mimic peripheral positional vertigo at their initial presentation. We here describe {{the results of a}} visual suppression test in six patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6), a <b>central</b> positional <b>vertigo,</b> and nine patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the major peripheral positional vertigo. As a result, the visual suppression value of both diseases differed significantly; e. g., 22. 5 % in SCA 6 and 64. 3 % in BPPV (p < 0. 001). There was a positive correlation between the visual suppression value and disease duration, cerebellar atrophy, and CAG repeat length of SCA 6 but they were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the present study showed {{for the first time that}} visual suppression is impaired in SCA 6, a <b>central</b> positional <b>vertigo,</b> but preserved in BPPV, the major peripheral positional vertigo, by directly comparing both groups. The abnormality in the SCA 6 group presumably reflects dysfunction in the central visual fixation pathway at the cerebellar flocculus and nodulus. This simple test might aid differential diagnosis of peripheral and <b>central</b> positional <b>vertigo</b> at the earlier stage of disease. disease...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Vertigo {{prevalence}} {{is estimated}} to be 1. 8 % among young adults and more than 30 % in the elderly. 13 - 38 % of the referrals of patients over 65 years old in America are due to vertigo. Vertigo does not increase the risk of mortality but it can affect the patient’s quality of life. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of vertigo patients referred to the emergency department (ED). Methods: In this 6 -month retrospective cross-sectional study, the profiles of all vertigo patients referred to the ED of Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from October 2013 to March 2014 were evaluated. Demographic data and baseline characteristics of the patients were recorded and then patients were divided into <b>central</b> and peripheral <b>vertigo.</b> The correlation of history and clinical examination with vertigo type was evaluated and screening performance characteristics of history and clinical examination in differentiating <b>central</b> and peripheral <b>vertigo</b> were determined. Results: 379 patients with the mean age of 50. 69 ± 11. 94 years (minimum 18 and maximum 86) were enrolled (58. 13 % female). There was no sex difference in vertigo incidence (p = 0. 756). A significant correlation existed between older age and increase in frequency of central cases (p < 0. 001). No significant difference was detected between the treatment protocols regarding ED length of stay (p = 0. 72). There was a significant overlap between the initial diagnosis and the final decision based on imaging and neurologist’s final opinion (p < 0. 001). In the end, 361 (95. 3 %) patients were discharged from ED, while 18 were disposed to the neurology ward. No case of mortality was reported.

40|$|Betahistine {{hydrochloride}} is {{the drug}} of choice {{for the treatment of}} vestibular vertigo in the presence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuronitis. Effective combination therapy regimens that contain, along with drugs from other pharmacological groups, betahistine hydrochloride that improves blood circulation in the vestibular structures, accelerates vestibular compensation, and prevents recurrent dizzy spells, have been elaborated to treat <b>central</b> vestibular <b>vertigo</b> in migraine-associated dizziness and in acute cerebrovascular accident. Of great importance is a combination of drug therapy and the current rehabilitation methods for vestibular diseases, which contribute to prompter and complete recovery of vestibular function. Biofeedback instrumental rehabilitation techniques using a stabilographic platform are highly effective. Successful treatment depends on the correctness of the established diagnosis. The diagnosis of peripheral and central vestibular vertigo frequently poses challenges. The essential reason for this is physicians’ unawareness about outpatient methods for the diagnosis of major vestibular diseases when the patient is at a doctor. It is important to follow a vestibular system study protocol since the use and correct assessment of diagnostic tests in most cases make it possible to estimate the degree of vestibular analyzer injury and to make an accurate diagnosis.  The paper describes the diseases that are the most common causes of vestibular vertigo.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aims {{of study}} were to {{determine}} how many patients require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for a diagnosis of <b>central</b> <b>vertigo</b> among all patients with acute isolated vertigo in the emergency department (ED). MATERIALS and METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 2671 patients. Diffusion-weighted and T 2 MR imaging was performed in all patients with the exception of those with trauma and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Patients were divided into three groups according to age (young adult, adult, old). Final diagnosis, MRI findings, and risk factors for <b>central</b> <b>vertigo</b> were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 2671 patients, 23. 4 % (626) needed MRI to diagnose vertigo of central origin. Of these, 4. 6 % (122 / 2671) of patients had confirmed vertigo of central origin, such as cerebral infarction (2. 4 %, 63 / 2671) or cerebral vascular accident (0. 7 %, 19). For the diagnosis of a central cause of acute isolated vertigo in patients in the ED, the sensitivity of MRI was 89. 3 %, and the specificity was 100 %. In both young adult and adult patients, the frequency of <b>central</b> <b>vertigo</b> increased in patients with underlying diseases. CONCLUSION: The utility of MRI may not be high in patients with acute isolated vertigo in the ED under age 65 years unless they have signs or risk factors of cerebral vascular accident.

40|$|Bernard Herrmann’s {{score for}} Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Vertigo (1958) {{is a clear}} example of the composer’s uncanny ability in {{translating}} the basic thematic premise of a film into a compact musical structure. The connection between love and death that is a <b>central</b> issue of <b>Vertigo</b> finds its musical counterpart in the derivation of the love motif and of two motifs associated with death from the same ‘Primal cell’ in the main title. The structure of the main title itself reflects this link by juxtaposing the basic motifs associated with death and love. To further illustrate the way Herrmann reinforces this connection, I will examine {{one of the key}} sequences of the film, in which the first four notes of one of the love motifs are subjected to a systematic process of transformation, which progressively eradicates the motif’s original identity.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that binocular flash-induced nystagmus (B-FIN) can be evoked in humans. Design: The study evaluated the presence of B-FIN by stimulation with a stroboscopic flash. Setting: The study was conducted with 12 healthy patients in the Otorhinolaryngology Department of the University of Genoa (Italy), between April 2008 and January 2009. Methods: Patients underwent binocular flashing light stimulation, in the dark, by stroboscopic flash presented through a photostimulator at frequencies of 4. 7 and 7. 69 cycles/second for 120 seconds, with their eyes covered by a homogeneous field hollow opal hemisphere. The photostimulator was placed in three different positions with respect to the anterior-posterior axis: 0 u, 45 u to the right, and 45 u to the left. Main Outcome Measures: Eyemovementswere recorded by electronystagmography (ENG). ENGrecording started 30 seconds before the stimulation and stopped 60 seconds after the end of the luminance stimuli to test the presence of flash induced after nystagmus (FIAN). Results: B-FIN was clearly evoked from 10 of the 12 healthy adults, whereas FIAN was evoked from 4 of the 12 subjects. The best stimulation of B-FIN was obtained through an intermittent luminance stimulus presented at a frequency of 4. 7 cycles/second and the photostimulator placed at 0 u to the optic axis. Conclusions: Our investigation demonstrates that B-FIN can be evoked in humans and its possible value in the differential diagnosis between <b>central</b> and peripheral <b>vertigo...</b>|$|R
40|$|IN PART I, {{the general}} topic of {{dizziness}} and vertigo was introduced, {{with a discussion}} of the major peripheral and systemic causes. 1 Part II concentrates on the central causes of dizziness and vertigo, in-cluding vertebrobasilar disease. Central Causes Dysfunction of the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve and the vestibular nuclei within the brainstem and their central connections is a central cause of diz-ziness and vertigo. Neural connections with the cen-tral vestibular nuclei include interaction with the vestibular portions of the cerebellum (primarily cerebellar flocculus), the visual sensory system, and afferent connections from muscle, joint, and tactile receptors. <b>Central</b> causes of <b>vertigo</b> are less common than peripheral or "systemic " etiologies, the ver-tiginous symptomatology is usually less prominent, and additional neurological signs are usually present on examination. Central disorders include demye-linating disease, tumors, seizures, and vertebrobasilar artery disease (table). Demyelinating disease should only be diagnosed after documentation of disseminated central nervous system lesions, such as optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, or other focal signs. Cerebellopontine angle tumors do not usually pre-sent symptoms of episodic vertigo alone. The most common tumor in this location results from a proliferation of the Schwann cells (which produce the myelin of nerves), hence the name Schwannoma. Most of these tumors arise in the vestibular portion of the eighth nerve within the internal auditory canal. They progressively enlarge, deforming the internal auditory meatus and compressing adjacent neural structures: the acoustic portion of the eighth nerve, facial nerve, root of the trigeminal nerve, brainstem, an...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveWe {{investigated}} {{the reliability and}} accuracy of a bedside diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with vertigo/unsteadiness to the emergency department. MethodsWe enrolled consecutive adult patients presenting with vertigo/unsteadiness at a tertiary hospital. STANDING, the acronym for the four-step algorithm we have previously described, based on nystagmus observation and well-known diagnostic maneuvers includes (1) the discrimination between SponTAneous and positional nystagmus, (2) {{the evaluation of the}} Nystagmus Direction, (3) the head Impulse test, and (4) the evaluation of equilibrium (staNdinG). Reliability of each step was analyzed by Fleiss’ K calculation. The reference standard (<b>central</b> <b>vertigo)</b> was a composite of brain disease including stroke, demyelinating disease, neoplasm, or other brain disease diagnosed by initial imaging or during 3 -month follow-up. ResultsThree hundred and fifty-two patients were included. The incidence of <b>central</b> <b>vertigo</b> was 11. 4 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 8. 2 – 15. 2 %]. The leading cause was ischemic stroke (70 %). The STANDING showed a good reliability (overall Fleiss K 0. 83), the second step showing the highest (0. 95), and the third step the lowest (0. 74) agreement. The overall accuracy of the algorithm was 88 % (95 % CI 85 – 88 %), showing high sensitivity (95 %, 95 % CI 83 – 99 %) and specificity (87 %, 95 % CI 85 – 87 %), very high-negative predictive value (99 %, 95 % CI 97 – 100 %), and a positive predictive value of 48 % (95 % CI 41 – 50 %) for <b>central</b> <b>vertigo.</b> ConclusionUsing the STANDING algorithm, non-sub-specialists achieved good reliability and high accuracy in excluding stroke and other threatening causes of vertigo/unsteadiness...|$|E
