500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, {{so you have to}} look for other options... I knew that the decision <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way,</b> but were expecting a yes. The hard thing is going to be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work. But at least I would have tried." ...|$|E
500|$|Benfica opened April in Vila do Conde with an {{away match}} against Rio Ave on Sunday 4 April. The home team opened the scoring {{in the second}} half and six minutes later Benfica {{equalized}} by Tiago. The game ended with a 1–1 draw, with Camacho admitting the team showed signs of fatigue. This draw also allowed Sporting to regain a six-point lead, with just five match-days to go. On 10 April, Benfica played Paços de Ferreira at home. Nuno Gomes and Geovanni both scored {{in the second half}} to give Benfica a 2–1 win. A week later Benfica won their second game in a row, 3–0 away at Braga. Miguel scored his first of the season while Sokota and Simão made it 3–0 by the half-hour point. The win, Benfica's largest there since 1989-90, helped them reduce the gap to second place to three points, because of Sporting's loss to Boavista. Camacho attributed the easy win to his team's motivation. Benfica ended April with a home game against Estrela da Amadora. They took an early lead through Nuno Gomes and Sokota scored the second later in the first half. Davide reduced the lead on the 86th minute, but an additional goal by Miguel led to a 3–1 win that put Benfica in second place in the league table, after catching up to Sporting. Camacho liked the win but not the performance, saying: [...] "We lacked sharpness and played on a slow pace." [...] For the upcoming match with Sporting, Tiago commented that the Derby <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way,</b> but dismissed the idea that it was the most important game in the season for Benfica, saying: [...] "The Portuguese Cup final is our most important game." ...|$|E

The Board of Control for Cricket in India, however, asserted that the blast would have no bearing on the cricket tour which would go ahead as scheduled. However, a conflicting report made on 15 September claimed that the CA had briefed that the tour was on track. Following these reports, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lashed at the Australian cricket establishment for agreeing to tour India while postponing their tour to Pakistan in early 2008 and accused the Board of adopting double standards. One PCB official even called the Australians [...] "lilly-livered cowards" [...] But Ricky Ponting issued a statement vindicating CA's stand by saying that the circumstances accompanying the cancellation of Australia's tour of Pakistan were entirely different. before adding on 17 September that the tour was not confirmed yet and that it <b>could</b> <b>go</b> <b>either</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

[...] Williams pointed out [...] "that although Catholics have for some time comprised the largest religious affiliation in both the Senate and {{the population as a}} whole, there has been only one Catholic Senate Chaplain since 1793, and not a single rabbi." [...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life."
