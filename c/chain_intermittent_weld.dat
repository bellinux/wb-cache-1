50|$|An <b>intermittent</b> fillet <b>weld</b> is {{one that}} is not {{continuous}} across a joint. These welds are portrayed as a set of two numbers {{to the right of the}} triangle instead of just one. The first number as mentioned earlier refers to the length of the weld. The second number, separated from the first by a “-”, refers to the pitch. The pitch is a measurement from midpoint to midpoint of the <b>intermittent</b> <b>welds.</b> <b>Intermittent</b> <b>welding</b> is used when either a continuous weld is not necessary, or when a continuous weld threatens the joint by warping. In some cases <b>intermittent</b> <b>welds</b> are staggered on both sides of the joint. In this case, the notation of the two triangles aren't directly on top of each other. Instead, the side of the joint to receive the first weld will have a triangle further to the left than the following side’s triangle notation. As an end result of alternating <b>intermittent</b> fillet <b>welds</b> at each side, the space between welds on one side of the joint will be the midpoint of the opposite side’s weld.|$|R

40|$|Although {{laser beam}} welding is an {{established}} joining technology {{in the field of}} precision engineering, welding of copper materials is still a delicate issue. The fluctuating energy deposition resulting from the unsteady thermodynamic and optical properties of copper causes <b>intermittent</b> <b>welding</b> failures. To make welding processes more reliable, failure detection by online process monitoring is a common technology for large-scale welding applications. For micro welding, where material thickness far below 1 mm and focus diameters of 100 µm and less are used, the existing methods must be adapted to meet requirements such as extreme accuracy and processing times of a few milliseconds. Innovative monitoring systems based on ultra-fast cameras and optical sensors with signal processors capable of sampling rates up to 20 kHz provide new opportunities. In this paper monitoring of micro welding processes with pulsed Nd:YAG lasers and fiber lasers is examined. Different methods for process monitoring are compared, regarding what kind of information about the welding process can be gained and how failures can be identified. A special topic is the use of galvanometric scanners and how an integrated system consisting of a processing head and a monitoring system can be put into practice...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Recently, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that embedded cores in a high-speed SoC circuit have the problem of broken scan chains that cannot shift properly. Also, scan <b>chain</b> <b>intermittent</b> faults caused by hold-time violations and crosstalk noises are pervasive. In this research, an efficient method is proposed to identify the faulty scan chain(s) at the core level. That is, the core where the scan chain is defective can be identified, even if the scan chain is broken. The result can be used to tune up the fabrication process or to guide the fine-grained scan cell identification process. Here, weight-based m-out-of-n codes, which can generate a large number of codewords, with small hardware overhead and high fault detection capability are used to generate the scan chain diagnostic patterns for permanent (and possibly intermittent) faults. An efficient codeword generation method is proposed to maximize the number of codewords, minimize the aliasing probabilities and test application cost. The idea of multiple m-out-of-n codes is also proposed to guarantee that sufficient number of codewords are generated to perturb the scan chains and the associated combinational circuits. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. I...|$|R

The load under which the column is strengthened slightly weakens the column but not by far to the extent of design recommendations used in the Czech Republic. The reduction ratio (ultimate load capacity of column strengthened under load divided by ultimate load capacity of column welded without preloading) decreases with increasing preload magnitude and column slenderness.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of using advanced composite materials to enhance double tee to double tee connections in regions of significant seismic and lateral load. This work stems partly from the unfortunate losses experienced during the 1994 Northridge California earthquake. Moreover, this work was also developed from discussions with a local precasting company, which is concerned about premature failure of the connection due to stress concentrations. The author contends that the current connection method, <b>intermittent</b> <b>welded</b> plates, does result in stress concentrations, which can effect the system 2 ̆ 7 s overall performance. The proposed connection was formed by using a grouting material in conjunction with CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) fabrics, placed at +/- 45 ° from the axis of the joint under consideration. It is believed that this connection will not only enhance the system 2 ̆ 7 s diaphragm action and reduce stress concentrations in the connectors currently used, but it will also enhance the system 2 ̆ 7 s load distribution mechanisms. At the University of Windsor a special set of experiments were conducted in the Civil Engineering Structures laboratory. These experiments were conducted at a 1 : 4 scale based on reviewed, full scale plans from a local precasting company. These experiments involved testing of two connected double tees with various connection designs. The tests conducted included dynamic analysis and ultimate loading. The experimental work was verified using a Finite Element Model. Overall, the proposed composite connection performed well and has proven itself suitable for repair and new construction works. It should be noted that this connection 2 ̆ 7 s performance is only known for the short term, thus long term effects are not yet know. This dissertation includes a discussion of design considerations and recommendations for future work.

40|$|A small friction-stir-welding tool {{has been}} {{developed}} for use in tack welding of aluminum-alloy workpieces. It is necessary to tack-weld the workpieces in order to hold them together during friction stir welding because (1) in operation, a full-size friction-stir-welding tool exerts a large force that tends to separate the workpieces and (2) clamping the workpieces {{is not sufficient to}} resist this force. It is possible to tack the pieces together by gas tungsten arc welding, but the process can be awkward and time-consuming and can cause sufficient damage to necessitate rework. Friction stir tack welding does not entail these disadvantages. In addition, friction stir tack welding can be accomplished by use of the same automated equipment (except for the welding tool) used in subsequent full friction stir welding. The tool for friction stir tack welding resembles the tool for full friction stir welding, but has a narrower shoulder and a shorter pin. The shorter pin generates a smaller workpiece-separating force so that clamping suffices to keep the workpieces together.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{self-regulating}} shielding gas valves {{have been developed}} to synchronise the shielding gas flow rate to the welding current being used in the gas metal arc welding process (GMAW). These valves make claims to reduce the shielding gas consumption by up to 60 %. One such system, the Regula® EWR Pro, has undergone detailed evaluation in an effort to fully understand the benefits that could be obtained. This electromagnetically controlled system necessitates around an extremely fast response valve, which opens and closes continually throughout the welding process. This creates a pulsing of the shielding gas, further reducing consumption whilst maintaining optimal shielding gas flow. The unit has been identified to reduce the initial gas surge at weld initiation and results in a virtually instant decay of gas flow at weld termination. These particular characteristics {{have been found to be}} ideally suited to saving shielding gas when carrying out <b>intermittent</b> or stitch <b>welding.</b> It was established that the use of this valve generated deeper penetration in fillet welds, which in turn has highlighted the potential to increase the welding speed, therefore further reducing gas consumption.

We analyze all M and X-class flares observed with GOES and AIA/SDO {{during the first two}} years of the SDO mission, amounting to 155 events. We find that most flares operate in the sub-diffusive regime (β= 0. 53 ± 0. 27), which we interpret in terms of anisotropic <b>chain</b> reactions of <b>intermittent</b> magnetic reconnection episodes in a low plasma-β corona.

Formation of such hydrophobic environment around the hydrocarbon chain may be viewed as the reason for the collapsed conformation gaining additional stability. We find a second anomalous behavior to emerge near x(DMSO) = 0. 15, due to a chain-like aggregation of the methyl groups of DMSO in water that lowers the relative concentration of the DMSO molecules in the hydration layer. We further find that as the concentration of DMSO is gradually increased, it progressively attains the extended coiled structure as the stable conformation. Although Flory-Huggins theory (for binary mixture solvent) fails to predict the anomaly at x(DMSO) = 0. 05, it seems to capture the essence of the anomaly at 0. 15...|$|R

Approved for public release; distribution is unlimitedThere is a great interest in the strength of fillet welds because the welding operation accounts for about 30 % of the labor cost in planning and constructing ship hulls. One way to reduce welding cost is to reduce the required weld size. Background information is obtained by reviewing the major experimental and theoretical work in the areas of static strength, fatigue strength, and shear strength of fillet welds. In order to appreciate the conditions in the real world, design considerations, fabrication considerations, and corrosion considerations are discussed. Typical joints from existing U. S. Navy ships are employed to obtain detailed geometry and local loading information to be used as input for a computer model which was developed at Massachusetts Institute of Technology which uses the finite element method for determining the static strength for fillet welds. In one particular joint a reduction of 30 % in the required weld size is justified.
