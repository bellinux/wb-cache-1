Since Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and Rawls' principle of social fairness will provide a powerful support for the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>probability,</b> then the principle of maximum entropy is available in a just and equilibrium economy so that an income distribution will occur spontaneously (with the largest probability). Remarkably, some scholars have observed such an income distribution in some democratic countries, e. g. USA. This result implies that the hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>probability</b> may be only suitable for some "fair" systems (economic or physical systems).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present two new {{approaches}} to planetary rover perception. One approach concerns stereo driving without 3 -D reconstruction. This approach begins with weakly calibrated stereo images, and evaluates the traversability of terrain using shape indicators such as relative slope and relative elevation. The approach then evaluates candidate paths based on the traversability analysis and generates the best path. The second approach involves estimating vehicle position by observing the Sun. At a given time, a measurement of the Sun 2 ̆ 7 s altitude constrains the observer to lie on a circle on the terrestrial surface called the <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> altitude.
