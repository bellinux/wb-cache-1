The effect of chronic exposure to carbon monoxide can depend on the stage of pregnancy in which the mother is exposed. Exposure during the embryonic stage can have neurological consequences, such as telencephalic dysgenesis, behavioral difficulties during infancy, and reduction of cerebellum volume. There are also possible skeletal defects that could result from exposure to carbon monoxide during the embryonic stage, such as hand and foot malformations, hip dysplasia, hip subluxation, agenisis of a limb, and inferior maxillary atresia with glossoptosis. Also, carbon monoxide exposure between days 35 and 40 of embryonic development can lead to an increased risk of the child developing a cleft palate. Exposure to carbon monoxide or polluted ozone exposure can also lead to cardiac defects of the ventrical septal, pulmonary artery and heart valves.

To determine if microstructural changes in WM are responsible for the delayed onset of cognitive symptoms, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with CO intoxication. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI was performed in 14 patients with delayed sequelae after CO intoxication and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers. The fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of several WM regions were measured. We also determined the correlation between FA of the selected WM and neuropsychological rating scores for the CO intoxi-cation group. RESULTS: FA of patients with CO intoxication decreased in the corpus callosum, orbitofrontal WM, high frontal WM, parietal WM, and temporal lobes in comparison with the corresponding regions of healthy controls. FA of the WM in the occipital lobe and internal capsule of patients was not significantly different from that in controls. ADCs of all measuredWM increased significantly in patients exposed to CO.

Chronic <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> <b>intoxication</b> may mimic the episodic nature and familial predisposition of migraine attacks. Normal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not exclude the diagnosis, and smoking is a confounding factor. In emergency rooms, patients presenting with headaches had higher levels of carboxyhemoglobin, but, {{as far as we}} know, there have been no studies investigating carboxyhemoglobin levels in migraine patients.

40|$|Deficits {{in speech}} motor control {{and in the}} {{comprehension}} of syntax were observed as {{five members of the}} 1993 American Sagarmatha Expedition ascended Mt. Everest. We analyzed speech recordings and cognitive test scores of the climbers at different altitudes. The mean “voice onset time ” interval that differentiates “voiced ” stop consonants from their “unvoiced ” counterparts (e. g., a [b] from a [p]) decreased from 24. 0 ms at Base Camp to 5. 4 ms at Camp Three. The time needed to comprehend simple spoken English sentences increased by 50 % at higher altitudes, and was correlated with speech motor deterioration. This pattern of deficits is similar to that noted for Parkinson’s disease and may reflect disruption of subcortical pathways to prefrontal cortex. Similar procedures could be used to remotely assess cognitive impairments caused by hypoxia, <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> or alcohol <b>intoxication,</b> or drugs, in order to monitor crew behavior in aeronautics and spaceflight operations, or to evaluate the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease...|$|R
40|$|Presence of parkinsonian {{features}} after <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO) <b>intoxication</b> is {{well known}} and the severity was found {{to relate to the}} pre-synaptic dopaminergic deficits. There is no systemic study to analyse the functional network involved in CO-related Parkinsonism. Forty-five CO-related parkinsonism patients and 25 aged-matched controls completed the 3 D T 1 -weighted imaging and 18 F-fluoro- 2 -deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to assess the structural and functional brain differences between the patients and controls. Spatial covariant networks responsible for distinguishing patients and controls were constructed using independent component analysis. For validation, the pre-synaptic dopaminergic functional network was established by regression model using striatal TRODAT- 1 SPECT as the independent variable. The clinical significance of both networks was determined by correlation with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Compared with controls, the spatial covariant signals of FDG-PET were significantly lower in the medial and lateral frontal, caudate nucleus, dorsomedial prefrontal areas and temporal-parietal regions while the spatial intensities correlated significantly with UPDRS total scores. The functional network that correlated with striatum pre-synaptic dopaminergic uptakes included the midbrain, thalamus, caudate, lateral frontal cortex, ventral striatum, ventral or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Both networks overlapped considerably and the topographies reflected structural damage pattern. Our study provides evidence that glucose metabolism in CO-parkinsonism patients pertains to an organized covariant pattern in the cortical regions that is spatially coherent with the cortical map of pre-synaptic dopamine deficits. As the fronto-temporal, striatum and temporal-parietal areas were involved, the unique metabolic covariant network suggests a different pathophysiology in CO-related parkinsonism...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the neurologic function, spatial learning and memory, histology, and changes of intracellular signal transduction in rat brain in <b>carbon</b> <b>monoxide</b> (CO) <b>intoxication.</b> CO intoxication was induced with inhalation of 0. 3 % CO for 40 minutes (Maximum HbCO; 78 %) in the rats artificially ventilated and anesthetized with 0. 5 % halothane. The rats were followed for 3 to 14 days after CO exposure. The neurologic disturbances such as muscle weakness, gait disturbance, and hypoactivity were observed in 30 - 40 % of animals exposed to CO. Disturbance of spatial learning and memory, evaluated with water maze test, was also observed from the llth day to the 14 th day. Despite scarce neuronal death in the substantia nigra, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex on light microscopy, significant changes of intracellular signal transduction mediated by G protein, adenylate cyclase, and protein kinase C were found; the binding sites for [^ 3 H]GTP in the hippocampus (7 - 12 %) and cerebral cortex (9 - 13 %), [^ 3 H]forskolin in the globus pallidus (33 %) and caudate nucleus (21 %), and [^ 3 H]PDBu in the substantia nigra (29 - 40 %) and caudate nucleus (17 - 18 %) decreased significantly 3 and 14 days after CO exposure. The [^ 3 H]QNB binding sites did not change in any region of the brain examined. These results indicate that, in CO intoxication with minimal histologic damages, impairement of intracellular signal transduction can be induced in association with neurologic dysfunction and disturbed spatial learning and memory...|$|R
