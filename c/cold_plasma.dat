5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or <b>cold</b> <b>plasma</b> and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when hot plasma from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of <b>cold</b> <b>plasma</b> outward.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} {{encountered}} in deciphering {{the dynamics of}} the Jovian magnetosphere is the transport of heavy <b>cold</b> <b>plasma</b> from the Io torus at 6RJ to the outer magnetosphere at distances of more than 50RJ. The precise mechanism of this process is not known, but it is hypothesized to occur as a result of plasma diffusion due to interchange instability. The process is similar to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in hydrodynamics. In the case of the Jovian magnetosphere, centrifugal force plays the role of gravity; the heavy liquid is the cold and dense Ionian (i.e. pertaining to Io) plasma, and the light liquid is the hot, much less dense plasma from the outer magnetosphere. The instability leads to an exchange between the outer and inner parts of the magnetosphere of flux tubes filled with plasma. The buoyant empty flux tubes move towards the planet, while pushing the heavy tubes, filled with the Ionian plasma, away from Jupiter. This interchange of flux tubes is a form of magnetospheric turbulence.|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} {{to describe the}} out-of-equilibrium free electrons in <b>cold</b> <b>plasmas</b> is developed assuming the electron entropy is defined through the Boltzmann H-theorem. Our theory explains why the Saha-Boltzmann relation among higher-lying excited states {{by means of the}} electron kinetic temperature is fulfilled, even when free electrons are far from equilibrium. The thermodynamic electron temperature, pressure and chemical potential have been introduced through the derivatives of the electron entropy. It is demonstrated that under usual conditions in <b>cold</b> <b>plasmas,</b> e. g. when the electron distribution function possesses the Maxwellian, Druyvestein or Kappa functional forms, kinetic and thermodynamic electron temperatures yield the same value. © Copyright EPLA, 2013.

Amongst these are the generation of large volume low temperature plasmas, the interaction of microwaves with plasmas, and the biomedical applications of <b>cold</b> <b>plasmas,</b> a field known as “Plasma Medicine”. In the latter, he published seminal papers on the interaction of low temperature plasmas with biological cells.

25|$|For both Jupiter and Saturn, {{transport}} of plasma {{from the inner}} to the outer parts of the magnetosphere {{is thought to be}} related to interchange instability. In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, waterrich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with hot plasma arriving from the outer magnetosphere. The instability is driven by centrifugal force exerted by the plasma on the magnetic field. The <b>cold</b> <b>plasma</b> is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail. The plasmoids move down the tail and escape from the magnetosphere. The reconnection or substorm process is thought to be {{under the control of the}} solar wind and Saturn's largest moon Titan, which orbits near the outer boundary of the magnetosphere.|$|E

2500|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} {{divided into four}} regions. The innermost region co-located with Saturn's planetary rings, inside approximately 3Rs, has a strictly dipolar magnetic field. It is largely devoid of plasma, which is absorbed by ring particles, although the radiation belts of Saturn are located in this innermost region just {{inside and outside the}} rings. The second region between 3 and 6Rs contains the <b>cold</b> <b>plasma</b> torus and is called the inner magnetosphere. It contains the densest plasma in the saturnian system. The plasma in the torus originates from the inner icy moons and particularly from Enceladus. The magnetic field in this region is also mostly dipolar. [...] The third region lies between 6 and 12–14Rs and is called the dynamic and extended plasma sheet. The magnetic field in this region is stretched and non-dipolar, whereas the plasma is confined to a thin equatorial plasma sheet. The fourth outermost region is located beyond 15Rs at high latitudes and continues up to magnetopause boundary. It is characterized by a low plasma density and a variable, non-dipolar magnetic field strongly influenced by the Solar wind.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Cold</b> {{atmospheric}} <b>plasma</b> could {{constitute an}} alternative against multi-drug resistant pathogens. Susceptibility of enterococci to <b>cold</b> atmospheric <b>plasma</b> {{was investigated in}} vitro. Methods: 39 clinical isolates of enterococci were grouped dependent {{on the most important}} resistance patterns and treated on agar using dielectric barrier discharge plasma. These included enterococci with combined vancomycin- and high-level gentamicin resistance, high-level resistance to gentamicin (HLGR) only, vancomycin resistance alone (VRE), and enterococci susceptible to both. Susceptibility to <b>cold</b> atmospheric <b>plasma</b> was evaluated based on the zones of inhibition and examined in terms of the enterococcal group and the “degree” of drug resistance. Results: <b>Cold</b> atmospheric <b>plasma</b> treatment killed all groups. Comparison of VRE and HLGR strains with non-VRE and non-HLGR isolates concerning zones of inhibition revealed that enterococci with special resistance patterns (VRE and HLGR) showed significantly smaller zones of inhibition than the sensitive ones. The mean of all isolates, irrespective of belonging to groups, showed smaller zones of inhibition with increasing “degree” of drug resistance. Conclusions: <b>Cold</b> atmospheric <b>plasma</b> treatment killed all isolates of enterococci, but its efficacy depended on the “degree” of drug resistance and on membership in special resistance groups with particular clinical-outbreak importance. However, a possible role of the different genetic lineages, which might be prone to acquiring more or less resistance phenotypes, may also play a role in this context...|$|R
