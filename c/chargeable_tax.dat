Capital gains tax is charged on the disposal of assets, and is based on any [...] "real gain" [...] made from the disposal.

Capital Gains Tax is a form of <b>tax</b> <b>chargeable</b> on capital gains arising from the disposal of chargeable assets. This paper examines the nature and the justification for Capital Gain Tax as a lucrative ground for raising revenue for development especially in the developing countries. In Nigeria, Capital Gain Tax is yet to yield the desired result in terms of raising revenue for the government. Our theoretical work on this subject explain reasons which includes lack of awareness, inadequate data and the high rate of inflation which has led to high incidence of avoidance of Capital Gain Tax. Arguments against capital gain tax in Nigeria are examined as well as issues, suggestions and recommendations for the effectiveness of this form of taxation. This paper recommends more aggressive awareness campaign, reduction of tax rate and even a merger of capital gain with income tax to reduce cost of collection.

The {{source of employment}} is laid down in the Goepfert Rules and Departmental Interpretation and Practice Note No.10. However, those individuals who visit Hong Kong for not exceeding 60 days will be exempt from paying Salaries Tax. This provision is known as [...] "sixty-day rule". [...] Employment sourced in Hong Kong will be fully <b>chargeable</b> to Salaries <b>Tax</b> whereas offshore employment will be chargeable on a [...] "time-in-time-out" [...] basis, the taxable income {{of which will be}} apportioned by reference to the days staying at Hong Kong. Employment of a government civil servant is considered sourced in Hong Kong and therefore its income is always fully taxable in Hong Kong.The above-mentioned [...] "sixty-day rule" [...] shall not be applied to seamen and aircrew. Instead, they are bound by stricter conditions for exemption. To exempt from charge of Salaries tax, they shall be present in Hong Kong not more than 60 days in the year and not more than 120 days in the two consecutive years, {{one of them is the}} current tax year.|$|R
5000|$|Hart {{and nine}} others were {{teachers}} at Malvern College, where from 1983 to 1986 they {{took advantage of}} a [...] "concessionary fee" [...] scheme, which allowed their children to be educated at rates one fifth of those paid by other pupils. They disputed the amount of tax they had to pay under the 1976 Finance Act, Section 63 of which said that: [...] The cash equivalent of any benefit <b>chargeable</b> to <b>tax</b> ... is an amount equal to the cost equivalent of the benefit, less so much (if any) of it as is made good by the employee to those providing the benefit ... {{the cost of a}} benefit is the amount of any expense incurred in or in connection with its provision, and (here and in those subsections) includes a proper proportion of any expense". [...] The Inland Revenue, attempting to tax this benefit, argued that the [...] "cost" [...] of the benefit meant an average of the cost of providing it; if there were 100 pupils at a school that cost £1,000,000 a year to run, the [...] "cost" [...] per pupil was £10,000. Hart and his fellow teachers disputed this and argued that it was instead marginal cost, saying that other than food, stationery, laundry and similar there was no cost to the school due to the children's presence that would not be there already. The Special Commissioners (an appellate body for income tax claims), ruling in favour of Hart, noted that not only was the school not full to capacity, with the teachers' children having no impact on waiting lists, but that the [...] "concessionary fee" [...] covered all costs incurred by the school in the course of educating those particular pupils. It was found, however, that during debate on the Finance Act, ministers had made statements in the House of Commons which supported the idea that such [...] "benefits" [...] should be excluded from tax.|$|R
