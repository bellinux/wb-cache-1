2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet when it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except he called me mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he {{has been shown to be}} as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|Said Steve Kroft on the May 8, 2011, {{edition of}} 60 Minutes, [...] "For {{more than a}} decade, bin Laden managed to elude the U.S. {{military}} and intelligence establishments, and he taunted three U.S. presidents. That finally ended last Sunday, {{and the last thing}} bin Laden saw was a Navy SEAL in the third floor bedroom of his compound in Pakistan." [...] According to The Economist, [...] "The silence of the usual critics of 'illegal', 'extrajudicial', targeted killing in the wake of America's killing of Osama bin Laden might reflect hypocrisy, sure. But this can be tough to distinguish from resignation to the fact that Mr Obama didn't submit his case for executing Mr bin Laden to some global civil authority because there isn't one and he didn't have to—because America's the biggest kid on the block and, ultimately, what America says goes. And, if it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> Britain, France, Italy, Russia and other powerful governments hope America will indulge their own kill-squad adventures with similar approving silences. Of course, if some aggrieved faction in the future seeks retribution through the targeted killing of one of these countries' leaders, that will be raw vengeance, that will be terrorism, that will be an international crime, because, like it or not, that's how it works." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} mainly written and {{recorded}} in the girls' home in Los Angeles with German songwriter Toby Gad. Jessica Origliasso states [...] "It was really great. Toby works on a simplified set-up on his Mac computer. It takes all the pressure out {{of being in a}} recording studio. We were able to take our time and get it right and not stress about time ticking." [...] When working on the album the girls knew exactly which songwriters they wanted to work with including Billy Steinberg (who has worked with Madonna) and John Feldmann (who has worked with Good Charlotte and The Used). The songwriting saw the girls write about personal things in life mainly to do with love. The song [...] "Revenge Is Sweeter (Than You Ever Were)" [...] is about a person who Lisa Origliasso dated overseas, she states [...] "When it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> that song's about cheating. A {{lot of people have been}} through it, like I've been through it, so it was very easy to relate to that situation. And I saw that whole situation go on, so it wasn't hard to write that song with her." [...] Another personal song includes [...] "In Another Life", is the most emotional song they've ever written. Lisa states that [...] "While recording this song we couldn't sing it properly because we were bawling our eyes out". Jess says, [...] "You actually hear me sniffing in the background".|$|E
2500|$|Hannah Montana 3 {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic, {{spoke of the}} album negatively, even more than Hannah Montana 2 and [...] On the review, Phares complains that the albums have not grown since the commence of the franchise by stating: [...] "Miley Cyrus was 13 {{years old when she}} started performing as Hannah Montana, but by the time Hannah Montana 3 was released, she was nearly 17. That's a pretty big span of time in a teenager's life, but you'd never know it from listening to these songs." [...] Another point which was brought by the reviewer was that the alteration from [...] "fizzy pop" [...] to [...] "searching ballads" [...] was too sudden. She described [...] "Ice Cream Freeze (Let's Chill)" [...] as [...] "extremely similar" [...] to Cyrus's own [...] "Hoedown Throwdown" [...] which wasn't received well by critics and others were too [...] "equally cookie-cutter". To AllMusic the nadir of the album is [...] "Just a Girl". She mentioned [...] "the only thing worse than a big star singing about how fame has damaged her is a big child star singing about how fame has damaged her." [...] Overall she said: [...] "Hannah Montana 3 seems to give fans exactly what they want, but the calculation behind this music overwhelms the fun that used to be in it." [...] Warren Truit of About.com, looked at the album also from [...] "a preteen's point of view" [...] and taking into account that the songs are not supposed to represent her real life. Truit compared [...] "It's All Right Here" [...] and [...] "He Could Be the One" [...] to Shania Twain. He said the songs were a mix of Gwen Stefani, Joan Jett and Avril Lavigne with [...] "fizzy Radio Disney pop rock". They also felt [...] "Ice Cream Freeze" [...] was just as [...] "goofy" [...] as [...] "Hoedown Throwdown". As a summary he commented: [...] "When it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack is harmless, poppy fun for preteen music fans. The tunes on the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack may be a little cookie-cutter, but at least the songwriters realize who their audience is and they deliver the goods, unlike the Jonas Brothers' recent genre-jumping mishmash disaster Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Hannah Montana devotees will absolutely love the Hannah Montana 3 Soundtrack, and parents can actually tolerate most of the songs on the album." [...] Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly, was also on a lighter and more positive perspective on the album. He said: ...|$|E

5000|$|Euphoria is Iglesias' first bilingual album. He {{described}} the album by saying, [...] "It's the first album I've ever released that's 50-50, ... I thought that when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> artistically, {{it would help}} me because it would put the Spanish songs against the English. I've created a little competition inside my head. I {{do not want to}} do a double album, and I've been writing this album for a year-and-a-half, ... So I want <b>to</b> make sure <b>it's</b> the very best I can give fans."

Also the phalanx soldier cannot operate in either smaller units or singly, whereas the Roman formation is highly flexible.

During the game the only way to change the lineup is via substitution, as batting out of turn is not allowed. Once the ninth person in the lineup finishes batting, the first person bats again; this is the top of the order. Lineups are designed to facilitate manufacturing runs. Depending on batters' skills, they might be placed {{in different parts of the}} lineup.

5000|$|Brice Ezell of Popmatters, on {{the other}} hand, gave the album a mixed review, writing [...] "When it <b>comes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> these tracks really aren't that bad, but it's hard {{not to have the}} echoes of savvier songwriting in your head when {{listening}} to a group like Trail of Dead, whose history has shown them to be more sophisticated musicians than the ones present on Lost Songs." [...] MusicOMH's Thomas May criticized the political-themed lyrics, writing [...] "Trail Of Dead display the difficulty of dealing with such issues musically: this album is either overly clumsy in its attempts to make its points explicitly or, when operating more abstractly, appears immature in its undirected angst." ...|$|E
60|$|This is a {{beautiful}} and very fertile valley, about twenty miles long and five or six broad; a bright cold stream called the Fourche de Glace, or Ice River, runs through it. Its sheltered situation, embosomed in mountains, renders it good pasturaging ground in the winter time; when the elk <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in great numbers, driven {{out of the mountains}} by the snow. The Indians then resort <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hunt. They likewise come <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in the summer time to dig the camash root, of which it produces immense quantities.
