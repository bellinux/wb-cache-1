5|$|When Congress {{created the}} Michigan Territory in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's {{language}} {{to define the}} territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed from that in Ohio's state constitution. This difference, and its potential ramifications, apparently went unnoticed at the time, but it established the legal basis for the <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> would erupt 30 years later.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> {{is part of}} the party's {{background}} was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were directly involved in the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E
40|$|Taking {{the example}} of the annual Kurayami Festival at the Ookunitama Shrine in Tokyo’s Fuchu city, this thesis will {{consider}} the handling of <b>conflicts</b> <b>that</b> arise at the festivals, and also the "rules" of festivals which can be seen from that example. Although various conflicts may arise at festivals, these are handled according to different rules than those applied to <b>conflicts</b> <b>that</b> arise in everyday life. Kurayami Festival, which is also sometimes called the "Argument Festival", is known for its frequent conflicts. This thesis takes as examples <b>conflicts</b> <b>that</b> have arisen at the Kurayami festival, and clarifies the reasons for the conflicts, how they were handled,and according to which "rules". In addition, by posing the question "why was he hit?", this thesis aims to offer a new viewpoint {{on the issue of the}} <b>conflicts</b> <b>that</b> arise at festivals...|$|R

The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory {{were given to the}} recently annexed Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt Do'Urden's {{stories are}} set in the Forgotten Realms {{campaign}} setting for Dungeons & Dragons. The character has been a mainstay for author R. A. Salvatore, appearing in his novels for over 20 years. Drizzt is a drow who acts against the drow stereotype, favoring friendship and peace over hatred and violence. His unusual personality creates the <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> allows Salvatore to create so many novels with stories about courage and friendship. Drizzt fights the dark traits that are inherent in the drow.|$|E
5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E

5|$|Migration from Cyprus to the UK has {{occurred}} {{in part due to}} the colonial links between the countries and the internal <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> followed Cyprus' independence from the British Empire in 1960. Migration peaked at the time of independence but has continued on a smaller scale. The number of Cypriot-born people in the UK fell between the 1991 and 2001 censuses, but the community, including people of Cypriot ancestry, remains sizeable, and the Cypriot-born population grew slightly between the 2001 and 2011 censuses.|$|E
5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} role {{in shaping}} the church's doctrines and practices—it was influenced by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were played out in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism. Conservatives dissatisfied with liberal trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.|$|E

5|$|PedroI invaded Portugal at {{the head}} of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a {{national}} civil war, he soon became involved in a wider <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> enveloped the Iberian Peninsula in a struggle between proponents of Liberalism and those seeking a return to Absolutism. PedroI died of tuberculosis on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago race riot of 1919 {{was a major}} racial <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> {{began in}} Chicago, Illinois, on July 27, 1919, and ended on August 3.

It is {{considered}} {{the worst of the}} approximately 25 riots during the Red Summer, so named because of the violence and fatalities across the nation. The combination of prolonged arson, looting, and murder made it the worst race riot in the history of Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The Winnebago War, {{also known}} as the Winnebago Uprising, was a brief <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> took place in 1827 in the Upper Mississippi River region of the United States, {{primarily}} in what is now the state of Wisconsin. Not quite a war, the hostilities were limited to a few attacks on American civilians by a portion of the Winnebago (or Ho-Chunk) Native American tribe. The Ho-Chunks were reacting to a wave of lead miners trespassing on their lands, and to false rumors that the United States had sent two Ho-Chunk prisoners to a rival tribe for execution.|$|E

5|$|Thomas is also speculated to {{have been}} one of the driving forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> took place in 1240. The {{speculation}} is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
5|$|After the United States officially {{entered the}} war, Hispanic Americans {{were among the}} many American {{citizens}} who {{joined the ranks of}} the United States Marine Corps as volunteers or through the draft. Hispanic Americans in the Marines fought in every major battle in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The battles of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between U.S. Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army. Among them PFC Guy Gabaldon who single-handed captured over 1,000 prisoners. It was during this <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> four Hispanics would also participate as military commanders in the Marine Corps. The two highest-ranking Hispanics in the Marines were Lieutenant General Pedro Augusto del Valle, the first Hispanic to reach the grade of general in the Marines, and Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr..|$|E
5|$|After their retreat, {{the native}} Theban kings found {{themselves}} trapped between the Canaanite Hyksos ruling {{the north and}} the Hyksos' Nubian allies, the Kushites, to the south of Egypt. After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a <b>conflict</b> <b>that</b> lasted more than 30 years, until 1555BC. The pharaohs Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos. That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt. He established a new dynasty. In the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the pharaohs seeking to expand Egypt's borders and attempting to gain mastery of the Near East.|$|E
