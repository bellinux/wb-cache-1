5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye.</b> In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye,</b> {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended to shoot the story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> is narrated in a {{subjective}} style {{from the point}} of view of Holden Caulfield, following his exact thought processes.

25|$|Chapman's {{obsession}} with the central character and message of The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye</b> added to controversy about the novel.

25|$|From J.D.

Immigrant authors such as Vladimir Nabokov, with Lolita, forged on with the theme, and, at almost the same time, the beatniks took a concerted step away from their Lost Generation predecessors, developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on Eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs.|$|E
25|$|Anyway, I keep picturing {{all these}} little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around – nobody big, I mean – except me.

What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them.

25|$|Links have {{sometimes}} been drawn between Chapman's actions {{and those of}} other killers or attempted killers. John Hinckley, who only months later tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan, was also associated with The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye.</b> It has been said that Hinckley mourned Lennon’s death. Furthermore, John Hinckley's father, John Hinckley, Sr, was president of World Vision, for whom Chapman was employed. A writer who experienced mental illness in the same city as Jared Loughner has suggested that examples such as Chapman's show the need to challenge stigma about mental health problems and ensure there are good community mental health services including crisis intervention.|$|E

25|$|Chapman's {{experiences}} {{during the}} weekend on which he committed the murder have {{been turned into a}} feature-length movie called Chapter 27, in which he is played by Jared Leto. The film was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer and is based on the Jones book. The film's title is a reference to The <b>Catcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rye,</b> which has 26 chapters. Chapter 27 premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2007 and received polarized reactions from critics. The film had a limited release in theaters in the United States in March 2008. Chapter 27 was released widely onto DVD on September 30, 2008. Another film was made before the feature film entitled The Killing of John Lennon starring Jonas Ball as Chapman, which documents Chapman's life before and up to the murder and portrays Chapman in a somewhat sympathetic light. The film features Ball as Chapman narrating the film and states that all the words are Chapman's own.|$|E
