500|$|It is disputed whether {{lanthanum}} and actinium {{should be}} included in group 3, rather than lutetium and lawrencium. Other d-block groups are composed of four transition metals, and group 3 is sometimes considered to follow suit. Scandium and yttrium are always classified as group 3 elements, but it is controversial which elements should follow them in group 3, lanthanum and actinium or lutetium and lawrencium. Scerri has proposed a resolution to this debate on the basis of moving to a 32-column table and consideration of which option results in a <b>continuous</b> <b>sequence</b> of atomic number increase. [...] He thereby finds that group 3 should consist of Sc, Y, Lu, Lr. [...] The current IUPAC definition of the term [...] "lanthanoid" [...] includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and lutetium, and that of [...] "transition element" [...] applies to lanthanum and actinium, as well as lutetium but not lawrencium, since it does not correctly follow the Aufbau principle. Normally, the 103rd electron would enter the d-subshell, but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration is actually 7s25f147p15f146d1, with the normal incomplete 6d-subshell in the neutral state. due to relativistic effects. IUPAC thus has not recommended a specific format for the in-line-f-block periodic table, leaving the dispute open.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of using the technique, it was {{understood}} that it depended on the atmospheric / ratio having remained the same over the preceding few thousand years. To verify the accuracy of the method, several artefacts that were datable by other techniques were tested; the results of the testing were in reasonable agreement with the true ages of the objects. Over time, however, discrepancies began to appear between the known chronology for the oldest Egyptian dynasties and the radiocarbon dates of Egyptian artefacts. Neither the pre-existing Egyptian chronology nor the new radiocarbon dating method could be assumed to be accurate, but a third possibility was that the / ratio had changed over time. [...] The question was resolved by the study of tree rings: comparison of overlapping series of tree rings allowed the construction of a <b>continuous</b> <b>sequence</b> of tree-ring data that spanned 8,000 years. [...] (Since that time the tree-ring data series has been extended to 13,900 years.) [...] In the 1960s, Hans Suess was able to use the tree-ring sequence to show that the dates derived from radiocarbon were consistent with the dates assigned by Egyptologists. [...] This was possible because although annual plants, such as corn, have a / ratio that reflects the atmospheric ratio at the time they were growing, trees only add material to their outermost tree ring in any given year, while the inner tree rings don't get their [...] replenished and instead start losing [...] through decay. [...] Hence each ring preserves a record of the atmospheric / ratio of the year it grew in. [...] Carbon-dating the wood from the tree rings themselves provides the check needed on the atmospheric / ratio: with a sample of known date, and a measurement of the value of N (the number of atoms of [...] remaining in the sample), the carbon-dating equation allows the calculation of N0 – the number of atoms of [...] in the sample at the time the tree ring was formed – and hence the / ratio in the atmosphere at that time. Equipped with the results of carbon-dating the tree rings, it became possible to construct calibration curves designed to correct the errors caused by the variation over time in the / ratio. These curves are described in more detail below.|$|E
