5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} {{would be about}} pool hustling, however as writing ensued, the script went through several incarnations until the Simpsons writers settled on the grifting story seen in the episode. Omine read several books about grifters for {{preparation}} for writing the episode. The other writers also prepared themselves by watching several heist films, including House of Games, Paper Moon and The Sting, the latter {{two of which are}} referenced in the episode.

5|$|The 2007 musical Enchanted, {{in which}} she played a cheerful Disney Princess, was Adams' first major success as a leading lady. She {{followed}} it by playing naive, optimistic women {{in a series of}} films, including in the 2008 drama Doubt. She subsequently played stronger female parts to positive reviews in the sports film The Fighter (2010), and the psychological drama The Master (2012). In 2013, she began portraying Lois Lane in superhero films set in the DC Extended Universe. She won two consecutive Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress for playing a seductive <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> in the crime film American Hustle (2013) and the troubled painter Margaret Keane in the biopic Big Eyes (2014). In 2016, she received acclaim for her leading roles in the science fiction film Arrival and the psychological thriller Nocturnal Animals.|$|E
5|$|The Marx Brothers {{had been}} stage {{performers}} {{since the early}} 1900s. By the 1930s, their act consisted of wisecracking leader Groucho, the chronically silent Harpo, the overly ethnic Chico, and the strangely normal Zeppo. The plot of the seminal comedy Duck Soup (1933) is quite convoluted. Groucho's plebeian character is named king of the fictional Freedonia, and he is pursued by two bumbling spies played by Chico and Harpo. Zeppo plays a typically normal secretary. Groucho's <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> character leads Freedonia into war with neighboring Sylvania. The plot essentially exists to {{provide a framework for}} several comedic bits and long sketches. The film was unsuccessful at the box office and the anarchic zaniness and subversive nature of the comedy in the film would be unmatched in the brothers' post-Code work, which was more standardly burlesque.|$|E

5|$|Kubrick {{is widely}} {{referenced}} in popular culture, and the TV series The Simpsons {{is said to}} contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. Pop singer Lady Gaga's concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from A Clockwork Orange. Several films have been made related to Kubrick's life, including the mockumentary film Dark Side of the Moon (2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had {{been involved with the}} faked footage of the NASA moon landings during the filming of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Colour Me Kubrick (2005), starring John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> who had assumed Kubrick's identity in the 1990s. Both films were authorized by Kubrick's family. In the 2004 film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, Kubrick was portrayed by Stanley Tucci, and documents their filming of Dr. Strangelove, rather than Lolita.|$|E

Later, Sawyer is revealed to be a <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> in debt with a loan shark, Kilo (Billy Mayo), who demands his money back, plus fifty percent, by the next day. Sawyer goes to Jessica's house to finalize the deal, but reconsiders upon seeing a small boy (Jim Woitas) emerge from another room.

5|$|The episode {{begins as}} Walt furiously notices a motion-detecting {{surveillance}} camera {{that has been}} installed in the lab. Later that day, Skyler convinces Walt {{in a meeting with}} Saul to buy the car wash by mentioning how the owner insulted his manhood. She devises a plan to trick the owner into selling by having a <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> (supplied by Saul) pretend to be a water-tester who is shutting down the business out of concerns over contaminants. The owner promptly sells to her, agreeing to an even lower price than her original offer. Jesse is still feeling numb from recent events, attempting to clear his head with nostalgic go-kart trips. He continues to open his house up for all-night drug-fueled orgies, deliberately throwing piles of money {{in the midst of the}} chaos. Angry and frustrated by Hank's continuous cold shoulder, Marie resumes her kleptomania; she starts stealing objects from real-estate open houses, where she also makes up elaborate stories about who she is, but is eventually caught by a real-estate agent. A livid Hank pulls strings with a senior police officer to get her out of being charged.

During this time he works with U.S. Marshal Leigh Johnson (Anthony De Longis) and his deputies, <b>con</b> <b>artist</b> Nigel West Dickens (Don Creech), treasure hunter and grave robber Seth Briars (Kevin Glikmann), and an unreliable alcoholic arms dealer known only as Irish (K.
