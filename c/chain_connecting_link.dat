40|$|Abstract. A {{heuristic}} search procedure for inventing legal arguments {{is built on}} two tools already widely in use in argumentation. Argumentation schemes are forms of argument representing premise-conclusion and inference structures of common types of arguments. Schemes especially useful in law represent defeasible argu-ments, like argument from expert opinion. Argument diagramming is a visualiza-tion tool used to display a <b>chain</b> of <b>connected</b> arguments <b>linked</b> together. One such tool, Araucaria, available free a...|$|R
40|$|We study quantum {{entanglement}} distribution on networks with full-rank bi-partite mixed states linking qubits on nodes. In particular, we use entanglement swapping and purification to partially entangle widely separated nodes. The simplest method consists of performing entanglement swappings along the shortest <b>chain</b> of <b>links</b> <b>connecting</b> the two nodes. However, {{we show that}} this method may be improved upon by choosing a protocol with a specific ordering of swappings and purifications. A priori, the design that produces optimal improvement is not clear. However, we parametrize the choices and find that the optimal values depend strongly on the desired measure of improvement. As an initial application, we apply the new improved protocols to the Erdös [...] Rényi network and obtain results including low density limits and an exact calculation of the average entanglement gained at the critical point.

50|$|Although not {{necessarily}} sharing any general suspension characteristics, these designs all share a certain structural benefit. Because the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> are so short, the floating link {{comes in the}} form of a rigid rear triangle big enough to encompass the rear wheel. This allows the rear triangle on both sides of the wheel to be rigidly connected together as one piece, before attaching to the <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> of the four-bar. This significantly increases lateral and torsional stiffness of the rear, often a weakness of four-bar designs, and reduces the load on the pivots, <b>connecting</b> <b>links</b> and joint between rear axle and frame.|$|R
