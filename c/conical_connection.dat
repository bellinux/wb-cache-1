30|$|The fixture-abutment {{connection}} type {{is also important}} for implant longevity. Quek et al. reported that narrow-diameter implants are more easily broken than wider implants {{because they have a}} narrow platform diameter [21]. However, different results are expected from implants with an internal connection. Certain {{studies have shown that the}} biomechanical stability of internal <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> implants is better than in butt-joint implants [22, 23]. Herein, we used implants with a <b>conical</b> <b>connection,</b> and the force on implants with a <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> was not focused on a screw but a connection.|$|E
30|$|Within the {{limitations}} of this study, judicious use of platform-switched narrow implants with a <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> must be considered an alternative for wide-diameter implants to restore a posterior edentulous region.|$|E

30|$|<b>Conical</b> hybrid <b>connection</b> {{was used}} in this study as it was proven that the conical hybrid {{demonstrated}} the best stress distribution [20]. This <b>connection</b> has a <b>conical</b> union between the implant fixture and the abutment. In the conical abutment, lateral force is resisted by the taper design of the Morse taper connection. Thus, the stress concentration is resisted by the side-wall contact surface of its taper design. This stress concentration increases at the apical end of the side-wall contact surface where the implant fixture is thicker. This thickness might provide more resistance to the force, especially the off-axis loading force (as in case of angled abutment). Thus, in abutments with <b>conical</b> hybrid <b>connection</b> design, the screw is not the only source of resistance to loading force, as it is in abutments with an internal hexagonal design [21, 22].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the survival of implants with different implant-abutment connection systems, in patients who had two kinds of implants implanted. In total, 240 implants were implanted - 91 implants with <b>conical</b> abutment Morse <b>connection,</b> and 149 with an internal hexagonal connection. During the follow-up period of 3 years and 10 months, the percentage of lost implants with a <b>conical</b> implant-abutment <b>connection</b> was 1. 1 %. Regarding the implants with hexagonal implant-abutment connection, this figure was 0. 7 %. Our work shows that there is a need for further research on the survival of dental implants. In this, the influence of other factors should be explored that are related both to the specific implant treatment, as well as to socio-demographic factor...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the pen-implant soft tissues and the amount of inflammatory cells around two different implant-abutment connections (self-locking <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> with platform switching and screwed connection with standard abutment and internal anti-rotational system). Histological analysis was made of 14 implants, 7 with self-locking Morse tapered connection (experimental group A) and 7 with screw-retained anti-rotational connection (control group B). Sixty days after non-functional immediate loading, pen-implant tissue biopsies were performed. In the samples taken from the experimental group the pen-implant connective tissue consisted of a greater density of collagen and fibroblasts compared to the connective tissue of the control group. The experimental group specimens showed less inflammatory infiltrate close to the self-locking tapered connection compared to the tissues around the screw-retained connection. The SEM observations showed less microgap in the self-locking <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> than in the screw connections with standard abutment and internal anti-rotational system. The presence of connective tissue with few inflammatory cells and the absence of inflammatory infiltrate, in self-locking <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> implants is due to the minimal size of the implant-abutment microgap that does not allow the passage of fluids and bacteria from the oral cavity to the implant thus preventing tissue inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Peri-implant {{bone loss}} seems to occur {{following}} implant placement/loading regardless {{of all the}} efforts to eliminate it. Several factors, including surgical trauma, biologic width establishment, lack of passive fit of the superstructures, implant-abutment microgap, and occlusal overloading, may increase peri-implant bone loss. Over the years, new interface designs were introduced and clinical studies suggest that internal <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> and platform shifting may be advantageous for marginal bone preservation. Purpose: To compare clinical and radiological outcomes of two implant designs with different prosthetic interfaces and neck configurations in a randomized, controlled, split-mouth clinical trial. Materials and Methods: Thirty-four partially edentate patients randomly received at least one internal <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> with back-tapered collar and platform shifting design or external-hexagon implants with flat-to-flat implant-abutment interface. Primary end point was peri-implant bone level changes at different time points, failures of implants and/or prosthesis, any complications, implant stability quotient (ISQ) values, and periodontal parameters. Results: No dropout occurred. Marginal bone changes were statistically significantly different with better results for the internal <b>conical</b> <b>connection.</b> No implants and prosthesis failures have been observed, yielding a cumulative survival rate of 100 %. A high ISQ value was found for both implants, and {{no statistically significant difference}} was found for ISQ mean values between interventions at each time point (p > . 05). All implants showed no bleeding on probing and a very slight amount of plaque at the 1 -year-in-function visit. Conclusions: Both implant designs investigated performed similarly in terms of failure rates, providing successful results up to 1 year after loading. The back-tapered neck configuration with <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> and built-in platform shifting showed statistically lower marginal bone loss than straight neck configuration with flat-to-flat implant-abutment interface and external-hexagonal connection...|$|E

30|$|In Version 3 (Fig.  3 c), {{a number}} of {{improvements}} were applied. Two <b>conical</b> <b>connections</b> at the two ends of the column were designed to replace the clamp-connections used in Version 2. The two caps and body of the column were connected by the two conical joints (vaseline should be used at the connect contact {{in order to facilitate}} the disassembling step). The connection was strengthened by stainless steel springs (or rubber bands) and hooks surrounding four sides of the column. This design also improved the manipulation of packing material in the column, making it quicker and easier to use. The leakage problem was mostly prevented by the conical joint. After several tests, the advantages of this version were compared to the previous versions and noted in terms of its faster manufacture, easier manipulating and packing, and lower production cost. Experiencing the trials, however, it was observed that the lower conical cap was not really necessary and, as a consequence, further refinements were made resulting in the final version (Version 4).|$|R

30|$|Within the {{limitations}} of this study, the prognosis for narrow implants with a <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> in the posterior region is comparable to wider implants.

40|$|A microgap between implant and {{abutment}} connection {{can act as}} {{a bacterial}} source and cause inflammation, even endanger Osseointegration and subsequently change clinical and histological parameters. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the microgap and microbial leakage of implant-abutment connection in three different implant systems. In this experimental study, 28 implants in 3 groups (10 Zimmer with <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> of 8 degrees, 10 Dentium with <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> of 11 degrees, 8 Test implants with <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> of 16 degrees) were used. Microleakage of Escherichia coli was assessed at intervals of 5, 24, 48 hours and 2 weeks. Microgap was measured at 4 random points by scanning electron microscope. Data were analysed by Spss version 22 and kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Chisquare, Kaplan-Meier tests. (alpha= 0. 5) Mean microgap was 4. 8 mu m (+/- 2. 2) in Zimmer group, 3. 1 mu m (+/- 1. 4) in Implantium group and 16. 9 mu m (+/- 8. 7) in test group. After 2 weeks from start of the study, 20 percent of Zimmer and Dentium implants and 25 percent of test implant showed microleakage. Microleakage between Zimmer and Dentium implants was not significant; however, there was a significant difference between test implant and other groups. Microbial leakage was observed in all three implant systems. Although; there were differences in microgap between three groups, Microbial leakage was not statistically significant...|$|E
30|$|Regarding the {{stability}} of peri-implant hard and soft tissue, biological or anatomical factors {{are not the only}} elements that could be proven to have an impact. Technical factors such as the implant-abutment connection are also known to be key factors for long-term stable hard- and soft-tissue health [11]. Regarding the implant-abutment connection, which seems to be the key issue, located on the interface between the implant, the peri-implant bone, the peri-implant soft tissue, and the oral cavity, different studies have shown that a Morse-tapered <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> reduces the micro-movement and therefore the micro-motions, which results in a pump effect of sulcus fluid and microorganisms in the fragile peri-implant soft tissue [10, 12]. The <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> leads to a kind of “cold welding” type of connection that seems to prevent bone loss compared to external implant-abutment connections [10, 12].|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} {{retrospective}} study, implants of 7 -mm length and a specific implant design, including a <b>conical</b> implant-abutment <b>connection</b> and platform switching, {{placed in the}} posterior maxilla were investigated {{by means of a}} clinical and radiological analysis after a mean loading period of 5  years. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze whether a reduced implant length has any impact on implant success and peri-implant hard and soft tissue health.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} {{retrospective}} study, bone level implants (C-Tech Esthetic Line implants) were investigated clinically and radiologically. The bone level implant system has a Morse-locking <b>conical</b> implant-abutment <b>connection</b> with platform switching and an indexing hex that allows subcrestal implant placement and aims to prevent peri-implant bone loss. The {{surface of the}} implant system is manufactured by grit-blasting and acid-etching.

30|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on this type of implant–abutment connection [23, 34]. Sutter et al.

30|$|Implant–abutment {{connection}} can {{be divided}} into three types, external parallel connection (EP), internal parallel connection (IP), and <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> which has the friction between the implant and the abutment (CC). Nobel Biocare has implant systems with these three kinds of implant–abutment connections, and these connection systems are popular even in other manufacturers and they also employ one or some of these connection systems.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, cyclic tensile and {{compressive}} loading {{were applied to}} cantilever superstructure. In the clinical situation, both compressive and tensile force was exerted to implant-supported prosthesis, but no previous study has discussed the microleakage using model study under this situation. In case of <b>conical</b> <b>connection,</b> compressive force may have promoted a higher penetration of the abutments into implant body, which may eliminate microgap [5]. But in the clinical situation, tensile force may also be applied to abutment–implant interface as indicated above; the model employed {{in the present study}} may be pertinent.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{our study}} is to value the {{microbial}} contamination in the implant-abutment connections (IAC) of a Nobel Replace <b>Conical</b> <b>Connection</b> implant system [Nobel Biocare®, Vimercate (MB), Italy]. Materials and methods. To identify the capability of the implant to protect the internal space from the external environment, the passage of genetically modified bacteria across IAC was evaluated. Four Nobel Replace <b>Conical</b> <b>Connection</b> implants (Nobel Biocare®, Vimercate (MB), Italy) were immerged in a bacterial culture for twenty-four hours and then bacteria amount was measured inside and outside IAC with Real-time PCR. Bacterial quantification was performed by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction using the absolute quantification with the standard curve method. Results. In all tested implants, bacteria {{were found in the}} inner side, with a median percentage of 10. 9 %. The analysis revealed that in both cases (internally and externally), bacteria grew for the first 48 hours but subsequently they started to dye, probably as a consequence of nutrient consumption. Moreover, the difference between outer and inner bacteria concentration was statistically significant at each time point. Conclusions. Implant’s internal contamination shows that IAC is not sealing. The reported results {{are similar to those of}} previous studies carried out on different implant systems. Until now, no IAC has been proven to seal the gap between implant and abutment...|$|E
50|$|Flared {{connectors}} {{should not}} be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a tapered <b>conical</b> shaped <b>connection</b> instead. A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45º tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the flare fitting. The flare nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} of this study, it was showed that with {{straight}} abutments, %postload RTL was lower than %initial RTL. This result could be explained by Squier et al. [33] who stated that abutments of the <b>conical</b> hybrid <b>connection</b> showed detorque values higher than the initial torque due to the cold solder on the implant–abutment interface, which agrees with the results of this study. This condition arises from the friction between the two surfaces, which differ slightly; the pressure created by the insertion force determines the maintenance of the connection even after stopping the applied force for insertion.|$|R

30|$|There {{are some}} spaces between {{abutment}} and implant body {{which can be}} a reservoir of toxic substance, and they can penetrate into subgingival space from microgap at the implant–abutment interface. This penetration may cause periimplantitis which is known {{to be one of the}} most important factors associated with late failure. In the present study, three kinds of abutment connection system, external parallel connection (EP), internal parallel connection (IP), and internal <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> (CC), were studied from the viewpoint of microleakage from the gap between the implant and the abutment and in connection with the loosening of abutment screw.|$|E
30|$|A further factor, {{which has}} been {{detected}} to improve peri-implant hard- and soft-tissue health and is related to a conical implant-abutment connection, is a “platform switching” design. By switching the platform between the implant and the abutment from the outside surface of the implant to the inside region and therefore in larger distance to the peri-implant hard and soft tissue, the colonization of microorganisms seems to be reduced. Furthermore, the <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> in combination with a platform switching design decreases stress transferred onto the peri-implant bone. As a result, peri-implant bone loss is prevented and the peri-implant soft- and hard-tissue health can be preserved [11, 13].|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the stress distribution pattern in the implant and the surrounding bone for a passive and a friction fit implant abutment interface and to analyze the influence of occlusal table dimension on the stress generated. Materials and Methods : CAD models of two different types of implant abutment connections, the passive fit or the slip-fit represented by the Nobel Replace Tri-lobe connection and the friction fit or active fit represented by the Nobel active <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> were made. The stress distribution pattern was studied at different occlusal dimension. Six models were constructed in PRO-ENGINEER 05 of the two implant abutment connection for three different occlusal dimensions each. The implant and abutment complex was placed in cortical and cancellous bone modeled using a computed tomography scan. This complex was subjected to a force of 100 N in the axial and oblique direction. The amount of stress and the pattern of stress generated were recorded on a color scale using ANSYS 13 software. Results : The results showed that overall maximum Von Misses stress on the bone is significantly less for friction fit than the passive fit in any loading conditions stresses on the implant were significantly higher for the friction fit than the passive fit. The narrow occlusal table models generated the least amount of stress on the implant abutment interface. Conclusion : It can thus be concluded that the <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> distributes more stress to the implant body and dissipates less stress to the surrounding bone. A narrow occlusal table considerably reduces the occlusal overload...|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} study, {{the effect of}} the joint design on the fatigue strength and failure mode in the <b>conical</b> <b>connection</b> system was significantly better for the butt-joint system [22].

In an article published by Zipprich et al., 10 implant systems that used either conical or flat-to-flat connections were compared relative to their dynamic lateral load responses under simulated clinical conditions. The clearance-fit systems produced micromovements, whereas the systems with a conical fit (Astratech® and Ankylos®) generated no movement at all [24]. There will be no micromovement during functional load, and fewer loads on the abutment screws produce few if any screw loosening problems.|$|E

Forty Morse taper connections and forty solid abutments were used at different torque levels (repeated after 10 minutes) in the following groups (n = 10) : 25 Ncm (group g 1), 30 Ncm (group g 2), 35 Ncm (group g 3), and 40 Ncm (group g 4).
