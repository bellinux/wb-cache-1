40|$|One of {{the source}} of air {{pollutants}} is emission from local coal-fired boiler-houses and domestic heating boilers. The consequence of incineration of municipal waste is the introduction of additional pollutants into the atmosphere, including fly ash. The aim of this work was to evaluate the particle size distribution of fly ash emitted by coal combustion and co-incineration of coal with municipal waste in a domestic 18 kW central heating boiler equipped with an automatic fuel feeder. Mixtures of bituminous coal with different types of solid waste (5, 10 and 15 % of mass fraction) were used. Solid waste types consisted of: printed, colored PE caps, fragmented <b>cable</b> <b>trunking,</b> fragmented car gaskets and shredded tires from trucks. During the incineration of a given mixture of municipal waste with bituminous coal, the velocity of exhaust gas was specified, the concentration and mass flow of fly ash were determined together with the physico-chemical parameters of the exhaust gas, the samples of emitted fly ash were taken as the test material. Particle size analysis of fly ash was performed using laser particle sizer Fritch Analysette 22. The PM 10 share from all fly ashes from incineration of mixtures was about 100 %. Differences were noted between PM 2. 5 and PM 1...|$|E

50|$|<b>Trunk</b> coaxial <b>cables</b> are {{connected}} to the optical node and form a coaxial backbone to which smaller distribution <b>cables</b> connect. <b>Trunk</b> <b>cables</b> also carry AC power which is added to the cable line at usually either 60 or 90 V by a power supply (with a lead acid backup battery inside) and a power inserter. The power is added to the cable line so that optical nodes, trunk and distribution amplifiers do not need an individual, external power source. The power supply might have a power meter next to it depending on local power company regulations.|$|R
40|$|As the {{complexity}} of communication networks increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate and diagnose network faults. This maintenance problem {{is due to the}} large number of functional elements within the networks, the elements' technical complexity, and their inherent interaction. One technique to solve this problem is to use expert system technology to manage the vast amount of status information produced by these networks and to provide an automated diagnostic reasoning about the location and cause of observed faults. In this thesis, a prototype expert system based diagnostic tool for <b>cable</b> <b>trunk</b> amplifier networks is presented. This tool is capable of isolating and diagnosing the most common network level faults which occur in these type of networks.

50|$|This is {{achieved}} by utilizing a split-architecture design that puts part of the barrier in an isolator card located in the safe area (power supply rack) & the other part {{in each of the}} spurs of field-mounted device couplers/segment.

50|$|In telephony, a main {{distribution}} frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. <b>Trunk</b> <b>cables</b> may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk {{main distribution}} frame (TMDF).|$|R
50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New cable ducts brought more reliable service to customers.

The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|R
40|$|Web Based Cable Connectivity Monitoring System was {{the title}} of the project chosen to develop for Sri Lanka Telecom PLC in my partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirement of the degree of M. sc in Information Technology of the University of Moratuwa. Sri Lanka Telecom is the owner of the largest copper network in Sri Lanka which spans all over the island. Variety of services such as PSTN Voice Calls, ADSL Broadband Connections, IP-TV connections, Leased Line Connections uses this copper network as the communication media. So {{it is important to keep}} a track of this copper network, especially <b>trunk</b> <b>cables</b> which contain large number of wire pairs in order to provide uninterrupted and satisfactory service to subscribers. Currently there is no online monitoring system for this. SLT was seeking for a proper system to monitoring disconnected or damaged cables for last few years because it is so important to identify those disconnected cables as soon as possible and rectify them. Also Sri Lanka Telecom has to take rapid reactions to avoid stealing of these expensive cables. Therefore, under this project, monitoring <b>trunk</b> <b>cable</b> disconnections from a remote location by using an embedded system which contains Rabbit Core RCM 4010 microprocessor module and SNMP technology was proposed. This unit will send disconnected cable information with its position or segment using SNMP trap messages through Ethernet to SNMP trap detection unit which will be in a central location. And this will acknowledge the authorized persons in few seconds via email. This system also reduces the number of points have to be checked and makes easy to locate the fault. This system will detect, display & record cable disconnections with other features such as fault localization & security. This will reduce time taken to report cable faults and rectify them which will make a direct impact on customer satisfaction.
