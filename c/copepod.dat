5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use <b>copepod</b> {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a <b>copepod,</b> it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the <b>copepod</b> is eaten by a fish, the larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E

2500|$|The second pair of cephalic {{appendages}} in free-living <b>copepods</b> {{is usually}} the main time-averaged source of propulsion, beating like oars to pull the animal through the water. However, different groups have different modes of feeding and locomotion, ranging from almost immotile for several minutes (e.g. some harpacticoid <b>copepods)</b> to intermittent motion (e.g., some cyclopoid <b>copepods)</b> and continuous displacements with some escape reactions (e.g. most calanoid <b>copepods.)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic <b>copepod</b> Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber to feed on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{barnacles}} {{found on}} fin whales include the acorn barnacle Coronula reginae and the stalked barnacle Conchoderma auritum, which attaches to Coronula or the baleen. The harpacticid <b>copepod</b> Balaenophilus unisetus (heavy infestations {{of which have}} been found in fin whales caught off northwestern Spain) and the ciliate Haematophagus also infest the baleen, the former feeding on the baleen itself and the latter on red blood cells.|$|E
5|$|Plankton is an {{intellectual}} planktonic <b>copepod</b> {{who runs the}} unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant alongside Karen, who is a talking supercomputer. Plankton is the arch-rival of Mr. Krabs, who owns the far more profitable Krusty Krab restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the Krabby Patty. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{consumers}} {{rely upon}} primary production {{as a main}} food source. The most important consumers of the pelagic web of the LSZ are <b>copepods,</b> along with the rotifers, flagellates and ciliates mentioned above. All species of calanoid <b>copepods</b> have declined under high predation pressure from the recently introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Because of this, and because <b>copepods</b> rely upon both photosynthetic and detrital food sources, <b>copepods</b> in the LSZ have limited feedback on primary production, unlike marine and lentic systems where <b>copepods</b> can graze down blooms {{in a matter of}} days.|$|R
40|$|Standard species used in {{ecological}} {{risk assessment}} are chosen {{based on their}} sensitivity to various toxicants and the ease of rearing them for laboratory experiments. However, this mostly overlooks the fact that species in the field that may employ variable life-history strategies, which may have consequences concerning the vulnerability of such species to exposure with contaminants. We aimed to highlight the importance of <b>copepods</b> in ecology and to underline the need to include freshwater <b>copepods</b> in ecotoxicology. We carried out a literature search on <b>copepods</b> and Daphnia in ecology and ecotoxicology to compare the recognition given to these two taxa in these respective fields. We also conducted {{a detailed analysis of}} the literature on <b>copepods</b> and their current role in ecotoxicology to characterize the scale and depth of the studies and the ecotoxicological information therein. The literature on the ecology of <b>copepods</b> outweighed that in ecotoxicology when compared with daphnids. <b>Copepods,</b> like other zoo-plankton, were found to be sensitive to toxicants and important organisms in aquatic ecosystems. The few studies that were conducted on the ecotoxicology of <b>copepods</b> mainly focused on marine <b>copepods.</b> However, very {{little is known about the}} ecotoxicology of freshwater <b>copepods.</b> To enable a more realistic risk higher tier environmental risk assessment, we recommend considering freshwater <b>copepods</b> as part of the hazard assessment process. This could include the establishment of laboratory experiments to analyse the effects of toxicants on <b>copepods</b> and the development of individual-based models to extrapolate effects across species and scenarios...|$|R
50|$|Calanoida is {{an order}} of <b>copepods,</b> a kind of zooplankton. They include around 40 {{families}} with about 1800 species of both marine and freshwater <b>copepods.</b> Calanoid <b>copepods</b> are dominant in the plankton {{in many parts of}} the world's oceans, making up 55%-95% of plankton samples. They are therefore important in many food webs, taking in energy from phytoplankton and algae and 'repackaging' it for consumption by higher trophic level predators. Many commercial fish are dependent on calanoid <b>copepods</b> for diet in either their larval or adult forms. Baleen whales such as bowhead whales, sei whales, right whales and fin whales eat calanoid <b>copepods.</b>|$|R

The gut flora of N.californiensis includes a wide range of bacteria, comprising around 40% Alphaproteobacteria, 20% gram-positive bacteria, 20% in the Cryptophaga–Flavobacteria–Bacteroides group, and 5% of each of Gammaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria. Predators of N.californiensis include bottom-dwelling fish and Dungeness crabs (Metacarcinus magister).|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark usually hunts {{close to}} the sea floor. Its diet {{consists}} mainly of small bony fishes, followed by crustaceans and cephalopods. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus blochii, Heteronybelinia heteromorphi, Otobothrium carcharidis, O. mugilis, Phoreiobothrium puriensis, and Phyllobothrium blochii, the nematodes Hysterothylacium ganeshi, Pseudanisakis sp., Raphidascaroides blochii, and Terranova sp., the <b>copepod</b> Caligus furcisetifer, and the protozoan Eimeria zygaenae.|$|E

At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several <b>copepod</b> species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{evaluating}} {{the impact of}} diatoms and <b>copepods</b> on microbial processes mediating nitrate removal in fine-grained intertidal sediments. More specifically, we studied the interactions between <b>copepods,</b> diatoms and bacteria {{in relation to their}} effects on nitrate reduction and denitrification. Microcosms containing defaunated marine sediments were subjected to different treatments: an excess of nitrate, <b>copepods,</b> diatoms (Navicula sp.), a combination of <b>copepods</b> and diatoms, and spent medium from <b>copepods.</b> The microcosms were incubated for seven and a half days, after which nutrient concentrations and denitrification potential were measured. Ammonium concentrations were highest in the treatments with <b>copepods</b> or their spent medium, whilst denitrification potential was lowest in these treatments, suggesting that <b>copepods</b> enhance dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium over denitrification. We hypothesize that this is an indirect effect, by providing extra carbon for the bacterial community through the copepods' excretion products, thus changing the C/N ratio in favour of dissimilatory nitrate reduction. Diatoms alone had no effect on the nitrogen fluxes, but they did enhance the effect of <b>copepods,</b> possibly by influencing {{the quantity and quality of}} the copepods' excretion products. Our results show that small-scale biological interactions between bacteria, <b>copepods</b> and diatoms can have an important impact on denitrification and hence sediment nitrogen fluxes...|$|R

25|$|Spring {{produces}} blooms of swarming phytoplankton {{which provide}} food for <b>copepods.</b> Planktonic <b>copepods</b> {{are usually the}} dominant members of the zooplankton, and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, <b>copepods</b> are prey to forage fish and jellyfish, both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some <b>copepods</b> have extremely fast escape responses when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).|$|R
5|$|Many predators feed on {{the milk}} shark, {{including}} larger sharks such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni), and possibly also marine mammals. Off KwaZulu-Natal, the decimation of large sharks {{by the use of}} gillnets to protect beaches has led to a recent increase in milk shark numbers. A known parasite of this species is the <b>copepod</b> Pseudopandarus australis. There is some evidence that male and female milk sharks segregate from each other.|$|E
5|$|Solitary in nature, the Atlantic torpedo {{is often}} seen resting on or half-buried in the {{substrate}} during the day, becoming more active at night. Large and well-defended from attack, it seldom falls prey to other animals. Known parasites of the Atlantic torpedo include the tapeworms Calyptrobothrium occidentale and C. minus, Grillotia microthrix, Monorygma sp., and Phyllobothrium gracile, the monogeneans Amphibdella flabolineata and Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the <b>copepod</b> Eudactylina rachelae.

5|$|The Australian blacktip shark {{is known}} to form large groups, {{segregated}} by size and sex. It preys mainly on teleost fishes, including ponyfishes, grunters, tunas, and herring. Cephalopods are a secondary food source, which are particularly important around April. This species also occasionally consumes smaller sharks, including snaggletooth sharks (Hemipristis pristis), spottail sharks (C. sorrah), and sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon). Their diets shift with age: smaller individuals feed on proportionately more bottom-dwelling fish, while larger individuals feed on proportionately more midwater fish and cephalopods. Documented parasites of this shark include the tapeworms Fossobothrium perplexum and Platybothrium sp., and the <b>copepod</b> Perissopus dentatus.|$|E

40|$|Diatoms exude {{considerable}} {{quantities of}} polymers, mainly polysaccharides, that {{play an important}} role in the process of sestonic particle aggregation in the sea. We investigated the impact of <b>copepods</b> on transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) generated by the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii. Grazing experiments with 14 C-labelled algae exudates demonstrated that <b>copepods</b> typical of the Baltic Sea were not actively filtering TEP. Control experiments showed that ‘uptake’ of radioactivity could be ascribed to passive uptake, such as adsorption of radioactively-labelled particles to the body surface. Furthermore, we tested the effect of <b>copepods</b> on TEP size spectra. The abundance and size distribution of TEP (from 1. 4 to 180 μm of Equivalent Spherical Diameter) were analysed in a 4 h incubation experiment. In the presence of <b>copepods,</b> the proportion of larger TEP was higher. An increase in total volume of TEP in jars containing <b>copepods</b> (~ 2 × 107 μm ml– 1) compared with control jars without <b>copepods</b> (~ 0. 5 × 107 μm 3 ml– 1) was also observed. The process of aggregation of TEP demonstrated in this work, whereby <b>copepods</b> increase downward particle flux without consuming carbon, can have far-reaching consequences for carbon fluxes along the water column and for <b>copepods</b> feeding dynamics...|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its large}} size and {{formidable}} defenses, The Pacific electric ray seldom falls prey to other animals. There {{is a record}} of one being fed upon by a killer whale (Orcinus orca) off Santa Catalina Island. The Cooper's nutmeg (Cancellaria cooperi) is a specialized parasite of this ray, and possibly other bottom-dwelling fishes such as the Pacific angelshark (Squatina californica). The snail is attracted to the chemicals contained in the ray's surface mucus; it makes a small cut on the ventral surface of the ray and uses its proboscis to suck blood. Other known parasites of this species include the <b>copepod</b> Trebius latifurcatus, the fluke Amphibdelloides maccallumi, and the tapeworm Acanthobothrium hispidum.|$|E
5|$|During the day, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are almost}} {{never seen in}} the open, instead resting motionless on the sea floor buried under {{a thin layer of}} sediment that disguises their outlines. At night some individuals remain motionless, waiting for prey, while others may be encountered on the bottom unburied or actively swimming. Large sharks, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), and the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) are known to consume Pacific angelsharks. Known parasites of this species include the <b>copepod</b> Trebius latifurcatus, which infests the skin, the myxosporidian Chloromyxum levigatum, which infests the gall bladder, and the tapeworm Paraberrapex manifestus, which infests the spiral valve intestine.

5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, plankton, or <b>copepod</b> diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E
5|$|The {{nursehound}} {{feeds on}} a variety of benthic organisms, including bony fishes such as mackerel, deepwater cardinalfishes, dragonets, gurnards, flatfishes, and herring, and smaller sharks such as the small-spotted catshark.

Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods, and fewer crustaceans, than juveniles. Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans Hexabothrium appendiculatum and Leptocotyle major, the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum, the trypanosome Trypanosoma scyllii, the isopod Ceratothoa oxyrrhynchaena, and the <b>copepod</b> Lernaeopoda galei.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that {{ingestion}} of Schistocephalus solidus coracidia was related to general activity of Macrocyclops albidus <b>copepods</b> {{at the time of}} exposure. The lower the activity of the host, the fewer parasites it ingested. In an earlier study it was shown that large M. albidus <b>copepods</b> were less likely to become infected with S. solidus than small <b>copepods,</b> which could potentially be caused by differential ingestion of parasites. However, the current study did not show any evidence for such an effect arising through differential ingestion. Body size was not related to ingestion of parasites, but was positively correlated to activity. So, even though size did not significantly relate to ingestion of parasites, if anything, through their higher activity large <b>copepods</b> rather than small <b>copepods</b> may have ingested more parasites. This study indicates that differences in resistance to this parasite do not come about through differential ingestion of parasites. Also, an earlier study failed to show differential elimination of the parasite from the haemocoel.
