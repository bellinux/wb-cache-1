5|$|<b>Cyclogenesis</b> is the {{development}} or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere. <b>Cyclogenesis</b> is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone. It can occur at various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale.|$|E
5|$|The South Atlantic {{environment}} for formation of subtropical cyclones has both stronger vertical wind shear and lower sea surface temperatures, yet subtropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> is regularly {{observed in the}} open ocean in the South Atlantic. A second mechanism for formation has been diagnosed for South Atlantic subtropical cyclones: lee <b>cyclogenesis</b> {{in the region of}} the Brazil Current.|$|E
5|$|On October8, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} developed within a monsoon trough over the extreme {{eastern edge of}} the Pacific basin. Environmental conditions ahead of the system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> Situated near Costa Rica, scattered convection accompanied the well-defined system. This low became less defined over the following days while remaining in the same general area. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for long-term <b>cyclogenesis</b> on October13, at which time the low was situated 150mi (240km) south of Guatemala. Organization was prolonged and slow; however, the convergence of a Kelvin wave and a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event on October15 spurred a significant increase in convection.|$|E
5|$|The {{activity}} in the first twomonths of the season were limited in tropical <b>cyclogenesis,</b> with the second tropical depression of the season not developing until July 22. Following that, the season was very active, {{and there was a}} quick succession of tropical cyclone development from late-July to mid-August. The Atlantic briefly remained dormant, and activity resumed on August 24 with the development of Tropical Depression Eight (Hurricane Gustav). Although August was a very active month, there were only two named storms in September, both of which became hurricanes. Activity in October was high then average, with five tropical cyclones to either form or exist in the month. Following an active October, no tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> occurred in the final month of the season, which is November.|$|E
5|$|Tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> first {{occurred}} {{in the month of}} June, with two tropical depressions developing in the Atlantic. However, no tropical cyclones developed in the month of July, the first phenomenon since1993. In August, five tropical cyclones developed, most notably, Hurricane Alberto. September was more active, with seven named storms forming; that month featured Hurricane Keith, the strongest system of the 2000Atlantic hurricane season. In addition, a quick succession of eight storms {{occurred in}} September, and lasted into early October. Six tropical cyclones existed in October and one additional subtropical storm developed in the last week of the month. Following an active October, no tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> occurred in November, which is the final month of the season.|$|E
5|$|In early July2007, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather {{began to}} persist in the South China Sea roughly 155mi (250km) southeast of Hainan. The Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July3 after the storm had organized sufficiently, however, other tracking agencies did not indicate that tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> had occurred at the time. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began to monitor the disturbance for potential signs of tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> at 0100UTC later that day, At the time, the storm system was situated in an area of weak to moderate wind shear, exposing the disturbance's low-level circulation center. Despite the prevailing conditions and proximity to land, the storm continued to organize, and as such the JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 0130UTC the following day.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{westerly}} wind increases {{associated with}} the Madden–Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for {{this appears to be}} the phase of the Madden–Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.|$|E
5|$|The summer {{tropical}} upper tropospheric trough in the Southern Hemisphere lies {{over the}} trade wind {{region of the}} east central Pacific and can cause tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> offshore Central America. In the western Pacific, tropical upper tropospheric lows are the main cause for the few tropical cyclones which develop north of the 20th parallel north and east of the 160th meridian east during La Niña events.|$|E
5|$|Tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> in the 1992 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{began with the}} development of Subtropical Storm One on April 21. However, over the next three months, minimal activity occurred, with only two depressions developing, one in June and the other in July. Although wind shear was relatively weak in August, only one tropical cyclone occurred in that month. However, that one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Andrew, was the strongest and costliest of the season. Though September is the climatological peak of {{hurricane season}}, an increase in wind shear prevented tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> {{in the first half of}} the month. After September 16, however, five tropical cyclones developed in a span of nine days, from September 17 to 26. Thereafter, activity abruptly halted, and only one tropical cyclone developed in October, Hurricane Frances. By October 27, Frances became extratropical, which was more than a month before the official end of the season on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{data was}} {{gathered}} at 6 hour intervals throughout the season. Even though most intensity assessments were estimates via the Dvorak Technique, {{there was a}} large research mission for Tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> in the Pacific. A NOAA research mission investigated Hurricane Jimena and gathered a few surface observations. Track forecasts were slightly more accurate than the past three years; intensity forecasts were comparable to the previous three seasons.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} form as {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land, and can lead to tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of <b>cyclogenesis,</b> and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving {{in the same direction as}} the upper-level winds.|$|E
5|$|All major {{forecasting}} agencies predicted an above-average season. All {{reduced their}} seasonal predictions in early August, {{but even the}} revised predictions were too high. The lack of activity was primarily caused by an unexpected significant weakening of the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation between winter and spring. This resulted in continuation of the spring weather pattern over the Atlantic Ocean, with strong vertical wind shear, mid-level moisture, and atmospheric stability, which suppressed tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Cyclogenesis</b> {{describes}} {{the process of}} cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical cyclones occlude as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided {{over the course of}} its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|E
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form anywhere {{within the}} extratropical {{regions of the}} Earth (usually between 30° and 60° latitude from the equator), either through <b>cyclogenesis</b> or extratropical transition. A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels, there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6-hour period. A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{activity}} in 1991 was below normal. This was partially due to decreased tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> from African tropical waves, which are troughs that {{move across the}} ocean with associated convection. In most seasons, the majority of storms develop from tropical waves. Of the season's twelve tropical cyclones, only five originated from tropical waves; in addition, {{only three of the}} eight tropical storms were from tropical waves, and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde-type hurricane. From late April to late November, there were 73tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa. The total was higher than average, although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity. The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal, typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America. <b>Cyclogenesis</b> was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear, as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel. There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century, after 1927 and 1962. The season produced twelve tropical depressions, which was the lowest in five years. The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years. Four of the storms developed into hurricanes, although {{for the first time in}} over 24years, none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves.|$|E
5|$|The 1917 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured nine known tropical cyclones, four of which made landfall. The first system appeared on July6 {{east of the}} Windward Islands. After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm struck Honduras, Belize, and Mexico, before dissipating on July14. After {{more than three weeks}} without tropical <b>cyclogenesis,</b> another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda. As the storm brushed eastern New England, four ships sank near Nantucket, causing 41fatalities. The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August10.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Oman cyclone (also {{known as}} Cyclone 02A) was a {{tenacious}} and deadly system that caused historic flooding {{in the southern}} Arabian Peninsula. It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June11. Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June12, although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – {{over the next few}} days.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Pacific typhoon {{season was}} a {{slightly}} below average yearlong period of tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> exhibiting {{the development of}} 45 tropical depressions, of which 21 became named storms; of those, 14 became typhoons. Though every month {{with the exception of}} February and March featured tropical activity, most storms developed from May through October. During the season, tropical cyclones affected the Philippines, Japan, China, the Korean Peninsula, Indochina, and various islands in the western Pacific.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Emilia {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that crossed northern Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 16. The system moved westward, developing a well-defined low pressure area about 525miles (850km) southwest of Acapulco by July 19. The next day, its forward motion had shifted to a slow north-northwest track, and with its convection continuing to organize around the low, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) remarked on the potential for tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> Early on July 21, its thunderstorm activity organized enough for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Six-E, located to the southwest of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are known}} to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500hPa level, or 5.9km) can lead to tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5°C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8°C/km.|$|E
5|$|Winters are mild with {{frequent}} frosts and cold spells. Temperatures are usually mild {{during the day}} and cold during the night. Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with <b>cyclogenesis</b> and sudestada, which bring long periods of precipitation, cloudiness and cooler temperatures, particularly in the southern and eastern parts. Dull, gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas. Occasionally, tropical air masses from the north may move southward, providing relief from the cool, damp temperatures. Snowfall is extremely rare. When it does snow, it usually lasts for only a day or two.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 2010, the Australian monsoon trough {{extended}} unusually {{far east}} over the southern Pacific Ocean. With above-average sea surface temperatures, {{stemming from a}} moderate-strength El Niño, multiple low pressure systems were able to develop across the region. An unusual spree of tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> in rapid succession ensued, including four hurricane-strength storms: Oli, Pat, Rene, and Tomas. On February6, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) began monitoring a tropical depression, dubbed 09F, well to the northeast of the Samoan Islands. Embedded within a well-developed trough, the system displayed curved convective banding features. Environmental conditions in the area, including low wind shear, high ocean heat content, and upper-level outflow, favored <b>cyclogenesis.</b> Additionally, an active Madden–Julian oscillation phase moving into the region was expected to bolster development. Steady improvement of the system's convective structure ensued and early on February7, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The low trekked generally east-southeast {{in response to a}} near-equatorial ridge anchored to the north. The storm's appearance continued to improve and Dvorak classifications rose to T2.5, indicating gale-force winds were likely present. Accordingly, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the system at 18:00UTC and dubbed it Tropical Cyclone 14P. Forecasters noted, however, that the small size of the cyclone could lead to erroneously low Dvorak estimates. The FMS followed suit six hours later and assigned the name Pat to the cyclone, assessing it as a Category1 on the Australian cyclone scale.|$|E
5|$|Climatologically, {{tropical}} cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west {{trade winds}} on the equatorial {{side of the}} subtropical ridge—a persistent high-pressure area over the world's subtropical oceans. In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, the trade winds steer tropical easterly waves westward from the African coast toward the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific Ocean before the waves dampen out. These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region. In contrast, in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific in both hemispheres, tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> is influenced less by tropical easterly waves and more by the seasonal movement of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone and the monsoon trough. Additionally, tropical cyclone motion can be influenced by transient weather systems, such as extratropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emilia was, at the time, {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on {{record in the}} Central Pacific Ocean, and the first of such to be classified as a Category5 hurricane– the highest rating on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. However, hurricanes Gilma later that year and Ioke in 2006 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. The fifth named storm and {{the first of three}} Category 5hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center(CPHC).|$|E
5|$|On August2, 2008, a trough {{entered the}} {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, {{with a low}} pressure area developing near Apalachicola, Florida. The system maintained scattered deep convection across offshore waters and environmental conditions favored tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> The system tracked generally west-southwestward, due to its position south of a subtropical ridge extending from Texas through Florida. On the afternoon of August3, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed {{the development of a}} well-defined center of circulation, slightly exposed from a disorganized area of thunderstorms. As a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Five at 1200UTC on August3, while located about 85miles (140km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Because the depression was initially located in an area of northerly wind shear and dry air, the National Hurricane Center forecast it to slowly intensify.|$|E
5|$|On March8, a {{circulation}} was observed southeast of Diego Garcia and was undergoing tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> By the next day, satellite imagery {{indicated that a}} tropical storm had formed about 635km (395mi) south of the island, given the name Honorinina. On March9, the Météo France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the storm in its database, and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 25S. The nascent tropical storm moved generally to the west-southwest, gradually intensifying. On March11, the JTWC upgraded Honorinina to {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane with 1minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph). On the next day, the MFR followed suit by upgrading the storm to tropical cyclone status while it was passing 175km (110mi) north of St. Brandon island.|$|E
5|$|The 1957 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a generally inactive year for tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> in the North Atlantic basin. There were eight tropical storms – {{two of which}} went unnamed – and three hurricanes, two of which intensified further to attain major hurricane intensity. The season officially began on June15 and ended on November15, though the year's first tropical cyclone developed {{prior to the start}} of the season on June8. The final storm dissipated on October27, well before the official end of the season. The strongest hurricane of the year was Carrie, which reached the equivalent of a Category 4hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale on two separate occasions in the open Atlantic; Carrie later caused the sinking of the German ship Pamir southwest of the Azores, resulting in 80deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, and an unnamed subtropical storm developed {{on the same}} day. 1997 was the least active {{hurricane season}} in above average era of tropical <b>cyclogenesis,</b> which began in 1995. Only nine tropical depressions formed. Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and just three of these attained hurricane status. There was only one tropical cyclone to reach major hurricane status, which was slightly below the 1950–2005 average of two per season. Only Danny made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Erika and Tropical Storm Grace also caused damage and fatalities. Those three cyclones collectively caused 11deaths and $111.46million in damage. The last storm of the season, Tropical Storm Grace, dissipated on October17, over {{a month before the}} official end of the season on November30.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Tropical Storm Don {{was from a}} {{tropical}} wave first identified off {{the west coast of}} Africa on July16. It tracked westward over the open Atlantic for several days, with minimal convection confined to the monsoon trough. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the potential for gradual tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> on July21, when it was positioned about 750mi (1200km) to the east of the Windward Islands. As the system moved through the Lesser Antilles on July23, it produced tropical-storm-force winds in Puerto Rico. The combination of vertical wind shear and the wave's proximity to land impeded further development. Convection increased along the northern portion of the wave on July24, although by the following day the NHC expected no significant redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Amara {{can be traced}} back to an area of low {{pressure}} embedded within a monsoon trough southeast of Diego Garcia on December13, 2013. Computer models suggested that surrounding atmospheric conditions would later become more conducive for tropical <b>cyclogenesis.</b> Over the course of the day, the localized area of circulation remained sheared, though convection remained persistent. Despite the hindering atmospheric environment, the system organized faster than anticipated, and was classified as a tropical disturbance by Météo-France at 1200UTC on December14. Shortly after development, the disturbance underwent a reformation phase and consequently a new center of circulation developed, allowing the system to reach tropical depression status early on December15. Nonetheless, the storm's overall structure remained ill-defined due to the presence of wind shear and multiple mesovortices.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Nora {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that exited {{the west coast of}} Africa on September13. It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing. The wave axis crossed Central America on September25, with its convection tracking westward along the southern Mexican coastline. On September29, the system became better organized when it reached a position about 100mi (160km) south of Acapulco. Although upper-level wind shear was only marginally favorable, the National Hurricane Center first noted the potential for tropical <b>cyclogenesis</b> on September30 over the subsequent few days. This verified on October1 after the thunderstorms organized enough for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Fourteen-E. At the time, it was located about 600mi (975km) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Noul {{were related to}} a strong {{westerly}} wind burst that also {{led to the formation}} of later Typhoon Dolphin. By April30, 2015, an area of convection, or thunderstorms, persisted and pulsed about 230km (145mi) west-southwest of Chuuk State within the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). The system had a broad circulation amid an environment favorable for tropical <b>cyclogenesis,</b> including low to moderate wind shear. The circulation slowly consolidated, developing improved outflow and increasingly organized convection. At 06:00UTC on May2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression about 850km (525mi) west-southwest of Chuuk. At 00:00UTC the next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 06W.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to Koni developed {{as an area}} of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July12. Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical <b>cyclogenesis,</b> the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity. Late on July14, however, the system developed organized rainbands. This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) to classify {{the system as a}} tropical depression at 0000UTC on July15, well north of Palau. Shortly after, the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA), immediately classifying the system as a tropical depression and designating it with the name Gilas; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200UTC that day. A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages.|$|E
