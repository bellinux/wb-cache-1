The tract length distribution for gene conversion events can be approximated by the equation P(L >/= n) = φ(n) where P is the probability that tract length (L) is {{greater than or equal}} to a specified number of nucleotides (n). From the co-conversion data, a maximum likelihood estimate with standard error for φ is 0. 99717 +/- 0. 00026, corresponding to a mean <b>conversion</b> tract <b>length</b> of 352 base pairs. (Thus, gene <b>conversion</b> tract <b>lengths</b> are sufficiently small to allow for extensive shuffling of DNA sequence polymorphisms within a gene.)

In particular, we study {{the regime of}} efficient nonlinear conversion with low-intensity fields that has been predicted from a semiclassical analysis.

In contrast to conventional nonlinear optics this Hamiltonian {{does not have a}} power expansion in the fields and the <b>conversion</b> <b>length</b> increases with the input power. We analyze the stationary wave-mixing process in the forward scattering configuration using an exact numerical analysis for up to $ 10 ^ 3 $ input photons and compare the results with a mean-field approach. Due to quantum effects, complete conversion from the two pump fields into the signal and idler modes is achieved only asymptotically for large coherent pump intensities or for pump fields in few-photon Fock states. The signal and idler fields are perfectly quantum correlated which has potential applications in quantum communication schemes.

The AGILE detector The AGILE design is derived from a refined study of the GILDA project (Barbiellini et al. 1995, Morselli et al. 1995) {{that was based on}} the techniques developed for the Wizard silicon calorimeter, already successful flown in balloon experiments (Golden et al. 1990).

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comBackground Conversion to an open procedure during laparoscopically assisted colorectal resection may be necessary because of technical, patient, or pathologic factors. Recent literature has indicated that converted patients may have poorer outcomes than those undergoing open or completed laparoscopically assisted procedure. This study aimed to audit the authors’ experience with laparoscopically assisted colectomy and to assess the clinical outcomes of patients undergoing conversion. Methods All laparoscopic right hemicolectomies or anterior resections performed at seven South Australian hospitals from 1997 to 2006 were reviewed. Data pertaining to patient sex, age, American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score, pathology, operative outcomes including operating time, conversion, reason for <b>conversion,</b> <b>length</b> of hospital stay, and intra- and postoperative complications were analyzed. Results Laparoscopic anterior resection had a higher rate of open conversion than laparoscopic right hemicolectomy (18. 7 % vs 10. 4 %; p = 0. 028). In the right hemicolectomy group, none of the investigated risk factors for conversion were statistically significant, and the morbidity rates for the two groups were similar. The median hospital stay was significantly longer in the anterior resection group (p < 0. 001), and the wound morbidity rate was higher in the converted group (12. 8 % vs 3. 0 %; p = 0. 022). Age older than 75 years and a high ASA status were independent risk factors for conversion in anterior resection. Conclusions Conversion of laparoscopic anterior resection to open procedure is associated with higher wound morbidity and a longer hospital stay.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{studied the}} results of laparoscopic colectomies {{performed}} by a surgical team on 80 consecutive patients and compared these results with standard open colectomies. METHODS: Eight consecutive laparoscopic-assisted colectomies were performed by Norfolk Surgical Group in a 14 -month period and compared to 53 patients who had a conventional open colectomies. Analysis included indications for surgery, types of procedure, complications, incidence and causes for <b>conversion,</b> <b>length</b> of procedure, duration of postoperative ileus, hospital stay, operating room and total hospital charges, and examination of the pathologic specimens. RESULTS: Many different types of colectomies were performed successfully and safely {{for a variety of}} surgical indications. The conversion rate was 22. 5 %, which decreased to 15 % {{in the second half of}} the series. Complications in patients who underwent laparoscopic operations were not severe in number of type. The length of the operative procedure, operating room charge, and the total hospital charge were greater for patients undergoing laparoscopic-assisted colectomies. Patients who underwent laparoscopic operations had a shorter period of postoperative ileus and less pain, resumed a regular diet sooner, and were discharged from the hospital sooner than patients who underwent open colectomies. There was no significant difference in the pathology specimens obtained by laparoscopic-assisted colectomies compared with conventional open colectomies for length of specimen, surgical margins, and number of lymph nodes retrieved. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that laparoscopic techniques can be applied safely and effectively to a broad range of colonic operations. Laparoscopic-assisted colectomies take longer to perform and are more costly, but are associated with less paralytic ileus, less pain, and reduced hospital stay. Laparoscopic colectomies for the treatment of malignancy are achievable technically, but will require careful long-term study...|$|E

40|$|Introduction : Traditionally, in open surgery, right {{adrenalectomy}} {{is considered}} technically more demanding than its left-sided counterpart. This belief {{is supposed to}} be attributable mainly to different anatomic characteristics of the adrenal veins. Whether this opinion is also correct for laparoscopic adrenalectomy remains elusive. Aim : To compare the outcomes of left versus right laparoscopic adrenalectomy from an anterior approach. Material and methods: Retrospective statistical analysis of a prospectively compiled database of consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy in a single center with focus on potential differences in the left- versus right-sided procedure in terms of demographic parameters, tumor size, operating time, occurrence of serious intraoperative complications, <b>conversion,</b> <b>length</b> of hospital stay and re-operation rate. Results: One hundred seventy-six patients underwent elective laparoscopic adrenalectomy – 80 left-sided (45. 45 %) and 96 right-sided (54. 55 %). No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of age (54. 09 ± 11. 2 vs. 56. 27 ± 11. 6; p = 0. 2), tumor size (3. 39 ± 1. 86 vs. 3. 26 ± 1. 66; p = 0. 64), operating time (71. 84 ± 22. 33 vs. 72. 06 ± 30. 99; p = 0. 95), occurrence of serious intraoperative complications (7. 5 % vs. 10. 4 %; p = 0. 5), conversion (1. 25 % vs. 1. 04 %; p = 0. 9), length of hospital stay (4. 52 ± 1. 30 vs. 4. 37 ± 1. 91; p = 0. 55) or reoperation rate (5 % vs. 1 %; p = 0. 11).

We have used this plasmid system to determine the minimum amount of homology required for gene conversion, to examine how <b>conversion</b> tract <b>lengths</b> are affected by limited homology, and to analyze the role of flanking DNA sequences on the pattern of exchange. Plasmids with homologous sequences greater than 2 kilobases have mitotic exchange rates as high as 2 x 10 (- 3) events per cell per generation.

40|$|When {{generating}} {{codes for}} today’s multimedia extensions, {{one of the}} major challenges is to deal with memory alignment is-sues. While hand programming still yields best performing SIMD codes, it is both time consuming and error prone. Compiler tech-nology has greatly improved, including techniques that simdize loops with misaligned accesses by automatically rearranging mis-aligned memory streams in registers. Current techniques are ap-plicable to runtime alignments, but they aggressively reduce the alignment overhead only when all alignments are known at com-pile time. This paper presents two major enhancements to the state of the art, improving both performance and coverage. First, we propose a novel technique to simdize loops with runtime alignment nearly as efficiently as those with compile-time misalignment. Runtime alignment is pervasive in real applications because it is either part of the algorithms, or it is an artifact of the compiler’s inabil-ity to extract accurate alignment information from complex ap-plications. Second, we incorporate <b>length</b> <b>conversion</b> operations, e. g., conversions between data of different sizes, into the align-ment handling framework. <b>Length</b> <b>conversions</b> are pervasive in multimedia applications where mixed integer types are often used. Supporting <b>length</b> <b>conversion</b> can greatly improve the coverage of simdizable loops. Experimental results indicate that our runtime alignment technique achieves a 19 % to 32 % speedup increase over prior art for a benchmark stressing the impact of misaligned data.
