5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were asked if they had made up the name or if they <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the defence of necessity was accepted.|$|E

25|$|Static type {{checking}} can {{be considered}} a limited form of program verification (see type safety), and in a type-safe language, {{can be considered}} also an optimization. If a compiler <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> a program is well-typed, then it does not need to emit dynamic safety checks, allowing the resulting compiled binary to run faster and to be smaller.|$|E
25|$|Integral linear {{programs}} are of central {{importance in the}} polyhedral aspect of combinatorial optimization since they provide an alternate characterization of a problem. Specifically, for any problem, the convex hull of the solutions is an integral polyhedron; if this polyhedron has a nice/compact description, then we can efficiently find the optimal feasible solution under any linear objective. Conversely, if we <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> a linear programming relaxation is integral, then it is the desired description of the convex hull of feasible (integral) solutions.|$|E
25|$|In a {{piece of}} {{electronic}} equipment, for example, the connections between stages (e.g. electronic mixers, electronic oscillators, amplifiers) may be 'probed' for the expected signal, using the scope as a simple signal tracer. If the expected signal is absent or incorrect, some preceding stage of the electronics is not operating correctly. Since most failures occur because of a single faulty component, each measurement <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> half of the stages of a complex piece of equipment either work, or probably did not cause the fault.|$|E

25|$|One {{question}} we might ask is whether, {{if we had}} chosen a different free ultrafilter V, the quotient field A/U would be isomorphic as an ordered field to A/V. This question {{turns out to be}} equivalent to the continuum hypothesis; in ZFC with the continuum hypothesis we can prove this field is unique up to order isomorphism, and in ZFC with the negation of continuum hypothesis we <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> there are non-order-isomorphic pairs of fields that are both countably indexed ultrapowers of the reals.|$|E
25|$|The {{proceeds}} of the liquidation are discharged to the creditors {{in accordance to}} their rank as established in the schedule of claims. Certain creditors (such as employees for the salaries of up to six months, or for social security payments) are accorded a higher rank by law and are paid out before all other creditors. To the extent the creditors remain unpaid, they receive certificates to that effect by the BO, {{but they may not}} initiate new insolvency proceedings against the debtor unless they <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> he has acquired new assets.|$|E

Males who have yet to complete pre-university education or are awarded the Public Service Commission scholarship can opt to defer their draft. Though not required to perform military service, {{the number of women}} in the SAF has been increasing: since 1989 they have been allowed to fill military vocations formerly reserved for men. Before induction into a specific branch of the armed forces, recruits undergo at least 9 weeks of basic military training.|$|E

Several other skeptic groups also offer a monied prize for proof of the paranormal, including the largest group of paranormal investigators, the Independent Investigations Group, which has chapters in Hollywood; Atlanta; Denver; Washington, D.C.; Alberta, B.C.; and San Francisco. The IIG offers a $100,000 prize and a $5,000 finders fee if a claimant can prove a paranormal claim under 2 scientifically controlled tests. Founded in 2000 no claimant has passed the first (and lower odds) of the test.|$|E
25|$|Back home, Selena learns {{from her}} father that Yolanda has been {{stealing}} money from the fan club. On March 9, 1995, Selena and her father, along with Suzette, confront Yolanda about the missing funds at a meeting. Yolanda denies this and says she would never take anything from Selena. Selena, angry and hurt by the betrayal, asks Yolanda how she could do this to her, and to her fans. Yolanda pleads for time to return the boutique's financial records and claims she <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> she has done nothing wrong. Selena and Chris discuss the prospect of starting their family when the crossover tour is finished. The future seems bright with promise.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the RMA {{argue that}} it ensures the {{sustainable}} use of resources for the foreseeable needs of {{the present and future}} generation, and also recognises the importance of indigenous rights in the mitigation process. In this respect, the RMA is a pioneering act in the area of sustainable development. Other advantages cited are the umbrella function, which (at least in theory) allows all consent decisions about a project to be considered in one process, freeing applicants from the need to research and apply for all the various permits they would otherwise have to apply for their development. It is also noted that the RMA is 'effects-based'. In other words, instead of a proposal needing to be on a list of approved or permitted developments or activities, if the applicant <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> the 'effects' of the development on the environment are unproblematic, then he or she is allowed to go ahead. In practice however, this proof is often elusive, especially with new or contested activities or developments.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Bhutan {{became the}} first country to {{completely}} outlaw the cultivation, harvesting, production, and sale of tobacco products. Penalties for violating the ban increased under the 'Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010'. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted {{as long as the}} possessor <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they have paid import duties. In January 2016, Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov reportedly banned all tobacco sales in the country. The Pitcairn Islands had previously banned the sale of cigarettes; however, it now permits sales from a government-run store. The Pacific island of Niue hopes to become the next country to prohibit the sale of tobacco. A proposal in Iceland would ban tobacco sales from shops, making it prescription-only and therefore dispensable only in pharmacies on doctor's orders. New Zealand hopes to achieve being tobacco-free by 2025 and Finland by 2040. In 2012, anti-smoking groups proposed a 'smoking licence' – if a smoker managed to quit and hand back their licence, they would get back any money they paid for it. Medical students in Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000.|$|E
500|$|Alexandrinus is an {{important}} witness {{for the absence of}} Pericope Adultera (John 7:53-8:11). Gregory asserted in regard to the lost two leaves (John 6:50-8:52), [...] "For by counting the lines we <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> it was not in the book. There was not room for it". (A similar counting involving missing leaves is done with Codex Ephraemi). The analysis referenced by Gregory falls short of full proof of absence. Gregory did not discuss possibilities like the text being added in the margin, or the writing to be condensed, or the section being {{in another part of the}} Gospels that is not extant.|$|E
500|$|Section 2 {{covers the}} actual {{prohibition}} of publishing [...] "obscene material".

Somebody can be found guilty of this regardless of if it was done for profit or not. Where the article is a film, {{the consent of the}} Director of Public Prosecutions is required before a prosecution can commence. Section 2(4) states that, where an article is obscene, no other common law charges should be brought, and it should instead be dealt with through the 1959 Act, intended to limit prosecutions to those crimes found in this Act. Section 2(5) creates a defence of [...] "innocent dissemination"; if the publisher <b>can</b> <b>prove</b> <b>that</b> they did not anticipate any obscenity problems, and did not examine the article in question for such issues, they cannot be convicted.|$|E
