These type molecules are hardly separated with conventional separation, and therefore need a good separation method. <b>Continuous</b> <b>Annular</b> Chromatography consists of a rotating annular bed. The annulus is formed between two concentric cylinders, and the resin is packed in the annulus. At fix position {{at the top of the}} bed, four solutions are continuously fed, the feed mixture to be separated, a displacer solution, a regenerant and a rinse. The Annulus is slowly rotated with the result that different zones will formed helices of characteristic angle which can be collected at variations fixed points around the bottom of the bed.

40|$|Optimization of Lamb modes {{induced by}} laser can be {{achieved}} by adjusting the spatial source distribution to the mode wavelength (λ). The excitability of Zero-Group Velocity (ZGV) resonances in isotropic plates is investigated both theoretically and experimentally for axially symmetric sources. Optimal parameters and amplitude gains are derived analytically for spot and <b>annular</b> <b>sources</b> of either Gaussian or rectangular energy profiles. For a Gaussian spot source, the optimal radius is found to be λ_ZGV/π. <b>Annular</b> <b>sources</b> increase the amplitude by at least a factor of 3 compared to the optimal Gaussian source. Rectangular energy profiles provide higher gain than Gaussian ones. These predictions are confirmed by semi-analytical simulation of the thermoelastic generation of Lamb waves, including the effect of material attenuation. Experimentally, Gaussian ring sources of controlled width and radius are produced with an axicon-lens system. Measured optimal geometric parameters obtained for Gaussian and annular beams are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. A ZGV resonance amplification factor of 2. 1 is obtained with the Gaussian ring. Such source should facilitate the inspection of highly attenuating plates made of low ablation threshold materials like composites. Comment: 11 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|The laser based {{ultrasound}} {{technique is}} a convenient non-contact tool for generation and detection of guided modes in plate. This technique {{is well suited}} to observe the specific Lamb modes having a Zero Group Velocity (ZGV) and a finite wavelength. For these modes, the energy deposited by a laser pulse remains trapped under the source which results in a local and narrow resonance. The frequencies of these modes depend on the bulk velocities and the thickness, and for isotropic the local Poisson’s ratio is provided by measurements of ZGV resonances[1]. The amplitude of the resonance depends on the laser pulse energy which {{is limited by the}} ablation threshold for non-destructive testing applications. To maximize the amplitude of resonance, the laser source needs to be matched with spatial distribution of the mode. The normal surface displacement of a ZGV mode of wavelength λ follows the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero u(r) =J 0 (2 πr/λ). A first optimization was performed by adjusting the radius of a Gaussian beam in function of the wavelength of the ZGV mode. The theory predicts that the optimal source radius at constant maximum surface energy is /. For the S 1 S 2 mode in duralumin plate, the wavelength is about 4 times the plate thickness. This result is confirmed by semi-analytic simulations and by measurements on a 1 -mm thick duralumin plate. The ZGV resonance amplitude is increased by a factor close to 5 when the radius increases from 0. 5 mm to the optimized source radius (1. 3 mm). A second optimization is performed on using <b>annular</b> <b>sources.</b> Experimentally, the <b>annular</b> beam is produced by a simple axicon-lens system. Both radius and width of the ring are controlled by varying the distances between the axicon, the lens and the sample and controlled on a ccd camera. We observe that for parameters well adapted to the ZGV mode’s wavelength, the first <b>annular</b> <b>source</b> enhances ZGV mode’s amplitude by a factor greater than 2 compared to the optimized Gaussian source at the same maximal surface energy. Moreover, simulations show that for a fixed width, ZGV amplitude increases pseudo periodically with the square- root of the ring radius. Besides, these <b>annular</b> <b>sources</b> are also interesting to enhance the generation of propagating modes...|$|R

The potential impact on the reconstructed images of deviations from the ideal activity is discussed. Results from simulated and real data {{for a pair of}} block detectors suggest that planar or <b>annular</b> <b>sources</b> can be equally suitable for a normalization procedure if their geometry and their intersections with the system lines-of-response (LORs) are properly taken into account. When comparing an annulus with a centered planar source, both filled with the same total activity, the planar source produces twice the count rate with a 92 % of trues versus 66 % of trues for the annulus. Scatter and randoms are lower by factors of 3 and 4 respectively in the planar case. We conclude that, although planar and <b>annular</b> <b>sources</b> can be suitable for a normalization procedure if their geometries are properly taken into account, planar source normalization results are better than those of an annulus, particularly if the normalization does not consider the effect of scatter correction, more significant for the annulus source than for the planar oneThis work has been partially funded by projects PI 052583 and PI 052583 (Ministerio de Sanidad), BFM 2003 - 04147 -C 02 - 01 (Ministerio de Edcucación y Ciencia) and CD-TEAM (Ministerio de Industria, CENIT program), Spai...|$|R

A popular colunm-based method, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) refolding, employs size-exclusion matrices to separate unfolded protein from denaturant, thus refolding the protein. In this work, we conduct a comparison of SEC refolding with refolding by batch dilution, using lysozyme as a model protein. Lysozyme refolding yield {{was found to be}} extremely sensitive to the chemical composition of the refolding buffer and particularly the concentration of dithiothreitol (DTT) introduced from the denatured protein mixture. SEC refolding was not adversely affected by DTT carry-over as small contaminants in the denatured solution are separated from protein during the refolding operation. We also find that, contrary to previous reports, size-exclusion refolding on batch columns leads to refolding yields slightly better than batch dilution refolding yields at low protein concentrations but this advantage disappears at higher protein concentrations. As batch-mode chromatography would be the limiting step in a column based refolding downstream process, the batch column refolding method was translated to a continuously operating chromatography system (preparative <b>continuous</b> <b>annular</b> chromatography, P-CAC).

Se lo volete ditemi come inviarlo ABSTRACT Photocatalytic {{degradation}} of acetonitrile {{was carried out}} in both gas–solid and liquid–solid regimes using two commercial TiO 2 catalysts (Merck and Degussa P 25). For the gas–solid regime, a <b>continuous</b> <b>annular</b> photoreactor was used. The inﬂuence on photodegradation kinetics of the gas ﬂow rate and concentrations of acetonitrile, oxygen, and water was investigated. Acetonitrile degradation products detected in the gas phase included carbon dioxide and hydrogen cyanide. The same photoactivity was exhibited in the presence {{and in the absence of}} water vapour. The liquid–solid regime used a batch photoreactor with an immersed lamp (the same as for the gas–solid regime). The oxidation products detected in the solution were cyanide, cyanate, nitrite, nitrate, methanoate, and carbonate ions. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic model ﬁt the photoreactivity data obtained in both regimes and allowed us to determine the rate constant and equilibrium adsorption constant values. The adsorption constant and kinetic constant value were lower in the liquid–solid regime than in the gas–solid regime. The Merck catalyst had higher values of these parameters for both regimes than the Degussa P 25 catalyst. An evaluation of the possible competition between acetonitrile and water molecules for the surface sites of the photocatalyst (Ti 4 + ions and hydroxyl groups) revealed that for high H 2 O/CH 3 CN ratios, as is typical for the photo-oxidation process carried out in a liquid/solid regime, acetonitrile molecules were not able to provide a speciﬁc interaction with the surface sites of TiO 2, remaining dissolved in the interface water molecular layers. In contrast, for low H 2 O/CH 3 CN ratios, as is typical for the photo-oxidation process carried out in a gas–solid regime, acetonitrile could win the competition with water for surface hydroxyls.  2005 Elsevier Inc.
