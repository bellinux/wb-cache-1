40|$|Abstract – Most {{of single}} {{frequency}} GPS receivers utilize low-quality crystal oscillators. If a low-quality crystal oscillator is utilized {{as the time}} reference of a GPS receiver, the receiver’s <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> grows very fast due to its inherent low precision and poor stability.

40|$|We present {{details of}} the design for the CCD readout {{electronics}} for the Subaru Telescope Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The spectrograph is comprised of four identical spectrograph modules, each collecting roughly 600 spectra. The spectrograph modules provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over the entire band from 380 nm to 1260 nm {{through the use of}} three separate optical channels: blue, red, and near infrared (NIR). A camera in each channel images the multi-object spectra onto a 4 k x 4 k, 15 um pixel, detector format. The two visible cameras use a pair of Hamamatsu 2 k x 4 k CCDs with readout provided by custom electronics, while the NIR camera uses a single Teledyne HgCdTe 4 k x 4 k detector and ASIC Sidecar to read the device. The CCD readout system is a custom design comprised of three electrical subsystems: the Back End Electronics (BEE), the Front End Electronics (FEE), and a Pre-amplifier. The BEE is an off-the-shelf PC 104 computer, with an auxiliary Xilinx FPGA module. The computer serves as the main interface to the Subaru messaging hub and controls other peripheral devices associated with the camera, while the FPGA is used to generate the necessary clocks and transfer image data from the CCDs. The FEE board sets <b>clock</b> <b>biases,</b> substrate bias, and CDS offsets. It also monitors bias voltages, offset voltages, power rail voltage, substrate voltage and CCD temperature. The board translates LVDS <b>clock</b> signals to <b>biased</b> <b>clocks</b> and returns digitized analog data via LVDS.

30|$|Most {{existing}} TDOA localization algorithms {{require the}} receiver locations to be accurately known and the receivers to be strictly synchronized in sampling the received signals, {{but these are}} unlikely to be satisfied in practice. As examples, receivers (or sensors) are fixed on vessels or aircraft or they are randomly arranged in a certain region, which results in the true receiver positions to be compromised by receiver position errors. In addition, when the receivers are far away from each other, it is difficult to achieve strict clock synchronization for all receivers. Many studies have shown that both the receiver position errors and synchronization <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> play important roles in TDOA localization because they deteriorate the positioning accuracy [29, 32, 34]. Indeed, the problem of jointly suppressing the receiver position error and synchronization <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> has been intensively studied in recent years. A joint synchronization and source localization algorithm with erroneous receiver positions has been proposed [35], where the <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> is assumed to be known with random errors, whereas such prior information with respect to synchronization <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> is not available in practice. To overcome this drawback, a novel closed-form solution method, in which the <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> is considered a deterministic parameter, has been developed and the algebraic solutions of the source location, receiver positions, and synchronization offsets were sequentially obtained [36]. This method is practical and effective and not only jointly suppresses receiver position error and synchronization <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> but also obtains the CRLB under low noise levels.|$|E

40|$|Satellite orbit {{error and}} <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> are {{the keys to}} precise point {{positioning}} (PPP). The traditional PPP algorithm requires precise satellite products based on worldwide permanent reference stations. Such an algorithm requires considerable work and hardly achieves real-time performance. However, real-time positioning service will be the dominant mode in the future. IGS is providing such an operational service (RTS) {{and there are also}} commercial systems like Trimble RTX in operation. On the basis of the regional Continuous Operational Reference System (CORS), a real-time PPP algorithm is proposed to apply the coupling estimation of <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> and orbit error. The projection of orbit error onto the satellite-receiver range has the same effects on positioning accuracy with <b>clock</b> <b>bias.</b> Therefore, in satellite clock estimation, part of the orbit error can be absorbed by the <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> and the effects of residual orbit error on positioning accuracy can be weakened by the evenly distributed satellite geometry. In consideration of the simple structure of pseudorange equations and the high precision of carrier-phase equations, the <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> estimation method coupled with orbit error is also improved. Rovers obtain PPP results by receiving broadcast ephemeris and real-time satellite <b>clock</b> <b>bias</b> coupled with orbit error. By applying the proposed algorithm, the precise orbit products provided by GNSS analysis centers are rendered no longer necessary. On the basis of previous theoretical analysis, a real-time PPP system was developed. Some experiments were then designed to verify this algorithm. Experimental results show that the newly proposed approach performs better than the traditional PPP based on International GNSS Service (IGS) real-time products. The positioning accuracies of the rovers inside and outside the network are improved by 38. 8 % and 36. 1 %, respectively. The PPP convergence speeds are improved by up to 61. 4 % and 65. 9 %. The new approach can change the traditional PPP mode because of its advantages of independence, high positioning precision, and real-time performance. It could be an alternative solution for regional positioning service before global PPP service comes into operation...|$|E

30|$|Both TOA- and TDOA-based {{localization}} {{are called}} time-based localization [2], since they both rely on time measurements (either the global {{time or the}} local time). The essence {{of this kind of}} localization problem is how to accurately extract distance-related information (e.g., the time of flight (TOF)). Directly using TOA measurements requires not only perfect clock synchronization between the emitters and the receivers but also the knowledge of the transmitting time [33]. In cooperative networks, where clock synchronization is frequently carried out (because the inner clock might drift over time) and the transmitting times are also piggybacked with the transmitted signals, one can precisely calculate the TOFs from the TOA measurements and then localize the target node. However, it is often very expensive to meet those requirements, and most networks are constrained by limited resources and capabilities. Therefore, in most cases, sensors suffer from two linear nuisance parameters, i.e., the unknown <b>clock</b> <b>biases</b> to the global time and the unknown transmitting times.|$|R

However, the corresponding triple-frequency based precise clock products are not widely available and adopted by applications. Currently, most precise products are generated based on ionosphere-free combination of dual-frequency L 1 /L 2 signals, which however are not consistent with the triple-frequency ionosphere-free carrier-phase measurements, resulting in inaccurate positioning and unstable float ambiguities. In this study, a GPS triple-frequency PPP ambiguity resolution method is developed using the widely used dual-frequency based clock products.

The weighted version of MDS in [11] utilized the weighted cost function to improve positioning accuracy.

Differential GPS techniques can largely eliminate common-mode errors between the reference and the rover GPS stations resulting from ionospheric and tropospheric refraction and delays, satellite and receiver <b>clock</b> <b>biases,</b> and orbital errors [1]. The ionospheric delay in the propagation of {{global positioning}} system (GPS) signals {{is one of the main}} sources of error in GPS precise positioning and navigation.

In this paper the single frequency data of concerned station are converted to dual frequency data by employing dual frequency data from 11 regional GPS stations distributed around it. Total electron content (TEC) was calculated at every GPS station to produce the mathematical model of TEC which is a function of latitude (Φ) and longitude (λ). By using this mathematical model the values of TEC and L 2 can be predicted at the single frequency GPS station for each satellite, after that the comparison between predicted and observation values of TEC and L 2 was performed. The estimation method and test results of the proposed method indicates that the difference between predicted and observation values is very small...|$|R
