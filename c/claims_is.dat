5|$|David Ramsden (born 2 September 1980) is a {{clothing}} recycler from Dewsbury, near Leeds in West Yorkshire. He entered the House on Day 44 {{with four other}} new housemates. With them he was tasked with ensuring that Noirin and Halfwit received the most nominations, but the new housemates failed their task and faced the public vote, though the eviction was ultimately cancelled. On Day 91, David celebrated his 29th birthday, and he received a birthday message from fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who he <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> his hero.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Driven by an Enlightenment belief in progress, she derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family has a farm sufficient for its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> genuine feeling, with Burke's false theatrical tableaux.|$|E

50|$|Not {{all these}} defences are {{available}} to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> legal or equitable; whether a <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> brought under national or EU law.|$|R
5|$|Samuel {{eventually}} {{turns up}} drunk {{at a local}} bar, his faith shaken by the death. He is taken into custody. The agents doubt his ability, but {{he is able to}} convince Mulder that he knows the latter has lost a sister—Samantha—at a young age. Mulder has been seeing visions of Samantha, and continues to see them. At Samuel's bail hearing, the courtroom fills with a swarm of locusts, which Samuel <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> a sign of God's wrath against him.|$|E
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift <b>claims,</b> <b>is</b> based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises that man is imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, as the circumstantial coincidences build up, Knight becomes {{convinced}} that Gorman's story is true. The lack of tangible evidence, he <b>claims,</b> <b>is</b> {{due to a}} government cover-up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation. To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy, he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders, and accuses Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of Police, of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies. Knight points out that Stowell, who was apparently {{the first person to}} suggest Albert Victor's and Gull's involvement in the murders, was a freemason.|$|E
50|$|Statistics {{released}} by the USPTO for reexaminations {{for the period of}} 1981 to 2007 showed that for ex parte reexaminations, <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> changed in average 64% of the cases. In 26% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>are</b> confirmed with no changes, while in 10% of the cases, all <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> invalidated. For inter partes reexaminations, <b>claims</b> <b>were</b> changed in seven of the eight cases that had been completed by the time the statistics were released.|$|R

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{arrives at}} work {{for what he}} <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> his second-to-last day before he moves to Colorado {{to live with his}} fiancee, Holly (Amy Ryan). As the day progresses, he tries to have an {{individual}} goodbye with each employee. A phone call with Holly reveals that this is his last day, and he is flying out to Colorado that night. After having a few mini-crises, including getting cold feet, he starts to break down, but regains his composure after speaking with Holly. Pam (Jenna Fischer) leaves the office to supposedly run errands, but takes a break from the workday to see The King's Speech before Michael can say his goodbye to her.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7 {{enjoyed a}} measure of {{popularity}} throughout the Western world during the war, but from 1945 it was rarely performed outside the Soviet Union. It became a point of controversy in the 1980s after Solomon Volkov's Testimony suggested it was a critique not of the Nazis, but of the Soviet government. The veracity of Volkov's account, which he <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> rooted in interviews with Shostakovich, has been debated. Other issues of contention about the symphony include whether it {{was inspired by the}} attack on Leningrad (as Soviet authorities and official accounts had asserted) or planned earlier and repurposed for propaganda, as well as its artistic merit compared to Shostakovich's other works.|$|E
50|$|Pyrrhonian moral {{skepticism}} {{holds that}} the reason we are unjustified in believing any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> that it is irrational for us to believe either that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> true or that any moral <b>claim</b> <b>is</b> false. Thus, {{in addition to being}} agnostic on whether (i) is true, Pyrrhonian moral skepticism denies (ii).|$|R

5|$|The {{success of}} The Pee-wee Herman Show {{prompted}} Warner Bros. to hire Reubens {{to write a}} script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. Reubens' original idea was to do a remake of Pollyanna, which Reubens <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> his favorite film. Halfway through writing the script, Reubens noticed everyone at Warner Bros. had a bike with them, which inspired Reubens to start on a new script with Phil Hartman. When Reubens and the producers of Pee-wee's Big Adventure saw Tim Burton's work on Vincent and Frankenweenie, they chose Burton to be the film's director. The film {{tells the story of}} Pee-wee Herman embarking on nationwide adventure in search of his stolen bicycle. The movie went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically, recouping almost six times its $7 million budget. At the time of release in 1985, the film received mixed reviews, but Pee-wee's Big Adventure developed into a cult film.|$|E
5|$|Three {{anhydrous}} neptunium oxides {{have been}} reported, NpO2, Np2O5, and Np5O8, though {{some studies have}} stated that only the first two of these exist, suggesting that claims of Np5O8 are actually the result of mistaken analysis of Np2O5. However, as {{the full extent of}} the reactions that occur between neptunium and oxygen has yet to be researched, it is not certain which of these <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> accurate. Although neptunium oxides have not been produced with neptunium in oxidation states as high as those possible with the adjacent actinide uranium, neptunium oxides are more stable at lower oxidation states. This behavior is illustrated by the fact that NpO2 can be produced by simply burning neptunium salts of oxyacids in air.|$|E
5|$|As {{the others}} plot {{to destroy the}} {{creature}} with improvised gas bombs and flares, Corcoran flees the station and finds the creature in a nearby cave. After consuming Wyman's brain, the creature is now able {{to speak with the}} scientist's voice and has absorbed his knowledge. Corcoran asks whether Wyman's death was needed, but the creature insists it was a necessary sacrifice. The others arrive to destroy the creature, but hesitate because Corcoran will not step aside and let them throw their bombs. The creature insists it is not an evil monster, but an intelligent alien who has come to Earth to save the human race from its own self-destructive tendencies. It explains that Corcoran's body has been implanted with its embryos, which will allow the alien species to multiply and take over the human race, which the creature <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> the only way to truly save humanity. Upon realizing the creature is forcing the will of its species on the human race, Corcoran concludes the creature is evil after all and commits suicide so its embryos cannot come to fruition. The others then throw their explosives and kill the creature, which in its dying breaths warns that others from his species are waiting in space and will return one day to conquer humanity.|$|E

5|$|Later, Howard {{arrives at}} Mickey's Diner and uses their {{phone to call}} home. As {{he tried to get}} a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the {{argument}} and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that the D.J. is running a Turbo-Man competition. When they get to the studio, they find out they can only win a gift certificate. They are nearly arrested, but Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with a package (which he <b>claims</b> <b>is</b> a mail bomb, unaware that it really is one). Officer Hummell tries to open it and it blows up in his face. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Upon seeing Ted in his house placing the star on his tree, Howard gets angry and attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll from Ted's house that he had bought for his son Johnny (E.J. De La Pena), but changes his mind at the last moment as he could not see himself stealing from a child. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer but manages to lock him up but he unintentionally sets some of his stuff on fire he tires to put it out but kicks it outside the window. This commotion leads him to be caught by Ted and a distraught Liz. Liz and Jamie leave for the local Wintertainment Parade with Ted and Johnny; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz, but after seeing what he really is, she turns him down by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog.|$|E
