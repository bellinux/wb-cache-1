40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> are {{commonly}} developed for homogenous patient groups.

Three classification systems were tested: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD 9 -CM), Clinical Coding System (CCS) data and All-Patient Redefined Diagnosis Related Groups (APR-DRG). RESULTS: Categorization with ICD 9 -CM and CCS shows rather wide variation. However, when restricting for the principal codes, CCS classification shows an almost homogeneous relationship with <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways.</b> APR-DRG's are already corrected for secondary procedures and are difficult to assess. Categorization with the Risk Of Mortality (ROM) is more homogeneous than with the Severity Of Illness (SOI). CONCLUSION: Patient groups in <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> are rather heterogeneous.

40|$|Background: <b>Clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> are {{structured}} multidisciplinary care plans used by health services to detail essential {{steps in the}} care of patients with a specific clinical problem. They aim to link evidence to practice and optimise clinical outcomes whilst maximising clinical efficiency. Objectives: To assess the effect of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> on professional practice, patient outcomes, length of stay and hospital costs. Search strategy: We searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE), the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Register, theCochraneCentral Register ofControlledTrials (CENTRAL) and bibliographic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, NHS EED and Global Health. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted relevant professional organisations. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series studies comparing stand alone <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> with usual care as well as <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened all titles to assess eligibility and methodological quality. Studies were grouped into those comparing <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> with usual care and those comparing <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. Main results: Twenty-seven studies involving 11, 398 participants met the eligibility and study quality criteria for inclusion. Twenty studies compared stand alone <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> with usual care. These studies indicated a reduction in in-hospital complications (odds ratio (OR) 0. 58; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 36 to 0. 94) and improved documentation (OR 11. 95 : 95 %CI 4. 72 to 30. 30). There was no evidence of differences in readmission to hospital or in-hospital mortality. Length of stay was the most commonly employed outcome measure with most studies reporting significant reductions. A decrease in hospital costs/ charges was also observed, ranging from WMD + 261 US$ favouring usual care toWMD - 4919 US$ favouring <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> (in US$ dollar standardized to the year 2000). Considerable heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis of length of stay and hospital cost results. An assessment of whether lower hospital costs contributed to cost shifting to another health sector was not undertaken. Seven studies compared <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. No evidence of differences were found between intervention and control groups.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{hospital}} treatment {{of heart failure}} frequently does not follow published guidelines, potentially contributing to the high morbidity, mortality and economic cost of this disorder. Consequently the development of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> {{has the potential to}} reduce the current variability in care, enhance guideline adherence, and improve outcomes for patients. Despite enthusiasm and diffusion, the widespread acceptance of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> remain questionable because very little prospective controlled data demonstrated their effectiveness. The Experimental Prospective Study on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Implementation of <b>Clinical</b> <b>Pathways</b> was designed in order to conduct a rigorous evaluation of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> in {{hospital treatment}} of acute heart failure. The primary objective of the trial was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the implementation of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> for hospital treatment of heart failure in Italian hospitals. Methods/design Two-arm, cluster-randomized trial. 14 community hospitals were randomized either to arm 1 (clinical pathway: appropriate use of practice guidelines and supplies of drugs and ancillary services, new organization and procedures, patient education, etc.) or to arm 2 (no intervention, usual care). 424 patients sample (212 in each group), 80 % of power at the 5 % significance level (two-sided). The primary outcome measure is in-hospital mortality. We will also analyze the impact of the <b>clinical</b> <b>pathways</b> comparing the length and the appropriateness of the stay, the rate of unscheduled readmissions, the customers' satisfaction and the costs treating the patients with the pathways and with the current practice along all the observation period. The quality of the care will be assessed by monitoring the use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures during hospital stay and by measuring key quality indicators at discharge.

40|$|Abstract Background Hospitals {{nowadays}} have {{to serve}} numerous patients with limited medical staff and equipment while maintaining healthcare quality. <b>Clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> informatics is regarded as {{an efficient way to}} solve a series of hospital challenges. To date, conventional research lacks a mathematical model to describe clinical pathways. Existing vague descriptions cannot fully capture the complexities accurately in clinical pathways and hinders the effective management and further optimization of clinical pathways. Method Given this motivation, this paper presents a <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> management platform, the Imperial <b>Clinical</b> <b>Pathway</b> Analyzer (ICPA). By extending the stochastic model performance evaluation process algebra (PEPA), ICPA introduces a clinical-pathway-specific model: <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> PEPA (CPP). ICPA can simulate stochastic behaviours of a <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> by extracting information from public clinical databases and other related documents using CPP. Thus, the performance of this <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway,</b> including its throughput, resource utilisation and passage time can be quantitatively analysed. Results A typical <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> on stroke extracted from a UK hospital is used to illustrate the effectiveness of ICPA. Three application scenarios are tested using ICPA: 1) redundant resources are identified and removed, thus the number of patients being served is maintained with less cost; 2) the patient passage time is estimated, providing the likelihood that patients can leave hospital within a specific period; 3) the maximum number of input patients are found, helping hospitals to decide whether they can serve more patients with the existing resource allocation. Conclusions ICPA is an effective platform for <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway</b> management: 1) ICPA can describe a variety of components (state, activity, resource and constraints) in a <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway,</b> thus facilitating the proper understanding of complexities involved in it; 2) ICPA supports the performance analysis of <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway,</b> thereby assisting hospitals to effectively manage time and resources in <b>clinical</b> <b>pathway.</b> </p...|$|E
