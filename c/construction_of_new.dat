5|$|To {{help the}} {{existing}} colonies rebound, several private {{projects have been}} initiated {{in an attempt to}} limit the encroachment of overshadowing trees and bushes, the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> highways and neighborhoods, and other natural and man-made threats.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions. Answers to these may require the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics.|$|E
50|$|In July 1975 {{the current}} site was {{approved}} for <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> Naval Hospital. The contract for <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> hospital was finalized ground breaking {{took place in}} May 1979.|$|R
50|$|In November 2013, Huntsman donated an {{additional}} $50 {{million for the}} <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> research building dedicated to children's cancer. <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> building is slated to begin in 2014.|$|R
50|$|In {{spring of}} 2015 it was {{announced}} that the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> VPS's <b>new</b> stadium would start soon. The <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> stadium began in the summer of 2015 and was completed in August 2016.|$|R
5|$|Following <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> lines, {{the station}} closed on 1 June 1859 and was {{replaced}} by a new station {{on the south side of}} the road, Norwood Junction, which is still in use, now part of the newly-extended East London Line of the London Overground which was opened on 23 May 2010.|$|E
5|$|Further {{financial}} endowments {{from the}} United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) allowed the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> facilities, while scholarship grants, {{mainly from the}} Rockefeller Foundation and the International Cooperation Administration, helped fund training of UPCA faculty. From 1947 to 1958, a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the {{government}} brought the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway {{together as a}} single organisation, the London Passenger Transport Board. The London Underground has since passed {{through a series of}} administrations, expanding further by the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> extensions and through the acquisition of existing main line routes, culminating in its current form as part of Transport for London, the capital's current transport administration, controlled by the Greater London Authority.|$|E
50|$|During {{the fall}} <b>of</b> 2006, <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> patio and picnic shelter built {{to match the}} design of the {{original}} buildings was begun next to the concessions. <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> building and picnic area have been completed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bridge was}} {{scheduled}} {{to be replaced by a}} <b>new</b> bridge with <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> bridge beginning in 2016. The old bridge will remain open during <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> span, located just west of the current bridge.|$|R
50|$|In July 1903, the BAGSR {{announced}} the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> building, {{which began in}} 1909. The remodeling included the enlargement of the installations and the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> main building. The new station was inaugurated on 19 December 1911.|$|R
5|$|Increased federal {{spending}} {{as a result}} of the New Deal in the 1930s led to the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington. World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital; by 1950, the District's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{modernisation}} {{in recent}} years has centred around the Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.|$|E
5|$|The {{engineering}} {{division of}} Lincolnshire's Public Works Department maintains roads and streets {{under the jurisdiction}} of Lincolnshire, inspects existing facilities, improves existing residential subdivisions, and considers the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> ones.

5|$|The notch was {{discovered}} in 1784 by Jeremy Belknap, but its isolation prevented further development for several years. The <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire Route 16 has led to increased accessibility and a rise in tourism. Its location makes it a hub for hiking and skiing.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Kirilovka Doukhobor Village {{was discovered}} by the Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation when undertaking <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> lanes for Provincial Hwy 5 northwest of Saskatoon, and west of Langham. Excavations commenced August 23, 1996. A 1944 aerial photograph was superimposed upon the Hwy 5 construction area showing house foundations.|$|E
5|$|The school's new {{location}} was bounded {{on the south}} by North Avenue, and on the west by Cherry Street. Peters sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for $10,000. This land was situated on what was then Atlanta's northern city limits. The act that created the school had also appropriated $65,000 towards the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings.|$|E

50|$|The {{school has}} been {{expanded}} greatly {{in the last five}} years with the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> sixth form centre and the conversion of Penrhos House, originally the sixth form common room, into a Music block, as well as the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> Learning Resources Centre.|$|R
50|$|A {{research}} and conservation {{project has been}} suggested to study and protect spinner dolphins live around Kokopo beach as this population may be threatened if <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> port for larger shipping lanes will be conducted.|$|R
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward {{ordered the}} <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> castles and walled towns across the {{occupied}} territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to {{the costs of the}} other projects.|$|E
50|$|On January 4, 2004, Nave de Alvalade {{sold out}} {{for the last time}} with a futsal game because, {{together}} with the old stadium, it would be demolished after the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> José Alvalade Stadium which did not contemplate the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> For the modalities.|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} years, the Library grew rapidly. As early as 1890, there were {{calls for the}} <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> building. Instead, in 1900, the Library moved to the old Market Hall, located on Seventh Street. Many civic leaders continued to push for the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> building, but the Library remained in the Market Hall until a fire in 1915 destroyed the entire building, including the Library {{and most of its}} collection of 158,000 books. At the time <b>of</b> the fire, <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> Central Library was already underway.|$|R
50|$|The {{place is}} no longer owned by the Department of Defence. In 2004 the Queensland Heritage Council {{approved}} the adaptive reuse of the place for residential purposes, including subdivision, <b>constructions</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> dwellings and demolition of ancillary structures.|$|R
5|$|Beginning on May 24, 2004, <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> {{platforms}} {{began at}} Clinton, Guilford, and Branford. The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25, 2005, and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8, 2005; both {{consist of a}} single high-level platform {{on the south side}} of the tracks. The new Guilford station, which has platforms on both sides of the tracks (connected by a pedestrian bridge) to allow for greater operational flexibility, opened on November 28, 2005. Construction at Madison started on September 24, 2007, and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28, 2008.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Coventry Street {{made it easier for}} traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
50|$|In May 1992, the Board {{and staff}} {{developed}} a comprehensive {{master plan for}} the Orlando Science Center, including a blueprint for <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> an entirely <b>new</b> science center. <b>Construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> science center began in early 1995.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> stadium started.|$|R
