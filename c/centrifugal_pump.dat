5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump,</b> following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E

25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal pumps {{of the style}} shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor working fluid is a gas (compressible) and the pump working fluid is liquid (incompressible). Again, the engineering methods used to design a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> {{are the same as}} those to design a centrifugal compressor. Yet, there is one important difference: the need to deal with cavitation in pumps.|$|E

The compressors were driven by two Rolls-Royce Merlin engines, adapted to run on town gas. It was not successful due to overheating the building and other problems and was removed early on.|$|E
25|$|Production {{of rolling}} {{stock in the}} area had started already back in 1889, and new {{facilities}} were built in 1898 in an area recently gained. As the new premises were next to railway connection, transportation of products became easier.

A brick-made pump house was built in 1899 and in the following year it was equipped by steam powered <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> made by Scottish Drysdale & Co. At the same time a new prime power machinery building with a chimney was constructed next to it, to the place of the old sawmill and storage.

After the Second World War the Transport Act of 1947 meant that control of the canal passed to the British Transport Commission, but by the 1950s large sections had been closed because of poor lock maintenance {{following a}} breach in the bank west of the Avoncliff Aqueduct.

500|$|The pump at Westonzoyland {{originally}} comprised a beam {{engine and}} scoop wheel, {{which is similar}} to a water wheel, except that it is driven round by the engine and lifts water up to a higher level. After 25years, there were problems pumping the water away as the land surface had dropped as it dried out. A better method was sought, and in 1861 a replacement pump was installed. The engine was built by Easton and Amos of London, to a design patented in 1858 by Charles Amos. It is a twin cylinder, vertical condensing engine, driving a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump.</b> A similar engine was on display at the Great Exhibition of 1851 and was shown to be able to lift 100tons of water per minute (1,700 L/s), to a height of [...] The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne (pronounced [...] "reen") into the River Parrett. The pump operated until 1951, when a new diesel-powered pumping station, capable of pumping 35tons per minute (600 L/s) at any state of the tide, was built beside the old one. The pumping station is now an Industrial Heritage museum of steam powered machinery and land drainage, and houses most of the equipment from the disused Burrowbridge pumping station.|$|E

500|$|The HPFTP is a three-stage <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> {{driven by}} a {{two-stage}} hot-gas turbine. It boosts {{the pressure of the}} liquid hydrogen from 1.9 to 45 MPa (276 to 6,515 psia), and operates at approximately 35,360rpm with a power of 71,140hp. The discharge flow from the turbopump is routed to, and through, the main valve and is then split into three flow paths. One path is through the jacket of the main combustion chamber, where the hydrogen is used to cool the chamber walls. It is then routed from the main combustion chamber to the LPFTP, where it is used to drive the LPFTP turbine. A small portion of the flow from the LPFTP is then directed to a common manifold from all three engines to form a single path to the liquid hydrogen tank to maintain pressurization. The remaining hydrogen passes between the inner and outer walls of the hot-gas manifold to cool it and is then discharged into the main combustion chamber. A second hydrogen flow path from the main fuel valve is through the engine nozzle (to cool the nozzle). It then joins the third flow path from the chamber coolant valve. This combined flow is then directed to the fuel and oxidizer preburners. The HPFTP is approximately [...] in size and is attached to the hot-gas manifold by flanges.|$|E
500|$|As {{the land}} dried, the peaty soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841-2, and this led the Commissioners {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament in 1844, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of a}} new main drain, [...] long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about [...] lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from [...] to [...] passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pump</b> was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was [...] in diameter, and powered by a [...] steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by [...] In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways.|$|E

In order to optimally design <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps,</b> it is beneficial to first understand the complex flow phenomena within different sections of the pump {{for a variety of}} operating conditions. This is normally achieved through the use of modern techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), where the flow within <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps</b> can be numerically modelled and important flow features can be analysed for better understanding of interactions amongst different process variables. CFD offers different turbulence modelling techniques with an aim to predict realistic flow approximations. Larger Eddy Simulation (LES) offers a more accurate solution to this, in which the larger eddies are resolved while smaller eddies are modelled, hence predictions using LES are more realistic. Further to turbulence modelling within <b>centrifugal</b> <b>pumps,</b> {{it is also important to}} model the complete interaction amongst different variables rather than a simplistic single blade passage flow analysis. In the present work, the complex blade-tongue interactions, and their consequent effects on the pressure fluctuations within the volute have been evaluated.
