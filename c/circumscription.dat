His publication included keys to the genera of both the Hypocreales and Clavicipitales, followed by a list of genera, each with the literature citation of the original descriptions and type species. He included 115 genera in the Hypocreales.|$|E

5|$|While the suprageneric (above genus level) {{structure}} of the family has varied greatly with its ever-changing <b>circumscription,</b> as currently constituted the family consists of three subfamilies, Lilioideae, Calochortoideae and Streptopoideae. Lilioideae is further divided into two tribes, Medeoleae and Lilieae. The three subfamilies contain fifteen genera and approximately 600 species in all.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current <b>circumscription</b> was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
5|$|Thiele and Ladiges' {{arrangement}} was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by {{him in his}} 1999 arrangement. B.ser. Abietinae was restored to George's 1981 <b>circumscription,</b> and all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries were abandoned. However, B.telmatiaea was moved in the phyletic order to between B.grossa (Coarse Banksia) and B.leptophylla, thus better according with the affinity with B.leptophylla claimed by George in 1981.|$|E

5|$|Historically, the {{inclusion}} of genera within Liliaceae has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, {{one of the best}} known and also the broadest modern <b>circumscription</b> is the Cronquist system (1981), which included nearly 300 genera in Liliaceae. Most of these have been reassigned to other families, as shown in the following collapsed list, following ITIS, together with their disposition as APG III transfers to other families and subfamilies, within Liliales and three other orders, Alismatales, Asparagales and Dioscoreales. Current members of Liliaceae are shown in bold.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. H. Corner published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported <b>circumscription</b> of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current <b>circumscription,</b> the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of these old and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall <b>circumscription,</b> but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the Liliaceae {{has a very}} complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it {{became one of the}} largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the APG which is based on phylogenetic principles using molecular biology, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the Latin terms sensu lato and sensu stricto are frequently used (together with their abbreviations, s.l. and s.s.) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the <b>circumscription</b> respectively, e.g. Liliaceae s.s..|$|E
5|$|Historically both {{wide and}} narrow {{interpretations of the}} genus have been proposed. In the nineteenth century genus {{splitting}} was common, favouring the narrow view. Haworth (1831) using a narrow view treated many species as separate genera, as did Salisbury (1866). These authors listed various species in related genera such as Queltia (hybrids), Ajax(=Pseudonarcissus) and Hermione(=Tazettae), sixteen in all in Haworth's classification. In contrast, Herbert (1837) took a very wide view reducing Harworth's sixteen genera to six. Herbert, treating the Amaryllidacea as an 'order' as was common then, considered the narcissi to be a suborder, the Narcisseae, the six genera being Corbularia, Ajax, Ganymedes, Queltia, Narcissus and Hermione and his relatively narrow <b>circumscription</b> of Narcissus having only three species. Later Spach (1846) took an even wider view bringing most of Harworth's genera into the genus Narcissus, but as separate subgenera. By the time that Baker (1875) wrote his monograph all of the genera with one exception were included as Narcissus. The exception was the monotypic group Tapeinanthus which various subsequent authors have chosen to either exclude (e.g. Cullen 1986) or include (e.g. Webb 1978, 1980). Today it is nearly always included.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} {{the results of}} a cladistic analysis of Banksia. They found George's arrangement to accord fairly closely with their inferred cladogram, so sought to publish a taxonomic arrangement that reflected their phylogeny whilst being minimally disruptive to the then-current arrangement. They accepted both of George's subgenera prior to the analysis, using each as an outgroup in the analysis of the other. Thus their analysis yielded little information about the <b>circumscription</b> and placement of B.subg. Banksia. They did find, however, that the subgenus was not monophyletic unless B.elegans (Elegant Banksia) was excluded. They ended up listing B.elegans and five other species as incertae sedis, but otherwise maintained George's <b>circumscription</b> of the subgenus.|$|E
