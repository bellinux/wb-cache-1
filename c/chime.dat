5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no visual indicator. Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a <b>chime</b> when connected to power. The Macintosh startup <b>chime</b> {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5|$|In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, {{the boot}} process {{starts with the}} {{activation}} of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup <b>chime</b> is played {{and control of the}} computer is passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the Random Access Memory, Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds a list of all devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information.|$|E
5|$|Journey is an indie {{video game}} {{developed}} by thatgamecompany {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3. It was released on March 13, 2012, via the PlayStation Network. In Journey, the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names until after the game's credits. The only form of communication {{between the two is}} a musical <b>chime.</b> This <b>chime</b> also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air. The developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one of the funeral servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the <b>chime</b> of bells.|$|E
5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with tam-tam and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four <b>chime</b> notes and another tam-tam on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical <b>chime</b> that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E

25|$|Cymbals of {{any type}} used to provide an accent rather than a regular pattern or groove are known as accent cymbals.

Accent cymbals include <b>chime</b> cymbals, small-bell domed cymbals or those with a clear sonorous/oriental <b>chime</b> to them like specialized crash and splash cymbals and many china types too, particularly the smaller or thinner ones.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, {{the village}} church became {{the centre of}} a nationally {{reported}} row over the quarter-hourly <b>chiming</b> of the clock. Complaints about the <b>chimes</b> during the night were initially received {{in the summer of}} that year, which North Hertfordshire District Council (NHDC) was legally obliged to investigate. In December, the council ruled that the <b>chimes</b> are [...] "prejudicial to health" [...] and have to be silenced between 11 pm and 6 am. Complying with the ruling has meant turning off the <b>chimes</b> altogether, although the parish council has asked the diocese in St Albans if it can install a timing mechanism that will restrict the <b>chimes</b> to the legally appointed hours, and has launched an appeal to raise the £1,900 cost. The <b>chiming</b> clock was initially installed in 1898, but was turned off for 18 months in 2011 and 2012 while repairs were carried out. A public meeting on 19 January 2014 discussed the future of the <b>chimes.</b> In May 2015, a timer had been installed to silence the church bells overnight.|$|R
