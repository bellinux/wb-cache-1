40|$|I {{discuss some}} data on {{contemporary}} Quaker attitudes to science, particularly gene technology, gathered from member of Britain Yearly Meeting. Quakers are often perceived {{as having a}} relatively positive attitude towards innovation, including technology, and some confirmation {{of this can be}} found in Quaker history, until 30 years ago. The observations described in this paper suggest that, in line with the general trend in the west towards a greater scepticism about the benefits of science, the current attitude of British Friends towards the practice of science is a more ambivalent or even negative one, although attitudes towards the scientific/experimental method have remained positive. Some aspects of this, which may be specific to or more <b>common</b> among <b>Quakers,</b> are discussed. Keywords...|$|R
5000|$|Two presidents were Quakers (Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon) and {{information}} about their religion is harder to come by. Quakerism is, by its nature, not circumscribed by doctrines, but even so {{it is hard to}} determine whether either Hoover or Nixon had much adherence even to Quaker practice. For instance, it is <b>common</b> among <b>Quakers</b> to refuse to swear oaths; however, recordings show that Nixon did swear the oath of office in the conventional manner in all cases, and while the matter is clouded for Hoover, there is newspaper and circumstantial evidence that he did likewise. While Abraham Lincoln never officially joined a church, there has been some research indicating that he may have had Quaker leanings. During his time in office, he had numerous meetings with Quakers and had investigated a supposed Quaker ancestry.|$|R
50|$|The <b>common</b> <b>Quaker</b> (Orthosia cerasi) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. Some authors prefer the synonym Orthosia stabilis (Denis & Schiffermüller 1775).

5000|$|Mr Edmund Sturge was {{for many}} years an active and highly esteemed member of the Howard Committee, and {{practically}} fulfilled the functions of its honorary secretary. He had previously resided in Birmingham, but afterwards divided his time between London and Charlbury, in Oxfordshire.He was a brother of Mr Joseph Sturge, a man of similarly philanthropic energy, who, like himself, devoted much time and labour {{to the service of}} the Anti-Slavery cause.Edmund Sturge resembled George Washington both in features and dignified aspect. He was part proprietor of estates in the island of Montserrat in the West Indies, and was therefore specially conversant with questions relating to the condition of negroes and coolies. For many years he was a constant visitor to the lobbies of the House of Commons, to interest members of the legislature in the several objects of philanthropic effort which were so dear to himself.He wore a wig, for he had lost all his hair in a brief illness. A few days later some of his friends were assembling for a committee meeting of which he was a member, and presently one of them exclaimed, [...] " [...] Edmund Sturge has not come yet. I never knew him unpunctual before." [...] " [...] I am here," [...] responded a quiet voice, and on turning round, his colleagues could hardly recognise their old friend in his suddenly altered appearance.He had a strong objection to wearing an overcoat, even in winter, and used to walk with a noiseless tread, as if his shoes had felted soles.He was not a man of many words, but had a dry humour and occasionally indulged in anecdotes. One of these related to a member of a well-known Quaker family whose eccentricities obliged his friends to put him under restraint at times in an asylum. But he managed to escape more than once, and afterwards remarked that he had thus come to appreciate a <b>common</b> <b>Quaker</b> counsel, to [...] "proceed as way may open." [...] On another occasion the same Friend, on re-entering an asylum at York, requested a private interview with the superintendent, which being granted, and the two sitting for a little while in silence, the new inmate suddenly exclaimed that he had been thinking of the precept, [...] " [...] Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might," [...] and forthwith he struck the superintendent violently.Mr Sturge was the subject of one of the cartoons in Vanity Fair (November 20, 1886). In the accompanying letterpress the journalist remarked of him : [...] "No kindlier, simpler, gentler, more upright and honourable a soul ever informed a human body than that which is enveloped in the Quaker outside of Mr Sturge. He is a good, honest creature."At Charlbury, Mr Sturge used to take his friends into the glades of the adjacent Wychwood Forest and into Cornbury Park, which contains some of the finest beech-trees in England. Mrs Sturge was as devoted to the interests of humanity, and especially to the Anti-Slavery cause, as her husband. They lived long enough to celebrate their golden wedding.On that occasion the Committee of the Howard Association presented them with an illuminated address of congratulation. In it they recorded : [...] " [...] The Committee gladly avail themselves of this opportunity of conveying to their esteemed friend and colleague, Mr Edmund Sturge, the expression of their profound sense of the value, to this Association and to other kindred bodies, of his services, and of his sound judgment and long experience.At an Anti-Slavery meeting at the Mansion House, London, Mr Sturge's labours in the cause of humanity received public recognition from the Prince of Wales and several eminent statesmen. He died in 1893, aged eighty-four, and was buried at Charlbury. He was a man of a truly noble character.|$|E
500|$|The Benjaminville Friends Meeting House {{is located}} on a [...] site planted with grass and native {{deciduous}} trees. The location is surrounded by crops and is well isolated from other nearby structures. The rectangular, balloon framed building is situated on an east-west axis, with its front facade facing west. The long side measures 42ft (13 m) and the shorter gable ends of the building measure 32ft (10 m). The building's entrance is found on its south elevation and consists of dual doors which bisect the walls at the jambs. The Friends meeting house in Benjaminville is a typical example of traditional Quaker meeting houses. Elements <b>common</b> to <b>Quaker</b> meeting houses east of the Allegheny Mountains and found on the Benjaminville example are: plain, undecorated interiors, lack of stained glass, rectangular shaped log or frame construction, some type of partition within the interior space, an attached burial ground, exterior simplicity, separate men's and women's entrances, and the entryway location along the long wall.|$|R
50|$|The {{meeting was}} founded in the years just before 1800 {{by members of the}} nearby Oswego Meeting in Moore's Mill when there were enough of them who lived in what was still at the time part of the Town of Beekman to {{constitute}} their own meeting. Their first meeting house, of which no traces remain, was a simple square building, unevenly divided inside with separate entrances for men and women, a feature <b>common</b> in <b>Quaker</b> meetinghouses of that era.By 1809 the Beekman meeting had grown so quickly it was necessary to construct a new building, the one whose wing remains today. In keeping with updated Quaker practice, it was a long building with moderately pitched gable roof and a full-width porch on the west elevation. The original plan called for a 33 by 25 ft with 11 ft posts, but the superior meeting ordered the post height reduced a foot (30.5 cm) and the final building varied slightly even from those plans.|$|R
50|$|Trueblood {{abandoned}} this prestige {{to settle}} in the Quaker hub community of Richmond, Indiana to help spur the growth of Earlham College from a tiny regional, religious school, and build it into a top flight institution of higher learning. He was {{a founder of the}} Earlham School of Religion, a Quaker seminary in Richmond, and part of a renaissance of American Quaker thought and action spurred on partly by the <b>common</b> experiences of <b>Quaker</b> intellectuals as conscientious objectors during World War II, although Trueblood himself was not a pacifist. He actively sought to mentor younger Quakers into his nineties. Trueblood also founded the Yokefellow movement and supported Stephen Ministries.|$|R
40|$|Spring has arrived, moths {{are coming}} to our traps at night and {{sightings}} of day-flying Emperor moths are numerous particularly in southern England. So far this year we have recorded 197 individuals of 29 species in the trap at Butterfly Conservation’s Head Office in Dorset, admittedly it has only been operated on nine occasions. <b>Common</b> <b>Quaker,</b> Hebrew Character and Early Grey {{have been the most}} abundant moths with 33, 33 and 27 individuals recorded respectively. Lunar Marbled Brown are appearing in the Manor Yard trap at the moment along with the other usual suspects, Clouded Drab, Small Quaker and Muslin Moth. Hopefully you are all aware of the planned Macro-moth Atlas for Britain and Ireland which we will be publishing in 2018. The atlas will include records to the end of 2016. We only have two more field seasons to target ‘white-holes ’ and under-recorded areas so it is really important that we increase our recording effort this year. Your County Moth Recorder will be able to let you know where in your area extra effort is required. If you are planning some moth-ing holidays further afield, please contact the relevant CMR to find out where you can focus your effort to help with under-recording...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{following}} {{exploration of}} the fundamentals of the Religious Society of Friends called Quakers will focus upon a lesser known tradition of the Quakers, namely that of the “Free Friends of Philadelphia ” and their modern progeny, the Free Quakers of Indiana These Free Quakers, as they are called, are those who chose to exercise their free right to follow their conscience in all things, a tradition reaching back to the 18 th century in Philadelphia when a contingent of Friends chose to support the war against Britain. A great deal {{is known about the}} programmed and unprogrammed traditions of the Religious Society of Friends, the former electing to have recorded ministers and formalized worship and the latter opting for no clergy and a preference for the mystical tradition of silent worship. Much less is known about the Free Quakers of Revolutionary Pennsylvania and the subsequent modern day Friends, their ideological progeny. In this brief essay, we intend to correct this <b>common</b> oversight in <b>Quaker</b> history...|$|R
500|$|The most typical {{cooking method}} of the Quakers was boiling, a method brought from ancestral {{northern}} England. Boiled breakfast and dinner were standard fare, {{as well as}} [...] "pop-robbins", balls of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Boiled dumplings and puddings were so <b>common</b> in <b>Quaker</b> homes that they were referred to by outsiders as [...] "Quaker food". Travelers noted apple dumplings as an almost daily dish in the Delaware Valley and cookbooks specialized in puddings and dumplings. Food was mostly preserved through boiling, simmering or standing. A popular genre of dishes made from this favored method of food preparation was [...] "cheese" [...] (or [...] "butter"), a generic term for dishes prepared by slow boiling or pressing. They could be made from ingredients as varying as apples (i.e., apple butter), plums and walnuts. Cream cheese had its origins in Quaker cooking, but was in colonial times not true cheese made with rennet or curds, but rather cream that was warmed gently and then allowed to stand wrapped in cloth until it became semi-solid. Dried beef was widely popular in the Delaware Valley and was eaten along with puddings and dumplings to add flavor. The use of dried beef was so widespread that it was often called [...] "Quaker gravy" [...] in the 18th century. Though the Quaker influence from the northern Midlands was the most dominant, there was some influence from German immigrants during the 18th century. Scrapple, a pot pudding made from meat scraps and grain, became {{a staple of the}} regional cuisine for many generations.|$|R

40|$|Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Komitet Badań NaukowychAn Essay Towards the Present and Future Peace of Europe {{is a small}} {{political}} treatise published anonymously in London in 1693 when England was embroiled with France in the War of the League of Augsburg. William Penn (1644 - 1718), {{the author}} of this essay, was the English aristocrat, the member of the <b>Quaker</b> <b>common</b> named „Society of Friends” - one of the most radical puritan sect, and the founder of Pennsylvania in the North America. Penn proposed in his treatise to make real of the European League or the Imperial States as a way to establish a permanent peace on the Continent. He drew the plan of the Imperial or General Parliment of nations with the function of arbitration to solve the contentions or disputes between the states-signatories of the League. Penn considered that this international assembly will be gather in the appointed place and time and make decisions in the secret ballot. The sources of Penn’s project were in existing in the 17 th century the European and American representative institutions, the earlier union propositions, the modern political philosophy and the Quaker pacifist ideas. Penn’s conceptions joined the proclamation of peace and justice in the international relations with the federal and parlimentary principles. However the solution was too much radical to find any reverberation on the European absolutist courts in the end of the 17 th century. On the contrary, the most important meaning of An Eisay [...] . is {{in the evolution of the}} Quaker pacifism from the evangelical and spiritual views to the humanitarian and rational argumentation (integrational pacifism).
