50|$|Regions with an ustic soil {{moisture}} regime often experience erratic rainfall which mostly occurs {{during the growing}} season. Summer droughts are erratic, but frequent. Ustolls (soils characterized with the ustic {{soil moisture}} regime) are the most commonly occurring suborder of Mollisols in the U.S., primarily located in the southern Great Plains, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma. Most Ustolls display an accumulation of calcium carbonate in the soil profile - a <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E

Note {{that this is not the}} only reason for a high soil pH. They are characterized by the presence of calcium carbonate in the parent material and may have a <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon,</b> a layer of secondary accumulation of carbonates (usually calcium or Mg) in excess of 15% calcium carbonate equivalent and at least 5% more carbonate than an underlying layer.|$|E
5000|$|When {{soil science}} was first founded, climate was {{considered}} one of the most important factors regarding the formation of soil. For instance, temperate regions have widespread acidic sand Spodosols, and in tropical regions red clayey Oxisols are common. The tendency to use climatic data for the classification of soils has been challenged by efforts to base the classification of soil on observable features within the soils. This tendency is unfortunate because paleoclimates cannot be interpreted from paleosols identified using paleoclimatic data. Fortunately, the identification of paleosols using climatic data is changing. For example, Aridisols have been redefined (Soil Survey Staff 1998) as soils that possess a <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> of less than 1 meter in depth.|$|E
40|$|This study {{outlines}} principal {{characteristics of}} soils {{occurred in the}} arid and semi-arid regions of Southern Iran. An outstanding characteristic of these soils is a prominent horizon of calcium carbonate accumulation {{at or near the}} depths of rainfall penetration. Objectives of this study were to discuss the genesis, morphological and physico-chemical properties of <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> and mineralogy and classification of soils in semi-arid region. Five representative profiles were selected and soil samples were collected to determine the chemical and physical properties. Carbonate accumulation and clay eluviation-illuviation are the dominant processes in these soils. Calcium carbonate in the studied soils varied from continuous coatings with weakly cemented matrix which appears as few to common carbonate nodules (stage II) and to plugged horizon (stage III). Palygorskite, chlorite, illite, smectite and vermiculite minerals were observed in soil samples. Illite and chlorite are largely inherited from parent materials. Inheritance, transformation and neoformation from other minerals are the main pathways for the occurrence of smectite and palygorskite in the studied soils. Presence of kaolinite only in deeper <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> suggested that these horizons developed in a tropical climate that shifted gradually towards semi-arid conditions. The soils of study site were classified as Typic Calcixerepts, Petrocalcic Calcixerepts and Calcic Haploxeralfs, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Sheets of eolian {{sediment}} cover {{many areas of}} the earth's urface, sand seas, dune fields, and loess sheets being the best known examples of such features. Less well known are deposits of sandy, {{eolian sediment}} forming extensive plains. An excellent example of such a region is the semi-arid Southern High Plains (northwest Texas and eastern New Mexico). The level landscape of the area was created by depositon of multiple, extensive (, ~ 80, 000 km 2) sheets of eolian sediment (Biackwater Draw Formation) over the past 1. 4 + Ma. This deposit grades from sandy (southwest) o silty and clayey (northeast) and is up to 27 m thick. Surface soils (at least 30, 000 and possibly 120, 000 years old) are well developed (5 YR hues, agrillic horizons, 1 - 2 m thick with prismatic structure, Stage II-III <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons)</b> and are generally Paleus-tolls and Paleustalfs, with some Paleargids and Haplargids. Morphologic variation isdue mainly to textural variation of the eolian parent material, although locally thickness of the parent material nd wind erosion and cumulization are impor-tant factors, and locally slight variation in effective precipitation may be significant. The Blackwater Draw Formation contains as many as six well-developed buried soils, each formed in individual layers of eolian sediment, similar to or more strongly expressed (2. SYR hues, higher illuvial clay content) than the regional surface soils. The presence of the buried soils indicates that sedimentation was episodic and separated by long periods of relative landscape stability. Eolian pro-cesses also appear to have been important during the periods of stability and pedogenesis by providing clayey, calcareous dust hat was added to the soil, promoting formation of the argillic and <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons.</b> The sedimentologic and pedologi...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present a fast and cheap method for high-resolutionmapping of calcic horizons in {{vineyards}} based on geoelectrical proximal sensing. The study area, 45 ha located in southern Sicily (Italy), was characterized by an old, partially dismantled marine terrace and soils with a <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> at different depths. The geoelectrical investigation consisted of {{a survey of the}} soil electrical resistivity recorded with the Automatic Resistivity Profiling- 03 sensor. The electrical resistivity values at three pseudo-depths, 0 - 50, 0 - 100 and 0 - 170 cm, were spatialized by means of ordinary kriging. A principal component analysis of the three electrical resistivity maps was carried out. During the survey, 18 boreholes, located at different electrical resistivity values, were made for soil description and sampling. The depth to the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> showed a strong correlation with electrical resistivity. The regression model between <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> and the principal component analysis factors with the highest correlation coefficients was selected to spatialise the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> values. An Normalized Difference Vegetation Index map was used to validate the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> map in terms of crop response to different soil rooting depths. The strengths of this method are the quick, non-invasive kind of survey, the relevance for vine vigour, and the high spatial resolution of the final map...|$|E

However, {{the widespread use}} of the isotopic signature (δ¹³C, δ¹⁸O, Δ¹⁴C) of pedogenic carbonates for reconstruction of local paleovegetation, paleoprecipitation and other environmental conditions lacks knowledge of the time frame of pedogenic carbonate formation, which depends on climatic factors. We hypothesized that temperaturedependent biotic processes like plant growth and root and rhizomicrobial respiration have stronger influence on soil CaCO₃ recrystallization than abiotic temperature-dependent solubility of CO₂ and CaCO₃. To assess the effect of temperature on initial CaCO₃ recrystallization rates, loess with primary CaCO 3 was exposed to ¹⁴CO² from root and rhizomicrobial respiration of plants labeled in ¹⁴CO₂ atmosphere at 10, 20 or 30 °C. ¹⁴C recovered in recrystallized CaCO₃ was quantified to calculate amounts of secondary CaCO₃ and corresponding recrystallization rates, which were in the range of 10 ⁻⁶– 10 ⁻⁴day⁻¹, meaning that 10 ⁻⁴– 10 ⁻²...|$|R

At New Mexico Tech we use electromagnetic induction for soil characterization and environmental restoration surveys: soil salinity assessment of irrigated lands (Hendrickx et al., 1992) and riparian areas along the Rio Grande (Sheets et al., 1994), extent of brine migration after spills of produced waters on the oilfields of southeastern New Mexico (Hendrickx et al., 1994), delineation of soil units in deserts (McHanon, 1998) and riparian areas (Caplan et al., 2001), detection of dissolution pipes through indurated <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> (Rodríguez-Marín, 2001), reclamation of mine spoils, and monitoring of spatial and temporal changes of field soil water contents (Kachanoski et al., 2002; Sheets and Hendrickx, 1995).

40|$|The Warm Springs {{soil series}} which {{contained}} variable amounts of subsoil available (sodium bicarbonate extractable) phosphorus was studied {{to explain the}} variability and distribution of the NaHCO 3 -P in the subsoil. Four pedons ranging in subsoil NaHCO 3 -P from less than 10 ppm to greater than 30 ppm were selected {{in an area of}} less than 200 ha located on a nearly level, low lake terrace east of the Great Salt Lake in Weber County, Utah. The morphology of each pedon was described in the field and samples collected from each genetic horizon or contrasting layer. Each soil sample was analyzed for total phosphorus, NaHCO 3 -P, water- soluble phosphorus, pH, extractable iron, calcium carbonate equivalent, electrical conductivity and water-soluble sodium. Four horizons were selected from each pedon for anal ysis of parti cle-size distribution, clay-size carbonate and non-carbonate clay. The very fine sand fraction of four horizons from two of the pedons were studied petrographically to determine the amount of apatite present. Thin strata with higher chroma were separated from adjacent layers and analyzed for extractable iron and NaHCO 3 -P. Cicada casts and their surrounding matrix were separated and analyzed Selected soil samples were shaken with sodiumphosphate solutions and then analyzed for NaHCO 3 -P to determine the influence of the amount of phosphorus in solution on the amount of phosphorus extracted. NaHCO 3 -P below the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> was highly variable, 10 ppm or less in two pedons and up to 40 ppm in the other two. Subsoil horizons with pH values greater than 10. 0 and relatively large amounts of water-soluble sodium contained more than 10 ppm NaHCO 3 -P. Extractable iron and NaHC 03 -P were concentrated in subsoil strata with higher chroma. The results indicated that large amounts of NaHCO 3 -P in the subsoil were primarily due to the presence of readily soluble sodium phosphate. Weathering of apatite in the surface horizons did not contribute the NaHCO 3 -P below the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons.</b> The most likely source of NaHCO 3 -P in the Warm Springs subsoil, however, was the sediments deposited in the low lake terraces and river flood plains by the Weber and Bear Rivers. Lateral flow and vertical fluctuations of the water table were suggested as a means by which the NaHCO 3 -P could be extracted from some areas and concentrated in others. Although certain soil properties might indicate the probable occurrence of more than 10 ppm NaHCO 3 -P in the subsoil, this study did not provide a method for identifying all subsoils with appreciable amounts of NaHCO 3 -P...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of spatial variability of soil water retention capacity and depth {{is essential for}} a correct and economical planning of water supply of a vineyard. The advantage of measuring soil electrical properties by proximal sensors {{is the ability to}} operate with mobile and non-destructive tools, quicker than the traditional soil survey. A. R. P. (Automatic Resistivity Profiling) is a mobile soil electrical resistivity (ER) mapping system conceived by Geocarta (Paris, France), and it is comprised by a couple of transmitter sprocket-wheels, which inject current within the soil, and three couples of receiver sprocket-wheels, which measure the voltage-drop at three different depths, about 0 - 50, 0 - 100 and 0 - 170 cm. Ten vineyards of “Villa Albius” farm in Sicily region (southern Italy) were chosen to carry out the A. R. P. survey, for a overall surface of 45 hectares. The vineyards were located in a wide Plio-Pleistocene marine terrace, characterized by a few meters level of calcarenite, overlying partially cemented by calcium carbonate yellow sands. During the A.

40|$|The most {{prominent}} paleosol {{unit in the}} Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) is the fifth paleosol complex (S- 5) with its well-developed very thick and dark colored pedons. To provide more insight {{in the formation of}} S- 5 and its environmental significance, the pedogenesis and clay mineral transformation in the S- 5 of the Wugong section (Shaanxi Province) on the southernmost CLP are analyzed. S- 5 at the Wugong section is essentially composed of three well-developed reddish pedons (i. e., S 5 - 1, S 5 - 2, S 5 - 3) which signify three glacial-interglacial climatic fluctuations during its formation. Complete decalcification in each pedon and a <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> of only 30 - 50 cm in thickness beneath each of the three pedons suggests that after deposition the pedons developed with a relatively stable surface in a sustained warm and humid climate. Clay formation in the S- 5 includes neogenesis of clay materials by in situ post-depositional weathering and mechanical migration of the fine fraction after complete decalcification. Complete leaching of CaCO 3, intensive clay formation (with 60 - 100 % higher clay content than that in the overlying and underlying loess (L- 5 and L- 6)) and extremely high magnetic susceptibility in the S- 5 pedons reflected a warmer, more humid climate and soil environment for pedogenesis than in the 'optimum' Holocene. However, the chemical alteration of the phyllosilicate minerals was weak and restrained by the hard <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon,</b> the compact argillic horizon and the flat terrain. The major clay mineral weathering processes during the formation of the S- 5 pedons at the Wugong section were depotassication, hydrolysis of primary minerals and degradation of chlorite. The pedogenesis in a loess-paleosol sequence and its pedogenic environment can best be deduced from combined data on pedogenic properties, and geochemical and mineralogical characteristics.

40|$|The {{calcification}} of {{soils and}} the effects of topography on this process were studied in semi-arid regions of Kermanshah. From a toposequence, based on the previous soil surveys of the region, five profiles were selected, and field studies and laboratory analyses were carried out on soils. Alluvial - colluvial fans, piedmont alluvial plains, and old plateaux were three main physiographies on the selected toposequence. Soil moisture and temperature regimes were Xeric and Thermic, respectively. The results indicate that redistribution of carbonates and soil formation processes may be categorized in four specific stages to be described in the text. Accumulation of calcium carbonates in soil profiles showed two basic forms: one in sandy layers of fine - textured soil profiles under the influence of abrupt textural changes and lower permeability, and the second in subsurface horizons of soils with calcareous parent material. The morphological evidences showed that in addition to translocation from upper horizons of carbonates by solution and suspension, physical movements to subsurface layers of fine calcareous materials have also affected the formation of <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons.</b> In other words, CaCO 3 may have moved as fine particles through soil cracks and subsequently accumulated in the lower horizons.

40|$|Under arid to semihumid climatic conditions, {{dissolution}} of primary carbonate and recrystallization with carbon (C) from soil CO₂ leads to accumulation of {{significant amounts of}} pedogenic (secondary) carbonate. Most soils of arid and semiarid regions contain a carbonate accumulation horizon, the depth of which is related to climatic conditions and properties of parent material. It remains unclear whether this carbonate migrates from the upper horizons before or after recrystallization with soil CO₂. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine recrystallization rates during initial pedogenesis and to estimate the accumulation depth of secondary carbonate based on C isotopic exchange during secondary carbonate formation in an experiment with alternating moisture conditions. Maize grown on 1 m high loess-filled columns was pulse labeled in ¹⁴CO₂ atmosphere every 3 weeks. After 6 months, portions of secondary (recrystallized) CaCO₃ 3 were determined in 5 cm segments, based on ¹⁴C respired in the rhizosphere and subsequently incorporated into newly formed secondary carbonate. More than 80 % of recrystallized carbonate (Ca¹⁴CO₃) was leached from the uppermost 15 cm of the loess column, and more than 70 % of total secondary carbonate were accumulated in a depth between 15 and 50 cm. Based on the recrystallization rate calculated for the uppermost 15 cm of the loess column (1. 77 ±� 0. 26 ⋅ 10 ⁻⁵ day⁻¹), between 300 and more than 1, 700 years are necessary for complete decalcification of the upper 15 cm.

40|$|The {{traditional}} soil survey, {{aimed to}} the production of soil maps, encounters methodological difficulties and high costs, particularly if accurate measurements, necessary for the interpretation of the spatial variations of the soil properties, are essential to address management strategies, {{as in the case of}} precision agriculture. In effect, the traditional soil survey made by augering and soil profile excavation is totally incompatible with a spatially dense sampling strategy, which would destroy the soil. For these reasons, there is an increasing attention toward the application of geophysical methods with respect to the traditional soils survey. In fact, the geophysical methods, that are non-invasive, fast and cost-effective, can be of great help in soil mapping because they disturb neither the structure nor the dynamics of the soil. In this paper, the results of detailed soil mapping carried out by electromagnetic induction (E. M. I.) and Very Low Frequency (V. L. F.) methods in two areas of Southern Sardinia (Italy), together with direct investigation, are reported. Moreover, a numerical elaboration based on the spectral analysis of the V. L. F. electromagnetic signals, has been effected. For both studied areas, a 1 : 10, 000 soil map, made using traditional soil surveys techniques, is available. Each area is located along a slope, where different soil units are present. Area 1 is characterised by terraced alluvial deposits of Pleistocene age, that cover sandstones, sometimes microconglomeratic, with silty and clayey intercalations, of Middle Eocene-Lower Pliocene age (Cixerri Formation). Calcic Palexeralfs are present in the upper (<b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> at the depth of 82 cm) and middle (<b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> at the depth of 115 cm) part of the slope, while Aquic Haploxeralfs characterise the lower part of the slope. Area 2 is characterised by the outcrop of Oligocenic andesites, that are in fault contact with the Cixerri Formation. The latter is not outcropping as it is covered by andesitic colluvia whose thickness increases downslope. From upslope to downslope, the following soils are present: rock outcrop associated with Lithic Xerorthents, Entic Haploxerolls, Vertic Calcixerepts, and Typic Haploxererts. From our analysis it was found that E. M. I. signals acquired in the above mentioned areas, are connected to the soil nature and composition. Furthermore, the spectral content of the V. L. F. electromagnetic can be considered as one of the key approaches used to improve the soil units characterization at field scale. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{replacement process}} is described {{to explain the}} way in which soft calcic horizons become 'mobile' and actively penetrate the soil. This model implies that the horizons are pedogenetic features which may be very old since they can escape exposure in a landscape subject to erosion. The lime they contain can be derived from the weathering strata through which they have passed in the course of time. The process is initiated by subterranean gilgaï formation which introduces soil material into {{the lower part of the}} <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> which subsequently moves this material upward and expels it from the top. The transport process was re-created in the laboratory and monitored by stereo radiography. Its driving force is derived from air enclosure which occurs upon wetting of crystalline powdery lime. Field data from the study area have yielded evidence of the replacement process and indicate the main controlling factors. Rates of downward movement of the calcic horizons have been calculated to be of the same order of magnitude as representative erosion rates for the area.

Limnopithecus evansi) and oreopithecine apes (Mabokopithecus clarki, M. pickfordi), and galagids (Komba winamensis). Specific habitat preferences can be interpreted from large collections of primate fossils in different kinds of paleosols (pedotypes). Fossiliferous drab-colored paleosols with iron-manganese nodules (Yom pedotype) are like modern soils of seasonally waterlogged depressions (dambo). Their crumb structure and abundant fine root-traces, as well as scattered large calcareous rhizoconcretions indicate former vegetation of seasonally wet, wooded grassland. Other fossiliferous paleosols are evidence of nyika bushland (Ratong), and early-successional riparian woodland (Dhero). No fossils were found in Mogo paleosols interpreted as saline scrub soils. Very shallow <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> (in Yom, Ratong, and Mogo paleosols) and Na-montmorillonite (in Mogo) are evidence of dry paleoclimate (300 – 500 mm MAP=mean annual precipitation). This is the driest paleoclimate and most open vegetation yet inferred as a habitat for any Kenyan Miocene apes or monkeys. Victoriapithecus was abundant in dambo wooded grassland (Yom) and riparian woodland (Dhero), a distribution like that of modern vervet monkeys. Kenyapithecus ranged through all these paleosols, but {{was the most common}} primate in nyika bushland paleosols (Ratong), comparable to baboons and macaques today. Mabokopithecus was virtually restricted to riparian woodland paleosols (Dhero), and Simiolus had a similar, but marginally wider, distribution.

A single specimen of Komba was found in dambo wooded grassland paleosol (Yom), a habitat more like that of the living Senegal bushbaby than of rainforest galagids. A shift to non-forest habitats may explain the terrestrial adaptations of Victoriapithecus, basal to the cercopithecid radiation, and of Kenyapithecus, basal to the hominoid radiation.

40|$|Many sports fields {{developed}} in the El Paso Valley and some in uplands became salinized when irrigated with water containing 800 to 1, 200 mg/L of dissolved salts. The soil types, which were salinized, include compacted soils, clayey Entisols, stony sediments along foothills, and some areas containing an indurated <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon.</b> Salinity of these soils was initially less than 3 dS m- 1 in the saturation extract, and has increased over {{a decade or two}} in excess of 10 dS m- 1, sufficient to deter growth of most turf grass species.

Observation included two municipal parks consisting of sandy alluvial soils, five sports fields consisting of clayey alluvial soils, sports fields consisting of topdressed stony alluvial soils or developed on an indurated <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> through topsoiling. The equipment tested included a rotary tiller, a vibratory spike, aerifiers, a minimum-till surface chisel, a subsoiler, a backhoe, and a front-end loader. Field management practices were left to discretion of cooperators. Soil salinity and photo records of turf response were used as the primary means of the treatment impact. The most significant reduction in soil salinity was found when stratified silty clay was either inverted to the new profile sequence of loamy sand over the fractured silty clay clods or mixed with the loamy sand layer below. Replacement of clays with sandy soils in a corrugated surface to permit lateral drainage was also highly effective in salt leaching in deep clay. Subsoiling of Glendale and Saneli silty clay loam followed by topdressing with a thin layer of sand also resulted in good salt leaching, especially when flood-irrigated using the Rio Grande water. The subsoiling shanks penetrated 20 to 30 inches deep, or almost to {{the full extent of the}} clay layer. It is uncertain if salt leaching can be improved when used in deeper clay, such as Tigua silty clay. The use of minimum-till shallow chisels provided an excellent fracturing of the surface clay layer (6 to 8 inches deep), but salt leaching was limited due to internal drainage impairment. The use of aerifiers did not improve salt leaching, at least at our test sites. Nonetheless, surface implements, especially minimumtill shallow chisels can be used advantageously for renovation or for sustaining high use fields consisting of loam. These preliminary test results are consistent with an earlier finding that soil salinization problems are closely tied with clayey soil textures. Test results also indicate that drainage impairment caused by the clay layer is probably as common as the difficulties with water intake for leaching salts. Since soil improvement measures to be used depend upon soil type, the field should be surveyed for soil type and its distribution prior to planning soil improvement activities. Irrigation systems and scheduling should also be checked. The primary goal of soil improvement activities is to improve soil permeability, water movement and salt leaching, and must be complemented by prudent turf management practices to obtain turf response. There is a need to examine the existing codes or specifications for construction of new fields for improved salt leaching. The current construction codes for sports fields emphasize soil strength and stability, but not salt leaching...|$|E
40|$|In arid regions worldwide, {{dissolution}} pipes {{have been}} observed in indurated calcic horizons. Pipes are defined as dissolution cavities that penetrate the <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> completely and form conduits between the soil layers over- and underlaying it. Since pipes are hidden subsurface soil features {{little is known about}} them. The objectives of this study are (i) to gather field data for the determination of the frequency of pipe occurrence in indurated calcic horizons and (ii) to develop a statistical method to estimate pipe density from observations along a long trench. We have found that pipes are a common feature of calcic horizons in New Mexico. The focus of this study is on two sections in a 32 km long trench on the Lower La Mesa surface in southern New Mexico. The pipes in these two sections showed a wide variety of features with mean diameters ranging from 4. 2 m in Section One to 8. 5 m in Section Two. Our field observations showed that 13 to 16 % of the Lower La Mesa surface is underlain by pipes. This percentage is nearly one order of magnitude larger than any number previously reported in the literature. The pipe density varied from 14 pipes per hectare in Section Two to 150 pipes per hectare in Section One; however in Section Two the sizes of the pipes are bigger. The results of this investigation have important implications for environmental management strategies. On the one hand the frequent occurrence of dissolution pipes and their possible enhancement of downward water fluxes may make desert sites underlain by indurated calcic horizons vulnerable for ground water contamination from hazardous materials stored on the desert floor. On the other hand the pipes may lead to an overall increase of regional ground water recharge. ...|$|E
40|$|The Bolivar {{district}} has excellent potential for delineation {{and expansion of}} reserves beyond what is currently being mined. Comparison with similar deposits in Mexico, USA, and Chile suggests the possibility of 10 - 20 million tons. Existing drilling in the Bolivar Sur zone should be continued and several other targets are outlined. As recommended previously, {{it is important to}} have a better understanding of igneous systematics in the Bolivar district, including dating and major/minor element compositional analysis. The 3 D database needs to be completed so that accurate maps and cross sections can be drawn to help visualize the Bolivar system. Preliminary plots of surface geochemical analyses indicate a strong Mo and W geochem anomaly that is coincident with the hypothesized center of skarn alteration in the Bolivar Sur zone. This should be drilled. The 3 D database should also be used to plot the distribution of the two main stratigraphic zones which host ore, the upper <b>calcic</b> carbonate <b>horizon</b> which predominantly hosts Zn-rich ore and the lower dolomitic horizon which predominantly hosts Cu-rich ore. It is particularly important to drill these horizons where they are intersected by structures or breccia pipes/zones. In addition, the topography of the Bolivar Granodiorite in the subsurface is an important control on ore distribution...|$|R
40|$|The geomorphological {{study of}} {{alluvial}} plains takes great advantage from {{the integration of}} detailed altimetry with high-resolution images, especially in the lower-relief sectors, {{like those in the}} distal plain of the Brenta and Bacchiglione rivers near the city of Padua (mean slope 1 - 0. 8 ‰). The LiDAR data which were specifically acquired for this research (Riegl LMS-Q 560, mean density 7 points/m 2, overall area 123 km 2), were classified and interpolated in order to map fluvial and anthropogenic landforms. The acquisition was carried out in a moment of minimal vegetation luxuriance (March 2011), in order to minimize ground cover. The DEM (z accuracy < 5 - 10 cm) was processed and analyzed in integration with high resolution oblique and vertical, multispectral (VIS + IR) and panchromatic aerial images. These latter were acquired during the summer crop season, with the aim of maximizing the detection of vegetation response to different soils, sediments and landforms (cropmarks). A detailed field survey was conducted with soil observation, hand augerings and description of stratigraphic sections in pits, in order to validate the remote sensing interpretations. The detailed topography allowed the identification and mapping of low rise interfluves and scarps (< 1 - 2 m), paleochannels, scroll bars and crevasse splays. The reconstruction of a precise "ground" surface in the narrow medieval streets detailed the morphology of the multi-stratified archeological mound in the historical center of Padua. The remote sensing of cropmarks is the most appropriate method to complete the mapping of the numerous fluvial forms that have little or no topographic expression being too small (i. e. minor crevasse channels and splays) and/or flattened by anthropogenic activity (mainly plowing). LiDAR intensity permitted a precise mapping of LGM deposits that have shown peculiar reflectivity related to specific soil characteristics (i. e., presence of <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> in well-drained, elevated position). High resolution images and LiDAR DEM allow the analysis of this largely anthropized low-plain environment at cell-size scale of 0. 5 - 1 m, i. e. approximating the original complexity of the alluvial sedimentary environment. The results bring advances in the comprehension of the Last Glacial Maximum and Holocene evolution of the Brenta-Bacchiglione plain. The large-scale mapping of paleohydrographic features led to the recognition of different fluvial styles adopted by the Brenta River: i) braided to wandering paleochannels, 100 - 300 m wide, in fine-sediment dominated fluvioglacial LGM distal alluvial plain, ii) meandering (up to ~ 3. 5) single channels, 50 - 100 m wide, with evidence of lateral migration in early and middle Holocene channel belts, and iii) low to medium sinuosity (~ 1. 15 - 1. 5) single channels with vertical aggradation, associated with ridges and widespread crevasse channels and splays during the middle Holocene. The derived maps provide significant support to land and urban planning, e. g., in the definition of appropriate geotechnical analysis, the estimation of buried archeological deposits in the city center, and the assessment of flooding hazard...|$|R
40|$|Complete {{issue of}} Desert Plants. Portions {{of the eastern}} Mojave Desert region of southeastern California, {{southern}} Nevada, and west-central Arizona that receive significant inputs of warm-season precipitation contain large areas dominated by various C 4 perennial grasses including Pleuraphis rigida, P. jamesii, Bouteloua eriopoda, and B. gracilis. The lower elevation at which the two Bouteloua species occur rises {{from east to west}} in response to diminished precipitation, especially that received during the warm season. Unpredictability of warm-season precipitation also increases from east to west, but these grasses occasionally make use of cool-season precipitation stored in the soil, once temperatures required for the C 4 photosynthetic pathway are achieved in late spring, but before the onset of summer monsoonal precipitation. Species distributions vary with elevation, with P. rigida occurring at lower elevations, B. eriopoda and P. jamesii at intermediate elevations, and B. gracilis at higher elevations. Composition of communities containing the latter three species is similar to grassland formations of the cool-temperate grasslands (grama-galleta steppe) of the Colorado Plateau region. Small, less predictable amounts of warm-season precipitation probably impose the greatest limitation to the diversity of C 4 grasses in the eastern Mojave Desert region. However, due to warmer minimum winter temperatures, the woody plant and succulent floras associated with perennial grasses in the eastern Mojave region bear greater resemblance to those of the warm-temperate, semi-desert grasslands of west-central Arizona, southeastern Arizona, and the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts. The presence of these woody plant and succulents in perennial grass-dominated communities in the eastern Mojave Desert imparts a structural character {{similar to that of the}} warm-temperate semi-arid grasslands of southern Arizona. Although climate (particularly warm-season precipitation) is a first-order determinant of the occurrence of perennial C 4 grasses in the eastern Mojave Desert region, geological characteristics that control soil formation and soil hydrological behavior strongly influence composition of communities. The common denominator of sites dominated by grasses is a soil with relatively thick, fine-grained soil horizons that are conducive to exploitation by relatively shallow, diffuse, fibrous root systems of those grasses. Such soils occur in diverse settings, ranging from relatively steep hillslopes underlain by bedrock to gently inclined alluvial fans. In rocky hillslope environments, these kinds of soils are associated with late Pleistocene colluvium deposits in which eolian dust accumulation is principally responsible for forming the thick, fine-grained horizons. Erosion of these soils on hillslopes contributes to hydrological conditions more conducive to taproot systems of woody plants that occupy deeper fractures and joints in bedrock. Similarly, erosional truncation of well-developed soils of alluvial fans and exposure of cemented, relatively impenetrable <b>calcic</b> <b>horizons</b> produce a shift in dominance by perennial grasses to woody plants. In many settings, the presence of relatively dense perennial grass cover plays an essential role in moderating surface flows and inhibiting erosion. Prior to Anglo-American settlement of the region in the late 1800 s, occasional wildfires may have fostered dominance of perennial grasses in some of these areas. Since the 1890 s, livestock ranching has significantly impacted perennial grass-dominated vegetation. Removal of livestock from portions of the region around 2000, coupled with years of abundant warm-season precipitation, in some cases combined with wildfire, has led to a resurgence of perennial grasses in some areas. Effective management and conservation of these areas require a comprehensive understanding of the composition, occurrence, and ecological functioning of these communities...|$|R
40|$|Abiotic and biotic land surface {{properties}} are often highly heterogeneous but can assemble in a repetitive manner forming landform mosaics at a mesoscale (ten {{to hundreds of}} meters). Nonetheless, {{we still do not}} fully understand their interactions or the mechanisms involved that change these properties during landscape evolution. The goal of this work was to relate land {{surface properties}} to functional group diversity of biological soil crusts and vascular plants, ecosystem functions and pedogenesis within a Mojave Desert landscape. Seven mosaic types were visually identified that occurred on three geomorphic-aged surfaces: young bars and swales, intermediate-aged flattened bars, flattened swales and bioturbation units, and old desert pavement and shrub zones. Sixty-three randomly selected landform mosaics served as study plots. In each plot a suite of morphometrical, physical and biological variables were determined. Multivariate analysis revealed that landform mosaics are statistically distinct according to specific sets of abiotic and biotic land surface properties. Within each landform type I also detected significant differences in functional group diversity of plants and biological soil crusts. The aggregate stability, nitrogen and carbon fixation of crusts were measured. An area based quality index (ABQI) was developed to evaluate these microbial communities based on ecological functions. The ABQI was computed for each landform mosaic and statistically compared. The ABQI was highest for bars and lowest for desert pavements. Two landform evolutionary trajectories were identified: an abiogenic and a biogenic tract. In the abiogenic track, vegetation contracted and the surface increased in physical components. In the biogenic track vegetation diversity and abundance increased, and crust cover and diversity was high. Both of these trajectories were linked to different pedogeneses. Abiogenic soils promoted vesicular and <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> development, as well as sodicity and alkalinity. Organic carbon and total nitrogen decreased. Biogenic soils were well mixed. No vesicular horizon could develop and calcic horizons were weakly expressed. Furthermore, these soils increased in organic carbon and total nitrogen. Overall, this work showed that desert landscapes are highly diverse in landform mosaics defined by abiotic and biotic land surface properties at the mesoscale. Moreover, strong linkages and feedbacks occur between physical, biotic and pedologic landscape components that over time result in quite contrasting surface features...|$|E
40|$|Several soil chronosequences {{were studied}} in {{southern}} California {{to determine the}} relative impacts of time and climatic change on soil genesis. Studying soil development in climatic regimes that vary from the moist, xeric climate of the coastal basins and Transverse Ranges to the hot, arid climate of the interior deserts of southern California provide data useful for evaluation {{of the impact of}} climatic change as well as time on pedogenesis. Seven distinctive stages of soil development are recognized in the study area. The first three occur in Holocene soils, and the last four are associated with late to mid-Pleistocene geomorphic surfaces. A distinct pattern of secondary soil mineral authigenesis is observed in increasingly older soils. The rapid formation of vermiculite and iron oxyhydroxides in xeric climates is attributed to rapid alteration of unstable Fe-bearing aluminosilicates. Continuous weathering of abundant feldspars results in a predominance of neogenetic kaolinite in mid-Pleistocene soils. Slightly acidic to mildly alkaline soil pH, rapid hydrolysis, and availablity of organic complexes result in formation of significant amounts of metastable ferrihydrite in young Holocene and late Pleistocene soils. Ferrihydrite dehydration and crystal aggregation result in hematite formation and increasingly lower Fe(, 2) O(, 3) o:Fe(, 2) O(, 3) d ratios. Arid climatic regimes are conductive to minimal chemical weathering. Clay/iron oxhydroxide regression analyses and mass balance calculations show that much of the silicate clay and secondary carbonate have been derived from external sources rather than by chemical weathering. Clay mineral authigenesis is characterized primarily by conversion of montmorillonite to palygorskite. A compartmental model developed in this study accurately predicts <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> development under Holocene soil water balance characteristics. Results of model predictions indicate that the distribution of carbonate observed in latest Pleistocene soils is related to past changes in climate. In addition, mass balance calculations suggest that large decreases in chemical reaction rates in soils due to soil temperature decreases may well be offset by increases in the magnitude of weathering. However, {{the results of this study}} indicate that calcium carbonate provides the most sensitive index of past climates when compared to other indices and that temporal change in climate has significantly influenced soil development in southern California...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Soil genesis and {{development}} in arid and semi-arid areas are strongly affected by geological formations and geomorphic surfaces. Various morphological, physical, and geochemical soil properties at different geomorphic positions are usually attributed to different soil forming factors including parent material and climate. Due to variations in climate, geological formations (Quaternary, Neogene and Cretaceous) and geomorphology, {{the aim of the}} present research was the study of genesis, development, clay mineralogy, and micromorphology of soils affected by climate, geology and geomorphology in Bardsir area, Kerman Province. Materials and Methods: The study area, 25000 ha, starts from Bardsir and extends to Khanesorkh elevations close to Sirjan city. The climate of the area is warm and semi-arid with mean annual temperature and precipitation of 14. 9 °C and 199 mm, respectively. Soil moisture and temperature regimes of the area are aridic and mesic due to 1 : 2500000 map, provided by Soil and Water Research Institute. Moving to west and southwest, soil moisture regime of the area changes to xeric with increasing elevation. Using topography and geology maps (1 : 100000) together with Google Earth images, geomorphic surfaces and geologic formations of the area were investigated. Mantled pediment (pedons 1, 3, 7, and 8), rock pediment (pedon 2), semi-stable alluvial plain (pedon 6), unstable alluvial plain (pedon 5), piedmont plain (pedons 9 and 11), intermediate surface of alluvial plain and pediment (pedon 4), and old river terrace (pedon 10) are among geomorphic surfaces investigated in the area. Mantled pediment is composed of young Quaternary sediments and Cretaceous marls. Rock pediments are mainly formed by Cretaceous marls. Quaternary formations are dominant in alluvial plains. Alluvial terraces and intermediate surface of alluvial plain and pediment are dominated by Neogene conglomerates. Siltstone, sandstone, and Neogene marls together with Neogene conglomerates are among dominant geological formations of piedmont plain. Eleven pedons affected by young Quaternary sediments, Neogene and Cretaceous marls in aridic, aridic border to xeric, and xeric moisture regimes on above-mentioned geomorphic surfaces were described and sampled using Natural Resources Conservation Service (2012) guideline. Physicochemical properties, clay mineralogy, and micromorphology of soil samples investigated and soils were classified by Soil Taxonomy (2014) and WRB (2015) systems. Results and Discussion: Calcic, gypsic, argillic, and cambic diagnostic horizons investigated after field and laboratory studies. Typic Calcigypsids, Lithic Torriorthents, Typic Haplogypsids, Typic Haplocalcids, Typic Torrifluvents, Sodic Haplocambids, Typic Calciargids, and Xeric Haplocalcids subgroups were found using Soil Taxonomy (2014) system. Gypsisols, Calcisols, Luvisols, Cambisols, and Regosols reference soil groups identified by WRB (2015) classification system.

Soils in aridic moisture regimes were little developed with gypsic horizon, and where <b>calcic</b> <b>horizon</b> was formed, it was near the surface. Moving to the west with increasing humidity, gypsum was leached from the pedon and clay illuviation caused argillic horizon to be formed.

Five soil pedons, developing on “Serie Gessoso- Solfifera”, were selected in a very representative forest Mediterranean ecosystem in Sicily (I). Pedons were opened, described in field and sampled according to the sequence of genetic horizons. Soil samples were analyzed to investigate 87 / 86 Sr ratio in leached and residual soil fractions as well as total amount of carbonates and gypsum.

40|$|Ooids, pisoids, nodules, concretions, {{and a host}} {{of other}} terms are used to {{describe}} concentrically-zoned pedogenic carbonate, phyllosilicates, silica, and other minerals in <b>calcic</b> and petrocalcic <b>horizons</b> worldwide. The pedogenic and paleoenvironmental significance of such features is not always easy to interpret because variations in size, structure, composition, and soil-geomorphic context have been used to infer distinct modes of genesis for features that appear similar. Using both optical and scanning electron microscopy, petrocalcic soil samples from the Jornada La Mesa geomorphic surface in New Mexico and the Mormon Mesa geomorphic surface in Nevada were studied to reconsider the formation of pedogenic ooids. In this paper, “ooids” are 3 ̆c 2 mm in diameter and are comprised of concentrically alternating carbonate and fibrous clay laminae. “Pisoids” are 3 ̆e 2 mm in diameter and have a range of internal morphologies. Ooids were especially common within features including clast pendant laminae, pisoids, and laminar horizons or laminar horizon caps. We propose a possible new mode of ooid genesis, suggesting that crystal growth can move ooids tiny, incremental distances over time, and that phyllosilicates are an important genetic component. Ooids are interpreted to form via: (1) mineralization during the evaporation of solutions held by surface tension around mineral grains, clasts, or petrocalcic fragments, with or without the presence of organic matter, (2) hydration and plastic behavior of pervasive, pedogenic, fibrous phyllosilicates that co-precipitate with pedogenic calcite, and (3) tiny, successive movements caused by the crystallization pressure of pedogenic carbonate and other minerals during soil solution evaporation. Spheroidal morphology is initially promoted by chemical precipitation from evaporating solutions around grains. Next, crystallization pressures from the surrounding matrix displace grains non-uniformly, promoting stochastic contacts or ‘knocking’ of ooids against one another and against the soil matrix. Over long time spans, this micrometer-scale, episodic translocation and rotation, in tandem with the plastic behavior of fibrous phyllosilicates, enhances the spherical shape of ooids. The model described here does not preclude possible biological contributions to ooid genesis, nor refute the role of other processes in producing similar features in the same soil. Finally, ooid size is limited by physical and hydrological thresholds. Pisoids, as larger features, are more complex and are more likely to involve erosion; they do not form in the same manner as ooids. This study has implications for paleoenvironmental interpretations of <b>calcic</b> and petrocalcic <b>horizons,</b> and for the selection of pedogenic features for isotopic analysis...|$|R

Humic acids were isolated from 21 soil samples differing in terms of vegetation (pine, holm oak, oak), geological substrate (granite, limestone), soil type (Humic Dystrudepts, Humic Dystroxerepts, Humic Haploxerepts, <b>Calcic</b> Argixerolls), soil <b>horizon</b> (O, A 1, A 2), humus type (calcic mull, mesotrophic-acid mull, moder), physiographic unit (hillside, moorland, ramp), altitudinal step, epipedon (mollic or umbric) and moisture regimen (udic or xeric), which were used as environmental classification factors. Quantitative peak intensity data were obtained from the second derivative infrared spectra of the humic acids. Discriminant analysis with automatic variable backward selection was used to identify the infrared bands showing more systematic changes in their intensities depending on the above classification factors. The diagnostic infrared bands chosen were at 1720, 1260 and 1330 cm- 1, corresponding mainly to carboxyl and lignin-derived O-containing functional groups. The bands at 2920 and 1510 cm- 1, corresponding to aliphatic and aromatic structures of the carbon backbone, respectively, were not significantly responsive to the environmental variability in the studied samples. The results showed how, in the scenario under study, taking advantage of the relative intensities of specific peaks from the second derivative infrared spectra, it is possible to discriminate different soil Suborders and humus types, as well as between several physiographic and bioclimatic features. © 2010 Elsevier B.
