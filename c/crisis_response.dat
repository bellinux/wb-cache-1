5|$|Through its Global Trade Finance Program, the IFC {{guarantees}} trade payment {{obligations of}} more than 200 approved banks in over 80 countries to mitigate risk for international transactions. The Global Trade Finance Program provides guarantees to cover payment risks for emerging market banks regarding promissory notes, bills of exchange, letters of credit, bid and performance bonds, supplier credit for capital goods imports, and advance payments. The IFC issued $3.46 billion in more than 2,800 guarantees in 2010, of which over 51% targeted IDA member nations. In its fiscal year 2011, the IFC issued $4.6 billion in more than 3,100 guarantees. In 2009, the IFC launched a separate program for <b>crisis</b> <b>response,</b> known as its Global Trade Liquidity Program, which provides liquidity for international trade among developing countries.

The article discusses the properties of time and its consequences during crises along these two notions, reviewing existing scholarly work on time and crises.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the important role}} that the European Statistical Agency - Eurostat - plays in shaping tools for responding to banking crises. From 2009, Eurostat used its position as the interpreter of member state budget statistical rules to implement increasingly stringent rules for how financial <b>crisis</b> <b>responses</b> would affect public budgets. Rather than mere technical details, these rules affected <b>crisis</b> <b>responses.</b> Elected politicians, and especially those under bailout programs, have strong incentives to minimise the direct budgetary effects of aiding failing financial institutions. By establishing and enforcing new rules about which crisis reponses directly hit member state budgets and which did not, Eurostat created incentives to choose certain policies. We explore this process by examining the creation of bad banks and the European Stability Mechanism.

40|$|This article compares {{government}} {{responses to}} the Great Recession of 2008 – 2009 with government responses to recessions and other economic challenges in the period 1974 – 1982. We focus on five countries: France, Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across these countries, we observe two broad shifts in <b>crisis</b> <b>responses.</b> First, governments have in the recent period eschewed heterodox crisis policies and relied more exclusively on fiscal stimulus. Second, tax cuts have become a more important component of fiscal stimulus while spending cuts have featured more prominently in governments’ efforts to consolidate their fiscal position.

40|$|Crisis {{situations}} {{can cause}} {{internal and external}} stakeholders to question the legit-imacy of organizations. When faced with a crisis, organizations are compelled to communicate strategically with stakeholders to manage legitimacy.

Using a quasi-experimental, 2 X 2 X 4 design, the study tests the hypotheses that (a) organizations that produce consis-tent <b>crisis</b> <b>responses</b> across stakeholders will enhance their legitimacy, while organ-izations that produce inconsistent <b>crisis</b> <b>responses</b> will reduce theirs; (b) generalist organizations are perceived as being more legitimate than specialist organizations; and (c) when combined, niche-width and crisis-response consistency will produce differing effects on organizational legitimacy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} Nordic {{embassies}} in Tokyo and the different ways in which theym chose to respond to the nuclear crisis following the massive earthquake and tsunami off the Pacific coast of Tohoku, Japan, on March 11, 2011. Although the embassies technically were subject to the same level of threat, their individual <b>crisis</b> <b>responses</b> have exhibited varying levels of precaution. For example, while the Swedish and Danish embassies remained fully operational in Tokyo, the Norwegian and Finnish embassies relocated most or all of their staff to provisional operations further away from the nuclear hazard. As a researcher in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), the wide display of responses raises an interesting question concerning the basic circumstances of nuclear risk, for how can the same circumstances generate such different scientific assessments and management strategies? What underlying considerations particular to the individual embassy can explain the Nordic variation in <b>crisis</b> <b>responses?</b> In accordance with the teachings of Dorothy Nelkin, the uncertain nature of nuclear radiation compounds the difficulties of risk assessment and leaves considerable scope for subjective factors to enter both scientific interpretations and public perceptions. With regard to the Nordic <b>crisis</b> <b>responses,</b> it becomes clear that various political, reputational, and economic interests have influenced the different outcomes. Yet, as it turns out, even coinciding interests may produce differing risk evaluations. By way of a methodical application of Cultural Theory (c. f. Mary Douglas et al.), this study shows how embassy diplomats with few personal ties to their Japanese communities have been more prone to opt for a higher degree of precaution, i. e. embassy relocation, than those more integrated in Japanese society. The interesting angle of a Nordic-specific comparison (as opposed to, say, a comparison between the Norwegian and Japanese <b>crisis</b> <b>responses)</b> {{is the fact that it}} becomes hard to argue “Culture” as the main explanatory factor behind the differences. As the thesis demonstrates, concerns about risk may depend less on culture at large than on social, contextual, or political biases...|$|R

5000|$|The roots for SCCT can {{be found}} in Attribution Theory. Attribution Theory holds that people {{constantly}} look to find causes, or make attributions, for different events, especially if those events are particularly negative or unexpected. People will attribute responsibility for the event and react emotionally to that event. In the case of organizations, attributions of causality elicit emotional reactions from stakeholders, especially negative emotions if the organization is attributed as the cause for a crisis. These negative emotions, like anger, affect stakeholders’ future interactions with the organization, changing behaviors like purchases and word-of-mouth recommendations. [...] Attribution Theory provided one of the first links between crisis situations and <b>crisis</b> <b>responses.</b> Attributions of responsibility that shape strategic <b>crisis</b> <b>responses</b> formed the foundation for SCCT. Coombs built upon Attribution Theory, using it as a base to predict the severity of potential reputational harm—or reputational threat—a crisis may bring to an organization and, using that prediction, guide communication response decisions to minimize damage.|$|R
