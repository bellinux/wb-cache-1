40|$|The {{analysis}} of the linearization effect in multifractal analysis, and hence of the estimation of moments for multifractal processes, is revisited borrowing concepts from the statistical physics of disordered systems, notably from the {{analysis of}} the so-called Random Energy Model. Considering a standard multifractal process (compound Poisson motion), chosen as a simple representative example, we show: i) the existence of a critical order $q^*$ beyond which moments, though finite, cannot be estimated through empirical averages, irrespective of the sample size of the observation; ii) that multifractal exponents necessarily behave linearly in $q$, for $q > q^*$. Tayloring the analysis conducted for the Random Energy Model to that <b>of</b> <b>Compound</b> Poisson <b>motion,</b> we provide explicative and quantitative predictions for the values of $q^*$ and for the slope controlling the linear behavior of the multifractal exponents.

According to the results of optimization, the vibration experiments were carried out on real screed. The experimental results show that, the harmful inertial force produced by the dual tamping mechanism has been significantly reduced, and the stability of vibration can be effectively improved when screed paving.

In {{the present study}} this phenomenon was studied with two-dimensional motion stimuli. A random dot pattern moved alternately in the vertical and oblique direction (zig-zag motion). The vertical <b>motion</b> was <b>of</b> 1. 04 ° length; it was produced by three discrete spatial steps of the dots. Thereafter the dots were displaced by a single spatial step in oblique direction. Each motion lasted for 57 ms. The upper spatial limit for perception <b>of</b> the oblique <b>motion</b> was measured under two conditions: the vertical component <b>of</b> the oblique <b>motion</b> and the vertical motion were either in the same or in opposite directions. It {{was found that the}} perception <b>of</b> the oblique <b>motion</b> was strongly influenced by the relative direction <b>of</b> the vertical <b>motion</b> that preceded it; in the “same” condition the upper spatial limit was much shorter than in the “opposite” condition.

40|$|When {{processing}} image sequences some representation <b>of</b> image <b>motion</b> must {{be derived}} {{as a first}} stage. The most often used representation is the optical flow field, which {{is a set of}} velocity measurements of image patterns. It is well known that {{it is very difficult to}} estimate accurate optical flow at locations in an image which correspond to scene discontinuities. What is less well known, however, is that even at the locations corresponding to smooth scene surfaces, the optical flow field often cannot be estimated accurately. Noise in the data causes many optical flow estimation techniques to give biased flow estimates. Very often there is consistent bias: the estimate tends to be an underestimate in length and to be in a direction closer to the majority of the gradients in the patch. This paper studies all three major categories of flow estimation methods—gradient-based, energy-based, and correlation methods, and it analyzes different ways <b>of</b> <b>compounding</b> one-dimensional <b>motion</b> estimates (image gradients, spatiotemporal frequency triplets, local correlation estimates) into two-dimensional velocity estimates, including linear and nonlinear methods. Correcting for the bias would require knowledge of the noise parameters. In many situations, however, these are difficult to estimate accurately, as they change with the dynamic imagery in unpredictable and complex ways. Thus, the bias really is a problem inherent to optical flow estimation. We argue that the bias is also integral to the human visual system. It is the cause of the illusory perception <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in the Ouchi pattern and also explains various psychophysical studies of the perception of moving plaids. c ○ 2001 Academic Press Key Words: analysis of optical flow estimation algorithms; bias; optical illusion...|$|R
