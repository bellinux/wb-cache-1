A multi-converter based energy storage system is proposed, in which solar power is the primary source while the grid or the diesel generator is selected as the secondary source. The existence of the secondary source facilitates the <b>battery</b> state of <b>charge</b> detection by providing a <b>constant</b> <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> current.

40|$|The {{inductive}} {{power transfer}} (IPT) technique in <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> applications has many advantages compared to conventional plug-in systems. Due to the dependencies on transformer characteristics, loading profile, and operating frequency of an IPT system, {{it is not}} a trivial design task to provide the <b>battery</b> the required <b>constant</b> <b>charging</b> current (CC) or <b>constant</b> <b>battery</b> <b>charging</b> voltage (CV) efficiently under the condition of a wide load range possibly defined by the charging profile. This paper analyzes four basic IPT circuits with series-series (SS), series-parallel (SP), parallel-series (PS), and parallel-parallel (PP) compensations systematically to identify conditions for realizing load-independent output current or voltage, as well as resistive input impedance. Specifically, one load-independent current output circuit and one load-independent voltage output circuit having the same transformer, compensating capacitors, and operating frequency can be readily combined into a hybrid topology with fewest additional switches to facilitate the transition from CC to CV. Finally, hybrid topologies using either SS and PS compensation or SP and PP compensation are proposed for <b>battery</b> <b>charging.</b> Fixed-frequency duty cycle control can be easily implemented for the converters.
