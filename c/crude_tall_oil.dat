50|$|The main {{byproducts}} of kraft pulping are crude {{sulfate turpentine}} and tall oil soap. The availability {{of these is}} strongly dependent on wood species, growth conditions, storage time of logs and chips, and the mill's process. Pines are the most extractive rich woods. The raw turpentine is volatile and is distilled of the digester, while the raw soap is separated from the spent black liquor by decantation of the soap layer formed on top of the liquor storage tanks. From pines the average yield of turpentine is 5-10 kg/t pulp and of <b>crude</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> is 30-50 kg/t pulp.|$|E

40|$|Rapeseed and <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> are {{important}} renewable feedstocks for chemicals and energy — the former, an agricultural crop, and the latter, is {{a by-product of}} the pulp and paper industry. This report presents {{a study on the}} production of fatty epoxides from rapeseed methyl ester, <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> methyl ester, and <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> fatty acids by a solvent-free lipase-mediated process. Fatty epoxides are useful reactive building blocks for production of lubricants, plasticizers, and surfactants. Epoxidation of the different raw materials exhibited similar reaction speeds, energy requirements, and final conversions, and the epoxide products were biodegradable and nontoxic up to high concentrations. From environmental and economic perspectives, however, the use of <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> as raw material is preferable to rapeseed.

50|$|In the Kraft Process, high {{alkalinity}} {{and temperature}} converts the esters and carboxylic acids in rosin into soluble sodium soaps of lignin, rosin, and fatty acids. The spent cooking liquor is called weak black liquor {{and is about}} 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20 - 30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to float in the storage tank for the weak or intermediate liquors and are skimmed off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2 - 0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called raw rosin soap or rosinate. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to settle or is centrifuged to release {{as much as possible}} of the entrained black liquor. The soap goes then to the acidulator where it is heated and acidified with sulfuric acid to produce <b>crude</b> <b>tall</b> <b>oil</b> (CTO).|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{was part of the}} general wartime plan to investigate unexploited sources of vegetable oil in Canada. In spite of a potential supply of 2000 tons annually, according to an estimate for Canada in 1943, very little effort has been devoted to Canadian <b>tall</b> <b>oil.</b> This oil is a by-product of sulfate pulp mills and of the seven such mills in Canada only one or two are making an attempt to market <b>tall</b> <b>oil.</b> Its use is discouraged by its complex nature and in the unrefined grades the color and odour are additional handicaps.

5000|$|The carbon {{emissions}} (carbon footprint) produced by biofuels are calculated using {{a technique called}} Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This uses a [...] "cradle to grave" [...] or [...] "well to wheels" [...] approach to calculate {{the total amount of}} carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted during biofuel production, from putting seed in the ground to using the fuel in cars and trucks. Many different LCAs have been done for different biofuels, with widely differing results. Several well-to-wheel analysis for biofuels has shown that first generation biofuels can reduce {{carbon emissions}}, with savings depending on the feedstock used, and second generation biofuels can produce even higher savings when compared to using fossil fuels. However, those studies did not take into account emissions from nitrogen fixation, or additional carbon emissions due to indirect land use changes. In addition, many LCA studies fail to analyze the effect of substitutes that may come into the market to replace current biomass-based products. In the case of <b>Crude</b> <b>Tall</b> <b>Oil,</b> a raw material used in the production of pine chemicals and now being diverted for use in biofuel, an LCA study [...] found that the global carbon footprint of pine chemicals produced from CTO is 50 percent lower than substitute products used in the same situation offsetting any gains from utilizing a biofuel to replace fossil fuels. Additionally the study showed that fossil fuels are not reduced when CTO is diverted to biofuel use and the substitute products consume disproportionately more energy. This diversion will negatively affect an industry that contributes significantly to the world economy, globally producing more than 3 billion pounds of pine chemicals annually in complex, high technology refineries and providing jobs directly and indirectly {{for tens of thousands of}} workers.|$|E
