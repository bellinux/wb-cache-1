5|$|Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (SV 325, The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland) is {{an opera}} {{consisting}} of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season. The story, taken from {{the second half of}} Homer's Odyssey, tells how <b>constancy</b> and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope.

The <b>constancy</b> of the decay rates is also governed by first principles in quantum mechanics, wherein any deviation in the rate would require {{a change in the}} fundamental constants.

In addition, {{there is also a}} high degree of <b>constancy</b> of the MOMENT/FORCE ratio (with respect to the bracket). This means also a homogeneous dental movement.

25|$|Based on the {{philosophy}} of Fictionalism, the philosopher Oskar Kraus (1921) and others claimed that the foundations of relativity were only fictitious and even self-contradictory. Examples were the <b>constancy</b> {{of the speed of}} light, time dilation, length contraction. These effects appear to be mathematically consistent as a whole, but in reality they allegedly are not true. Yet, this view was immediately rejected. The foundations of relativity (such as the equivalence principle or the relativity principle) are not fictitious, but based on experimental results. Also, effects like <b>constancy</b> of the speed of light and relativity of simultaneity are not contradictory, but complementary to one another.|$|E

40|$|Our {{perception}} {{starts with}} the image that falls on our retina and in this retinal image, distant objects are small and shadowed surfaces are dark. But {{this is not what}} we see. Visual <b>constancies</b> correct for distance so that a person approaching us does not appear to become a larger person, a white sheet held in a shadow still appears white, and so forth. Interestingly, an artist, when rendering a scene realistically, must undo all these corrections and return to the image on their retina, making, for example, distant objects appropriately small. Have artists acquired specialized adaptations of vision to accomplish this task? We examined the perceptual abilities of artists compared to non-artists by first asking them to adjust either the size or the brightness of a target to match it to a standard that was presented either on a perspective grid or within a cast shadow. We instructed them to ignore the context, judging size, for example, by imagining the separation between their fingers if they were to pick up the test object from the display screen. Then to test the speed with which artists might access early visual representations, subjects searched for an L-shape in contact with a circle; the target was an L-shape, but because of visual completion, it appeared to be a square occluded behind a circle, camouflaging the L-shape. Surprisingly, artists were as affected by context as non-artists in all three tests. Moreover, artists took, on average, significantly more time to make their judgments, implying that they were doing their best to demonstrate the special skills that we, and they, believed they had acquired. Our data therefore support the proposal from Gombrich that artists do not have special perceptual expertise to undo the effects of <b>constancies.</b> Instead, once the context is present in their drawing, they need only compare the drawing to the scene to match the effect of <b>constancies</b> in both...|$|R

This framework {{has been applied}} successfully to understanding the role of prior knowledge in visual perception, as well as perceptual illusions and <b>constancies</b> (Kali & Orion, 1996). This work proposes that experience on a personal or evolutionary time scale supports unconscious statistical inferences (Helmholtz, 1867) about the probability of the environment’s being a particular way, given specific sensory input. For example, in apparent motion, there is a specific prior to infer a straight path between objects that successively appear in different locations, unless the objects are biological, where curved paths {{may be more likely}} (Heptulla-Chatterjee, Freyd, & Shiffrar, 1996). In such a case, priors may reveal something about the statistical likelihood of objects or events in the environment.|$|R
