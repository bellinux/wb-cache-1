40|$|International audienceMining {{sites are}} usually sources of metal {{pollution}} {{many years after}} closure. Specific geo-chemical phenomena such as acid drainage contribute to an increase of environmental impacts, especially if remediation measures were not taken {{at the time of}} mine closure (Bird et al., 2005). When a site is left exposed to the elements, pollution may arise from unmanaged waste piles, mine runoff water and tailings. The implementation of a reliable monitoring system is required to assess risks for the exposed resources (groundwater, cultivated areas, urban settlements or littoral), until the site is remediated. Monitoring data are essential to design remediation works. The monitoring network is designed using water, sediment or soil quality data along time at the critical points of the pollution transfer model. Traditionally, such points are selected from a large number of sampling points and laboratory analyses (baseline data). This is both expensive and lengthy. IGME followed an alternative route at Kirki, where mining and ore beneficiation for copper, zinc and lead ceased in 1995, and no remedia-tion was undertaken. A baseline monitoring program was implemented in 2005 {{with the support of the}} Euro-pean Union, incorporating field analysis campaigns to improve its efficiency (heavy metals in water by polarography, in solids by portable XRF and multiparametric probes). This allowed to identify quickly pollutant variation ranges, emission or attenuation points, and to design conceptual transfer models. Field techniques were particularly efficient to design an optimised monitoring network, by allowing an immediate feedback between results, investigations and sampling. They do not substitute to laboratory techniques, but optimise their use for a better representativity of phenomena. Examples of critical points include:-neutralisation fronts for acid mine drainage, and metal precipitation sites,-separation between rainfall recharge and contaminated aquifer in shallow wells,-migration distance of each contaminant in sediments within the catchment. The monitoring plan provides key data for remediation options, and for the design of a <b>community</b> <b>alert</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, the disorganized land occupation of Rio de Janeiro with houses being built on landplaning high risk areas (known as “favelas”, or slums, in English) allied to the geological and geographical special characteristics of the city, transformed Rio in a very susceptible place to disasters related to landslides during heavy rains. With the goal of protecting the people living in those slums, especially the ones living in the risky areas, the Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro has created the Community Protection Program focusing on three subjects: (i) Training of Local Agents, (ii) <b>Community</b> Alarm and <b>Alert</b> <b>System,</b> and (iii) Simulation exercises at public schools. Local Agents live and work in the community and their training is of a huge importance mainly because these residents know about the vulnerabilities and they are great multipliers, advising other people about the danger. Currently there are almost 6, 000 trained Local Agents acting in the <b>community.</b> The <b>Alert</b> and Alarm <b>System</b> for rainfall consists of sending SMS messages (Alert) and activation of sirens (Alarm). The alert is rung when the meteorologists identify the possibility of rain and the Local Agents and Community Leaders, registered to receive these messages on their cell phones, are ready to support the community. Afterwards, the Alarm (sirens) is triggered when the rain gauge indicates that rainfall has reached critical levels, what can provoke accidents - sirens were installed in 103 communities, receiving also Simulation Exercises. The Simulation Exercises at public schools consists of training for the evacuation of the community in case of heavy rains. The school represents the community, while the Civil Defense tents assembled in the courtyard represent the support points, which are safe places around the community where residents can take shelter temporarily during an emergency. The students from the 5 th grade act as monitors, helping the younger students and playing the role of Public Officials and volunteers. This whole mise-en-scène has been helping a lot of communities to overcome the challenges raised by the rains in Rio de Janeiro...|$|R

40|$|Postsecondary {{institutions}} have increasingly attempted to discover innovative methods to promote student engagement and persistence, thus combating student attrition. In recent years, {{the higher education}} landscape has been flooded with intervention strategies sourced in early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> that utilize technological components to encourage student connections to institutional support entities. Whether homegrown or commercially developed, early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> provide cost-effective means of bolstering student persistence while depleting limited financial resources. While early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> {{have the potential to}} be a useful and cost-effective tactic to provide students with platforms for connections to faculty, academic advisors, and support resources, their development and implementation provides challenges. This study was based on Tinto’s student development and Astin’s student engagement theories. The purpose of this study was to uncover and analyze student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage as a retention tool, an area of research lacking depth. The entire undergraduate student enrollment (N = 21, 437) during the fall 2014 academic semester at East Carolina University was invited to complete an on-line survey requesting student opinions of campus utilization of the Starfish™ early <b>alert</b> <b>system.</b> A total of 4, 658 student responses were collected. A series of statistical tests were used to assess differences in student perceptions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> usage. General student opinions of early <b>alert</b> <b>system</b> structure and differences within student population groups and demographics were also discovered through data examination. Additionally, results of the analysis showed statistical significance indicating that early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> serve as conduits between students and the institution, impacting their educational satisfaction, motivation to seek resources, communication with campus officials, and overall sense of belonging. Results from this study offer implications and recommendations for administrators, faculty, and other key institutional decision-makers focused on utilizing early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> as a retention tool. Study findings contribute to the body of knowledge on student development, engagement, and persistence, yet additional research is necessary to further investigate the impact of early <b>alert</b> <b>systems</b> in higher education...|$|R
40|$|Cockpit <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> monitor {{potentially}} hazardous situations, {{both inside}} and outside the aircraft. When a hazard is projected to occur, the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> displays <b>alerts</b> and/or command decisions to the pilot. However, pilots have been observed to not conform to <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> commands by delaying their response or by not following the automatic commands exactly. This non-conformance to the automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> can reduce its benefit. Therefore, a need exists to understand the causes and effects of pilot non-conformance in order to develop automatic <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> whose commands the pilots are more likely to follow. These considerations were examined through flight simulator evaluations of the collision avoidance task during closely spaced parallel approaches. This task provided a useful case-study because the effects of non-conformance can be significant, given the time-critical nature of the task. A preliminary evaluation of <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> identified non-conformance in over 40 % of the cases and a corresponding drop in collision avoidance performance. A follow-on experiment found subjects' alerting and maneuver selection criteria were consistent with different strategies than those used by automatic systems, indicating the pilot may potentially disagree with the <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> if the pilot attempts to verify automatic alerts and commanded avoidance maneuvers. A final experiment found supporting automatic alerts with the explicit display of its underlying criteria resulted in more consistent subject reactions. In light of these experimental results, a general discussion of pilot non-conformance is provided. Contributing factors in pilot non-conformance include a lack of confidence in the automatic system and mismatches between the <b>alerting</b> <b>system's</b> commands and the pilots' own decisions based on the information available to them. The effects of non-conformance on system performance are discussed. Possible methods of reconciling mismatches are given, and design considerations for <b>alerting</b> <b>systems</b> which alleviate the problem of non-conformance are provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{role of an}} <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> is to {{make the}} system {{operator}} (e. g., pilot) aware of an impending hazard or unsafe state so the hazard can be avoided or managed successfully. A review of 46 commercial aviation accidents (between 1998 and 2014) revealed that, {{in the vast majority of}} events, either the hazard was not alerted or relevant hazard alerting occurred but failed to aid the flight crew sufficiently. For this set of events, <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> failures were placed in one of five phases: Detection, Understanding, Action Selection, Prioritization, and Execution. This study also reviewed the evolution of <b>alerting</b> <b>system</b> schemes in commercial aviation, which revealed naive assumptions about pilot reliability in monitoring flight path parameters; specifically, pilot monitoring was assumed to be more effective than it actually is.
