The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The <b>components</b> <b>were</b> intended to replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, {{none of these}} projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E
5|$|Its design {{began in}} September 2005 with {{sketches}} by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 <b>components</b> <b>were</b> designed {{especially for the}} car. Most components, including the engine, drivetrain, are modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo from which it was derived. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September.|$|E
5|$|Its major <b>components</b> <b>were</b> a {{spaceplane}} orbiter with {{an external}} fuel tank and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E

5|$|Kenney assumed {{command of}} the Allied Air Forces on 4 August. Three days later, he instituted a {{sweeping}} reorganization of the Allied Air Forces. The Australian <b>components</b> <b>were</b> assigned to RAAF Command under Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, while the American <b>components</b> <b>were</b> consolidated into the reformed Fifth Air Force under Kenney's personal command. On paper, the organization followed the orthodox pattern, consisting of V Fighter Command under Brigadier General Paul Wurtsmith, V Bomber Command under Walker, and an Air Services Command under Major General Rush B. Lincoln. But Kenney realized {{that he would have}} to maintain his headquarters near MacArthur's GHQ, which moved to Brisbane on 20 July, while the fighting was thousands of miles away in New Guinea, with the Fifth Air Force's principal forward bases around Port Moresby. Moreover, Walker's headquarters was in Townsville, as heavy and medium bombers were based there and only staged through Port Moresby. Accordingly, Kenney appointed Whitehead as deputy Fifth Air Force commander, and commander of the Advanced Echelon (ADVON) in Port Moresby.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the former}} instruments, three (COSTAR, FOS and WFPC2) are {{displayed}} in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. The FOC is in the Dornier museum, Germany. The HSP is in the Space Place at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The first WFPC was dismantled, and some <b>components</b> <b>were</b> then re-used in WFC3. The current location of GHRS is unclear.|$|E

The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf <b>components</b> <b>were</b> used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E

5|$|The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 Little Boy {{assemblies}} in 1947 {{for use by}} the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune {{aircraft carrier}} aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). <b>Components</b> <b>were</b> produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six. All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|The Special Troops Battalion {{was formed}} {{as part of}} a {{reorganization}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade into a modular brigade. The battalion was designed to be the self-contained command component of the brigade, allowing it to function independently of any higher command. The battalion was activated on 8 June 2006. Most of its <b>components</b> <b>were</b> drawn from the 82nd Engineer Battalion, which inactivated on 30 March 2006. On 21 April 2006, a coat of arms and a distinctive unit insignia were approved for the battalion.|$|E

Production aircraft cost about £9,500. The most expensive <b>components</b> <b>were</b> the hand-fabricated and finished fuselage at approximately £2,500, then the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine at £2,000, followed by the wings at £1,800 a pair, guns and undercarriage, both at £800 each, and the propeller at £350.|$|E
50|$|To {{make the}} {{illumination}} {{of an image}} more even, the high-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> increased and low-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> decreased, because the high-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> assumed to represent mostly the reflectance in the scene (the amount of light reflected off the object in the scene), whereas the low-frequency <b>components</b> <b>are</b> assumed to represent mostly the illumination in the scene. That is, high-pass filtering is used to suppress low frequencies and amplify high frequencies, in the log-intensity domain.|$|R

5|$|The {{formation}} was inactivated on 15 June 1997 in Germany. Over {{the next}} four months, the unit's inactive <b>components</b> <b>were</b> reorganized and redesignated as a brigade sized unit, allowing it {{to take on a}} larger support staff that could command more soldiers. This transformation occurred as the brigade was reassigned to the continental United States. It was activated on 24 October 1997 as the 166th Aviation Brigade at Fort Riley, Kansas. It was also activated into the Active duty force.|$|E

William Sheetz was paid $18.80 USD for building the memorial's raised mound and supporting foundation. Twelve days later on September26, the Confederate Memorial was formally dedicated in a public ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct <b>components</b> <b>were</b> separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses to {{the crash}} were in {{universal}} agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft <b>components</b> <b>were</b> found with the separated engine, other than its supporting pylon, leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free of the airframe and struck the engine. Hence the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure.|$|E
