2500|$|While {{the term}} [...] "weed" [...] {{generally}} {{has a negative}} connotation, many plants known as weeds can have beneficial properties. A number of weeds, such as the dandelion (Taraxacum) and lamb's quarter, are edible, and their leaves or roots {{may be used for}} food or herbal medicine. Burdock is common over much of the world, and is sometimes used to make soup and medicine in East Asia. Some weeds attract beneficial insects, which in turn can protect crops from harmful pests. Weeds can also prevent pest insects from finding a crop, because their presence disrupts the incidence of positive cues which pests use to locate their food. Weeds may also act as a [...] "living mulch", providing ground cover that reduces moisture loss and prevents erosion. Weeds may also improve soil fertility; dandelions, for example, bring up nutrients like calcium and nitrogen from deep in the soil with their tap root, and clover hosts nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its roots, fertilizing the soil directly. The dandelion is also one of several species which break up hardpan in overly cultivated fields, helping crops grow deeper root systems. Some garden flowers originated as weeds in cultivated fields and have been selectively bred for their garden-worthy flowers or foliage. An example of a crop weed that is grown in gardens is the <b>corncockle,</b> (Agrostemma githago), which was a common weed in European wheat fields, but is now sometimes grown as a garden plant.|$|E
60|$|Who {{ever saw}} a wood anemone or a heath blossom {{in the wrong}} place? Who ever saw nettle or hemlock in a right one? And yet, the {{difference}} between flower and weed, (I use, for convenience sake, these words in their {108} familiar opposition,) certainly does not consist merely in the flowers being innocent, and the weed stinging and venomous. We do not call the nightshade a weed in our hedges, nor the scarlet agaric in our woods. But we do the <b>corncockle</b> in our fields.|$|E

60|$|Gorgeous Peonies, and Columbines 'that {{drew the}} car of Venus,' and the Rose with her lover, and the stately white-vestured Lilies, and wide staring Ox-eyes, and scarlet Poppies pass before us. There are Primroses and <b>Corncockles,</b> Chrysanthemums in robes of rich brocade, Sunflowers and tall Hollyhocks, and pale Christmas Roses. The designs for the Daffodils, the wild Roses, the Convolvulus, and the Hollyhock are admirable, and would be {{beautiful}} in embroidery or in any precious material. Indeed, any one who wishes to find beautiful designs cannot do better than get the book. It is, in its way, a little masterpiece, and its grace and fancy, and beauty of line and colour, cannot be over-estimated. The Greeks gave human form to wood and stream, and saw Nature best in Naiad or in Dryad. Mr. Crane, with something of Gothic fantasy, has caught the Greek feeling, the love of personification, the passion for representing things under {{the conditions of the}} human form. The flowers are to him so many knights and ladies, page-boys or shepherd- boys, divine nymphs or simple girls, and in their fair bodies or fanciful raiment one can see the flower's very form and absolute essence, so that one loves their artistic truth no less than their artistic beauty. This book contains some of the best work Mr. Crane has ever done. His art is never so successful as when it is entirely remote from life. The slightest touch of actuality seems to kill it. It lives, or should live, in a world of its own fashioning. It is decorative in its complete subordination of fact to beauty of effect, in the grandeur of its curves and lines, in its entirely imaginative treatment. Almost every page of this book gives a suggestion for some rich tapestry, some fine screen, some painted cassone, some carving in wood or ivory.|$|R
5000|$|Agrostemma is a genus {{of annual}} {{plants in the}} Caryophyllaceae family, {{containing}} the species known as corncockles. Its best-known member is A. githago, the common <b>corncockle,</b> which {{is a native of}} Europe where it is simply called [...] "the corncockle". The species is a weed of cereals and other crops, probably with a centre of origin in the eastern Mediterranean. Nowadays declining in its native range because of improved seed cleaning, it is found as a weed worldwide. Agrostemma gracile, the slender <b>corncockle,</b> is only found in central Greece near the city of Farsala. <b>Corncockle</b> is an attractive plant, and its seeds are still commercially available to gardeners.|$|E

50|$|Templand {{lies between}} the <b>Corncockle</b> woodland, a marsh, and the Kinnel Water. Geographically it is {{believed}} that the entire Templand area is on a massive slab of sandstone, due to the Annan river carrying sand down from the Moffat area.|$|E
50|$|Templand is {{a village}} in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, a few {{kilometers}} northwest of Lockerbie. Templand was built during the industrial revolution. When the nearby sandstone quarry (<b>Corncockle</b> Quarry) was built it became home to many quarry workers. Stone from the quarry {{was used in the}} construction of the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow and was quarried for the refurbishment of the gallery completed in 2006. At its height of activity up to the 1930s it had its own mineral line from what is now the West Coast Mainline and up to 6 trains per week of stone were moved to Glasgow, throughout Scotland and it is believed the Rockefeller Building in New York was faced with <b>Corncockle</b> stone.|$|E
50|$|A mineral line {{ran down}} to the station from <b>Corncockle</b> Quarry, a large and {{historically}} important sandstone quarry near Templand. Stone from this quarry was used in Victorian times to build tenements in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dinosaur footprints were found there in the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Of European wheat fields. In the 19th century, it was {{reported}} as a very common weed of wheat fields and its seeds were inadvertently included in harvested wheat seed and then resown the following season. It is very likely that until the 20th century, most wheat contained some <b>corncockle</b> seed.|$|E
50|$|Forests cover 299.8 km2 (67.26%) of the area. The most {{widespread}} genera {{of trees}} are beech, linden and ash. Other plants include orchids, for example Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. sooiana and Ophrys holubyana. Private fields are often home to endangered species, such as <b>corncockle</b> (Agrostemma githago), corn buttercup (Ranunculus arvensis) and Nigella arvensis.|$|E

50|$|A {{large number}} of plants in the park are on “the red list of {{superior}} plants in Romania”, meaning they are vulnerable or rare species. Some of these include: yarrow (Achillea thracica), Water soldier (Stratiotes aloides), common <b>corncockle</b> (Agrostemma githago), Cirsium brachycephalum, prostrate false pimpernel (Lindernia procumbens), brittle waternymph (Najas minor), hog’s fennel (Peucedanum officinale), lesser Butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia), Scottish dock (Rumex aquaticus), French vetch (Vicia narbonensis L. ssp. serratifolia).|$|E
50|$|There is a {{diversity}} of plants, especially in the meadow area. Some recently seen plants include Birdsfoot trefoil, Bloody cranesbill, <b>Corncockle,</b> Cowslip, Dog rose, Evening primrose, Field speedwell, Lesser periwinkle, Michaelmas daisy, Oxeye daisy, Vipers bugloss, Sweet violet, Lucerne, Wild gladiolus, Green alkanet, Herb robert, Lesser celandine, Marsh marigold, Purple loosestrife, Yellow flag, Wild strawberry, Yarrow and many others. Some of these have been introduced, others found their own way here.|$|E
50|$|He made {{a memorable}} {{contribution}} likewise to geological science. In 1828 Duncan presented a {{paper to the}} Royal Society of Edinburgh describing his discovery of the fossil footmarks of quadrupeds on the Permian red sandstone of <b>Corncockle</b> Muir, near Lochmaben. The paper, published in 1831, was the first scientific report of a fossil track. A cast of the tracks of Chelichnus duncani {{can be found in}} the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.|$|E
50|$|Other {{parts of}} the lowland (on the south and north east slopes) are used as pasture. As a result of grazing by cattle, horses and sheep this area, {{as well as the}} former arable fields, have {{developed}} into a calcareous grassland. Its typical plants are the cowslip, houndstooth, cheat grass, wild strawberry, the rare field gromwell, the poisonous common <b>corncockle,</b> smooth rupturewort, field parsley, biting stonecrop, various mulleins, viper's bugloss, long-headed poppy, Centaurium, ragwort and carline thistle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Corncockle</b> Quarry was a {{large and}} {{historically}} important sandstone quarry near Templand in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Stone from here {{was used in the}} late Victorian era to build tenements in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and also to construct New York 'brownstones'. The sandstone dates from the Permian Age and dinosaur footprints were found there in the 19th century. The stone is currently extracted by Dunhouse. At its peak the quarry was connected to the Caledonian Main Line by a mineral railway. It {{was the subject of a}} lithograph by William Jardine.|$|E
50|$|In {{parts of}} Europe, {{intensive}} mechanised farming {{has put the}} plant at risk {{and it is now}} uncommon or locally distributed. This is partly due to increased use of herbicides, but probably much more to do with changing patterns of agriculture with most wheat now sown in the autumn as winter wheat and then harvested before any <b>corncockle</b> would have flowered or set seed. The plant was believed to be completely extinct in the United Kingdom until 2014, when a single specimen was found growing in Sunderland by an assistant ranger of the National Trust.|$|E
50|$|The strata {{consist of}} breccias, falsebedded {{sandstones}} and mans, the sandstones being extensively quarried for building purposes. In the sandstones of <b>Corncockle</b> Moor reptilian footprints have been obtained. In the Thornhill basin {{there is a}} thin zone of volcanic rocks {{at the base of}} this series which are evidently on-the horizon of the lavas beneath the Mauchline sandstones in Ayrshire. In the Sanquhar basin there are small outliers of lavas probably of this age and several vents filled with agglomerate from which these igneous materials in the Thornhill basin may have been derived. There are several striking examples of basalt dikes of Tertiary age, one having been traced from the Lead Hills south-east by Moffat, across Eskdalemuir to the English border.|$|E
50|$|In 1911 Hamilton Academy's 'prep' (junior) school {{relocated}} to its new, separate smaller building behind the main edifice, before completion, in 1913, {{of the new}} senior school building in the French Renaissance style and of red freestone from <b>Corncockle</b> Quarry in Dumfriesshire. The main building, with separate entrances for girls and boys, was arranged over three storeys, with additional basements, providing accommodation for Rector's office, board room, offices, class-rooms, six laboratories, workshops, art rooms and gymnasia. Of particular note were the Central Hall, the large lecture hall (seating 200, gallery-style and communicating with the laboratories) and library, with reading rooms for girls and boys respectively. In addition, a domestic science block was erected in the same style {{to the south of}} the main building and near the girls' school entrance.|$|E
50|$|The {{quality of}} food for common people was not always {{particularly}} high. The research at Coppergate shows that the Vikings in York made bread from whole meal flour — probably both wheat and rye - but with the seeds of cornfield weeds included. <b>Corncockle</b> (Agrostemma), {{would have made the}} bread dark-coloured, but the seeds are poisonous, and people who ate the bread might have become ill. Seeds of carrots, parsnip, and brassicas were also discovered, but they were poor specimens and tend to come from white carrots and bitter tasting cabbages. The rotary querns often used in the Viking Age inevitably left tiny stone fragments (often from basalt rock) in the flour and when eaten later on, these small stones wore down the teeth. The effects of this can be seen on skeletal remains of that period.|$|E
5000|$|Many taxa {{have been}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} longevity of their seeds in the soil seed bank. Seeds of transient species remain viable in the soil seed bank only to the next opportunity to germinate, while seeds of persistent species can survive longer than the next opportunity—often much longer than one year. Species with seeds that remain viable in the soil longer than five years form the long-term persistent seed bank, while species whose seeds generally germinate or die within one to five years are called short-term persistent. A typical long-term persistent species is Chenopodium album (Lambsquarters); its seeds commonly remain viable in the soil for up to 40 years and in rare situations perhaps as long as 1,600 years. [...] A species forming no soil seed bank at all (except the dry season between ripening and the first autumnal rains) is Agrostemma githago (<b>Corncockle),</b> which is a formerly widespread cereal weed.|$|E

40|$|Are flower-strips {{composed}} of arable field plants {{a tool to}} integrate rare species into organic fields? In the surrounding of the Hessian State Domain Frankenhausen seeds of rare annual field plants were collected and reproduced. The autochthonous seeds and also the corn-cockle have been integrated into a mixture that has been tested to which extent the flower-strips are able to suppress soil-borne weed species. The vegetation of the arable field plant strips has been monitored by phytosociological relevees. A certain amount of seeds is needed to reach satisfactory results. The <b>corncockle</b> affords special management because of its biology and its possible toxicity...|$|E
40|$|The Early Iron Age granaries of Tell Gradina upon Bosut {{exploded}} {{in a fire}} inferno in the 8 th century B. C. The result of this catastrophe is 2 - 5 cm thick layer with mixed carbonized seeds and fruits. Recently, eight samples were taken from Gradina's profile for archaeobotanical analysis. The goal was to obtain basic information on land use and on major crops and weeds of that period. The most abundant were cereals, followed by millets, pulses and oil/fibre plants. The dominant cereals were einkorn (Triticum monococcum) and hulled barley (Hordeum vulgare vulgare). Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) was also very important. Pulses were represented with six and oil/fibre plants with three species. Among weeds and ruderals, most common are rye brome (Bromus secalinus), fat hen (Chenopodium album), darnel ryegrass (Lolium temulentum), hairy crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis) and <b>corncockle</b> (Agrostemma githago) ...|$|E
