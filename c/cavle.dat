40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reeursive procedure for computing the degrees of the irreducible complex characters of a finite p-group by working up a central {{series in the}} group. A program written in the computer group theory language <b>CAVLE</b> 7 is presented which implements this algorithm assuming that the p-group is given {{in terms of a}} power-commutator presentation. Some times for sample runs are presented which indicate that the CAYLEY implementation is effective for groups of order up to p 15 for small primes. In particular, this approach seems to produce the character degrees much faster than using CAYLEY,"S built-in character table function and reading off the degrees...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} Henrik <b>Cavling</b> as a journalistic ideal in various litera-ture regarding his carrier and life. Our interest concerns how this ideal has been constructed and developed since his era and the explanation for this course. Our foundation covers nine works of literature: memoirs, biographies and works on history of the press, which timewise expands over more than eighty years. We analyse how the different authors has created nar-ratives to portray <b>Cavling,</b> how the authors build on each others works and why it is exactly these narratives they choose to accentuate. We come to the acknowledgement, that the Cav-ling-ideal is not constructed solely in the literature – <b>Cavling</b> was already an ideal on his time. The ideal does, however, {{seem to have been}} reproduced and maintained in the literature. To some extend the authors seem to build on each other, but we have come to the insight, that the intertextuality is more of an implicit nature, than an explicit one, and that the works of literature must to some degree be based on the authors historical consciousness from the previous works on the topic. We further discuss and find, that the development of the narra-tives is two-pieced: there is a development in the focus of the authors, {{and at the same time}} a non-development in the overall meaning of the ideal. Especially during the emergence of the journalistic award, Cavlingprisen, the content of the Cavling-ideal seems to shift. Regardless of content of the ideal, the meaning seems to be constant though, and that is: to produce good and unique journalism...|$|R

Ulvedalsteateret (Ulvedal theatre) gave performances for 39 years in Ulvedalene. The first time was in the summer of 1910 with Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger's Hagbart and Signe. The idea originated from the actor Adam Poulsen and producer Henrik <b>Cavling.</b> The architect Jens Ferdinand Willumsen created spaces for about 4,000 sitting and 2,000 standing spectators, which made it possible to lower the ticket price to an accessible level. The theatre survived up to 1949, and after a break of almost 50 years, the tradition was revived by Birgitte Price with an arrangement of Johan Ludvig Heiberg's Elverhøj in 1996 in a production supported by the Royal Danish Theatre, Lyngby-Taarbæk Kommune and Kulturby'96.
