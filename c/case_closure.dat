The most common reason for <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> was the APS worker’s assessment that the victim was no longer at risk for abuse (34. 5 %), followed by long-term care placement (21. 4 %), administrative closure (14. 2 %), victim refusal of services (12. 3 %), and victim death (12. 0 %).

40|$|Working {{is a form}} of {{societal}} participation highly valued in American culture. The state-federal vocational rehabilitation system helps people with disabilities obtain and maintain employment in their communities. Although some people with traumatic brain injury return to work with minor adjustments, high proportions do not return to former employment or find work after their injuries. Analyzing vocational rehabilitation services, and other variables that impact competitive employment outcomes for this population, is important. This study examined the association of types and degree of limitations to functional capacities, and competitive employment outcomes; and selected VR services, and competitive employment, after controlling for demographic variables. The sample for this study consisted of 340 consumers of Illinois state-federal VR system whose cases were closed in fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Eligible individuals with TBI who did not receive services were also described (N= 120). The present study also provided information on the types and reasons for <b>case</b> <b>closure,</b> length of rehabilitation, case expenditure, types and number of services received, and weekly earnings at <b>case</b> <b>closure.</b> Contrary to expectations, the degree of limitation across all areas of functional capacity, used by VR counselors to determine severity of disability, and priority for services, were not found to be significantly related to competitive employment among customers with TBI. Results also found that, when relevant demographic characteristics are controlled, the odds of achieving competitive employment increased significantly for VR clients with TBI in Illinois who received job placement and on-the-job supports. For clients who were of minority background, received SSI/SSDI at application, or had lower socioeconomic status (based on income, education and pre-service work status), these odds significantly decreased.

40|$|International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Correction Coil (CC) case, made of {{ultra-low}} carbon {{austenitic stainless}} steel 316 LN with 20 mm thickness, was designed in the outmost layer of the CC, and was used to protect the internal superconducting coil, resist the deformation effect caused by the powerful electromagnetic force and thermal stress during the operation process. These cases have characteristics of small cross-section, large dimension, and complex structure. They {{were divided into two}} parts for the convenience of the internal superconducting coil being inserted into the case, and they will be closure welded together after insertion. Thus, weld seam is located the whole perimeter of the case, which will decide the large quantity weld with the specific distribution caused by the geometric profile of the case. The distribution requires a specific welding system, aim at the CC <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> welding characteristic, should be developed to realize the field welding. The strict deformation requirement, temperature control of internal coil and full penetration with high welding quality brings the technology challenges to this closure welding. The welding system must be constructed and these key technologies must be solved using this welding tooling before the offcial production of CC. A fibre laser robotic welding system was developed for the <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> welding based on the research, scheme design and analysis in this thesis. The specific qualification experiments were carried out on this laser welding system according to technology challenges on the welding quality, temperature control and deformation. Firstly, according to the distribution of weld seam, the preliminary scheme designs of welding systems based on several different welding methods were carried out. It was found that the laser welding is identified as the most suitable welding method. Based on above, reasonable arrangement of robots and external rail, and simulation of robotic welding motion process were carried out in order to further optimize design and analysis. The simulation results show that there exist the dead zone where the robot arm can not doing the effective welding and the robotic welding workspace should be increased. A slip plate module for the welding robot was added to assist travel, after that, the robot was successful in covering all weld seams in all cases. Secondly, to complete this welding system, the welding fixture should be developed to support the welding platform, adjust the assembly tolerance and provide the rigid constrain to control the welding deformation, and electric control should be developed to integrate the welding system and increase its security and stability. A number of ground supports match with the C-type clamps were designed and special distributed aim at the geometric profile of case. The rotatable ground supports, which can provide two types of welding platform, were developed to meet the two different welding positions with arched and concave shape of SCC case. In order to provide the turn over function for SCC case, a welding tilter with tilter framework, single central axis, load-bearing jig was designed base on the good finite element analysis (FEA) result. In addition, the design requirements of the control system of the CC case laser welding were analyzed and the integrated control system was developed based on SIEMENS PLC system S 7 - 300. Thirdly, narrow gap multi-pass laser welding with hot wire was developed as the welding process for the <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> welding. The welded jointed with defects-free and good mechanical properties was achieved based on good optical system, reasonable groove structure and optimized welding procedure. In order to protect the internal superconducting coil, which is inside of the case, the backing strip was designed and welded by laser welding behind the case in the actual welding structure of the CC case. The temperature distribution of the welding process was simulated by FEA and measured by the thermocouples on a short sample. The FEA temperature distribution shows good agreement with the experimental measurement, the highest temperature of the inner face of case was 255 ℃, and the highest temperature record of surface of the internal coil was 59 ℃. The result shows the laser welding process will not harm the superconducting coil, and the welding process, based on the laser welding system, can meet the temperature control requirement. To study the welding deformation, a SCC model case was designed, fabricated and welded by the laser welding system. The principle of positioning welding before continuous welding, as well as segmented, skip, symmetry and repeated turn over, was developed to keep uniform heating of the model case. According to the detected results of welding deformation of the model case, the overall welding deformation was controlled below ± 2 mm. Satisfactory results of the welding deformation of the model case certify the reasonability of the welding structure, system and process of the CC <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> welding, and also provide technical support for the full scale CC case. In conclusion, this thesis study to develop a special robotic laser welding system to solve the CC <b>case</b> <b>closure</b> welding, and some key technologies were studied aim at the related engineering challenges...|$|E
