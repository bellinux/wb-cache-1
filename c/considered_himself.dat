5|$|Chamberlain {{denounced the}} Black Panthers and other black {{nationalist}} {{movements in the}} late 1960s, and supported Republican Richard Nixon in the 1968 and 1972 presidential elections. Chamberlain accompanied Nixon to the funeral of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> a Republican.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{is mainly}} {{associated}} with the Royal Ballet, MacMillan frequently <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> an outsider there and felt driven {{to work with other}} companies throughout his career as choreographer. His creations for the Stuttgart Ballet and the Deutsche Opera ballet include some of his most frequently revived works.|$|E
5|$|King's {{stance on}} Vietnam {{encouraged}} Allard K. Lowenstein, William Sloane Coffin and Norman Thomas, {{with the support}} of anti-war Democrats, to attempt to persuade King to run against President Johnson in the 1968 United States presidential election. King contemplated but ultimately decided against the proposal on the grounds that he felt uneasy with politics and <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> better suited for his morally unambiguous role as an activist.|$|E

5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician. During his tenures on Senate committees, his approach to their hearings was very similar to courtroom examinations of trial witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May 1217. Although they {{seized a}} strategically-important tower {{on a nearby}} island on 24 August, Al-Kamil (who had succeeded Al-Adil I in Egypt) {{controlled}} traffic on the Nile. In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III's legate Cardinal Pelagius (who <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> the crusade's supreme commander) arrived from Italy.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{elementary}} school in 1893, Kafka {{was admitted to the}} rigorous classics-oriented state gymnasium, , an academic secondary school at Old Town Square, within the Kinský Palace. German was the language of instruction, but Kafka also spoke and wrote in Czech. He studied the latter at the gymnasium for eight years, achieving good grades. Although Kafka received compliments for his Czech, he never <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> fluent in Czech, though he spoke German with a Czech accent. He completed his Matura exams in 1901.|$|E

5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, except for one leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and the excitement of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back to work in an office and <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|As Mary II and William III & II had {{ascended the}} English and Scottish thrones, Mary of Modena {{ceased to be}} Queen of England on 11 December 1688 OS and of Scotland on 11 May 1689 OS. This was {{concurrent}} with her husband's formal deposition. James II, however, backed by Louis XIV of France, still <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> king by divine right and maintained it was not within parliament's prerogative to depose a monarch.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 41, McCrae {{enrolled}} {{with the}} Canadian Expeditionary Force following {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. He had the option of joining the medical corps because of his training and age but he volunteered instead to join a fighting unit as a gunner and medical officer. It was his second tour of duty in the Canadian military. He had previously fought with a volunteer force in the Second Boer War. He <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> a soldier first; his father was a military leader in Guelph and McCrae grew up believing in the duty of fighting for his country and empire.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{arrived in}} Paris in late September 1831; {{he would never}} return to Poland, thus {{becoming}} one of many expatriates of the Polish Great Emigration. In France he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport. However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer Adam Zamoyski writes that he never <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.|$|E
5|$|Coveleski had 216 {{wins and}} 142 losses with a 2.89 ERA in 450 games, 385 of them starts in a 14-year career. He had 224 {{complete}} games, 38 shutouts, 981 strikeouts, and pitched 3,082 total innings. His control was highly regarded. He never <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> a strikeout pitcher, {{and it was}} not unusual for him to pitch a complete game having thrown 95 pitches or less. He once pitched seven innings of a game where every pitch was either a hit or a strike. In 2001, baseball statistician Bill James ranked Coveleski 58th among the all-time greatest major league pitchers.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{was born}} Archibald Alec Leach on January 18, 1904 at 15 Hughenden Road in the {{northern}} Bristol suburb of Horfield. He was the second child of Elias James Leach (1873–1935) and Elsie Maria Leach (née Kingdon; 1877–1973). Elias worked as a tailor's presser at a clothes factory while Elsie worked as a seamstress. Grant's elder brother, John William Elias Leach (1899–1900), died of tuberculous meningitis. Grant <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> to have been partly Jewish. He had an unhappy upbringing; his father was an alcoholic, and his mother suffered from clinical depression.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that it was near Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E
5|$|Ravel drew on {{many generations}} of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré {{and the more}} recent {{innovations}} of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> {{in many ways a}} classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.|$|E

5|$|Though Tunis never <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> a children's writer, {{all but one}} of his twenty-four {{books were}} {{published}} for juveniles; their success helped create the juvenile fiction book market in the 1940s. Books like Iron Duke (1938), All American (1942) and Keystone Kids (1943) were well received by readers and critics. Iron Duke received the New York Herald Tribune Spring Book Festival Award for best juvenile novel and was named a The Horn Book Magazine Best Book. The Child Study Association of America gave its Golden Scroll Award to Keystone Kids.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Creangă {{eventually}} {{moved out}} of the monastery, but refused to relinquish his key to the church basement, and, in what was probably a modernizing intent, chopped off his long hair, one of the traditional marks of an Orthodox priest. The latter gesture scandalized his superiors, particularly since Creangă explained himself using an ancient provision of canon law, which stipulated that priests were not supposed to grow their hair long. After some assessment, his superiors agreed not to regard this action as more than a minor disobedience. He was temporarily suspended in practice but, citing an ambiguity in the decision (which could be read as a banishment in perpetuity), Creangă <b>considered</b> <b>himself</b> defrocked. He relinquished his clerical clothing altogether and began wearing lay clothes everywhere, a matter which caused public outrage.|$|E
