5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the Windlass mechanism) {{are thought to}} <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> stroke symptoms. Firstly, {{the flow}} through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence {{increase the risk of}} thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures.

In the same vein, we believe that continuation {{of the use of}} Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> {{a wide range of}} {{diseases}} including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Director {{and story}} writer Hironobu Sakaguchi, {{designer}} Hiromichi Tanaka, character designer Yoshitaka Amano, scenario writer Kenji Terada, and music composer Nobuo Uematsu {{returned from the}} two previous Final Fantasy games to <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> Final Fantasy III. As with the previous two installments of the series, Final Fantasy III was programmed for the Famicom by Nasir Gebelli. It was the last original Final Fantasy title on which Gebelli worked. Midway {{through the development of}} the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The completed game was one of the largest ever released for the Famicom, published on a 512KiB cartridge, the second-highest capacity available for the console. Like many console role-playing games of the era, Final Fantasy III is noted for its difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) would <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned Xenogears series.|$|E

5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form in {{a worldwide}} band of thunderstorm activity near the equator, {{referred to as}} the Intertropical Front (ITF), the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or the monsoon trough. Another important source of atmospheric instability is found in tropical waves, which <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> about 85% of intense tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and become most of the tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific. The majority forms between 10 and 30 degrees of latitude away of the equator, and 87% forms no farther away than 20 degrees north or south. Because the Coriolis effect initiates and maintains their rotation, tropical cyclones rarely form or move within 5degrees of the equator, where the effect is weakest. However, it is still possible for tropical systems to form within this boundary as Tropical Storm Vamei and Cyclone Agni did in 2001 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>development</b> <b>of</b> new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would {{tend to have more}} fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea {{came to be known as}} the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
