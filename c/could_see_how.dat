5|$|Diệm's {{government}} put Ba Cụt on trial. During the proceedings, Ba Cụt theatrically {{removed his}} shirt {{so that the}} public gallery <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists. This, according to him, demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism. He challenged any other man to show as many scars. The Diệmist judge was unimpressed. Ba Cụt {{was found guilty of}} multiple murders and sentenced to death. Diệm's adviser, Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA, was one of many who protested against the decision. Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm—who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam) and declared himself President—and antagonise Ba Cụt's followers. Ngô Đình Nhu, Diệm's younger brother and chief adviser, denied a reprieve as the army, particularly Minh, opposed any clemency. Some sections of the southern public, however, were sympathetic to Ba Cụt.|$|E
25|$|The war {{brought a}} decline in Ottoman morale {{and a feeling of}} helplessness, {{illustrating}} that modern technology and superior weaponry were {{the most important part of}} a modern army, and a part that the Ottoman Empire was sorely lacking. While fighting alongside the British, French, and even the Piedmontese, the Ottomans <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> far they had fallen behind. Things began to change after the Crimean War.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} the feel of the games, Gans had the sound designer of the original Silent Hill, Akira Yamaoka, flown to the set several times. Additionally, Gans had a 40-inch television brought onto the set, to which he attached a PlayStation 2; Gans then played the original Silent Hill on the system so that the actors and cinematographers <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> Gans wanted to emulate various camera angles and movements.|$|E

25|$|After launch at 23:59 EDT, Discovery {{opened her}} payload bay doors. Once {{the doors were}} opened the crew {{deployed}} the Ku-band antenna and activated the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS). Once the Ku-band antenna was deployed and activated the crew then down-linked photos from the External Tank Umbilical Well Camera system, so controllers on the ground <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the tank performed and how much if any foam was shed during ascent.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2008, Komsomolskaya Pravda {{reported}} that in South Ossetia several soldiers were wounded and one was killed, who were from Tatarstan. Five days {{before he was killed}} in South Ossetia, Evgeny Parfenov warned his parents not to call him because {{it would be hard to}} reach him by phone. Lieutenant Aleksandr Popov was participating in the exercises on the height near Tskhinvali when his group was requested by the intelligence to reinforce them. According to Popov's mother, Popov told her he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the Georgians fired on Tskhinvali one week before the war. The mother of Eldar Lotfullin, 23-year-old contract soldier, said that she was able to call her son for the last time at around 10 PM MSK on 7 August 2008. Eldar Lotfullin told journalist that the Georgian tanks fired on his barracks on 8 August. On 13 August, Izvestia {{reported that}} the unit (where Popov served) was participating in the exercises in the mountains of South Ossetia.|$|E
500|$|Welles {{was just}} as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30a.m. Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest {{incarnation}} of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach. [...] "In the film and production photographs, {{you can see that}} Kane had a belly that overhung," [...] Seiderman said. [...] "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way." ...|$|E

In 2005, Westenra visited Ghana to publicise her project, [...] "Bikes for Ghana", and actively helped with fundraising to purchase bicycles for young girls, allowing them {{to get to their}} schools from outlying surrounding areas. When she was later interviewed about this charity work, she had this to say: [...] "I met girls who had been given bikes and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much it meant to them. We wanted to borrow one just for a photo and they wouldn't let them go; they were really reluctant". 2 May 2007, SYD Edition, LOCAL: 5.|$|E
500|$|The {{commander}} of U.S. Army Forces in Australia, Lieutenant General George H. Brett, received a radiogram from General Marshall in Washington, D.C., alerting him that MacArthur would be requesting bombers to transport his party from Mindanao to Australia. A subsequent message from MacArthur requested his [...] "most experienced pilots, {{and the best}} available planes in top condition", but the only long-range aircraft that Brett had were Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns. He therefore approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary, the {{commander of}} naval forces in the Anzac Area, {{to ask for a}} loan of some of twelve newly arrived Navy B-17s. Leary, who had a reputation for refusing requests unless he <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the Navy would benefit, turned Brett down.|$|E
500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. I begin to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E

2500|$|The {{entryway}} for the Richards {{building is}} in the middle laboratory tower. [...] Kahn left the entire ground floor of that tower open as an entry porch and exposed the structural elements in its ceiling so the public <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the building was constructed.

It's more getting your mind cleared, and I <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> they could say that that could be compatible. Scientology has not really developed into a complete religious tradition.

At the same time, the US drew a different conclusion: {{that there would be}} no war." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the initial}} {{period of the}} four rightly-guided caliphs (632-661) {{following}} the death of Muhammad (570-632), the ruling family of the Umayyads took firm control of the new Muslim state. The Umayyad Caliphate (661-750) ruled from the city of Damascus; their first Caliph Mu'awiya (602-680, r.661-680) directed Muslim forces in their on-going military contest with the Byzantine Empire. Decades earlier the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt had fallen to Islamic arms. Under Mu'awiya the Umayyad Caliphate <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the foreign lands west of Egypt figured in the [...] "geo-political" [...] and military strategy of this struggle. Hence there began the decades-long undertaking resulting in the Umayyad conquest of North Africa.|$|E
