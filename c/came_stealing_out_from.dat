60|$|I lay at {{the edge}} of that cornfield a long time; it was very peaceful. The church bells had begun to ring. The long shadows <b>came</b> <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the sheaves; woodpigeons rose one by one, and flapped off to roost; the western sky was {{streaked}} with red, and all the downs and combe bathed in the last sunlight. Perfect harvest weather; but oppressively still, the stillness of suspense....|$|E
60|$|De Grost {{crossed the}} road diagonally, as though {{about to take}} the short cut across London Bridge, {{but as soon as}} the {{policeman}} was out of sight he retraced his steps to the building which they had been discussing, and turning the battered brass handle of the door, walked calmly in. On his right and left were counting houses framed with glass; in front, the cavernous and ugly depths of a gloomy warehouse. He knocked upon the window-pane on the right and passed forward a step or two, as though to enter the office. The boy, who had been engaged in the left-hand counting house, came gliding from his place, passed silently behind the visitor and turned the key of the outer door. What followed seemed to happen as though by some mysteriously directed force. The figures of men <b>came</b> <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the hidden places. The clerk who had been working so hard at his desk calmly divested himself of a false mustache and wig, and, assuming a more familiar appearance, strolled out into the warehouse. De Grost looked around him with absolutely unruffled composure. He was the centre of a little circle of men, respectably dressed, but every one of them hard-featured, with something in their faces which suggested not the ordinary toiler, but the fighting animal--the man who lives by his wits and knows something of danger. On the outskirts of the circle stood Bernadine.|$|E

60|$|I {{opened my}} window, and hailed the good omen of sunrise {{in a clear}} sky. Just as I was turning away again from the view, I saw a figure <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the {{shrubbery}} and appear on the lawn. The figure came nearer. I recognized Oscar.|$|R
60|$|The {{wind had}} risen, blowing from the West, and {{sunshine}} was flying on it. The {{call of the}} cuckoos--a little sharpened--followed the swift-travelling car. And that essential sweetness of the moor, born of the heather roots and the South-West wind, was <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the young ferns.|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} looked funny to see {{a boy and a}} girl shaking hands there in front of the hotel, and a young darkey took {{advantage}} of our good-humor, and, <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> a shady corner of the court, sold us seven little red and black liquorice-seed for fourpence,--the worst swindle that had been worked on us yet.|$|R
25|$|This time, Brendan's {{attacker}} is successful, <b>stealing</b> him <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under Sarah, who is {{elsewhere in}} the house, reading up on the local practice of witchcraft.|$|R
60|$|The {{interpreter}} gave {{a sort of}} grunt, but he said nothing. The conversation went no farther, however, just then; for, by this time, the Indians <b>came</b> <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> of the house, {{every man}} of them armed, looking dusky, prepared and full of wariness. Manytongues did not keep them long, but soon told his story. After this, his authority appeared, in a great measure, to cease. Flintyheart was now {{the most prominent of}} the party, though Prairiefire, and another warrior, were also connected with the orders given to the rest. I observed that Eaglesflight had no part in these arrangements, which were peculiarly military, though he appeared armed and ready, and went forth on the sudden call, like the rest. In five minutes, the Indians were all off, principally in pairs, leaving the interpreter and myself still standing together, in front of the deserted house.|$|R
60|$|From all the {{landings}} {{that lined}} either shore brilliant boats glided to the rendezvous; some hung with luminous globes {{of blue and}} silver, some with lanterns fiery-red, flower-shaped, golden, green, or variegated, as if a rainbow were festooned about the viewless masts. Up and down they flashed, <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> dusky nooks and floating in their own radiance, as they went to join the procession that wound about the island like a splendid sea-serpent uncoiling itself from sleep and darkness.|$|R
60|$|Sharkey's head fell {{forward on}} his chest, {{and he sat}} motionless, {{stricken}} by this great and sudden horror, looking with his smouldering eyes into his fearsome future. Softly the mate and the surgeon rose from their places, and <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the poisoned air of the cabin, came forth into the freshness of the early dawn, with the soft, scent-laden breeze in their faces and the first red feathers of cloud catching the earliest gleam of the rising sun as it shot its golden rays over the palm-clad ridges of distant Hispaniola.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was in {{the wood}} that night. It was dark; I lost my way. Suddenly I heard voices--yours and Morton's. You were {{struggling}} within {{a few feet of}} me. Before I could interfere you had thrown him down and rushed away. I heard him breathing hard, and I saw Mr. Marx <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> behind a tree and creep up to him. Morton heard, too, and sprang up. They struggled together; perhaps in the darkness, Morton mistook him for you. I remembered the quarry and rushed out. I was too late.|$|R
60|$|He {{got there}} first and {{hid in the}} top of a big apple-tree, where he could see all that went on. It wasn't long before he saw Reddy Fox <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the Green Forest and over to the old orchard. Reddy was nervous, very nervous. You see, it was broad daylight, and the old orchard was very near Farmer Brown's house. Reddy knew that he ought to have waited until night, but he knew that then Johnny Chuck would be fast asleep, Now, perhaps, Johnny Chuck, {{thinking}} that no one knew where he lived, would not be on watch, and {{he might be able to}} catch Johnny.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see no plan," [...] he said, [...] "by {{which my}} lord {{can get away}} with all his {{followers}} and camels. One or two might <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the camp, and I thought at first that if Yussuf and myself--who would not be so closely watched as he will be, for there are two sentries outside the tent--could manage to <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> with our guns and to open fire in the darkness upon the camp, the Mahdists, thinking they were attacked, would seize their arms and run out, and in the confusion my lord and you and some of the others might make their escape. But this plan is full of danger, and it might not succeed, for they might suspect that those who attacked them were of your party, and a portion would remain to keep guard over you. This, then, should be the last resource, for if the attempt was made and failed, escape would be more difficult than ever.|$|R
60|$|He {{raised his}} hand, {{and it seemed}} as though unseen eyes watched them from every quarter. The silken {{curtains}} through which he had issued were drawn back by invisible hands, and the inner apartment was disclosed. Its faint illumination was obscured with purple shades. There was a high lacquer bedstead, with little ivory ladders on either side, a bedstead hung with silks of black and purple and mauve. There was a huge couch, a shrine opposite the bed, in which was a kneeling figure of black marble. A faint odour, as though from thousand-year-old sachets, very faint indeed and yet with its mead of intoxication, seemed to <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the room, which had borrowed from its curious hangings, its marvellous adornments, its strangely attuned atmosphere, all the mysticism of a fabled world.|$|R
60|$|Her whole being {{was in a}} turmoil. She drew {{nearer to}} the papers upon the table. She was now within a yard of Prince Shan himself. He {{made no effort to}} {{intercept}} her, no movement of any sort to stop her. Only his eyes never left her face, and she felt a madness which seemed to be choking the life out of her, a pounding of her heart against her ribs, a strange and wonderful joy, a joy in which there was no fear, a joy of new things and new hopes. With the papers for which she had come only a few yards away, she forgot them. She turned her head slowly. His arms seemed to <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> those long, silken sleeves. She suddenly felt herself held in a wonderful embrace.|$|R
60|$|In {{another five}} minutes the little party, <b>stealing</b> {{cautiously}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> their shelter, kept along {{close to the}} wall to a side door, through which they issued forth into the open. Ten steps {{took them to the}} cactus hedge, and stooping low under its shelter, they moved on till they safely reached the clump of trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "My plan is this," [...] I says. [...] "We can easy {{find out}} if it's Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that <b>comes</b> <b>steal</b> the key <b>out</b> of the old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn't that plan work?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Effingham {{shook his}} head in dissent, but the {{conversation}} changed in consequence of a stir in the ship. The air from the land had freshened, and even the heavy canvas on which the Montauk was now compelled principally to rely, had been asleep, as mariners term it, or had blown <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the mast, where it stood inflated and steady, a proof at sea, where the water is always in motion, that the breeze is getting to be fresh. Aided by this power, the ship had overcome the united action of the heavy ground-swell and of the current, and was <b>stealing</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the land, when the air murmured for an instant, as if about to blow still fresher, and then all the sails flapped. The wind had passed away like a bird, and a dark line to sea-ward, denoted the approach of the breeze from the ocean. The stir in the vessel was occasioned by the preparations to meet this change.|$|R
60|$|This plan {{appeared}} {{to offer more}} advantages than any other; and it was agreed, at last, that the two lads should, having darkened their skins and put on Indian dress, <b>steal</b> <b>out</b> that night <b>from</b> the castle and make for the shore. Tom and Reuben regretted much {{that they could not}} take part in the enterprise; but the governor assured them that, even were it desirable that four should undertake the mission, they could not be spared, since their presence would be greatly needed in the castle should the natives, before the arrival of the ship, make an attack upon it.|$|R
5000|$|Bleeding Through {{recently}} {{stated in}} an MTV blog they have finished {{the record and}} released details of the album, but {{do not intend to}} hand the masters over to Trustkill until numerous issues be resolved. This leaves the supposed August 2008 release date up in the air. Subsequently, they asked to be dropped from Trustkill in the same blog. Whilst playing at Download Festival in June 2008 Bleeding Through's front man Brandan Schieppati said with regards to the albums [...] "We are having trouble with our record label, so when the new record <b>comes</b> <b>out,</b> <b>steal</b> it, download it illegally, do what you fucking want, as long as you the fans hear it".|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Lucas {{is able to}} {{convince}} Carla, a detective investigating the case, that he is innocent, explaining to her that both the Oracle and the AIs are seeking the Indigo Child, a young girl who possesses a secret that will give great power to whoever hears it. The sacrifices were performed to find her location. Learning of {{the location of the}} child, Lucas <b>steals</b> her <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the noses of both the Oracle and the AIs, bringing her to a military base where he grew up and where, as a fetus, he was exposed to a powerful force known as Chroma, which gives both him and the Oracle their powers and gives Lucas the ability to resist the Oracle's attempts to drive him to suicide. However, he is followed, and a final battle takes place between the three: Lucas, the Oracle and the AIs.|$|R
50|$|The {{third and}} final session saw most of the cars {{switching}} to the softer option tyre. Sebastian Vettel took pole from Rubens Barrichello, with Webber third. Button qualified sixth - his worst of the season - after Nakajima found some of his first-session pace to <b>steal</b> fifth place <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under him, resulting in his career-best qualifying position. When the weights of each car was published post-qualifying, it emerged that Vettel was 9 kg heavier than the Brawn of Barrichello and 7 kg heavier than teammate Webber. After qualifying, {{it was announced that}} BMW Sauber would be abandoning their KERS program for good.|$|R

You understand; we {{have not}} yet been seen to {{communicate}} with the town; and luckily our French colors have been flying all the morning Our head, too, is in-shore, and we shall drift so far to the eastward in a few minutes as will shut in our hull, if not our upper sails, from the lugger where she now lies. As soon as this is done you shall be off with forty picked men for the shore. Engage a felucca and <b>come</b> <b>out</b> <b>stealing</b> along the rocks as close as you can, as if distrusting us.

50|$|Things were worsened when Mindy {{returned}} to town, still far {{too close to}} Roger Thorpe for Billy's liking. His violent temper {{got the better of}} him and led him to attack Roger with a knife. His friends convinced him to seek revenge in business and, at this, he was successful, turning Roger's son against him only to discover himself betrayed by Nadine and her ex-husband Buzz. She had faked her entire pregnancy and Buzz had blackmailed the Lewis family. Finishing with her, he remarried Vanessa just as Roger escalated their war. This culminated in Roger framing him for attempted murder. While the charges were dropped, he came to confess that he had actually shot Roger on a different occasion and he was sent to prison. When he was released, he tried to strengthen ties with Reva and Josh after his father's death. Since Vanessa was now married and presumed dead, {{he fell in love with}} Cassie, who had been hired by Alan to seduce him to <b>steal</b> Lewis <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under him. It came out that she was Reva's sister and all was forgiven.|$|R
