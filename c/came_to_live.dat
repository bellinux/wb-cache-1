5|$|In 1938, Otto Frank {{started a}} second company, Pectacon, {{which was a}} {{wholesaler}} of herbs, pickling salts, and mixed spices, used {{in the production of}} sausages. Hermann van Pels was employed by Pectacon as an advisor about spices. A Jewish butcher, he had fled Osnabrück with his family.

5|$|Mary Shelley's first concern {{during these}} years was the welfare of Percy Florence. She honoured her late husband's wish that his son attend public school, and, with Sir Timothy's grudging help, had him educated at Harrow. To avoid {{boarding}} fees, she moved to Harrow on the Hill herself so that Percy could attend as a day scholar. Though Percy went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, and dabbled in politics and the law, he {{showed no sign of}} his parents' gifts. He was devoted to his mother, and after he left university in 1841, he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with her.|$|E

He {{lived there}} with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with him at Yarralumla homestead.|$|E
5|$|Though Jane {{never used}} her {{connection}} with Shelley to gain any publicity, she did entertain prominent admirers and biographers of Shelley, including George Eliot and William Michael Rossetti. In {{the years before}} Hogg's death, a nephew of Jane's, one of John Cleveland's seven children, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with them after leaving the military due to an illness. Jane and her nephew, Harry Cleveland, became close friends {{and he began to}} run her household as she grew older. In her later years, Jane often read novels, played the piano, and spent time with Harry's daughter and her grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E

5|$|Elias C. Laycock was his 'chief rival'. Just a year {{younger than}} Rush, and like him, a large and {{powerful}} man, Laycock <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> on the Lower Clarence River around 1874. The two scullers met first at the Queen's Birthday regatta in Grafton in May 1874. Laycock, untried at boat racing, was beaten, though undeterred. During the following years, Laycock challenged Rush and others to sculling matches, until in April 1879, he beat World Champion Trickett at a State regatta. A series of matches followed to determine the current Australian sculling Champion, who would defend the World Title. Laycock beat Rush again and again, but Trickett eventually beat Laycock. Trickett once more went to the Thames to row against Ned Hanlan, but these preliminary contests in Sydney {{marked the end of}} Rush's World Championship ambitions.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} gene transfer as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals. The endosymbiotic theory holds that organelles within the cells of eukorytes such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, had descended from independent bacteria that <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> symbiotically within other cells. It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{arrived at}} Shannon Harbour in 1804, {{and the water}} {{transport}} facilities stimulated the growth of existing industries and encouraged the establishment of new ones. Neat two and three-storey houses were built {{on each side of}} the road in Banagher to provide shops and dwellings for the merchants and other people who <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there for the canal business. In 1834, there was a distillery, a brewery, two tanyards, a malthouse and corn mills in full operation in the town. Several craftsmen carried on industries in smaller workshops and in their homes. With the increase in trade and manufactures went a corresponding increase in population. In 1800, the population was estimated at 1500; in 1841, it was 2836, and in 1846, it was estimated at 3000.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that St. Rynagh (also Reynagh, Rinagh), who founded Banagher and after whom the parish is named, was a sister of St. Finnian of Clonard. According to research, they came from a place near New Ross in County Wexford. It is known that contact was {{maintained}} between Rynagh's Wexford home and her foundation at Banagher; and her mother <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> there. It is recorded that Reynagh's mother, Talech, or Talacia, became Abbess of the Banagher convent. The death of St. Finnian is assigned to 563, but there {{does not seem to}} be any authoritative statement as to the date of St. Rynagh's death, although according to St. Rynagh's Parish Church in Banagher, St. Rynagh died about 610. The place of her burial is uncertain but it is likely to have been in either Banagher or Kilmacduagh near Gort, the monastery founded by her son, St. Colman.|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, and he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain {{the location of the}} shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E

5|$|Three months later, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) shows Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) a photo taken {{moments before}} Teddy's death, {{showing that the}} balloon moved {{horizontally}} against the wind. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow), a digital photo expert, uses software to uncover evidence of electromagnetic disturbances {{in the shape of}} a child, holding the balloon. During a visit by the agents, the Holveys adamantly dispute Mulder's theory that Teddy was led onto the tracks. Scully sees Golda (Lilyan Chauvin), Maggie's elderly Romanian mother, drawing a swastika on Charlie’s hand. Scully hypothesizes that the Holvey children may be victims of Munchausen by proxy, perpetrated by their grandmother. At a meeting with Steve Holvey, he explains that Golda was against his marriage to Maggie, and that strange things began to happen when Teddy was born and Golda <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with the family. Steve hints that Golda might be hurting Charlie, leading Scully to suggest that they visit a social worker named Karen Kosseff (Christine Willes). When preparing to leave for a session with Kosseff, Steve and Charlie get in the car but the garage sliding door seems to be malfunctioning, making Steve to step out and take a double-sided ladder to reset the sliding door's motor but in doing so, his tie is caught in the door rails with the motor suddenly starting, strangling and hanging him. Meanwhile Charlie, having been mysteriously locked in the car, starts crying over his father's death.|$|E
