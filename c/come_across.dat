5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} the peninsula, to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due to the length of the peninsula and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E

5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries <b>come</b> <b>across</b> in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity not given to emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|Nine months later, {{the family}} leaves Boston and drives to Los Angeles. Their teenage {{daughter}} Violet (Taissa Farmiga) is unhappy about the move.

She mentions the deaths of the previous owners, a gay couple named Chad and Patrick who died from an apparent murder/suicide. The family decides to buy the house and move in.|$|E

5|$|After Flower was {{released}} to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany {{moved on to}} their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen {{to focus on the}} element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to <b>come</b> <b>across</b> other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E

The two men <b>come</b> <b>across</b> a slave labor camp, but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had <b>come</b> <b>across</b> the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually to return it to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E

5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, even if they are lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her <b>come</b> <b>across</b> as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers <b>come</b> <b>across</b> an old man on a snowmobile. Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} first time in a dozen years is as close as we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever <b>come</b> <b>across,</b> and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E
