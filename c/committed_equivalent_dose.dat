40|$|ABSTRACT: Retention, absorbed dose, <b>{{committed}}</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> {{and committed}} effective doses have been assessed due to acute ingestion of 1 Bq of 60 Co in human body. Calculations are done using “Internal Radiation Dose Assessment (IRDA) ” software {{which has been}} developed based on the biokinetic model. Due to ingestion maximum radiation dose is deposited in the gastro intestinal (GI) tract, assumed to consist of four tissue compartments, e. g. stomach (ST), small intestine (SI), upper large intestine (ULI) and lower large intestine (LLI). In this work actual tissue masses of GI Tract of Bangladeshi people have been considered to calculate the above mentioned quantities for different age groups, such as 1 yr, 10 yrs and adult (female and male). One hour after the ingestion, the retention and absorbed dose show the trend ST> SI> ULI> LLI. Regarding tissue compartments the variation of the <b>committed</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> pattern is LLI> ULI> ST> SI for the radionuclide. The variation of absorbed dose, <b>committed</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>dose</b> and committed effective dose with respect to age follow the pattern: 1 yr> 10 yrs> adult female> adult male. The highest committed effective dose for ingestion of 1 Bq of the radionuclide under the study {{is found in the}} GI tract of 1 yr old child. This value is 6. 56 x 10 - 6 mSv.

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{internal}} exposure, the dose is not received {{at the moment of}} exposure, as happens with external exposure, since the incorporated radionuclide irradiates the various organs and tissues during the time it is present in the body. By definition, the <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> corresponds to the received dose integrated over 50 years from the date of intake. In order to calculate it, one has to know the intake activity and the value of the <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> per unit of intake activity. The uncertainties of the first parameter are such that the <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> can only be regarded as an order of magnitude and not as a very accurate quantity. The use of it is justified, however, for, like the <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> for external exposure, it expresses the risk of stochastic effects for the individual concerned since these effects, should they appear, would do so only after a latent period which is generally longer than the dose integration time. Moreover, the use of the <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> offers certain advantages for dosimetric management, especially when it is simplified. A practical problem which may arise is that the annual dose limit is apparently exceeded by virtue of the fact that one is taking account, in the first year, of doses which will actually be received only in the following years. These problems are rare enough in practice to be dealt with individually in each case.|$|R

40|$|Most of {{radiation}} hazard of indoor radon is {{largely due to}} the radon progenies, which are inhaled and deposited in the human respiratory tract. It is therefore important to understanding the distribution of radon and their progeny in indoor environment helps in calculating the inhalation doses due to them. This paper focuses on effects of exhalation from different sources (wall, floor and ceiling) and the ventilation profile on distribution of the concentrations of radon and their progeny indoor. The radon exhalation rate from walls, floor and ceiling, and ventilation rate were measured as a part of this study and are used as input in Finite Volume Method (FVM) simulation. The findings show that the radon concentration which is distributed in a non-homogeneous way in the room is due to the difference in the radon concentration of different sources (wall, floor and ceiling). Moreover, the radon concentration is much larger near walls, and decreases {{in the middle of the}} room because of the effect of air velocity. It has also been found that the distributions of unattached and attached fraction of 218 Po, 214 Pb and 214 Po radionuclides are similar to that of 222 Rn.

Our study hence suggests that, based on the food data, the internal exposure of Japanese residents was too low to cause a statistically discernible increase in thyroid cancer, even if the contribution from inhalation is taken into account. The data also indicate that the governmental efforts in the food monitoring campaign were successful and cut the thyroid doses to the public by a factor of approximately 3 compared to a scenario without any monitoring. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|The ICRP has {{published}} two biokinetic models providing {{a basis for}} radiation dose assessment due toradionuclides incorporated inside the gastrointestinal tract. These models are a sufficient tool to assess the <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> for occupational exposures to workers assuming normal anatomy. The colostomy is becoming a more prevalent procedure. A colostomy permanently or temporarily bypasses a portion of colon to allow rest and healing. There are four different colostomies; ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid and an ileostomy. As a patient’s strength returns, they can return to normal daily activities, including returning to work. Therefore, as an ostomy patient returns to the workforce handling radioactive material, the potential for exposure to the radioactive material for these workers increases. The aim of this project is to determined whether or not an additional risk exists for these workers and if additional limitations {{should be placed on}} ostomy patients handling uranium. In order to determine if an additional risk exists two pathways are considered, ingestion and injection. Injection is a unique pathway for this work and is defined as radioactive material entering through the stoma. As part of the injection scenario {{as well as in the}} event contamination occurs, the dose per hou to the stoma was also determined.

In addition, using the more limiting value between the CDE and CEDE annual limit, the annual limit on intake (ALI) was determined. Based on a decrease in CDE values within the alimentary tract for each procedure and the determination the ALIs were either equivalent or orders of magnitude greater than the current ICRP ALI values no additional risk exists. Finally, based on the dose per hour resulting from stoma contamination, the chemical hazards were determined to be of greater concern than the radiological. Therefore, no additional guidance is needed for ostomy patients working with uranium...|$|R

Material mass and isotopic data are needed to calculate PuE using the isotopic conversion factors, which will provide the actual PuE value at the time of calculation. PuE is the summation of the isotopic masses times their associated isotopic conversion factors for plutonium 239. Isotopic conversion factors are calculated by a normalized equation, relative to Plutonium 239, of specific activity (SA) and cumulated dose inhalation affects based on 50 -yr <b>committed</b> effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> (CEDE). The isotopic conversion factors for converting weapons grade plutonium to PuE are provided in Table- 1.

The ALI is the annual intake of a radionuclide which would result in a <b>committed</b> effective <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> of 0. 05 Sv/yr for stochastic effects, or a <b>committed</b> <b>dose</b> <b>equivalent</b> to an individual organ or tissue of 0. 5 Sv/yr for deterministic effects, to Reference Man (ICRP 1975).

Therefore, ALIs and DACs can be used for assessing radiation doses due to accidental ingestion and inhalation of radionuclides and are used for limiting radionuclide intake through breathing of, or submersion in, contaminated air.

For this research, instrumental neutron-activation analysis (INAA) {{was used to determine}} the activities of U- 235 fission products in common spices. Using this information, the concentrations of natural uranium in these spices and the doses to individuals consuming the spices were calculated. Nine spices and two standard reference materials were selected for analysis. The spices chosen were cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, oregano, thyme, cayenne, ginger, chili powder, and paprika. For comparison, NIST-certified "orchard leaves" and "spinach leaves" were used. The spices and standards were placed in polyethylene vials and heat-sealed. The samples were divided into irradiation groups of 30 seconds, 12 hours, and long irradiations of 10 to 12. 8 hours. After irradiation, all samples were counted on an HPGe detector for time periods ranging between 10 minutes to 65 hours. After counting, the results were analyzed using Genie 2000 software. The Genie 2000 analysis revealed no detectable fission products for samples irradiated for 30 seconds or counted for short times. However, long counts revealed the high-yield U- 235 fission products molybdenum- 99 and what appeared to be cerium- 144. However, after comparing the experimental values with the calculated values, it was determined that the experimental values of Ce- 144 were not credible and the focus shifted solely toward Mo- 99.
