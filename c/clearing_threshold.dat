40|$|Amplification of the {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} receptor 1 (FGFR 1) gene {{has been described}} in tumors of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Prior reports showed conflicting rates of amplification frequency and clinical relevance. We developed a reliable real-time quantitative PCR assay to assess the frequency of FGFR 1 amplification and assessed the optimal cutoff level of amplification for clinical application. In a training cohort of 203 NSCLCs, we established that a 3. 5 -fold amplification optimally divided patients into groups with different survival rates with a <b>clear</b> <b>threshold</b> level. Those with FGFR 1 amplification levels above 3. 5 -fold had an inferior survival. These data were confirmed in a validation cohort of 142 NSCLC. After adjusting for age, sex, performance status, stage, and histology, patients with FGFR 1 amplification levels above 3. 5 fold had a hazard ratio of 2. 91 (95 % CI- 1. 14, 7. 41; pvalue- 0. 025) for death in the validation cohort. The rates of FGFR 1 amplification using the cutoff level of 3. 5 were 5. 1 % in squamous cell and 4. 1 % in adenocarcinomas. There was a non-significant trend towards higher amplifications rates in heavy smokers (> 15 pack-years of cigarette consumption) as compared to light smokers.
