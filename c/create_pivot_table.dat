40|$|Abstract Multidimensional {{data are}} used in popular to support OLAP(On-Line Analytical Processing) {{operations}} efficiently. Many OLAP tools {{have been developed to}} manipulate the multidimensional data to provide users with useful information for decision making. While they are equipped with useful features, they seem be sometimes complicated to relational database users. In this paper, we developed an easy and effective interface manipulating multidimensional data on the top of relational DBMSs. The proposed interface provides a mechanism handling data in relational tables like spreadsheet (e. g., Microsoft Excel) does. Spreadsheet is the most popular tool for end users to analysis their data conveniently. The interface provides the features browsing relational tables virtually with sheet by sheet and <b>creating</b> <b>pivot</b> <b>tables.</b> <b>Pivot</b> <b>tables</b> are a useful presentation form of multidimensional data, which have attribute values (not attribute names) as their columns thus have horizontal format. We store <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> of horizontal format as vertical tables in relational DBMSs and we provide the transformation of queries on horizontal table into ones on vertical tables. With this user-friendly interface, users will be able to perform analysis activities on data in relational DBMSs easily and effectively...|$|R

40|$|Microsoft SQL Server PowerPivot for Excel, or PowerPivot for short, is an in-memory {{business}} intelligence (BI) engine that enables Excel users to interactively <b>create</b> <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> over large data sets imported from {{sources such as}} relational databases, text files and web data feeds. Unlike traditional <b>pivot</b> <b>tables</b> in Excel that are defined on a single table, PowerPivot allows analysis over multiple tables connected via foreign-key joins. In many cases however, these foreign-key relationships are not known a priori, and information workers are often not be sophisticated enough to define these relationships. Therefore, the ability to automatically discover foreign-key relationships in PowerPivot is valuable, if not essential. The key challenge is to perform this detection interactively and with high precision even when data sets scale to {{hundreds of millions of}} rows and the schema contains tens of tables and hundreds of columns. In this paper, we describe techniques for fast foreign-key detection in PowerPivot and experimentally evaluate its accuracy, performance and scale on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world data sets. These techniques have been incorporated into PowerPivot for Excel. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The query for triple {{information}} on product– attribute (property) –value {{is one of}} the most frequent queries in e-commerce. In storing the triple (product–attribute– value) information, a vertical schema is effective for avoiding sparse data and schema evolution, while a conventional horizontal schema often shows better query performance, since the properties are queried as groups clustered by each product. Therefore, we propose two storage schemas: a vertical schema as a primary table structure for the triple information in RDBMS and a <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index <b>created</b> from the basic vertical table as an additional index structure for accelerating query processing. The <b>pivoted</b> <b>table</b> index is beneficial to improving the performance of the frequent pattern query on the group properties associated with each product class.
