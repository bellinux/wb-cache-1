5|$|A nearby Citgo {{service station}} also had {{security}} cameras, but a video released on September 15, 2006 {{did not show}} the crash because the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> pointed away from the crash site.|$|E
5|$|The Optical Navigation Camera images the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, against {{background}} {{stars to}} precisely determine MRO's orbit. Although moon imaging is not mission critical, it was {{included as a}} technology test for future orbiting and landing of spacecraft. The Optical Navigation <b>Camera</b> <b>was</b> tested successfully in February and March 2006. There is a proposal to search for small moons, dust rings, and old orbiters with it.|$|E
5|$|The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{developed}} a battery-powered pigeon camera now {{on display in}} the CIA Museum's virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest that the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it was a failure.|$|E
30|$|As {{previously}} mentioned the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> identical in every respect. The left <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated {{as a master}} while the right <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> operated as a slave but this distinction is merely {{the result of the}} way the outputs from the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> treated by the video concentrator.|$|R
50|$|Intermittent motion <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{capable of}} {{hundreds}} of frames per second. Rotating prism <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of thousands of frames per second. Rotating mirror <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> capable of millions of frames per second.|$|R
50|$|Remote <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{most widely}} used in sports photography. 35mm digital or film, and medium format <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> the most common types of <b>cameras</b> that <b>are</b> used.|$|R
5|$|The new camera {{will allow}} Hubble to take large-scale, {{extremely}} clear and detailed photos over {{a wider range}} of colors than the old camera did. After the installation, controllers at the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at Goddard Space Flight Center sent commands to the camera to perform an aliveness test, which passed, indicating the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> installed correctly.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame the scenes in his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
5|$|A video by Ken McCallum, a {{cameraman}} for Channel4 News, was broadcast on 8 April. Shot {{from a different}} angle, the footage shows Harwood draw his arm back to head height before bringing the baton down on Tomlinson's legs. McCallum was filming another incident at the time; the Tomlinson incident was unfolding in the background, unseen by the journalists but recorded by the camera. Half an hour later Alex Thomson, chief correspondent of Channel4 News, was doing a live broadcast when the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> damaged. It took engineers days to recover the tape, which is when they saw that Tomlinson's assault was on it.|$|E
50|$|The main (rear-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 8MP, {{while the}} {{secondary}} (front-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 5MP <b>camera.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gun <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> <b>cameras</b> used {{primarily}} in aircraft to help measure tactical effectiveness. These <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{triggered by the}} firing of a weapon, hence the name.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} instant <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> conceived before Edwin Land's {{invention of}} the instant <b>camera.</b> These <b>cameras</b> <b>were,</b> however, more portable wet darkrooms than [...] "instant" [...] <b>camera</b> and <b>were</b> difficult to use.|$|R
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Many fans wanted Snake Eater {{to use a}} 3D camera, {{but this}} was {{ultimately}} not implemented in the game. Kojima views Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty and Snake Eater as a trilogy, and wished to keep the camera {{the same as the}} previous two {{in order to keep the}} feel of the three games the same. He did, however, acknowledge that the current trend for video games is to use the 3D camera. The <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> later implemented in an updated version of Snake Eater titled , and further installments in the franchise.|$|E
5000|$|A folding <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a <b>camera</b> type. Folding cameras fold into {{a compact}} and rugged package for storage. The lens and shutter are {{attached}} to a lens-board which {{is connected to the}} body of the camera by a light-tight folding bellows. When the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> fully unfolded it provides the correct focus distance from the film. The key advantage of folding <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> their excellent physical-size to film-size ratio when the <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> folded for storage.|$|R
50|$|The main (rear-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 13 MP {{autofocus}} {{camera with}} 0.25s autofocus while the secondary (front-facing) <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> a 3.7 MP camera.|$|R
50|$|SAO <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> at Woomera, Australia; Juptier, Florida; Organ Pass, New Mexico; Olifantsfontein, Union of South Africa; Cadiz, Spain; Mitaka, Japan; Nani Tal, India; Arequipa, Peru; Shiraz, Iran; Curaҫao, Netherlands West Indies; Villa Dolores, Argentina; and Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. USAF <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> at Oslo, Norway; Edwards AFB, California, and Santiago, Chile. Two {{additional}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> later {{added to}} the USAF inventory - one of the USAF <b>cameras</b> <b>was</b> transferred to the Royal Canadian Air Force at Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada in 1961.|$|R
5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs to hear about the status of the war. A smuggled <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places was done on a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} mainly shot on Kodak Vision3 250D film stock. Scenes where Oscar is alive were {{shot in the}} super 35 format with Arricam LT cameras, and the rest in super 16 with an Aaton XTR Prod. The cinematographer was Benoît Debie, who also shot Irréversible. As in Irréversible, Noé was {{reluctant}} to use artificial lighting that would destroy the illusion if the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> turned around. Thanks to Tokyo's many neon signs, very little additional lighting was required for the exterior scenes, {{despite the fact that}} many were shot late at night. For the interior scenes Debie mainly used practical, in-frame light sources. Some exceptions were made. One was that the moods of the characters were meant to be indicated by different colours, ranging from orange to purple with occasional greens. For this, Debie used a set of red, green, and blue programmable disco lights, which allowed for all different hues. The disco lights were easy to hide. They were also used for simulation of neon flashes, and to add a tint of red to the dressing-room scenes. Another exception was the use of strobe lights, which were programmed together with the coloured lights. Blue colour was avoided throughout, since the filmmakers did not associate it with dreams. Noé was the film's camera operator, except for a few shots of Oscar running in the streets, as they required a taller cameraman. In those scenes, the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> held by Debie.|$|E
50|$|The Olympus PEN F {{series of}} <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> half-frame SLR <b>cameras</b> {{produced}} between 1963 and 1970. The <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> unique in using a rotary shutter.|$|R
30|$|Video <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{present in}} many parts of our daily lives. In {{surveillance}} applications they are used to monitor train stations, airports, or public places in cities [1]. Enforcement applications and traffic monitoring [2] are another application area where <b>camera</b> systems <b>are</b> frequently used. In all those applications multiple, spatially distributed <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> used to cover large areas. But the deployment of <b>cameras</b> <b>is</b> no longer limited to public places. An example where <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> installed in private environments is assisted living. Elderly people are monitored in their homes to detect unusual behavior such as the collapse of persons [3].|$|R
50|$|Some special {{models of}} color <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> only capable of {{outputting}} raw digital image data. Such <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> called ColorRAW or Bayer <b>cameras.</b> They <b>are</b> {{often used in}} industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science. In form of photo <b>cameras,</b> they <b>are</b> used by professional photographers. Semi-professional photo cameras often offer an optional RAW mode.|$|R
5|$|There are two known {{photographs}} of Bahá'u'lláh, both {{taken at the}} same occasion in 1868 {{while he was in}} Adrianople (present-day Edirne). The one where he looks at the <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> taken for passport purposes and is reproduced in William Miller's book on the Bahá'í Faith. Copies of both pictures are at the Bahá'í World Centre, and one is on display in the International Archives building, where the Bahá'ís view it as part of an organized pilgrimage. Outside of this experience Bahá'ís prefer not to view his photos in public, or even to display any of them in their private homes, and Bahá'í institution strongly suggests to use an image of Bahá'u'lláh's burial shrine instead.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} at Lukeville POE at 3 or 3:30 PM, the two agents interviewed Howard and Maureen Cotterman separately. Howard Cotterman {{offered to help}} the agents with the computer, but the offer was declined. At 6 PM, the two agents left with both laptops and one digital camera. The devices were taken to Tucson and delivered to John Owens, an ICE Computer Forensic Examiner at 11 PM that night. The <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> returned to the Cottermans as {{there was no evidence}} of contraband found. However, on April 8, Agent Owens' forensic examination turned up approximately 75 images of child pornography on Howard Cotterman's computer. Agent Owens called the Cottermans that night, asking Howard Cotterman for assistance opening the password protected files. Howard Cotterman agreed to come in the next day, but only his wife showed up to pick up the other laptop.|$|E
5|$|An early {{concept for}} The Rite of Spring was {{to extend the}} story {{to the age of}} mammals and the first humans and the {{discovery}} of fire and man's triumph. John Hubley, the segment's art director, explained that it was later curtailed by Disney to avoid controversy from creationists, who promised to make trouble should he connect evolution with humans. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the history of the planet the studio received guidance from Roy Chapman Andrews, the director of the American Museum of Natural History, English biologist Julian Huxley, paleontologist Barnum Brown, and astronomer Edwin Hubble. Animators studied comets and nebulae at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and observed a herd of iguanas and a baby alligator that were brought into the studio. The <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> kept at a low position throughout the segment to heighten the immensity of the dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|In motor racing, onboard <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} to give a better {{perspective}} from the driver's point of view, whilst in films, these <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> designed to increase the intensity and action of a specific scene. Onboard <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> used in movies such as Le Mans and The Fast and the Furious series, for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Each phone has {{a camera}} and both front and back <b>camera</b> <b>are</b> available. Front <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> 5 {{megapixel}}.

Proximity Sensor, Light Sensors, Gravity, Accelerometer, Orientation {{are a few of}} the sensors available.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, many single-system 35mm <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by Wall Camera Corporation, which much later produced the three-film Cinerama cameras. Wall initially converted some Bell & Howell Design 2709 cameras to single-system, {{but most were}} Wall designed and produced. Single-system <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> also {{produced by}} Mitchell Camera Corporation during World War II for the U.S. Army Signal Corps, although these <b>cameras</b> <b>were</b> quite rare.|$|R
5|$|In early 1942, Rudel {{got married}} while home on leave. Later in the year, he {{took part in}} the Battle of Stalingrad. In February 1943, Rudel flew his 1,000th combat mission. He then participated in the {{experiments}} with using the Ju87G in the anti-tank role. The anti-tank unit took part in operations against the Soviet Kerch–Eltigen Operation. The footage from an onboard gun <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> used in Die Deutsche Wochenschau, a Reich Ministry of Propaganda newsreel. In April 1943, Rudel was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, receiving them from Hitler personally in Berlin. Rudel participated in the Battle of Kursk with the same unit. In October 1943, Rudel was credited with the destruction of his 100th tank and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The <b>camera</b> <b>was</b> switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro <b>Camera,</b> <b>was</b> a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
5000|$|While some {{disposables}} {{contain an}} actual cartridge as used for loading normal, reusable cameras, others {{just have the}} film wound internally on an open spool. The whole <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> handed in for processing. Some of the <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> recycled, i.e. refilled with film and resold. The <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> returned for [...] "processing" [...] {{in the same fashion}} as film cameras.|$|R
30|$|Normally, {{the target}} of CCTV <b>cameras</b> <b>are</b> people, therefore, the average height of humans is adopted as the target height. The {{corresponding}} parameter of the Revit <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> “target elevation”.|$|R
50|$|In general usage, this rear <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> {{used to take}} higher-resolution images, {{whereas the}} front-facing <b>camera</b> <b>is</b> used for lower-resolution {{face-to-face}} conversations with other users using the FaceTime communication platform.|$|R
