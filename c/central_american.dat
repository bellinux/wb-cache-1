5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included the very small range of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> who {{illegally}} immigrated after 1982 {{were not}} eligible for the federal government's amnesty program for illegal immigrants. Some <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> became eligible for amnesty and legalization at a later date.

5|$|All {{species of}} Cucurbita have 20 pairs of chromosomes. Many North and <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> species are visited by {{specialist}} pollinators in the apid tribe Eucerini, especially the genera Peponapis and Xenoglossa, and these squash bees can {{be crucial to}} the flowers producing fruit after pollination.|$|E
5|$|Beatrice Marquez, a Houston Independent School District (HISD) parent {{involvement}} {{specialist for the}} Gulfton area, stated in a 2004 Education Week article {{that members of the}} <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> communities specifically identify themselves with Gulfton rather than Houston.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederation of North, <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) Congress in Guatemala City, Guatemala on January 26, 1991, the {{qualification}} rounds for {{the inaugural}} CONCACAF Gold Cup was decided upon. Since Costa Rica {{were given a}} bye into the competition due to its first place standing at the 1989 CONCACAF Championship, which {{also served as a}} qualification phase for the FIFA World Cup hosted by Italy in 1990, they weren't required to participate in the preliminary stages. However, the final qualification round of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> zone had two bids: the United States and Costa Rica. Costa Rica won the bid and was named by CONCACAF and UNCAF as the host nation of the inaugural UNCAF Nations Cup tournament on February 19, 1991.|$|E

5|$|One popular {{theory is}} that {{squirrel}} monkeys did live in Colombia during the late Miocene or Pliocene and these squirrel monkeys migrated to Central America, becoming the ancestors of the current <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> species. According to this theory, the Guatemalan black howler migrated to Central America around the same time. Passage through the isthmus of Panama later closed due to rising oceans, and eventually opened up to another wave of migration about 2 million years ago. These later migrants, ancestors to modern populations of white-headed capuchins, mantled howlers and Geoffroy's spider monkeys, out-competed the earlier migrants, leading to the small range of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkey and Guatemalan black howler.|$|E
5|$|Palms in {{the genus}} Calyptronoma have pinnately {{compound}} leaves and large, solitary stems 4 to 15 metres (13 to 49ft) tall. The genus is endemic to the Greater Antilles, inhabiting wet areas near streams. Calyptronoma {{is closely related}} to the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> genus Calyptrogyne.|$|E
50|$|Among the Hispanic {{population}}, 16,321 (12.8%) were of Mexican descent. 8,117 (6.3%) were of Puerto Rican descent, with {{a sizable}} population of <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> (excluding Mexicans) at 1,758 (1.4%).|$|R
50|$|The first Latino {{immigrants}} to the city began arriving in the 1960s. <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> and anti-Castro middle-class Cubans {{were the first to}} immigrate. They were followed by middle-class immigrants from Argentina, Mexico, Peru, and Puerto Rico.|$|R
40|$|This report discuses {{issues related}} to the {{significant}} portion of the <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> affected by the IIRIRA revisions still have asylum cases pending and may obtain legal permanent residence by that avenue if they demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution. The Attorney General also has the discretionary authority to grant blanket relief from deportation, but the discretionary forms of relief do not entail legal permanent residence. There is considerable interest in this issue in the 105 th Congress, and the Senate passed by a vote of 99 to 1 an amendment to provide relief for certain <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> to the D. C. appropriations bill (S. 1156) ...|$|R
5|$|Providence {{has several}} ethnic neighborhoods, notably Federal Hill and the North End (Italian), Fox Point (Portuguese), West End (mainly <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> and Asians), and Smith Hill (Irish with {{miscellaneous}} enclaves of other groups). There are also many dedicated community organizations and arts associations {{located in the}} city.|$|E
5|$|The Arévalo {{government}} also floated {{the idea of}} a <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> Federation, as being the only way that a democratic government could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> countries, but was rejected by all except Castañeda Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 the Castro government was toppled in a military coup led by Óscar Osorio.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel}} monkey differs in coloration from South American {{squirrel monkey}}s. While South American squirrel monkeys {{tend to be}} primarily greenish in color, the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> species has an orange back with olive shoulders, hips and tail and white undersides. The hands and feet are also orange. There is a black cap {{at the top of}} the head, and a black tip at the end of the tail. Males generally have lighter caps than females. The face is white with black rims around the eyes and black around the nose and mouth.|$|E
40|$|This study tests Portes and Zhou's (1993) three-level {{model of}} assimilation. The model posits that {{immigrant}} assimilation {{is based on}} the privileges the immigrant group brings to the United States; particularly, resources such as education and language attainment that facilitate inclusion. This work examines this process among Dominican, <b>Central,</b> and South <b>American</b> immigrants. The study posits language assimilation, as a proxy for classic assimilation. Results suggest that Dominican, <b>Central,</b> and South <b>American</b> immigrants significantly differ from other Latinos with respect to political orientation and racial identity. As Dominican, <b>Central,</b> and South <b>Americans</b> adopt the language of the United States, {{the more likely they are}} to affiliate with the Republican Party and to identify racially as White.

5|$|The {{lifespan}} of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> {{squirrel monkey}} {{in the wild}} is unknown, but captive specimens {{have been known to}} live more than 15 years. Other squirrel monkey species are known to be able to live more than 20 years.|$|E
5|$|The manakins are {{a family}} of {{subtropical}} and tropical mainland <b>Central</b> <b>American,</b> South America, and Trinidad and Tobago. They are compact forest birds, the males typically being brightly colored, although the females of most species are duller and usually green-plumaged. Manakins feed on small fruits, berries, and insects.|$|E

50|$|By 1986 {{the most}} {{prominent}} groups of <b>Central</b> <b>Americans</b> came from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Rodriguez identified five key groups: Salvadorans from urban and rural areas, urban Hispanic Guatemalans, rural Guatemalans of Mayan/indigenous origin, urban Hispanic Hondurans, and rural Hondurans of Garifuna origin.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{dominance}} hierarchies {{among the}} females, and the females do not form coalitions. Males {{in the group}} are generally {{related to each other}} and thus tend to form strong affiliations, and only form dominance hierarchies during the breeding season. This is especially the case among males of the same age. Neither males nor females are dominant over each other, an egalitarian social system that is unique to <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkeys. In South American species, either the females (S. boliviensis) or males (S. sciureus) are dominant over the other sex, and both sexes form stable dominance hierarchies. Groups of <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> squirrel monkeys generally do not compete or fight with each other. Male Costa Rican squirrel monkeys are known to have very close bonds with each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{language}} {{which was}} the ancestor of Pochutec split from Proto-Nahuan (or Proto-Aztecan) possibly as early as AD 400, arriving in Mesoamerica a few centuries earlier than the main bulk of speakers of Nahuan languages. Some Nahuan groups migrated south along the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> isthmus, reaching as far as Nicaragua. The critically endangered Pipil language of El Salvador is the only living descendant {{of the variety of}} Nahuatl once spoken south of present-day Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Arachnids {{have been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine, and their venom has been studied for bioactive factors. In 1993 Margatoxin was synthesized from the venom of the <b>Central</b> <b>American</b> bark scorpion, Centruroides margaritatus. This peptide selectively inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels. Patented by Merck, {{it has the potential to}} prevent neointimal hyperplasia, a common cause of bypass graft failure.|$|E
50|$|Many of the biracial, {{mixed and}} White Caucasian Salvadorans (and other <b>Central</b> <b>Americans)</b> descend from Spain, Italy, Portugal, Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, and other European countries.
