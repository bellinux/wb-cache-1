25|$|Channel-switching (not to be {{confused}} with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching to a different purchasing environment (or distribution channel) to purchase goods, such as switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues, or the internet. A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of Category killers (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal/ statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> <b>preparations</b> and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{the high}} use of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines, {{little is known}} about Australia's <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines information needs. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify gaps in consumers' perceived knowledge and concerns, to better target consumer medicines information and improve quality use of medicines. Methods: We analysed cough-and-cold related enquiries from consumers who contacted an Australian national medicine call centre between September 2002 and June 2010. Results: Of 5503 <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> calls, female callers made up 86 % of the calls and 33 % were related to children. Questions most frequently related to drug-drug interactions (29 %). An analysis of narratives over an 18 -month period (248 calls) revealed 20 % of the calls concerned potentially clinically relevant interactions, particularly those involving psychotropic agents. Discussion: The potential for interactions with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines purchased OTC is recognised by consumers. Patient information should address their concerns. Doctors should be aware of the common <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> interactions <b>and</b> communicate likely clinical symptoms to patients when prescribing medication to prevent potential harm...|$|R

A pesquisa etnográfica envolveu observação participante, entrevistas abertas e semi-estruturadas e pesquisa domiciliar. Analisando seis meses (2008) de prescrições médicas, foram indicados 458 medicamentos em 236 consultas, sobressaindo-se as preparações para tosse e resfriado, os analgésicos e os anti-helmínticos, entre outros. Nas três pesquisas domiciliares, os analgésicos e as preparações para tosse e resfriado foram os mais encontrados em 2006 e 2007, e os antianêmicos em 2008. Os Guaraní utilizavam os serviços de atenção básica principalmente para gripe, tosse e diarréia, incluindo também em suas práticas a procura pelo pajé e a autoatenção com medicamentos e ervas, reconhecendo para os medicamentos sua eficácia e avaliando o tratamento de acordo com suas experiências e concepções do processo saúde-doença-atenção.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} carried out in various {{hospitals}} to analyze the use of rational fixed dose combinations (FDCs) in Pune. Methods: 279 prescriptions were evaluated in this study. Information about age, sex, names of the all the drugs prescribed by doctor/ physician, diagnosis for the use of prescriptions and adverse effects were noted in the audit form from the prescriptions of the patients. Rationality of fixed dose combination is evaluated according to WHO Model List of Essential Drugs, 17 th updated version, 2011. Results: 56. 98 % doctor&# 8217;s prescriptions in this study were containing of fixed dose combinations and out of this 10. 69 % prescriptions were including two or more FDCs in their prescriptions. Only 13. 20 % FDCs were in accordance with WHO Model List of Essential Drugs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Medication {{errors are}} widely {{reported}} for hospitalised patients, but limited {{data are available}} for medication errors that occur in community-based and clinical settings. Epidemiological data from poisons information centres enable characterisation of trends in medication errors occurring across the healthcare spectrum. AIM: The objective {{of this study was}} to characterise the epidemiology and type of medication errors reported to the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC) of Ireland. METHODS: A 3 -year prospective study on medication errors reported to the NPIC was conducted from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 inclusive. Data on patient demographics, enquiry source, location, pharmaceutical agent(s), type of medication error, and treatment advice were collated from standardised call report forms. Medication errors were categorised as (i) prescribing error (i. e. physician error), (ii) dispensing error (i. e. pharmacy error), and (iii) administration error involving the wrong medication, the wrong dose, wrong route, or the wrong time. RESULTS: Medication errors were reported for 2348 individuals, representing 9. 56 % of total enquiries to the NPIC over 3 years. In total, 1220 children and adolescents under 18 years of age and 1128 adults (>/= 18 years old) experienced a medication error. The majority of enquiries were received from healthcare professionals, but members of the public accounted for 31. 3 % (n = 736) of enquiries. Most medication errors occurred in a domestic setting (n = 2135), but a small number occurred in healthcare facilities: nursing homes (n = 110, 4. 68 %), hospitals (n = 53, 2. 26 %), and general practitioner surgeries (n = 32, 1. 36 %). In children, medication errors with non-prescription pharmaceuticals predominated (n = 722) and anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, anti-bacterials, and <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> <b>preparations</b> were the main pharmaceutical classes involved. Medication errors with prescription medication predominated for adults (n = 866) and the major medication classes included anti-pyretics and non-opioid analgesics, psychoanaleptics, and psychleptic agents. Approximately 97 % (n = 2279) of medication errors were as a result of drug administration errors (comprising a double dose [n = 1040], wrong dose [n = 395], wrong medication [n = 597], wrong route [n = 133], and wrong time [n = 110]). Prescribing and dispensing errors accounted for 0. 68 % (n = 16) and 2. 26 % (n = 53) of errors, respectively. CONCLUSION: Empirical data from poisons information centres facilitate the characterisation of medication errors occurring in the community and across the healthcare spectrum. Poison centre data facilitate the detection of subtle trends in medication errors and can contribute to pharmacovigilance. Collaboration between pharmaceutical manufacturers, consumers, medical, and regulatory communities is needed to advance patient safety and reduce medication errors...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Health is a {{fundamental}} human right. Access to health care, which includes providing a population with safe, effective, good quality drugs at the least possible cost, is a prerequisite to realising that right. Drugs or medicines play {{a fundamental}} role in the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of health care systems. Drugs also constitute a major recurrent expense in both state-run and private sector health care. To ensure that health care workers prescribe the most cost-effective drugs through the essential drugs list, training, as well as evaluation and monitoring systems must be regarded as important elements of containing costs. Pharmaceutical benefit management programmes such as pharmacoeconomics, drug utilisation review (DUR), evidence-based medicine and disease management have emerged as tools to ensure cost-effective selection and use of drugs, particularly for chronic diseases. These managed care tools are often investigated to determine whether new technologies or interventions are appropriate and have "value". Affordable prices of medicines, on their own, however, do not ensure access to medicines. Also important are reliable procurement, distribution and storage systems, and appropriately trained personnel to manage these components of drug management. Poorly regulated drug supply systems can have serious consequences such as antibiotic resistance, problems with safety or quality and most importantly wastage, as it is believed that a significant proportion of drugs purchased by the state in South Africa find their way into the private sector market through a "grey market". The general objective {{of this study was to}} review and analyse the cost and medicine usage of the "top twenty" pharmaceutical products according to the monthly pharmaceutical purchasing reports of the Department of Health in the North West Province. The research can be classified as retrospective and quantitative. The data used for the analysis were obtained over a two-year study period (1 Apr 2000 - 28 Feb 2002) from the private provider operating the medical stores in the North West Province. The results of the empirical investigation, showed the total number of "top twenty" products appearing during the study period amounted to 460 different products having a total purchasing cost of R 66, 263, 674. 51 representing 37. 2 % (n = R 178, 163, 061. 50) of all pharmaceutical products purchased during the two-year period. Through analysis it was found, when classified according the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) therapeutic main group, antihypertensives had the highest quantity purchased for year one (20. 69 %; n = 134, 515, 640) with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> <b>preparations</b> revealing the highest purchasing quantity for year two (40. 55 %; n = 103, 567, 031) of all "top twenty" pharmaceuticals during the study period. Antibacterials for systemic use presented with the highest cost percentages for both years, representing 20. 68 % (n = R 35, 568, 221. 31) and 16. 72 % (n = R 31, 370, 435. 51) respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide presented with the highest purchasing quantity for both years when classified according to chemical substance with, Methyldopa having the highest purchasing cost for year one followed by vaccine Hib-DTP 10 dose vial (Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine-diphtheria, pertusis and tetanus vaccine) for year two. Furthermore it was also found that the majority of the "top twenty" products were in the oral dosage form. Finally it was concluded that drugs used in the treatment of hypertension and cardiac failure were the most utilised in comparison to other "top twenty" products during the study period. Possible misappropriation based on the defined daily dose of the "top twenty" products might have occurred. In completion of this study, recommendations for future research were made. Master...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Over-the-counter (OTC) <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> {{medications}} are marketed widely {{for relief}} of common <b>cold</b> symptoms, <b>and</b> yet studies {{have failed to}} demon-strate a benefit of these medications for young children. In addition, OTC medications {{can be associated with}} significant morbidity and even mortality in both acute overdoses and when administered in correct doses for chronic periods of time. Physicians often do not inquire about OTC medication use, and parents (or other care-givers) often do not perceive OTCs as medications. We present 3 cases of adverse outcomes over a 13 -month period—including 1 death—as a result of OTC <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medication use. We explore the toxicities of OTC <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medications, discuss mechanisms of dosing errors, and suggest why physicians should be more vigilant in specifically inquiring about OTCs when evaluating an ill child.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} paediatric <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines have come under intense scrutiny in several countries including Australia. After issuing the 2009 advisory {{against the use of}} <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines in children under 2 years, on September 1, 2012, the labelling of <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines in children assumed a new status in Australia restricting their use in children less than six years of age. However, no study was conducted in Australia to evaluate the opinion and behaviour of pharmacists regarding this new advisory. This study consisted of a web-based questionnaire sent to members of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia evaluating their behaviour towards the regulatory advisories against the use of <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines in children below the age of six years and focused on knowledge, belief and comfort in recommending these medicines for children in this age range. The majority of pharmacists in this study reported that they use alternative strategies to cough cold medicines when handling request for children with minor ailments in line with current recommendations. Many pharmacists however do perceive these medicines to be safe and effective which could lead to conflicts in their beliefs and the current guidelines surrounding product supply.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{changes in}} the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), non-opioid analgesics <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines <b>and</b> its relation with the use of antibiotics after the over-the-counter (OTC) antibiotic sales restrictions in Mexico and Brazil. IMS Health provided retail quarterly data from the private sectors in Mexico and Brazil from the first quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2013. Data of each active substance of antibiotics, easily accessible medicines perceived as antibiotics substitutes (<b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines, analgesics <b>and</b> NSAIDs-the latter two being combined in the analyses), and medicines to control for external factors that can affect the medicines usage trend (antihypertensives) were converted from kilograms to defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants days (DDD/TID). Interrupted time series were used to estimate changes in level of medicines use at the intervention point and slope after the regulation. The Gregory-Hansen cointegration test was used to explore the relation between the use of antibiotics and perceived substitutes. After the regulation in Mexico NSAIDs-analgesics usage level increased by 1. 1 DDD/TID with a slope increase of 0. 2 DDD/TID per quarter <b>and</b> the <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines usage level increased by 0. 4 DDD/TID. In Brazil NSAIDs-analgesics usage level increased by 1. 9 DDD/TID, <b>and</b> <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines did not change. In the two countries, NSAIDs-analgesics usage changes were related with antibiotic usage changes; in Mexico <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines usage changes had a relation with the antibiotics usage changes. These results showed a substitution effect on the use of other medicines, especially NSAIDs and analgesics, after reinforcement of OTC antibiotics sales restrictions. These regulations aimed to improve the antibiotics use and as a consequence reduce antimicrobial resistance; however, this type of policies should be comprehensive and take into account the potential substitution effects on the use of other medicines...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Based on {{concerns}} about safety and efficacy, international authorities have either advised {{against the use}} of <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medication or considering such action. We aimed to systematically review the evidence for the effectiveness <b>and</b> safety of <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medicines in children. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to identify studies relating to the use of products to treat symptoms of the common cold, influenza or allergic rhinitis, and relating to poisoning or toxicity from unintentional ingestion or overdose in children (< 12 years). Medline, Embase and the Cochrane database were searched. No meta-analysis was undertaken because of the paucity of evidence, multiple medicines available, and the need to consider both effectiveness and safety. Results: Seventy two relevant studies or clinical reports were identified. There was little support for the effectiveness of these medicines for acute cough or the common cold in children. However, the majority of these medicines {{do not appear to be}} highly toxic in children and are not a major cause of severe effects following unintentional poisoning. The common use of these agents does not appear to be responsible for increased deaths in young children. Many cases of toxicity from <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> medications in young children are a result of therapeutic error. Particular medications, including diphenhydramine and codeine, appear to be associated with a high frequency of severe adverse effects and toxicity.

In this thesis I explore different methodological approaches to understanding doctor-patient consultations for URTls. I critically review quantitative and qualitative approaches to URTI consultation research, and explore qualitative discursive approaches through analyses of consultation data. Data comprise 33 video-taped consultations and post-consultation interviews with inner London general practitioners <b>and</b> patients with <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> symptoms, supplemented with ethnographic data. I draw {{from a range of}} discursive methodological approaches including conversation analysis, socio-Iinguistic analysis of institutional talk and discursive psychology. I show how discursive approaches can illuminate the complexity and meaning of doctor-patient interaction, exploring the way that coughing is used by patients as an interactional resource. In a detailed micro-analysis, I show that coughing is associated with interactional problems such as misunderstanding and disagreement, and how it also functions as a resource to assert patients' legitimacy.,. In another detailed analysis, I show that the 'minor' status of <b>coughs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colds</b> (<b>and</b> consequent 'no problem' diagnosis) is associated with interactional difficulty for both doctors and patients: I show how doctors' and patients'legitimacy and 'face' are at stake in a contest to define the meaning of <b>cough</b> <b>and</b> <b>cold</b> symptoms (as significant and treatable, or alternatively, 'no problem'). I discuss conflicts between doctors' and patients' interests: for example, prescribing antibiotics may legitimise the patient but discredit the doctor.. I discuss the way that discourse analytic approaches can contribute richer understandings of doctor-patient interaction through detailed analysis of social transactions in consultation (such as the negotiation of identity and face). I contend that discursive approaches represent valuable and under-utilised resources for research and practice in primary care. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

AIM: To examine lay beliefs about over-the-counter medicines for <b>coughs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colds.</b> To explore whether the distinction between symptom relief and cure has the same relevance to lay people {{as it does to}} medical professionals. DESIGN OF STUDY: Small pilot study using qualitative techniques. SETTING: Variety sample of 11 patients attending the National Health Service walk-in centre, Birmingham, England. METHOD: In-depth semi-structured interviews, including pile-sorting and fictional case histories, were used to explore participants' beliefs about the effects of over-the-counter medicines on <b>coughs</b> <b>and</b> <b>colds.</b> RESULTS: Eight of the 11 participants believed that at least one over the-counter cough medicine (most frequently Benylin for Chesty Coughs) could shorten, or "cure", an illness.
