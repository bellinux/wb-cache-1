5|$|Little brown bats produce {{calls that}} are high {{intensity}} frequency modulated (FM) and that last {{from less than}} one millisecond (ms) to about 5 ms and have a sweep rate of 80–40kHz, with most of their energy at 45kHz. Bats usually emit 20 calls per second when in flight. When pursuing prey, a bat emits 200 calls per second. It also emits a high-pulse repetitive <b>call</b> <b>if</b> it wants to land.|$|E
5|$|The Trost {{brothers}} asked producer Brandon Barrera {{to act in}} {{the short}} film. After seeing their work, Barrera suggested that the brothers expand the premise into a feature film. The filmmakers placed an advertisement in the Mountain Enterprise, the Mountain Communities of the Tejon Pass's newspaper, encouraging community members to <b>call</b> <b>if</b> they wanted to help with locations, catering, donations, or by serving as extras or crew members on the film.|$|E
5|$|These {{monitors}} {{will rise}} {{up on their}} hind legs to check their surroundings, a behavior that has also been documented in Gould's monitors (V.gouldii). They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they will give a warning <b>call</b> <b>if</b> they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E

25|$|The film Bruce Almighty (2003) {{originally}} {{featured a}} number {{that did not have}} the 555 prefix. In the cinematic release, God (Morgan Freeman) leaves 776-2323 on a pager for Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) to <b>call</b> <b>if</b> he needed God's help. The DVD changes this to a 555 number. According to Universal Studios, which produced the movie, the number it used was picked because it did not exist in Buffalo, New York, where the movie was set. However, the number did exist in other cities, resulting in customers' having that number receiving random calls from people asking for God. While some played along with the gag, others found the calls aggravating.|$|E
25|$|One {{well-known}} {{strategy is}} the covered call, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> the stock price rises above the exercise price, the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the stock price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as put-call parity and offers insights for financial theory. A benchmark index {{for the performance of}} a buy-write strategy is the CBOE S 500 BuyWrite Index (ticker symbol BXM).|$|E
25|$|Chicks hatch {{synchronously}} with a dense downy coat. The coloring is white, grey or yellow, {{with dark}} spots {{to aid in}} camouflage. The young are precocial, and can run {{almost as soon as}} they hatch. Soon after hatching the eggs, the male will leave the nest and call the chicks to him with a soft contact <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> threatened, he will freeze and attempt to hide the chicks under his wings or belly. There have been documented cases of females caring for the young; it is thought that this occurs when the male has been killed. Young chicks can feed themselves within the first few days, but the male will bring the food and drop it on {{the ground in front of}} them. The chicks have a high initial mortality rate. However, within a few days they are chasing insects on their own and, at 1–3 weeks, they can fly to branches a metre from the ground. They are self-sufficient within 20 days.|$|E

25|$|In 1198 (or 1199) Vladimir II Yaroslavich of Halych died, and {{his death}} created a {{political}} vacuum {{that a number}} of claimants were eager to fill. Ryurik Rostislavich could now claim that, after the dynasty of Halych became defunct, the territory reverted to the jurisdiction of the prince of Kyiv; the princes of the two branches of the Olgovichi (the princes of Chernigov) could argue that their marriage ties with the defunct dynasty gave them the right to rule Halych; and the Hungarians had already made a bid for the domain ten years earlier. The Galicians asked Ryurik Rostislavich for his son Rostislav Ryurikovich, but Roman rode to Duke Leszek I of Poland (1194–1227), promising to be at his beck and <b>call</b> <b>if</b> the Polish ruler helped him to win Halych. When the citizens refused to welcome Roman, Duke Leszek I besieged the town, and after capturing it, he forced the townspeople to accept Roman as prince. Roman promised to be subservient to the duke of Poland and to live in peace with his new subjects.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, an {{objection}} {{to a request}} for unanimous consent will compel a vote. While forcing a single vote {{may not be an}} effective delaying tool, the cumulative effect of several votes, which take at least 15 minutes apiece, can be substantial. In addition to objecting to routine requests, senators can force votes through motions to adjourn and through quorum calls. Quorum calls are meant to establish {{the presence or absence of}} a constitutional quorum, but senators routinely use them to waste time while waiting for the next speaker to come to the floor or for leaders to negotiate off the floor. In those cases, a senator asks for unanimous consent to dispense with the quorum <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> another senator objects, the clerk must continue to call the roll of senators, just as they would with a vote. If a call shows no quorum, the minority can force another vote by moving to request or compel the attendance of absent senators. Finally, senators can force votes by moving to adjourn, or by raising specious points of order and appealing the ruling of the chair.|$|E

Till joined fellow League Two club Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 15 January 2009, having made 21 {{appearances}} and scored two goals for Grimsby {{up to that point}} during the season. He made his debut in a 3–1 victory at Chester on 17 January 2009 and in February the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after impressing manager Lee Richardson. Grimsby released him on 30 April 2009 and in retrospect he commented [...] "It has been a wake-up <b>call</b> <b>if</b> I am honest.

500|$|The adult red-throated loon has {{a number}} of vocalisations, which are used in {{different}} circumstances. In flight, when passing conspecifics or circling its own pond, it gives a series of rapid yet rhythmic goose-like cackles—kaa-kaa-kaa or kak-kak-kak, at roughly five calls per second. Its warning <b>call,</b> <b>if</b> disturbed by humans or onshore predators, is a short croaking bark. A low-pitched moaning call, used primarily as a contact call between mates and between parents and young, but also during copulation, is made with the bill closed. The species also has a short wailing call—aarOOao...aarOOao...—which descends slightly in pitch and lasts about a second; due to strong harmonics surrounding the primary pitch, this meowing call is more musical than its other calls. Another call—a harsh, pulsed cooing that rises and falls in pitch, and is typically repeated up to 10times in a row—is used in territorial encounters and pair-bonding, and by parent birds encouraging their young to move on land between bodies of water. Known as the [...] "long call", it is often given in duet, which is unusual among the loons; the female's contribution is longer and softer than her mate's.|$|E

2500|$|A {{dead heat}} is a tie between two or, rarely, more horses in a race. The {{terminology}} originally came from when horses used to race in matches consisting of heats, rather than single races, {{and the first}} horse winning two heats was declared {{the winner of the}} match. When the judges could not determine the first horse over the finish line, the heat was declared [...] "dead", and did not count. Usually, a photo finish can determine the winner, but at times it is too close to <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> there is a dead heat, wagers are paid on all winning horses, but against half the original stake (or one-third if there were three tied horses, and so on).

Nmap calls this mode connect scan, named after the Unix connect (...) system <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> a port is open, the operating system completes the TCP three-way handshake, and the port scanner immediately closes the connection to avoid performing a Denial-of-service attack. Otherwise an error code is returned. This scan mode has the advantage that the user does not require special privileges. However, using the OS network functions prevents low-level control, so this scan type is less common. This method is [...] "noisy", particularly if it is [...] a [...] "portsweep": the services can log the sender IP address and Intrusion detection systems can raise an alarm.|$|E
2500|$|Performance and {{continuity}} calls: The existing contract stated that stagehands could only perform work {{related to the}} performance during a performance <b>call.</b> <b>If</b> the producer wishes the stagehand to perform other duties, the producer must issue a one-hour [...] "continuity call," [...] even if the stagehand has no more work to do. If the one-hour continuity call is not long enough, producers are required {{to pay for a}} four-hour shift. Producers call the rule wasteful, but the union claimed the rule discouraged theaters from forcing employees to work past midnight. The union also noted that many stagehands supplement their income with daytime jobs, and late nights significantly interfere with these arrangements. Producers proposed widening the tasks stagehands may perform during performance calls and reducing the required four hours of pay. The union had agreed to discuss reducing the required four hours of pay in exchange for improving other benefits.|$|E
2500|$|As the American {{operation}} commenced, light scout helicopters flew {{ahead of}} the strike force at low level to detect opponents or draw their fire. Above the scouts, the helicopter gunships would lurk, ready to pounce on enemy movement, fire or fortifications. Behind and below the gunships came the [...] "slicks." [...] These transport choppers would sometimes carry [...] "people sniffer" [...] technology designed to detect chemical traces or fumes left from human waste, smoke or sweat- [...] indicators that Communist troops might be hiding nearby. People sniffing often required steady low altitude flying to improve reliability of results. Once VC/NVA were detected, hiding places might be saturated with tear gas. If flushed out, the enemy was attacked by the gunships, and the transports began to land infantry to surround the target and seal off escape routes. Artillery firebases would then begin their fires to smash the opposition, bombard exit routes and provide cover for the American infantry. US troops on such [...] "jitterbug" [...] operations did not usually drive home attacks with direct assault, but sealed the enemy in a ring, while he was worked over by artillery and gunship strikes. Fixed-wing aircraft were on <b>call</b> <b>if</b> needed. This [...] "surround and pound" [...] approach substituted metal for men, and lowered US casualties, but was not without cost.|$|E
