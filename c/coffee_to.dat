5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> 35,500people. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Rick had a {{temporary}} economic impact when, during its time off {{the shore of}} Chiapas and Oaxaca, it caused the price of <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> rise 4.7 percent to $1.5685 per pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest total it reached since October 16. Mexico is the United States's largest source of coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

When Leslie refuses {{to hand over the}} opossum, Evelyn angrily takes back her promise of a favor from the mayor's office. Andy, still oblivious to the reasons behind April's jealousy, delivers <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> April, as well as the day's newspaper, containing a story which credits April for providing moral support to Andy.

5|$|PEARL {{brought a}} {{specialty}} coffee expert to Rwanda, who {{put them in}} touch with a seller, Louisiana-based Community <b>Coffee,</b> <b>to</b> help market Maraba. They sent samples to Louisiana, and in June 2002 a representative from Community visited Maraba. Rwandan president Paul Kagame was also present, as the government placed great importance on the project. Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were roasted and blended into one of the company's gourmet coffees. This was the first direct contract between an American roaster and an African coffee cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, the Philippine Air Force were mobilized to help deliver {{supplies}} and aid in {{search and rescue}} missions. On July24, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared that the National Disaster Coordinating Council would provide assistance to citizens affected by the typhoon. The president requested P134million (PHP, $2.5million USD) for farmers to buy new seeds, and P35million (PHP, $650,000 USD) to rebuild the hard-hit Cagayan Valley, where Arroyo visited days after the storm struck. The government ultimately spent about P24million (PHP, $435,000 USD) in emergency aid for relocating storm victims, search and rescue operations, and assistance. In Mindanao, officials prepared 800bags of rice and various other food supplies due to the storm. Power and water outages persisted across Luzon {{for up to three}} weeks, causing many factories otherwise undamaged to close. In Isabela province, 25Tzu Chi volunteers provided supplies to 2,873houses. The Philippine government provided rice, sardines, and <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> many affected houses. Damaged houses were supposed to receive 1,000pesos, although few received the monetary aid. In the town of San Mariano in Isabela province, most farmers incurred more debt and continued their same general farming practice, despite sustaining heavy losses from the storm.|$|E
5|$|The coffee {{farmers of}} Maraba first needed a washing station to remove sugar from the coating {{of the coffee}} bean, under the skin. If this sugar is not removed within 12 hours of picking, the flavour of the coffee is impaired. They built the first station in July 2001 in the Cyarumbo sector, close to the main road, with funding from UNR, the Office des Cultures Industrielles du Rwanda (OCIR-Café), ACDI/VOCA, and the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR). The opening {{was late in the}} harvest season, so only 200kilograms (441lb) of that year's harvest were {{suitable}} for washing. However, the results were reasonably good, and the station was upgraded to allow more <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> be processed in 2002. To bring mineral water from Mount Huye to the upgraded station, ACDI/VOCA helped fund a pipeline, which opened in March 2002.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{news of the}} storm, {{businesses}} in West Palm Beach boarded up vulnerable, expensive plate glass windows. Fearing flooding, authorities were empowered by Florida governor David Sholtz to evacuate over 4,200–5,000 residents, {{most of whom were}} black farm workers, from low-lying areas around Lake Okeechobee to elevated locations. Most of the evacuees left by train, prompted by fears of washouts on the track beds. Aday before the storm, the lake level reached , heightening officials' concerns about flooding and spurring the evacuations. Several railway companies lent free transport to their passengers, and trains were conveniently stationed around the lake. The evacuations took place in the communities of Belle Glade, Pahokee, Canal Point, Okeechobee, and Clewiston. Relief organizations and local mayors distributed milk, biscuits, and <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> evacuees. On the west coast of the state, some residents covered their windows, but many others did not, anticipating little damage from the weak storm. Citizens received radio updates from the Weather Bureau, which gave the position and movement of the storm. Some beachfront residents, such as in Sarasota, left their homes for safety, while boaters secured their vessels.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{independence}} in 1821, Costa Rica had found no regular trade routes for its coffee in European markets. This {{was compounded by}} transportation problems.

25|$|Coffee is best {{stored in}} an {{airtight}} container made of ceramic, glass, or non-reactive metal. Higher quality prepackaged coffee usually has a one-way valve which prevents air from entering while allowing the <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> release gases. Coffee freshness and flavor is preserved when it is stored away from moisture, heat, and light. The ability of <b>coffee</b> <b>to</b> absorb strong smells from food means that it should be kept away from such smells. Storage of coffee in the refrigerator is not recommended due to the presence of moisture which can cause deterioration. Exterior walls of buildings which face the sun may heat the interior of a home, and this heat may damage coffee stored near such a wall. Heat from nearby ovens also harms stored coffee.|$|E
