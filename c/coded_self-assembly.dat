40|$|An {{idea is not}} a {{replicator}} {{because it}} does not consist of <b>coded</b> <b>self-assembly</b> instructions. It may retain structure as it passes from one individual to another, but does not replicate it. The cultural replicator is not an idea but an associatively-structured network of them that together form an internal model of the world, or worldview. A worldview is a primitive, uncoded replicator, like the autocatalytic sets of polymers widely believed to be the earliest form of life. Primitive replicators generate self-similar structure, but because the process happens in a piecemeal manner, through bottom-up interactions rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low fidelity, and acquired characteristics are inherited. Just as polymers catalyze reactions that generate other polymers, the retrieval of an item from memory can in turn trigger other items, thus cross-linking memories, ideas, and concepts into an integrated conceptual structure. Worldviews evolve idea by idea, largely through social exchange. An idea participates in the evolution of culture by revealing certain aspects of the worldview that generated it, thereby affecting the worldviews of those exposed to it. If an idea influences seemingly unrelated fields {{this does not mean that}} separate cultural lineages are contaminating one another, because it is worldviews, not ideas, that are the basic unit of cultural evolution...|$|E

40|$|The {{argument}} that heritable epigenetic change plays a distinct role in evolution would be strengthened through recognition {{that it is}} what bootstrapped the origin and early evolution of life, and like behavioral and symbolic change, is non-Darwinian. The mathematics of natural selection, a population-level process, is limited to replication with negligible individual-level change, i. e. that uses a <b>self-assembly</b> <b>code...</b>|$|R
40|$|Dawkins' replicator-based {{conception}} of evolution {{has led to}} widespread mis-application selectionism across the social sciences {{because it does not}} address the paradox that inspired the theory of natural selection in the first place: how do organisms accumulate change when traits acquired over their lifetime are obliterated? This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a self-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a <b>self-assembly</b> <b>code</b> that is used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to construct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant to ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime is not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during copying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for discarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude faster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential replication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist but not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of life suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred to as communal exchange that does not involve a <b>self-assembly</b> <b>code,</b> and that natural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary process. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate evolutionary framework for culture than selectionism. This is supported by a computational model of cultural evolution and a network-based program for documenting material cultural history, and it is consistent with high levels of human cooperation.

40|$|The polytopic ligand 1 {{contains}} {{three different}} metal ion binding subunits forming two substructures that <b>code</b> for the <b>self-assembly</b> {{of two different}} coordination structures (helicate and grid type) under metal ion complexation. Reaction with Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions generates the coordinatively unsaturated architectures 8 and 9 resulting from the formation of two double helicate arrangements. Their crystal structure has been determined by x-ray diffraction. These {{results show that the}} double helical motif is expressed {{at the expense of the}} grid type one, indicating the dominant/recessive behavior of the system. Together with earlier studies on the linear combination and crossover processing schemes, the dominant/recessive generation of 8 and 9 completes the demonstration of principle of the modes of multiple expression of molecular information in a multicode programmed chemical system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} clarifies five misunderstandings about {{cultural}} evolution identified by Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson (2008). First, cultural representations are neither discrete nor continuous; they are distributed across neurons that respond to microfeatures. This enables associations to be made, and cultural change to be generated. Second, 'replicator dynamics' do not ensure natural selection. The replicator notion does not capture {{the distinction between}} actively interpreted <b>self-assembly</b> <b>code</b> and passively copied self-description, {{which leads to a}} fundamental principle of natural selection: inherited information is transmitted, whereas acquired information is not. Third, this principle is violated in culture by the ubiquity of acquired change. Moreover, biased transmission is less important to culture than the creative processes by which novelty is generated. Fourth, there is no objective basis for determining cultural fitness. Fifth, the necessity of randomness is discussed. It is concluded that natural selection is inappropriate as an explanatory framework for culture. Comment: 23 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1206. 438...|$|R
40|$|The improbability of a spontaneously {{generated}} self-assembling molecule {{has suggested}} that life began {{with a set of}} simpler, collectively replicating elements, such as an enclosed autocatalytic set of polymers (or protocell). Since replication occurs without a <b>self-assembly</b> <b>code,</b> acquired characteristics are inherited. Moreover, there is no strict distinction between alive and dead; one can only infer that a protocell was alive if it replicates. These features of early life render natural selection inapplicable to the description of its change-of-state because they defy its underlying assumptions. Moreover, natural selection describes only randomly generated novelty; it cannot describe the emergence of form at the interface between organism and environment. Self-organization is also inadequate because it is restricted to interactions amongst parts; it too cannot account for context-driven change. A modified version of selection theory or self-organization would not work because the description of change-of-state through interaction with an incompletely specified context has a completely different mathematical structure, i. e. entails a non-Kolmogorovian probability model. It is proposed that the evolution of early life is appropriately described as lineage transformation through context-driven actualization of potential (CAP), with self-organized change-of-state being a special case of no contextual influence, and competitive exclusion of less fit individuals through a selection-like process possibly (but not necessarily) playing a secondary role. It is argued that natural selection {{played an important role in}} evolution only after genetically mediated replication was established.
