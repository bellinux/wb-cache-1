5|$|A Christmas truce {{memorial}} {{was unveiled}} in Frelinghien, France, on 11 November 2008. Also on that day, {{at the spot}} where, on Christmas Day 1914, their regimental ancestors <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> their trenches to play football, men from the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welch Fusiliers played a football match with the German Battalion 371. The Germans won 2–1.|$|E

Through a Sindebele interpreter, Rudd introduced {{himself and the}} others, explained on whose behalf they acted, said they had come for an amiable sojourn, and presented the king with a gift of £100.|$|E
5|$|Failing {{to reach}} their initial {{destination}} of Tobago due to light winds and strong currents, Low's depleted fleet made it to Grenada, a French-owned island. Hiding most of his men belowdecks, he was permitted to send men ashore for water. The following day, a French sloop was sent out to investigate, but was captured when Low's men <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> hiding. Low, now commanding the captured sloop (renamed the Ranger), gave the schooner Squirrel to Spriggs, now his quartermaster, who renamed it the Delight before sailing away {{in the middle of}} the night with a small crew following a disagreement with Low over the disciplining of one of Spriggs' crew.|$|E

5|$|Chavo Guerrero went on {{to defend}} the WWE Cruiserweight Championship in a Cruiserweight Open at The Great American Bash against Jimmy Wang Yang, Jamie Noble, Funaki, and Shannon Moore. Hornswoggle also entered the match at the bell, but {{immediately}} escaped the ring and hid under it. With all of the cruiserweights down, {{with the exception of}} Noble, Hornswoggle <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under the ring and delivered a Tadpole Splash to Noble. He pinned him afterwards to win the match and the Cruiserweight Championship. Candice Michelle and Melina continued to feud over the WWE Women's Championship. The two had a rematch at The Great American Bash for the title. Michelle pinned Melina after delivering a Candy Wrapper to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> {{the back of the}} offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant du Plooy led his {{men around}} the bend, {{carefully}} keeping them behind cover, then sent Coey {{out into the}} open riverbed to give treatment. With his Red Cross flag clearly visible, Coey <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> cover and made for the bodies on the ground. The concealed cadres immediately opened fire and fatally shot him through the head. His lifeless body fell at du Plooy's feet. Coey was the first American fatality of the Rhodesian Bush War. The contact in which he died eventually ended with du Plooy and two other Rhodesians being wounded and a further Rhodesian soldier, Corporal Jannie de Beer, being killed. The insurgents escaped without any further loss to their number.|$|E

5|$|Scenes not {{involving}} the main apartments were all filmed in London {{during the week}} beginning March 30, 1998. Location shooting was done mostly for scenes featuring Joey and Chandler; outside the London Marriott, Grosvenor Square, {{and the top of}} an open-top London bus as it crosses Tower Bridge (this scene was excised from the final cut but features in the opening titles of the next episode). Interiors, such as the restaurant, the Waltham's hallway and the hotel rooms, were all filmed on purpose-built sets at The Fountain Studios, Wembley. The reaction from the audience when Monica <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under Chandler's bed covers meant the actors had to hold their position for 27 seconds. When filming ran late one evening, the production team ordered pizzas for the audience.|$|E
5|$|The royalists {{under the}} command of Prince Mohamed's {{objective}} was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack {{with the help of the}} Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi. On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> behind the rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the legends}} of the Muisca, mankind {{originated}} in Lake Iguaque, Monquirá, when the goddess Bachué <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the lake with a boy in her arms. When the boy grew, they populated the Earth. They are considered the ancestors of the human race. Finally, they disappeared unto the lake {{in the shape of}} snakes.|$|E

50|$|By 2013, Baner had {{returned}} as drummer {{for the release}} of the band's fourth studio album, <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>From</b> Where You Hide. <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>From</b> Where You Hide featured professionally-recorded versions of several of the songs first heard on Lucid Dreams, as well as several songs that had not been previously recorded. <b>Come</b> <b>Out</b> <b>From</b> Where You Hide displays strong influence from Carton's travels to France and Africa. Carton (who wrote all fifteen songs for the album) also made an effort to vary the construction of the music and include diverse topics - not just love songs. The attempts at variety were praised, and the songs were once again compared to musical theater, but as with Hidden Deep in the Green, critics found the songs to be too much alike.|$|R
25|$|After the {{campaign}} {{in the fall of}} 1812, Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington's army was in poor shape, with 18,000 soldiers on the sick list. On the other hand, {{the campaign}} resulted in the capture of the cities of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Astorga, and Seville, and the provinces of Andalusia, Asturias, and Extremadura. Also, 5,000 new replacements <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July, the Russian fleet, under Admiral Peter Khanykov, <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> Kronstadt. The Swedes massed a fleet under Swedish Admiral Cederstrom, {{consisting}} of 11 line-of-battle ships and five frigates at Örö and Jungfrusund to oppose them. On 16 August, Saumarez then sent Centaur and Implacable, under Captain Thomas Byam Martin, also a 74-gun third rate, {{to join the}} Swedish fleet. They chased two Russian frigates on 19 July and joined the Swedes the following day.|$|E
25|$|The eclipse {{generated}} {{reports of}} abnormal behavior in {{animal and plant}} life. Some farm animals including domestic chickens <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> under their coops and began grooming, usually an evening activity. Horses also displayed increased whinnying, running, and jumping after the event. Cicadas were reported to grow louder before going silent during totality. Various birds were also observed flying in unusually large formations. Flowers such as the Hibiscus closed their petals which typically happens at night, before opening again after the solar event.|$|E

25|$|The police, Aboriginal {{trackers}} {{and others}} watched the surrounded hotel throughout the night. At about 5 {{o'clock in the}} morning the landlady, Mrs Jones, began loudly wailing over the fate of her son, who {{had been shot in the}} back. She <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> the hotel crying bitterly and wandered into the bush on several occasions. With the assistance of one of the prisoners she removed her son from the building, and sent him to Wangaratta for treatment. The firing continued intermittently. Bullets lodged in the station buildings and the train.|$|E
25|$|At {{around that}} time, June Keithley {{received}} reports that Marcos had left Malacañang Palace and broadcast {{this to the}} people at EDSA. The crowd celebrated and even Ramos and Enrile <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> Crame to appear to the crowds. The jubilation was however short-lived as Marcos later appeared on television on the government-controlled Channel 4, (using the foreclosed ABS-CBN facilities, transmitter and compound) declaring {{that he would not}} step down. It was thereafter speculated that the false report was a calculated move against Marcos to encourage more defections.|$|E
25|$|It was not {{immediately}} clear that Provenzano had succeeded Riina. He had not been publicly seen since 1963, and when {{his wife and two}} grown sons <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> hiding in 1992, many then suspected that Provenzano was dead, from natural causes or otherwise. Informants subsequently claimed otherwise, saying that after Riina's arrest in 1993, Provenzano became the boss of the Corleonesi. It is said that two other mobsters, Leoluca Bagarella and Giovanni Brusca, challenged his leadership, but, even if they succeeded, they were both captured and imprisoned in 1995 and 1996 respectively.|$|E

25|$|Triton, {{the fastest}} {{of the three}} British frigates, led the chase. The next morning she struck some rocks {{as she tried to}} prevent her quarry from {{reaching}} port. Triton got off the rocks and resumed the chase despite taking on water. She and Alcmene then exchanged fire with the Spanish frigate, which surrendered before Naiad could catch up. Four large Spanish ships <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> Vigo but then retreated when the three British frigates made ready to receive them. Alcmene had one man killed and nine wounded, and Triton had one man wounded; Santa Brigida had two men killed and eight men wounded.|$|E
25|$|The Second Book of Enoch {{contains}} a section, called Exaltation of Melchizedek, {{which says that}} Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> his mother after she had died {{and sat on the}} bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel Gabriel (Michael in some manuscripts) to the Garden of Eden and was thus preserved from the Deluge without having to be in Noah's Ark.|$|E
25|$|Following Tibet's {{invasion}} by China in 1959, Chagdud Tulku escaped along with Khenpo Dorje to India, after enduring hunger, and many dangers, where {{it looked like}} they would be captured. His route took him through the Pemakö region of Tibet, and his party <b>came</b> <b>out</b> <b>from</b> there into the Indian state of Nagaland. In India Rinpoche lived {{in a number of}} Tibetan refugee resettlement camps ─ Kalimpong, Odisha, Dalhousie, Bir, Himachal Pradesh, and Delhi. He practiced traditional Tibetan medicine, and was much in demand as his fellow refugees had trouble coping with the heat, and subtropical diseases found in India.|$|E
