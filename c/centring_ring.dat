50|$|Stadsroutes (city routes) form {{a network}} of {{numbered}} arterials that connect parts of a city to a ring road or motorways running outside the city. City routes are signposted prefixed by an s and numbered from 100 or 101. When there is an s 100 present, it is an inner city ring road around the city centre.

25|$|As {{styles of}} {{performance}} have developed {{since the time}} of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed. The earliest modern circuses were performed in open air structures with limited covered seating. From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a <b>centre</b> <b>ring,</b> and sometimes a stage. The 'traditional' large tents, commonly known as 'Big Tops' were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues. These tents eventually became the most common venue and remain so to the present day. Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos. Many circus performances are still held in a ring usually 13m (42ft) in diameter. This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a Two-Step {{approach}} that sequentially adjusts generation and distribution {{values of the}} (dynamic) OD matrix. While the proposed methodology already provided excellent results for updating demand flows on a motorway, {{the aim of this}} paper is to validate this conclusion on a real network: Luxembourg City. This network represents the typical middle-sized European city in terms of network dimension. Moreover, Luxembourg City has the typical structure of a metropolitan area, composed of a city <b>centre,</b> <b>ring,</b> and suburb areas. An innovative element {{of this paper is to}} use mobile network data to create a time-dependent profile of the generated demand inside and outside the ring. To support the claim that the model is ready for practical implementation, it is interfaced with PTV Visum, one of the most widely adopted software tools for traffic analysis. Results of these experiments provide a solid empirical ground in order to further develop this model and to understand if its assumptions hold for urban scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{determine}} {{the design of the}} Circular Transmission Line Model (CTLM) in order to ensure accurate results are obtained. The CTLM is used to measure the specific contact resistance of a metalsemiconductor barrier. Through analytical modelling {{it has been shown that}} the accuracy of the measurements obtained using a particular CTLM pattern, depends on the geometry chosen. By determining which geometries will yield the most sensitive measurement will ensure an accurate result when compared to the sheet resistance and specific contact resistance of an ohmic contact sample. Analysis of the equations reveals that for any given sample a smaller geometry is preferable. This is determined by comparing the differential of specific contact resistance of the sample with the contact end resistance of the test structure. It has been found that for confident results to be obtained then the annular (<b>centre)</b> <b>ring</b> of the structure should be as narrow as is possible within testing constraint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract.

Similarly, the <b>centre</b> of the <b>ring</b> of BP operations is the corresponding ring for the Adams sum-mand of p-local connective complex K-theory. Here we show that, in the additive unstable context, this result holds with BP replaced by BP 〈n〉 for any n. Thus, for all chromatic heights, the only central operations are those coming from K-theory. 1...|$|R
5000|$|When {{there are}} no enemy discs on the board, many (but not all) rules also state that a player must shoot for {{the centre of the}} board, and a shot disc must finish either {{completely}} inside the 15-point guarded ring line, or (depending on the specifics of the rules) be inside or touching this line. This is often called the [...] "no hiding" [...] rule, since it prevents players from placing their first shots where their opponent must traverse completely though the guarded <b>centre</b> <b>ring</b> to hit them and avoid fouling. When playing without this rule, a player may generally make any shot desired, and as long as a disc remains completely inside the outer line of the playfield, it remains on the board. During any shot, any disc that falls completely into the recessed central [...] "20" [...] hole (a.k.a. the [...] "Toad" [...] or [...] "Dukie") is removed from play, and counts as twenty points for the owner of the disc {{at the end of the}} round, assuming the shot is valid.|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the structural integrity analysis of a low pressure (LP) turbine with transverse cracking. Cracks are initiated in the <b>centre</b> <b>ring</b> keyway of the shaft by a fretting mechanism and propagate during barring operation. The cracks arrest during normal operation when they are still relatively shallow. The aim of the calculations is to predict the transition where cracks start propagating by high cycle fatigue during normal operation of the shaft. Most influencing factors, including continuum mechanics, mathematical modelling, material behaviour, service loads and industry experience, {{are studied in detail}} as a precursor to the case study. The calculated results show that the case study is an example where the application of fracture mechanics on the crack-free stress field leads to erroneous results. There is a significant redistribution of stress {{in the presence of the}} crack so that the actual stress ratio, as calculated from three dimensional cracked models, varies significantly compared to the crack-free model. Calculated results, together with carefully researched material properties, confirm the postulated crack growth during barring operation and predict limiting crack sizes where high cycle fatigue would ensue during normal operation. The case study concludes that the shaft has a significant remaining life and that it can be returned to service with periodic non-destructive examinations...|$|R
