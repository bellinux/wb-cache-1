40|$|Proefskrif [...] PU vir CHOAfrikaans-speaking {{people often}} {{claim that the}} {{education}} in South Africa is <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> or <b>Christian</b> and <b>national.</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> inclined parents are entitled to complete <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education for their children. This thesis is an inquiry into the degree in which <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> principles are already implemented in South Africa and what must still be done to comply with Acts 39 / 67 and 73 / 69. It is necessary in advance to ascertain what <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education must be if the Bible and available relevant sources in the principles of education and philosophy are consulted. A study covering this subject was conducted. At the same time an inquiry {{was made into a}} variety of doctrines which influence the world educational scene, to ascertain if their teachings fit in with <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education or not. Part I of this thesis is a concise interpretation of the main principles of <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education. In part II the following is done: 1. An historical inquiry into the aspects of <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education already implemented or removed by legislation. 2. To evaluate the present state of affairs an empirical inquiry by way of a, questionnaire was conducted. The results of this indicate that certain <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> principles are evident to a degree, but differ from school to school, while in most cases much must still be done to implement <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> principles completely. 3. The last chapter deals with recommendations. The most important of these are: * Differentiation according to religious convictions {{in order to make it}} possible for children of <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> parents to have complete <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education. * Integration of Bible principles with everything the <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> pupil learns or does. * More study and research concerning <b>Christian</b> <b>national</b> education.

5000|$|The {{group had}} {{its roots in the}} <b>National</b> <b>Christian</b> <b>Union,</b> formed in 1922 by Cuza and the famed {{physiologist}} Nicolae Paulescu. This group morphed in to the LANC in 1923. The swastika became the symbol of Cuza's movement and appeared in its publications, booklets and electoral programs. Cuza claimed that the symbol was purely Romanian in character and denied that LANC had copied the Nazi party's symbol. [...] The LANC became associated with extreme anti-Semitism, calling for a gradual withdrawal of rights for Jews which would include the withdrawal of political rights for all Jews, the withdrawal of citizenship for most and a gradual policy of reapportionment of Jewish land and businesses. In order to accomplish this they hoped to begin by excluding Jews from the professions and the upper echelons of the armed forces. By 1927, the party banner became the flag of Romania with a swastika in the centre. Much of LANC's ideas were framed within theological arguments which were created by Nichifor Crainic, who served as Secretary General of the group.|$|R
