5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> with that depth.|$|E
5|$|The K–Pg {{boundary}} {{represents one}} of the most dramatic turnovers in the fossil record for various calcareous nanoplankton that formed the calcium deposits that gave the Cretaceous its name. The turnover in this group is <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> at the species level. Statistical analysis of marine losses at this time suggests that the decrease in diversity was caused more by a sharp increase in extinctions, than by a decrease in speciation. The K–Pg boundary record of dinoflagellates is not so well understood, mainly because only microbial cysts provide a fossil record, and not all dinoflagellate species have cyst-forming stages, thereby, likely causing diversity to be underestimated. Recent studies indicate that there were no major shifts in dinoflagellates through the boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E

50|$|The town church, called San Martine Ocoxochitepec, is {{an amalgam}} {{of a number of}} {{different}} styles, but its atrium <b>clearly</b> <b>marks</b> its beginnings in the 16th century. It was last remodeled in 1975.|$|R
5|$|The ground {{offensive}} in Glina commenced {{with a single}} SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station. This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe {{that they were being}} fired on by the Croatian police, inducing them to fire at the police station. The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station, which was in turn fired upon by the JNA. A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene. Following consultations with Vasiljković, the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards Viduševac, where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church, before turning to approach the police station from a different direction. The assault, supported by mortar fire, continued until the following day. The police station was captured on 27 July at 11:08. According to SAO Krajina military reports, 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting. Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others, as well as the deaths of two civilians, including a German journalist killed by sniper fire. The killed journalist, Egon Scotland, a reporter of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> car, when he was fatally wounded. The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to Viduševac.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits {{to the next level}} which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At the beginning of the game, shops are visible and are <b>clearly</b> <b>marked</b> with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key to the next level, to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E

50|$|Robert Gordon's (1580-1661) {{map shows}} the loch and two inflows and Jan Jansen's 1659 map shows the loch clearly. Roy's map of 1747-55 <b>clearly</b> <b>marks</b> the loch {{and the nearby}} mill, the Garroch Burn running into the Cessnock Water close to Carnell Castle.|$|R

25|$|The Weights and Measures Act of 1824 was {{initially}} {{scheduled to go}} into effect on 1 May 1825. However, the Weights and Measures Act of 1825 pushed back the date to 1 January 1826.

25|$|Inadequate fire exits. Full {{occupancy}} of {{the entire}} complex {{was estimated to be}} roughly 2,750, which under Kentucky law would require 27.5 exits.

Towerlands can {{be confused with the}} Tour estate in Kilmaurs, East Ayrshire.|$|R
