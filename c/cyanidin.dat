5|$|Ideain (<b>cyanidin</b> 3-O-galactoside) is an anthocyanin, {{a type of}} pigment, {{which is}} found in some red apple cultivars.|$|E
25|$|Red-fleshed peaches {{are rich}} in anthocyanins, {{particularly}} <b>cyanidin</b> glucosides in six peach and six nectarine cultivars and malvin glycosides in clingstone peaches.|$|E
25|$|Most {{frequently}} {{occurring in}} nature are the glycosides of <b>cyanidin,</b> delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, and petunidin. Roughly 2% of all hydrocarbons fixed in photosynthesis are converted into flavonoids and their derivatives, {{such as the}} anthocyanins. Not all land plants contain anthocyanin; in the Caryophyllales (including cactus, beets, and amaranth), they are replaced by betalains. Anthocyanins and betalains have never {{been found in the}} same plant.|$|E
40|$|Overconsumption {{of energy}} dense foods and {{sedentary}} lifestyle are considered as major causes of obesity-associated insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Results from both cohort studies and randomized trials suggested that anthocyanins from berries may lower metabolic risks, however these reports are equivocal. The {{present study was}} designed to examine effects of six berries with structurally diverse anthocyanin profiles (normalized to 400 µg/g total anthocyanin content) on development of metabolic risk factors in the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse model of polygenic obesity. Diets supplemented with blackberry (mono-glycosylated <b>cyanidins),</b> black raspberry (acylated mono-glycosylated <b>cyanidins),</b> blackcurrant (mono- and di-glycosylated <b>cyanidins</b> and delphinidins), maqui berry (di-glycosylated delphinidins), Concord grape (acylated mono-glycosylated delphinidins and petunidins), and blueberry (mono-glycosylated delphinidins, malvidins, and petunidins) showed a prominent discrepancy between biological activities of delphinidin/malvidin-versus cyanidin-type anthocyanins that could be explained by differences in their structure and metabolism in the gut. Consumption of berries also resulted in a strong shift in the gastrointestinal bacterial communities towards obligate anaerobes that correlated with decrease in the gastrointestinal luminal oxygen and oxidative stress. Further work is needed to understand mechanisms that lead to nearly anoxic conditions in the gut lumens, including the relative contributions of host, diet and/or microbial oxidative activity, and their implication to human health...|$|R
50|$|Raspberries contain phytochemicals, such as {{anthocyanin}} pigments, ellagic acid, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic acid, <b>cyanidins,</b> pelargonidins, catechins, kaempferol and salicylic acid. Yellow raspberries {{and others}} with pale-colored fruits are lower in anthocyanin content. Both yellow and red raspberries contain carotenoids, mostly lutein esters, but these are masked by anthocyanins in red raspberries.|$|R

2500|$|The {{distinctive}} dark flesh {{color is}} due to the presence of anthocyanins, a family of antioxidant pigments common to many flowers and fruit, but uncommon in citrus fruits. Chrysanthemin (<b>cyanidin</b> 3-O-glucoside) is the main compound found in red oranges. The flesh develops its characteristic maroon color when the fruit develops with low temperatures during the night. [...] Sometimes, dark coloring is seen on the exterior of the rind, as well, depending on the variety of blood orange. The skin can be tougher and harder to peel than that of other oranges. Blood oranges have a unique flavor profile compared to other oranges, being distinctly raspberry-like in addition to the usual citrus notes.|$|E
2500|$|The Leguminosae {{are rarely}} cyanogenic, however, where they are, the cyanogenic {{compounds}} {{are derived from}} tyrosine, phenylalanine or leucine. They frequently contain alkaloids. Proanthocyanidins can be present either as <b>cyanidin</b> or delphinidine or {{both at the same}} time. [...] Flavonoids such as kaempferol, quercitin and myricetin are often present. Ellagic acid has never been found in any of the genera or species analysed. [...] Sugars are transported within the plants in the form of sucrose. C3 photosynthesis has been found {{in a wide variety of}} genera. The family has also evolved a unique chemistry. Many legumes contain toxic and indigestible substances which may be removed through various processing methods. Pterocarpans are a class of molecules (derivatives of isoflavonoids) found only in the Fabaceae.|$|E
50|$|Blackberries rank highly among fruits for {{in vitro}} {{antioxidant}} strength, particularly {{because of their}} dense content of polyphenolic compounds, such as ellagic acid, tannins, ellagitannins, quercetin, gallic acid, anthocyanins, and <b>cyanidins.</b> One report placed blackberry {{at the top of}} more than 1000 polyphenol-rich foods consumed in the United States, but this concept of a health benefit from consuming darkly colored foods like blackberries remains scientifically unverified and not accepted for health claims on food labels.|$|R
40|$|Cameo apples stored under high CO 2 levels {{suffer from}} “skin burning”. Accordingly, {{this study is}} aimed to {{correlate}} the incidence of skin burning with different polyphenols. After harvest, apples were sorted into bad- and good-colored fruit and further stored under either high (3 %) or low (0. 7 %) CO 2 level. At frequent intervals, fruit were assessed for incidence of skin burning and relative concentrations of various polyphenols. Results clearly show that bad-colored apples stored under high CO 2 level had the highest incidence percentage. Concerning the polyphenol profile, good-colored and healthy apples had significantly higher concentrations of certain polyphenols, including cyanidin- 3 -galactoside and rutin. However, bad-colored and injured apples had significantly higher concentrations of another set of polyphenols, including phloridzin, epicatechin, and (epi) catechin→(epi) catechin isomers. Taking into account that quercetins and <b>cyanidins</b> {{account for more than}} 80 % of antioxidants, it is logical to assume that these polyphenols might give protection to good-colored apples against skin burning...|$|R
40|$|Chronic low-grade {{inflammation}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in the pathogenesis of obesity, due to its associated chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases and cancer. Thus, targeting inflammation is an attractive strategy to counter the burden of obesity-induced health problems. Recently, food-derived bioactive compounds have been spotlighted as a regulator against various chronic diseases due to their low toxicity, as opposed to drugs that induce severe side effects. Here we describe the beneficial effects of dietary anthocyanins on obesity-induced metabolic disorders and inflammation. Red cabbage microgreen, blueberry, blackcurrant, mulberry, cherry, black elderberry, black soybean, chokeberry and jaboticaba peel contain a variety of anthocyanins including <b>cyanidins,</b> delphinidins, malvidins, pelargonidins, peonidins and petunidins, and have been reported to alter both metabolic markers and inflammatory markers in cells, animals, and humans. This review discusses the interplay between inflammation and obesity, and their subsequent regulation via the use of dietary anthocyanins, suggesting an alternative dietary strategy to ameliorate obesity and obesity associated chronic diseases...|$|R

40|$|Improving the micronutrients in {{food has}} become an {{important}} field of the Second Green Revolution. In recent years, minor bioactive compounds such as polyphenols, pigments and carotenoids, have attracted more and more interest from both researchers and food manufactures as health-promoting and disease-preventing effects in both in vitro and in vivo studies. One of plant pigments, wheat anthocyanins as plant phenolics are increasingly attractive as natural compounds positively affecting consumer´s health and condition moreover wheat is staple food source consumed usually daily. For a purple, blue, or red colour of wheat seed are responsible glycosylated <b>cyanidins,</b> delphinidins, malvinidins, pelargonidins, petunidins, and peonidins located in aleurone layer or pericarp, respectively. Other than white seed colour is not natural for common hexaploid wheat but this trait can be introduced from donors by aimed breeding programs. The way of wheat anthocyanins to provide positive effects for consumer´s physiology is limited due to their specific occurrence in seed parts usually removed during grain milling practice and lower stability during processing to food...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{can survive}} a {{limiting}} nitrogen (N) supply {{by developing a}} set of N limitation adaptive responses. However, the Arabidopsis nla (nitrogen limitation adaptation) mutant fails to produce such responses, and cannot adapt to N limitation. In this study, the nla mutant was utilized to understand further the effect of NLA on Arabidopsis adaptation to N limitation. Grown with limiting N, the nla mutant could not accumulate anthocyanins and instead produced an N limitation-induced early senescence phenotype. In contrast, when supplied with limiting N and limiting phosphorus (Pi), the nla mutants accumulated abundant anthocyanins and did not show the N limitation-induced early senescence phenotype. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} Arabidopsis has a specific pathway to control N limitation-induced anthocyanin synthesis, and the nla mutation disrupts this pathway. However, the nla mutation does not affect the Pi limitation-induced anthocyanin synthesis pathway. Therefore, Pi limitation induced the nla mutant to accumulate anthocyanins under N limitation and allowed this mutant to adapt to N limitation. Under N limitation, the nla mutant had a significantly down-regulated expression of many genes functioning in anthocyanin synthesis, and an enhanced expression of genes involved in lignin production. Correspondingly, the nla mutant grown with limiting N showed a significantly lower production of anthocyanins (particularly <b>cyanidins)</b> and an increase in lignin contents compared with wild-type plants. These data suggest that NLA controls Arabidopsis adaptability to N limitation by channelling the phenylpropanoid metabolic flux to the induced anthocyanin synthesis, which is important for Arabidopsis to adapt to N limitation...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{food matrix}} and {{individual}} food components on potential bioaccessibility of pomegranate were investigated {{by means of}} simulating in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion. The foodstuffs (sunflower oil, skim milk, cooked lean meat, bread, skim yogurt, probiotic yogurt, apple, lemon, honey, soy milk, cream, and soybean) and the food components (gluten, casein, isolated meat protein, lactose, fructose, galactose, glucose, salt, ascorbic acid, starch, cooked starch, tocopherol, linoleic acid, cellulose, citric acid and pectin) were codigested with pomegranate in model systems to better understand matrix effects. Total phenolic content (TPC) and total anthocyanin content (TAC) were determined by spectrophotometric methods and major phenolics/anthocyanins were analyzed by RP-HPLC/PDA detection {{both before and after}} in vitro GI digestion at post gastric (PG), dialyzable (IN) and non-dialyzable (OUT) fractions. Phenolics of pomegranate were found to be stable during gastric conditions (115 %), with 25 % loss in pancreatic digestion, available (14 %) in IN. Although preserved (89 %) in PG, anthocyanins were lost in pancreatic digestion (38 %), but still available (12 %) in IN. Milk, bread, yogurt, probiotic yogurt, lactose, starch, cellulose, salt, citric acid or tocopherol codigestion with pomegranate decreased TPC for all fractions. Proteins affected losses in PG and OUT fractions. Carbohydrates such as starch, lactose, glucose and pectin appeared to affect the loss of phenolics and exerted 2 -fold decreases in serum fraction (IN). For TAC, only meat, soymilk or cream codigestion with pomegranate resulted in IN losses. Proteins did not significantly affect TAC in IN, but were inhibitory in PG. However, carbohydrates and fatty acids significantly increased TAC in IN. Generally <b>cyanidins</b> were found to be more stable in food matrices and pancreatic conditions than other anthocyanins.
