5000|$|In {{straight}} <b>climbing</b> <b>flight,</b> lift is {{less than}} weight. [...] At first, this seems incorrect because if an aircraft is climbing it seems lift must exceed weight. When an aircraft is climbing at constant speed it is its thrust that enables it to climb and gain extra potential energy. Lift acts perpendicular to the vector representing the velocity of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere, so lift is unable to alter the aircraft's potential energy or kinetic energy. This {{can be seen by}} considering an aerobatic aircraft in straight vertical flight - one that is climbing straight upwards (or descending straight downwards). Vertical flight requires no lift! When flying straight upwards the aircraft can reach zero airspeed before falling earthwards - the wing is generating no lift and so does not stall. In straight, <b>climbing</b> <b>flight</b> at constant airspeed, thrust exceeds drag.|$|E

Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and tail rotor axis {{and the sense of}} tail rotor rotation.

In <b>climbing</b> <b>flight,</b> a pitch lock engaged in one main rotor blade causing a violent vibration {{that resulted in the}} tail rotor departing the aircraft at 2,200 ft AGL. Torque and rapid rotation contributed to the aircraft breaking apart further just aft of the main transmission. Auto-rotation resulted a bounce, roll over and fire. Aux tanks were attached. The plane was Dash-2 in a seven plane flight. More than 200 servicemen had been killed in accidents involving the CH-53A, CH-53D, and CH-53E from 1969 to 1990.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} test in March 2004, the Pegasus fired {{successfully}} and released the test vehicle {{at an altitude}} of about 29000 m. After separation, the engine's air intake was opened, the engine ignited, and the aircraft then accelerated away from the rocket reaching Mach 6.83 or 7,401 km/h (4,600 mph). Fuel was flowing to the engine for 11 seconds, a time in which the aircraft traveled more than 24 km. Following Pegasus booster separation, the vehicle experienced a small drop in speed but the scramjet engine afterward accelerated the vehicle in <b>climbing</b> <b>flight.</b> After burnout, controllers were still able to maneuver the vehicle and manipulate the flight controls for several minutes; the aircraft, slowed by air resistance, fell into the ocean. With this flight the X-43A became the fastest free flying air-breathing aircraft in the world.|$|E

Every aircraft type has limits on the pitch-power settings {{that can be used for}} <b>climbing</b> <b>flight.</b> Typically it is the pitch attitude which is the more limiting factor. Somewhat like an automobile, if the [...] "slope" [...] is made too steep, by an excessive increase (nose up) in pitch-attitude, the aircraft will lack sufficient power to climb, and in an extreme nose-up attitude, the airspeed may decrease to the point where the aircraft will stall.

This algorithm was tested using more than 1000 <b>climbing</b> <b>flights</b> in Fort Worth Center. Compared to the baseline trajectory predictions of a real-time research prototype (Center/TRACON Automation System), the TOC-matching method reduced the altitude root mean square error (RMSE) for a 5 -minute prediction time by 38 %.

5000|$|The {{bar-headed goose}} {{is one of}} the world's highest-flying birds, having been heard flying across Mount Makalu [...] - [...] the fifth highest {{mountain}} on earth at 8,481 m [...] - [...] and apparently seen over Mount Everest [...] - [...] 8,848 m [...] - [...] although this is a second-hand report with no verification. This demanding migration has long puzzled physiologists and naturalists: [...] "there must be a good explanation for why the birds fly to the extreme altitudes... particularly since there are passes through the Himalaya at lower altitudes, and which are used by other migrating bird species." [...] In fact, bar-headed geese have never been directly tracked (using GPS or satellite logging technology) flying higher than 6,540 m, and it is now believed that they do take the high passes through the mountains. The challenging northward migration from lowland India to breed in the summer on the Tibetan Plateau is undertaken in stages, with the flight across the Himalaya (from sea-level) being undertaken non-stop in as little as seven hours. Surprisingly, despite predictable tail winds that blow up the Himalayas (in the same direction of travel as the geese), bar-headed geese spurn these winds, waiting for them to die down overnight, when they then undertake the greatest rates of <b>climbing</b> <b>flight</b> ever recorded for a bird, and sustain these climbs rates for hours on end, according to research published in 2011.The 2011 study found the geese peaking at an altitude of around 6,400 m (21,000 ft). In a 2012 study that tagged 91 geese and tracked their migration routes, it was determined that the geese spent 95% of their time below 5784 m, choosing to take a longer route through the Himalayas in order to utilize lower-altitude valleys and passes. Only 10 of the tagged geese were ever recorded above this altitude, and only one exceeded 6500 m, reaching 7290 m. All but one of these high-altitude flights were recorded at night, which along with the early morning, is the most common time of day for geese migration. The colder denser air during these times may be equivalent to an altitude hundreds of meters lower. It is suspected by the authors of these two studies that tales of the geese flying at 8000 m are apocryphal.|$|E

40|$|This paper address two {{problems}} of the helicopter flowfield: the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic interaction between a) the main- and the tail rotor and, b) between the main rotor and the fuselage. The first interaction is analyzed with a numerical approach; the main rotor/fuselage interaction study, restricted to aerodynamics, is based on wind tunnel experiments. The rotor interactions studied are for a) a two-blade main- and tail rotor in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade tail rotor in <b>climb</b> <b>flight.</b> Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and tail rotor {{and the sense of}} tail rotor rotation. The unsteady pressure on the main- and tail rotor blade surface is calculated with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and used as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings-equation based code to evaluate the aeroacoustics. Main rotor effects a significant change in the noise directivity pattern and noise level of the tail rotor. Tail rotor contribution to the total noise dominated during the <b>climb</b> <b>flight.</b> Main rotor/fuselage aerodynamic interaction is analysed from pressure and flow visualization data of wind tunnel tests.

40|$|Gliding is a {{comparatively}} inexpensive flight mode {{in which a}} bird covers the aerodynamic cost by losing potential energy. However, the bird needs fuel energy to maintain the force on its wings, by pushing them down and forward, to counteract the force generated by the airflow on the wings and by gravity on the mass. This cost {{is estimated to be}} approximately 3 – 4 times the basal metabolic rate (Hedenström, 1993). Potential energy can be stored by soaring in updrafts of thermals, by powered <b>climbing</b> <b>flight</b> prior to gliding descent or by dynamic soaring in the wind gradient over the sea. Without the use of rising air, active <b>climbing</b> <b>flight</b> or a vertical wind gradient, a gliding bird will inevitably end up on the ground or the sea surface. In a wind tunnel, it is possible to generate updrafts by tilting the air stream, i. e. the tunnel, thereby continuously feeding energy to the gliding bird. In theory and practise, it is therefore possible to have a bird gliding in front of an experimenter for prolonged periods. Gliding flight has previously been studied in wind tunnel...|$|E

(2) A tight climb-rate-hold autopilot, using feedback of pitch-angle to angle-of-attack. After penetration, recovery to steady <b>climbing</b> <b>flight</b> is aided by using feedback of airspeed deviation to throttle.
