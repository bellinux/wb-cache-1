40|$|In Europe, the {{perennial}} C 4 grass miscanthus is currently mainly cultivated for energy generation via combustion. In recent years, anaerobic digestion {{has been identified}} as a promising alternative utilization pathway. Anaerobic digestion produces a higher-value intermediate (biogas), which can be upgraded to biomethane, stored in the existing natural gas infrastructure and further utilized as a transport fuel or in combined heat and power plants. However, the upgrading of the solid biomass into gaseous fuel leads to conversion-related energy losses, the level of which depends on the cultivation parameters genotype, location, and harvest date. Thus, site-specific crop management needs to be adapted to the intended utilization pathway. The objectives of this paper are to quantify (i) the impact of genotype, location and harvest date on energy yields of anaerobic digestion and combustion and (ii) the conversion losses of upgrading solid biomass into biogas. For this purpose, five miscanthus genotypes (OPM 3, 6, 9, 11, 14), three cultivation locations (Adana, Moscow, Stuttgart), and up to six harvest dates (August-March) were assessed. Anaerobic digestion yielded, on average, 35 % less energy than combustion. Genotype, location, and harvest date all had significant impacts on the energy yield. For both, this is determined by dry matter yield and ash content and additionally by substrate-specific methane yield for anaerobic digestion and moisture content for combustion. Averaged over all locations and genotypes, an early harvest in August led to 25 %and a late harvest to 45 %conversion losses. However, each utilization option has its own optimal harvest date, determined by biomass yield, biomass quality, and <b>cutting</b> <b>tolerance.</b> By applying an autumn green harvest for anaerobic digestion and a delayed harvest for combustion, the conversion-related energy loss was reduced to an average of 18 %. This clearly shows that the delayed harvest required tomaintain biomass quality for combustion is accompanied by high energy losses through yield reduction over winter. The pre-winter harvest applied in the biogas utilization pathway avoids these yield losses and largely compensates for the conversion-related energy losses of anaerobic digestion...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of surface roughness on the fatigue strength in high strength steels which was cut using different cutting processes were studied. Fatigue testing {{was conducted on}} S 700 and S 960 material of different plate thicknesses cut in dog bone specimens using oxygen, plasma, laser and waterjet cutting. The surface roughness was measured on all specimens and residual stress measurements were conducted. Estimations of the fatigue strength were made using the measured surface roughness and the ISO 9013 : 2002 standard for thermal <b>cutting</b> quality <b>tolerances.</b> The testing proved a 15 - 70 % increased fatigue strength compared to the estimation, proving a weak connection between the surface quality levels in ISO 9013 : 2002 and the fatigue test results. Different codes and design recommendations (IIW, EC 3 and EN 13001) for fatigue strength of cut surfaces were compared with the fatigue test results which clearly showed an increased fatigue strength with enhanced quality and steel grades and where the codes and design recommendations do not allow for any fatigue strength improvement with improved quality and increased strength.   QC 201606013 </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is i) to isolate ozone-induced genes, after an acute treatment, in two poplar hybrid species characterised by a different susceptibility to O 3, and ii) to study the regulatory mechanisms of the genes related with stress <b>tolerance.</b> <b>Cuttings</b> of two poplar hybrid clones (Populus deltoides x maximowiczii, Eridano clone, O 3 -sensitive, and Populus x euramericana, I- 214 clone, O 3 -tolerant) were grown and submitted to acute O 3 fumigation treatment (150 ppb for 5 h). Several differentially regulated cDNA clones were isolated. Most of the transcripts encode proteins involved in stress defence, protein synthesis, cell metabolism and signal transduction and other. Expression analysis of cDNA clones involved in signal transduction showed that most of transcripts level was increased by ozone treatment in both poplar clones. The mRNA accumulation was in some cases higher in the tolerant species, i. e. for cell wall-associated kinase (WAK) and WRKY transcription factors. Notably, WAK was induced by ozone stress only in the tolerant clone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{technological}} development demands efficiency {{of time and}} energy in all fields {{in order to create a}} product that can compete in the global market. Breakthroughs and innovations are needed merely to survive in manufacturing industry. Punching is the common process of using a cutting punch and die in the manufacturing process. A variety of physical phenomena occur in the metal cutting process such as metal flow, friction between the material and tools, process heat and changes in the microstructure of the material. Much research conerning dimensions, <b>tolerances,</b> <b>cutting</b> angles and cutting force has been carried out. This article discusses and examines the relationship between clearance, punch and dies circularity and circularity of the product of the punching process. Testing has been conducted using various punches with different diameters and different circularity conditions. The Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) which has an accuracy of 1 micron was used to measure the diameter of the punch and the dies, the clearance and circularity of the punch and dies, and the resulting product. The question is: is the circularity of the product of punching affected by the clearance or by the circularity of such tools? Keywords- CMM. I...|$|R
40|$|From SOFC-Stack {{manufacturing}} needs like {{to build}} up large numbers of stacks and like learning effective manufacturing techniques for stacks a huge demand on ceramic componentes arises. This project was {{set up for the}} many goals to improve FSZ-electrolyte and LaCrO_ 3 -interconnect (bipolar plate) quality and to develop built up and evaluate a cost effective manufacturing pilot line for at least 15 000 components per year. Component quality level has been achieved. It was defined as flexural strength, Weibull modul, flatness, gas tightness, design, thickness range and tolerance levels in length and width of plates. High flexural strength can be provided by soluble binders without residues, by slips free from gaseous and solid inclusions, by casting techniques without producing any bulk or surface interference in the tape, by handling techniques without producing any damage of tape and substrate and by firing techniques, which do not cause any reaction between component plates and surrounding elements. Good flatness needs a homogeneous distribution of organic across the tape, firing at low speed, rigid, flat and smooth setters, intelligent firing under load. Postfiring seems imperative. Small variation in electrolyte and bipolar plate thickness is difficult to achieve with a large casting width. The many attempts to come close to the final target have not yet prompted in final success. Small variation in electrolyte and bipolar plate dimensions can be simply produced by classification. A second step is variable <b>cutting.</b> Very small <b>tolerances</b> from slip and tape are related to high packing density of ceramic in the green sheet. However a perfect casting operation and particularly the burn out of organic are for same reasons in contradiction to a high density green ceramic. 10 000 electrolytes and bipolar plates have been produced, a quality system according to ISO 9000 has been introduced, the production part approval process has been completed and cost structures developed.
