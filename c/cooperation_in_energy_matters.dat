40|$|Despite {{sharing a}} common culture and heritage, South Asia {{is one of}} the least {{integrated}} regions of the world. There are numerous persistent problems creating continuous hurdles for regional integration in South Asia. In this paper an effort is made to present the case for the regional integration of South Asia from the perspective of functional theory. Interestingly, some countries in South Asia are energy deficit and some have vast unexplored potential to meet these shortfalls. The pertinent issue is how to link demand and supply of <b>energy</b> <b>in</b> South Asia so that it subsequently becomes a functional area for cooperation. This paper considers prevalent models of <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> <b>energy</b> security of other regions and argues how it can be relevant to the context of South Asia. The role of various actors essential for promoting <b>cooperation</b> <b>in</b> <b>energy</b> security <b>in</b> South Asia is discussed in this paper. Also, in order to substantiate the application of functional theory, the example of the European Union's policy is briefly outlined...|$|R

We mainly propose a simple heuristic algorithm {{to improve the}} energy efficiency of each node in a clustering based EH-WSN. First, the effect of cooperative communication is evaluated, and then, the energy sustainability of every node is taken into account, finally, we formulate an online optimization problem which can be solved near optimally with low computational complexity. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the outstanding performance of our proposed scheme in nodes’ transmitting power allocation and average working utility. Therefore, this joint optimization algorithm has a promising future in real applications.|$|R
