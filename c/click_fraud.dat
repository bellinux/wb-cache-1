40|$|With the Internet {{becoming}} the dominant channel for marketing and promotion, online advertisements are also increasingly used for illegal purposes such as propagating malware, scamming, <b>click</b> <b>frauds,</b> etc. To understand {{the gravity of}} these malicious advertising activities, which we call malvertising, we perform a largescale study through analyzing ad-related Web traces crawled over a three-month period. Our study reveals the rampancy of malvertising: hundreds of top ranking Web sites fell victims and leading ad networks such as DoubleClick were infiltrated. To mitigate this threat, we identify prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their related content delivery paths, and leverage them {{to build a new}} detection system called Mad-Tracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and utilizes them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and detect malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer was capable of capturing a large number of malvertising cases, 15 times as many as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront did together, at a low false detection rate. It also detected new attacks, including a type of click-fraud attack that has never been reported before...|$|R
40|$|Organizations are {{starting}} to realize the significant value of advertising on mobile devices, {{and a number of}} systems have been developed to exploit this opportunity. From a privacy perspective, however, all “privacy-concerned ” systems developed so far are based on either a trusted third-party model or on some generalized architecture. We propose a system for delivering location and preference-aware advertisements to mobiles with a novel architecture to preserve privacy. The main adversary in our model is the server distributing the ads trying to identify users and track them, and to a lesser extent, other peer in the wireless network. When the need for tailored ads arises, the node will form a group of nearby nodes seeking ads and will cooperate to achieve privacy. Peers combine their interests using a “shuffling” mechanism in an ad-hoc network and send them through a “primary peer ” to the ad server. The result is that preferences of multiple peers are accumulated and masqueraded to request custom ads which are then distributed by the primary peer. Another mechanism is also proposed to implement the a robust and anonymous billing system that does not disclose user identities and protects against <b>click</b> <b>frauds,</b> and sybil attacks...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{has become}} an {{essential}} part of the daily life for billions of users worldwide. However, everyday we are still reading news stories about major security breaches, new polymorphic worm/virus spreading, identity theft, DDoS or phishing emails. Attackers are using botnets as an effective tool to conduct a wide range of criminal activities even more efficiently than before. It becomes very challenging to detect/defend cyber attacks in high-speed networks nowadays. Firstly, the Internet traffic exhibits huge fluctuations and long range dependence, which makes the attack traffic often be hidden by large volumes of normal traffic. In order to get reliable information for the malicious traffic, we must be able to process each packet in a wire speed. Secondly, ISPs want to detect the attacks when they are still at a low-profile volume in order to reduce the damage as much and early as possible. Therefore, the detection algorithm should be able to correlate multiple data sources and identify the root of causes efficiently. In this dissertation, we propose data streaming algorithms to detect/defend cyber attacks in high-speed networks. We propose a novel data structure to detect <b>click</b> <b>frauds</b> in the online advertising network, and track the command-and-control communications in the botnets. Next, we introduce a fast sketch for the aggregate queries in high-speed network traffic, which can preserve some critical information for root cause analysis, like IP addresses, port numbers, etc. This sketch can also be extended to track super spreaders. Lastly, we apply the low-rank matrix approximation to monitor network-wide traffic anomalies and traffic activity graphs...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade mobile phones and tablets evolved into smart devices with {{enormous}} computing power and storage capacity packed in a pocket size. People around the globe have quickly moved from laptops to smartphones for their daily computational needs. From web browsing, social networking, photography to critical bank payments and intellectual property every thing has got into smartphones; and undoubtedly Android has dominated the smartphone market. Android growth also attracted cyber criminals to focus on creating attacks and malwares to target Android users. Malwares in different category are seen in the Android ecosystem, including botnets, Ransomware, <b>click</b> Trojan, SMS <b>frauds,</b> banking Trojans. Due to huge amount of application being developed and distributed every day, Android needs malware analysis techniques that are {{different than any other}} operating system. This research focuses on defining a process of finding Android malware in a given large number of new applications. Research utilizes machine learning techniques in predicting possible malware and further provide assistance in reverse engineering of malware. Under this thesis an assistive Android malware analysis system “AndroSandX” is proposed, researched and developed. AndroSandX allows researcher to quickly analyze potential Android malware and help perform manual analysis. Key features of the system are strong assistive capabilities using machine learning, built in ticketing system, highly modular design, storage with non-relational databases, backup of analysis data for archival, assistance in manual analysis and threat intelligence. Research results shows that the system has a prediction accuracy of around 92 %.

40|$|Dissertação de mestrado em Engenharia de InformáticaInternet {{security}} has been targeted in innumerous ways throughout the ages and Internet cyber criminality has been changing its ways since {{the old days}} where attacks were greatly motivated by recognition and glory. A new era of cyber criminals are on the move. Real armies of robots (bots) swarm the internet perpetrating precise, objective and coordinated attacks on individuals and organizations. Many of these bots are now coordinated by real cybercrime organizations in an almost open-source driven development resulting in the fast proliferation of many bot variants with refined capabilities and increased detection complexity. One example of such open-source development could be found during the year 2011 in the Russian criminal underground. The release of the Zeus botnet framework source-code {{led to the development}} of, at least, a new and improved botnet framework: Ice IX. Concerning attack tools, the combination of many well-known techniques has been making botnets an untraceable, effective, dynamic and powerful mean to perpetrate all kinds of malicious activities such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, espionage, email spam, malware spreading, data theft, <b>click</b> and identity <b>frauds,</b> among others. Economical and reputation damages are difficult to quantify but the scale is widening. It’s up to one’s own imagination to figure out how much was lost in April of 2007 when Estonia suffered a well-known distributed attack on its internet country-wide infrastructure. Among the techniques available to mitigate the botnet threat, detection plays an important role. Despite recent year’s evolution in botnet detection technology, a definitive solution is far from being found. New constantly appearing bot and worm developments in areas such as host infection, deployment, maintenance, control and dissimulation of bots are permanently changing the detection vectors thought and developed. In that way, research and implementation of anomaly-based botnet detection systems are fundamental to pinpoint and track all the continuously changing polymorphic botnets variants, which are impossible to identify by simple signature-based systems...|$|R
