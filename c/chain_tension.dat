25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} fork ends, rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1937 {{this was}} the only {{permitted}} form of gear changing on the Tour de France.

2500|$|It is {{imperative}} (for road riding, at least) that the chain is sufficiently tight {{that it is}} impossible for it to derail from either the chainring or sprocket. [...] This generally equates to [...] "no visible slack". [...] A derailed chain can cause a variety of undesirable consequences, such as a locked rear wheel or, worst of all, destruction of the frame if the chain becomes caught around the crank arm and pulls the rear triangle forwards. [...] On a fixed-gear bicycle without hand brakes, even a relatively benign derailment means a total loss of braking ability. [...] Tensioning aside, a chain is significantly less likely to derail if the chainline is accurate and the chain is a traditional [...] "full bushing" [...] type with limited lateral flexibility. [...] Because the difference between a tight and a slack chain equates to only very minor elongation of the links, <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> should be visually checked at least weekly, especially if the bicycle is ridden in wet or dirty conditions.|$|E

2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to repack their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1956 IWL {{replaced}} the Pitty with the SR 56 Wiesel. [...] "SR" [...] stands for StadtRoller ("town scooter"), 56 is the year, and Wiesel is German for weasel. Instead of the Pittys huge fairing, the Wiesel {{has a more}} conventional scooter fairing behind the front wheel and a separate front mudguard. This reduced the weight to 124 kg: still heavy, but 15 kg lighter than the Pitty. The rear swingarm was of a new trapezoidal design, which allowed the <b>chains</b> <b>tension</b> to remain constant as the rear wheel travelled vertically. The fuel tank was increased to 12 L, which gave the scooter a 340 km range.|$|R
5000|$|For the '87+ model, the {{swingarm}} {{design was}} changed to a more [...] "beefy" [...] design after cracking / breaking issues with the 85-86 swingarm design. Clearly, the Suzuki engineers underestimated how hard their customers could ride their product. However, the '87+ swingarm will mount to the 85-86 frame with some other minor equipment swap (i.e. rear shock, link). The '87+ rear axle carrier includes forward-reverse slide <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> rather than the 85-86's rotary tensioning method. The '87+ carrier housing slides forward and reverse and then is {{held in place by}} four vertical bolts and two rear horizontal bolts whereas the 85-86 carrier was held with a clamp or pinch design.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple meanfield variational approach {{to study a}} number of properties of intrinsically stiff chains which are appropriate models for a large class of biopolymers.

For the case of the stiff <b>chain</b> under <b>tension</b> we recover analytically all the known limits. We obtain quantitative agreement with recent experiments on the stretching of DNA.

40|$|We {{examine how}} the {{distribution}} of contour lengths and the high-stretch stiffening of individual chain segments affect the macroscopic shear modulus of flexible polymer gels, using a 2 D numerical model, in which polymer segments form a triangular network and disorder is introduced by varying their contour lengths.

50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary <b>chain</b> <b>tensioning</b> bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain adjusting bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the drive sprocket to maintain constant <b>chain</b> <b>tension.</b> This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|E
50|$|The belt or <b>chain</b> <b>tension</b> on a single-speed bicycle can be {{maintained}} by either setting the fixed horizontal position of the rear sprocket or the front chainring horizontally, or by a separate tensioner that pushes perpendicular to the chain with either a fixed position or spring tension.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, dynamic {{response}} {{analysis of}} a Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) with Spar-type floating foundation is presented.

40|$|We have {{measured}} the nonlinear rheological response {{of a model}} transient network over a large range of steady shear rates. The system is built up from an oil in water droplet microemulsion into which a telechelic polymer is incorporated. The phase behaviour is characterized which comprises a liquid-gas phase separation and a percolation threshold. The rheological measurements are performed in the one phase region above the percolation line. Shear thinning is observed for all samples, leading in most cases to an unstable stress response at intermediate shear rates. We built up a very simple mean field model which involves {{the reduction of the}} residence time of the stickers in the droplets due to the <b>chain</b> <b>tensions</b> at high shear. The computed constitutive equation is non-monotonic with a range where the stress is a decreasing function of the rate, a feature that indeed makes homogeneous flows unstable.
