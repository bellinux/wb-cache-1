5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly <b>cheese,</b> <b>is</b> unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with black treacle and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
5|$|The village {{gave its}} name to Cheddar cheese, {{which is the most}} popular type of cheese in the United Kingdom. The <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> now made and {{consumed}} worldwide, and only one producer remains in the village.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{processed}} pizza <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and Provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 A lexicon {{to define}} the sensory {{properties}} of melted Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> created using a trained descriptive panel. The lexicon characterized appearance (surface rupture, meltedness, oiliness, and edge browning) and texture (stringiness, stretchiness, springiness, firmness, toothpull, smoothness, cohesiveness, denseness, and chewiness). Three brands of commercially available shredded Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>were</b> examined to determine if heating treatment (oven or microwave) affected the sensory perception of melted cheese. Microwave heated <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> rated higher in meltedness, which {{was defined as the}} homogeneity of the melted sample's appearance. Oven heated sharp <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> rated higher than microwave treated sharp cheese in most descriptors, and microwave treated mild <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> rated high in most descriptors. The sensory characteristics of the <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> not affected by cheese brand...|$|R
50|$|The two best-known {{examples}} of grana-type <b>cheeses</b> <b>are</b> Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. The two <b>cheeses</b> <b>are</b> broadly similar, {{with the latter}} being less sharp, crumbly and grainy.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Low- and full-fat <b>cheeses</b> <b>were</b> {{fermented}} by Lactobacillus acidophilus and adjunct cultures Streptococcus thermophilus. After ripening for 90 d at 4 ˚C, {{the protein}} had been proteolysed in different degrees. The {{results showed that}} protein content of low- and full-fat <b>cheese</b> <b>were</b> all decreased after 90 d ripened, which the low-fat <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> 40. 45 % and full-fat <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> 28. 68 %. The soluble nitrogen contents at pH 4. 6 (pH 4. 6 SN) were 4. 97 % and 3. 88 %, and 12 % (w/v) trichloracetic acid soluble nitrogen (12 % TCA-SN) were 5. 17 % and 3. 74 % in low- and full-fat cheese respectively. After ripening for 90 d at 4 ˚C {{it was found that}} a part of protein in <b>cheese</b> <b>were</b> degraded into amino acids determined by automatic amino acid analyzer, total amino acids contents in low- and full-fat <b>cheese</b> <b>were</b> 29. 17 mg• 100 g- 1 and 16. 02 mg• 100...|$|R
5|$|Jersey milk {{being very}} rich, cream and butter {{have played a}} large part in insular cooking. (See Channel Island milk) However, there is no {{indigenous}} tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> produced commercially. Jersey fudge, mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.|$|E
5|$|Jibneh Arabieh or jibneh baida is a {{white table}} cheese served {{with any of the}} above dishes. Ackawi <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> a common {{variation}} of jibneh baida. Ackawi cheese has a smoother texture and a mild salty taste. Labaneh is a pasty yogurt-like cream cheese either served on a plate with olive oil and za'atar—which is generally called labaneh wa za'atar—or in a khubz sandwich.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{amounts of}} pizza cheese {{are used in}} Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Whole milk mozzarella is popular in pizzas in the East and Southwest regions of the U.S., while one survey showed that Provolone was more popular on {{the east and west}} coast. Cheddar may be used more in the Eastern and Southern regions of the U.S. Provel <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> {{typically}} used in the preparation of St. Louis-style pizza in the U.S.|$|E
5000|$|Ardsallagh Goat Farm {{is located}} at Carrigtwohill County Cork. Three types of <b>cheese</b> <b>are</b> made from their own herd and from locally sourced goat's milk. [...] The <b>cheeses</b> <b>are</b> {{suitable}} for vegetarians.|$|R
50|$|After Edam {{was granted}} {{the right to}} have weekly markets, {{commercial}} cheese markets in the town until 1922. The <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> brought to the market by local farmers on little boats, and when the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> lifted out of the boats it was carried to the market by cheese sledges. At the market the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> shown to the merchants. After being tested for their quality the price was settled by haggling until there was an agreement about the price. After that the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> brought to a warehouse where it was kept until the quality was at its best.|$|R
40|$|Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> {{manufactured}} from cow {{and buffalo}} milk using commercially available starter cultures (Lactococcus lactis ssp. Cremoris and Lactococcus lactis ssp. Lactis). <b>Cheese</b> <b>was</b> analyzed for proximate composition, pH, acidity, lactose and mineral contents and sensory perception (flavor, aroma and texture) after 2 and 4 months of ripening. All the chemical composition was significantly influenced by cow and buffalo milk. Buffalo milk <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> found considerably superior in nutritional profile. Lactose content and pH decreased and acidity increased significantly during ripening of 120 days. On sensory evaluation, buffalo milk <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> ranked appreciably higher {{for all the}} sensory parameters as {{compared to that of}} cow milk...|$|R
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Beecher's Handmade <b>Cheese</b> <b>is</b> an artisan cheesemaker {{and retail}} shop with {{locations}} in the Pike Place Market, Seattle, Washington and New York City's Flatiron District. The company was founded by Kurt Beecher Dammeier in 2003 and opened in the Pike Place Market after Dammeier obtained a difficult to obtain storefront lease in the Market. Because Dammeier {{had never been a}} cheesemaker, he sought out the assistance of Brad Sinko, who helped run a family cheese-making business in Oregon. A second location was opened in 2011 in the Flatiron neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and <b>cheese,</b> <b>is</b> used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|The <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> {{often from}} food {{surpluses}} stockpiled {{by the government}} as part of milk price supports. Butter was also stockpiled and then provided under the same program. Some government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> made of kosher products. This <b>cheese</b> product <b>is</b> also distributed to victims of a natural disaster following {{a state of emergency}} declaration.|$|R

5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> used, {{which is}} a {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese recipe and lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{production}} and consumption of Mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of pizza <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese used in the United States is Mozzarella cheese. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.|$|E
5|$|Mass-produced pizza <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> {{used by the}} foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, {{and other}} {{industries}} and businesses. The world's largest manufacturer of pizza cheese, Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized Mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded cheese used for pizza that is created {{in a few hours}} from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza cheese, which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of pizza cheese in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese stuffed into the pizza crust.|$|E

5000|$|Lymeswold <b>cheese</b> (1982-1992) <b>was</b> an English <b>cheese</b> variety. Many English <b>cheeses</b> <b>are</b> {{named after}} regions but Lymeswold was not, {{the product of}} a public {{competition}} to name it, the winning name may have been derived from a quintessential English place name Wymeswold. The <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> a soft, mild blue cheese with an edible white rind, much like Brie, and was inspired by French <b>cheeses.</b> It <b>was</b> similar to non-branded cheeses sold as Blue Brie. At the time of its launch, it was hailed as [...] "the first new English cheese in 200 years". For the export market, the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> branded Westminster Blue, because some non-English speakers had difficulty pronouncing the name Lymeswold.|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} of government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> claimed {{to not have}} an adverse effect on commercially available cheeses, as the government was required to purchase dairy products like cheese to keep the commercial companies afloat. The government could then sell or give the cheese away to foreign countries. At the time of Ronald Reagan’s signing of the 1981 farm bill, the cheese stockpile equaled to more than two pounds of cheese for each person living in the United States. Government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> frequently moldy. Those who received the cheese did not lose any food stamps and {{were not required to}} trade their food stamps in for the <b>cheese.</b> California <b>was</b> the first state to take the cheese, the first delivery that they received was for three million pounds of <b>cheese.</b> Government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> provided to welfare, food stamp, and Social Security recipients at no cost to them. Government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> colored neon orange. It was distributed to low-income families through the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance Program. Government <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> nominally removed in the 1990s when the dairy market stabilized.|$|R
5|$|Processed pizza <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> {{manufactured}} {{to produce}} optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Sardinian cheese casu marzu {{is exposed}} to flies known as cheese skippers such as Piophila casei, {{members of the family}} Piophilidae. The {{digestive}} activities of the fly larvae soften the cheese and modify the aroma as {{part of the process of}} maturation. At one time European Union authorities banned sale of the cheese and it was becoming hard to find, but the ban has been lifted on the grounds that the <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> a traditional local product made by traditional methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due to milk {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Primula <b>Cheese</b> Spread <b>was</b> {{developed}} in 1924 by Norwegian businessman Olav Kavli. Primula <b>Cheese</b> <b>was</b> the world's first spreadable cheese {{with a long}} shelf life and was named after the Primula flower. It was first introduced into the United Kingdom in 1929. By the 1930s, Primula <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> exported to over 30 countries, with the United States the main market.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> {{given an}} Italian {{protected}} {{designation of origin}} (DOP) in July 1996, and may also carry the name [...] "di alpeggio" [...] (from mountain pasture) if the <b>cheese</b> <b>was</b> made in the mountainous areas of its designated Province of Cuneo.|$|R

5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360–degree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Some {{versions}} may use mayonnaise, {{other types}} of cheese, such as pepper jack cheese, brie cheese or Cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese as primary ingredients. Some may incorporate other seafoods in addition to crab, such as imitation crab, lobster, shrimp and surimi. Additional ingredients may include mushrooms, artichoke, onion, green onion, shallot, green pepper, bread crumbs (such as panko), heavy cream and others. Bread crumbs {{may be used to}} top the dish, which may be browned during the cooking process creating a crust. Sometimes Parmesan <b>cheese</b> <b>is</b> combined with the bread crumbs. Some versions use Old Bay Seasoning as an ingredient to add flavor, and some are prepared spicy with the addition of ingredients such as hot sauce and red pepper.|$|E
