40|$|The hot gas {{desulfurization}} (HGD) {{technique is}} one of the elemental technologies of syngas purification having both thermal efficiency and very low emissions. The HGD is a novel method to efficiently remove H 2 S and COS in the syngas with regenerable sorbents at high temperature and high pressure condition. We propose a compact hot gas desulfurization system by which its operability is improved in stabilizing pressure balances among units. The proposed compact two beds system has two bubbling beds, solid injection nozzle, solid conveying line, and riser. The compact desulfurization system was located between coal gasifier and Fisher-Tropsch (F-T) reactor to desulfurize syngas in order not to deactivate F-T catalyst. To check feasibility of the compact desulfurization system at high pressure condition, both cold mode and hot mode tests have been performed.

40|$|Natural gas is {{becoming}} increasingly important as a primary energy source. A suitable replacement for fossil natural gas is bio-SNG, produced by biomass gasification, followed by methanation. A major challenge is efficient gas cleaning processes for removal of sulfur compounds and other impurities. The present study focuses on development of a gas cleaning step for a product gas produced in a 50 MWfuel gasification system. The developed gas cleaning washing process is basically a modification of the Rectisol process. Several different process configurations were evaluated using Aspen plus, including PC-SAFT for the thermodynamic modeling. The developed configuration takes advantage of only one methanol wash column, compared to two columns in a conventional Rectisol process. Results from modeling show {{the ability of the}} proposed configuration to remove impurities to a sufficiently low concentrations - almost zero concentration for H 2 S, CS 2, HCl, NH 3 and HCN, and approximately 0. 01 mg/Nm 3 for COS. These levels are acceptable for further upgrading of the gas in a methanation process. Simultaneously, up to 92 % of the original CO 2 is preserved in the final <b>cleaned</b> <b>syngas</b> stream.

This review covers the recent literature reporting syngas production with Ni-based catalysts from HTLc precursors via methane or ethanol reforming. The discussion was initiated with catalyst preparation (including conventional and novel means), followed by subsequent thermal treatment processes, then composition design and the addition of promoters in these catalysts.

40|$|AbstractThe major {{technical}} {{problems faced by}} stand-alone fluidized bed gasifiers (FBG) for waste-to gas applications are intrinsically related to the composition and physical properties of waste materials, such as RDF. The high quantity of ash and volatile material in RDF can provide a decrease in thermal output, create high ash clinkering, and increase emission of tars and CO 2, thus affecting the operability for <b>clean</b> <b>syngas</b> generation at industrial scale. By contrast, a two-stage process which separates primary gasification and selective tar and ash conversion would be inherently more forgiving and stable. This can be achieved {{with the use of}} a separate plasma converter, which has been successfully used in conjunction with conventional thermal treatment units, for the ability to ‘polish’ the producer gas by organic contaminants and collect the inorganic fraction in a molten (and inert) state. This research focused on the performance analysis of a two-stage fluid bed gasification–plasma process to transform solid waste into <b>clean</b> <b>syngas.</b> Thermodynamic assessment using the two-stage equilibrium method was carried out to determine optimum conditions for the gasification of RDF and to understand the limitations and influence of the second stage on the process performance (gas heating value, cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency), along with other parameters.

The purpose of this study is the assessment of a system constituted by a SOFC-based hybrid cycle integrated with a coal gasification process. In this system, syngas produced in a high efficiency, dry feed, oxygen blown, entrained flow Shell gasifier is cooled, depurated from particulate and sulfur compounds and reheated; the <b>clean</b> <b>syngas</b> feeds a pressurized SOFC together with high pressure air generated by the compressor of a gas turbine. After combustion of unconverted syngas, fuel cell exhausts are expanded and cooled, providing heat to a bottoming steam cycle for an efficient energy recovery.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{plays an}} important role in solving the problems of waste-to-energy (WTE) processes. The most important drawback, common to the gasification processes used in WTE technology, consists of the need of cleaning facilities to obtain a <b>clean</b> <b>syngas</b> for powering generation. To eliminate this drawback and to obtain a sufficiently <b>clean</b> <b>syngas,</b> ready for a further use, a gasifier consisting of two stages in series was developed. Although the developed gasifier was tested in a lab-plant scale with various wastes, it was not taken into account how the performances change as a function of the injected waste. Aim of this paper is therefore to compare the effect of different feedings waste, i. e. RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel), ASR (Automotive Shredder Residue) and biomass such as olive oil husk, bagasse, and swithgrass on the gasifying performance of gasifier at two stages. This aim is accomplished by examining either already published or new data relevant the selected wastes. Two main items, namely residual carbon at stage one and syngas composition at stage two, are taken into account to perform this comparison by considering kinetic and thermodynamic of the process. According to the found kinetic law, carbon deposition at stage one is typical of the first hours of process and is characteristic of the short-time test normally performed in a bench scale reactor. As far as stage two concerns, the heat content of the outgoing syngas depends on the ultimate analysis of the used wastes in terms of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. A thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data confirms the correctness of such a deduction...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of biofuels via a low temperature Fischer-Tropsch synthesis could potentially increase {{the utilization of}} biofuels without having to change the currently used combustion engines. Furthermore, the upgrading process needed to convert the FT-crude obtained just after the synthesis into commercial motor fuels {{could be done in}} a state-of-the-art refinery. In addition, current infrastructures would still be suitable for the distribution of the FT-fuels. To gain knowledge about this synthesis, a model has been developed with particular focus on the FT-synthesis of hydrocarbons from biomass derived syngas. The general Biomass-To-Liquid process would also include the upstream gasification process which converts biomass into syngas and the further upgrading of the FT-crude into diesel and gasoline. The main features of this model are: a chain growth probability, α, dependent on temperature, H 2 and CO mole fraction, a concomitant {{production of}} olefins and paraffins considered and kinetics of the FT-synthesis reaction taken into account. The starting point of the modelled processes is a <b>cleaned</b> <b>syngas</b> which was previously derived from biomass through a gasification process. This syngas is then converted into a FT-crude stream. However, not all of the H 2 and CO in the fresh syngas is converted in the FT-synthesis. Therefore, it can be recycled into the reactor to increase the overall conversion. Alternatively, the light hydrocarbons in the syngas obtained after crude condensation can be reformed to H 2 and CO, thus increasing the fresh syngas available for the synthesis. To avoid a build-up of inert components, some of the recycled stream is purged. Four different process configurations have been modelled and analysed in this work. They differ by the way the syngas loop is handled (with and without reformer) and by the final utilization of the purge gas (simple combustion in a boiler or used to fuel a gas turbine for power production). This work discusses the results of a parametric study of the different configurations in order to investigate the impact of the reactor operating temperature, pressure and of the desired CO conversion on different indicators. Within this study the product distribution has been investigated according to the characteristics required for products in the carbon ranges of interest. Catalyst amount and reactor volume needed to achieve a certain CO conversion have been calculated as well as efficiencies of the process using different system boundaries. The electricity balance of the processes has also been considered for further evaluation. The results highlight that there is a trade-off between {{the quality and quantity of}} FT-crude production and the reactor size which mainly depends on the temperature. With an increase in temperature the reactor volume decreases, however, the amount of long chain hydrocarbons decreases as well and the production of C 1 - 4 is favoured. This gives a less valuable product stream. The same trend is applicable for the system and conversion efficiency of the modelled process. Due to the applied model for the chain growth probability (α) of the hydrocarbons, the pressure only has a minor impact except for the electricity consumption. It can be generally concluded that the electricity demand of the FT synthesis process increases with the pressure. It is furthermore shown that the same impact on the electricity consumption can be observed with an increase of the CO conversion within the FT reactor. Considering the impact of an upgrading process for the recirculating gas flow, it can be concluded that the utilisation of a reformer helps to a large extent to reduce the need for a water gas shift prior the synthesis step. However, with the syngas composition considered in this work (similar to that of a biomass indirect gasifier product gas) the reformer’s contribution is not enough to completely avoid this part of the system. The model of the FT-reactor provided by this study can be used in the future to investigate a more complete process where the syngas production, e. g. by biomass gasification, as well as the following upgrading of the FT-crude to motor fuels is also included. The major advantage of this model with respect to other literature models is that kinetic has been taken into account...|$|R

The experimental results showed that the viability of co-gasification to process such blends and that by the right manipulation of coal and biomass or waste blends, syngas treatment and upgrading may be simplified and the cost of the overall process may be reduced. Blends of three different coal grades (sub-bituminous coal from Puertollano mines, South African bituminous coal and German brown coal) with two different types of biomass (pine and olive oil bagasse) or polyethylene (PE) were co-gasified.

Coal, air, steam, and possibly sand are fed to the bottom of the PCFB reactor and establish a relatively dense bed of coal/char in the bottom section. As these constituents react, a hot syngas is produced which conveys the solids residue vertically up through the reactor and into the recycle cyclone.

40|$|The GreatPoint Energy (GPE) {{concept for}} {{producing}} {{synthetic natural gas}} and hydrogen from coal involves the catalytic gasification of coal and carbon. GPE’s technology “refines” coal by employing a novel catalyst to “crack” the carbon bonds and transform the coal into cleanburning methane (natural gas) and hydrogen. The GPE mild “catalytic” gasifier design and operating conditions result in reactor components that are less expensive and produce pipeline-grade methane and relatively high purity hydrogen. The system operates extremely efficiently on very low cost carbon sources such as lignites, subbituminous coals, tar sands, petcoke, and petroleum residual oil. In addition, GPE’s catalytic coal gasification process eliminates troublesome ash removal and slagging problems, reduces maintenance requirements, and increases thermal efficiency, significantly reducing {{the size of the}} air separation plant (a system that alone accounts for 20 % of the capital cost of most gasification systems) in the catalytic gasification process. Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) pilot-scale gasification facilities were used to demonstrate how coal and catalyst are fed into a fluid-bed reactor with pressurized steam and a small amount of oxygen to “fluidize” the mixture and ensure constant contact between the catalyst and the carbon particles. In this environment, the catalyst facilitates multiple chemical reactions between the carbon and the steam {{on the surface of the}} coal. These reactions generate a mixture of predominantly methane, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. Product gases from the process are sent to a gas-cleaning system where CO{sub 2 } and other contaminants are removed. In a full-scale system, catalyst would be recovered from the bottom of the gasifier and recycled back into the fluid-bed reactor. The by-products (such as sulfur, nitrogen, and CO{sub 2 }) would be captured and could be sold to the chemicals and petroleum industries, resulting in near-zero hazardous air or water pollution. This technology would also be conducive to the efficient coproduction of methane and hydrogen while also generating a relatively pure CO{sub 2 } stream suitable for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or sequestration. Specific results of bench-scale testing in the 4 - to 38 -lb/hr range in the EERC pilot system demonstrated high methane yields approaching 15 mol%, with high hydrogen yields approaching 50 %. This was compared to an existing catalytic gasification model developed by GPE for its process. Long-term operation was demonstrated on both Powder River Basin subbituminous coal and on petcoke feedstocks utilizing oxygen injection without creating significant bed agglomeration. Carbon conversion was greater than 80 % while operating at temperatures less than 1400 °F, even with the shorter-than-desired reactor height. Initial designs for the GPE gasification concept called for a height that could not be accommodated by the EERC pilot facility. More gas-phase residence time should allow the syngas to be converted even more to methane. Another goal of producing significant quantities of highly concentrated catalyzed char for catalyst recovery and material handling studies was also successful. A Pd–Cu membrane was also successfully tested and demonstrated to produce 2. 54 lb/day of hydrogen permeate, exceeding the desired hydrogen permeate production rate of 2. 0 lb/day while being tested on actual coal-derived syngas that had been cleaned with advanced warm-gas cleanup systems.

The results indicate that a 54 % decrease of fossil CO 2 emissions implies an energy penalty (a loss of net power) of about 20 % while does not cause significant change of the net efficiency of the plant. The mitigation cost (the additional cost of electricity per avoided ton of CO 2) is significantly dependent on the price of the biomass cost compared to the price of the fossil fuel...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{previous}} studies, the efficiency of a Brayton/Hirn combined cycle fuelled with a <b>clean</b> <b>syngas</b> produced by means of biomass gasification and equipped with CO 2 removal by chemical absorption reached 33. 94 %, considering also the separate CO,) compression process. The specific CO 2, emission of the power plant was 178 kg/MW h. In comparison with values previously found for an integrated coal gasification combined cycle (ICGCC) with upstream CO 2 chemical absorption (38 - 39 % efficiency, 130 kg/MWh specific CO 2 emissions), this configuration seems to be attractive because of the possibility of operating with a simplified scheme and because of the possibility of using biomass in a more efficient way with respect to conventional systems. In this paper, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted with presenting the results {{on the basis of the}} Eco-Indicator 95 impact assessment methodology. Further, a comparison with the results previously obtained for the LCA of the ICGCC was performed in order to highlight the environmental impact of biomass production with fossil fuels utilisation. The LCA shows the important environmental advantages of biomass utilisation in terms of reduction of both greenhouse gas emissions and natural resource depletion, although an improved impact assessment methodology may better highlight the advantages due to the biomass utilisation.

40|$|Production of {{high-quality}} syngas from biomass gasification in a dual fluidised bed gasifier (DFBG) {{has made a}} significant progress in R&D and Technology demonstration. An S&M scale bio-automotive fuel plant close to the feedstock resources is preferable as biomass feedstock is widely sparse and has relatively low density, low heating value and high moisture content. This requires simple, reliable and cost-effective production of <b>clean</b> and good <b>syngas.</b> Indirect DFBGs, with steam as the gasification agent, produce a syngas of high content H 2 and CO with 12 - 20 MJ/mn 3 heating value. The Mid Sweden University (MIUN) gasifier, built for research on synthetic fuel production, is a dual fluidised bed gasifier. Reforming of tars and CH 4 (except for methanation application) in the syngas is a major challenge for commercialization of biomass fluidised-bed gasification technology towards automotive fuel production. A good syngas from DFBGs {{can be obtained by}} optimised design and operation of the gasifier, by the use of active catalytic bed material and internal reforming. This thesis presents a series of experimental tests with different operation parameters, reforming of tar and CH 4 with catalytic bed material and reforming of tar and CH 4 with catalytic internal reformer.   The first test was carried out to evaluate the optimal operation and performance of the MIUN gasifier. The test provides basic information for temperature control in the combustor and the gasifier by the bed material circulation rate.    After proven operation and performance of the MIUN gasifier, an experimental study on in-bed material catalytic reforming of tar/CH 4 is performed to evaluate the catalytic effects of the olivine and Fe-impregnated olivine (10 %wtFe/olivine Catalyst) bed materials, with reference to non-catalytic silica sand operated in the mode of dual fluidised beds (DFB). A comparative experimental test is then carried out with the same operation condition and bed-materials but when the gasifier was operated in the mode of single bubbling fluidised bed (BFB). The behaviour of catalytic and non-catalytic bed materials differs when they are used in the DFB and the BFB. Fe/olivine and olivine in the BFB mode give lower tar and CH 4 content together with higher H 2 +CO concentration, and higher H 2 /CO ratio, compared to DFB mode. It is hard to show a clear advantage of Fe/olivine over olivine regarding tar/CH 4 catalytic reforming.     In order to significantly reduce the tar/CH 4 contents, an internal reformer, referred to as the FreeRef reformer, is developed for in-situ catalytic reforming of tar and CH 4 using Ni-catalyst in an environment of good gas-solids contact at high temperature.  A study on the internal reformer filled with and without Ni-catalytic pellets was carried out by evaluation of the syngas composition and tar/CH 4 content. It can be concluded that the reformer with Ni-catalytic pellets clearly gives a higher H 2 content together with lower CH 4 and tar contents in the syngas than the reformer without Ni-catalytic pellets. The gravimetric tar content decreases from 25 g/m 3 down to 5 g/m 3 and the CH 4 content from 11 % down below 6 % in the syngas.   The MIUN gasifier has a unique design suitable for in-bed tar/CH 4 catalytic reforming and continuously internal regeneration of the reactive bed material. The novel design in the MIUN gasifier increases the gasification efficiency, suppresses the tar generation and upgrades the syngas composition.    Gasification-based Biorefinery for Mechanical Pulp Mill...|$|R
40|$|Gasification {{of biomass}} residue, a {{thermochemical}} conversion process, {{is fast becoming}} an attractive method of syngas production by extracting energy from the non-food based biomass feedstocks. Unlike the more popular biochemical processes, like fermentation of cellulosic biomass, it can operate {{with a wide range}} of biomass-feedstock in terms of feed???s quality and consistency, thus expanding the available pool of feedstock and thereby reducing the overall costs. Moreover, by doing almost complete depolymerization of the source biomass to useful gaseous products like syngas, gasification currently is the only established technology that can theoretically make the most of the energy stored in the raw biomass. However, on gasification, along with the syngas, gaseous impurities like sulfur containing species (H 2 S, COS), ammonia, alkali oxides, halides etc are also generated due to the volatile contaminants present in the biomass residue. Many downstream processes, like Fischer Tropsch synthesis, Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and methanol production, use catalysts that have little tolerance with gaseous contaminants. Transition metal / metal oxide catalysts, typically employed for such value-addition processes, are especially vulnerable to sulfur containing gaseous species like hydrogen sulfide. Therefore, before this raw syngas can be used for different downstream applications, it needs to be cleaned. Among the different processes used for H 2 S removal, wet amine scrubbing has been the most popular. However, such wet processes require comparatively low operating temperatures (35 - 55 ???C). The <b>cleaned</b> <b>syngas</b> has to be subsequently reheated for the downstream processes (300 - 800 ???C). Such consecutive cooling and heating can cause considerable thermal losses. To avoid such energy losses, it is important to desulfurize the gas stream at suitably high temperatures. A solid-phase sulfur-sorbent material that has a high reactivity, good structural stability, and easy regenerability at such high temperatures can provide such an alternative. In past work, different bulk sorbents with different chemical and structural properties have been tried for high temperature desulfurization. However, in spite of numerous efforts to modify chemical and compositional properties, only a limited success has been achieved. It is due to sorbent's failure in meeting one or more of the aforementioned criteria. For instance, in the past, it has been demonstrated that due to mass transfer limitations, if a bulk sorbent gets completely sulfided, it is almost impossible to achieve complete regeneration afterwards, regardless of process's favorable thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. This incomplete regeneration, partly due to mass transfer limitation and subsequent loss of sorbent's surface area, leads to underutilization of the sorbent material, which is typically a transition or rare earth metal oxide. To overcome these limitations, it seems necessary that one needs to go beyond doing modifications in sorbent chemical composition alone. One option that has been little explored involves integration of tailored design and morphology of the sorbent with the process's favorable kinetics. The attempt in this work will be to describe how the structure-based modification of sorbents, specifically nanostructuring, can help in achieving improved sorbent performance for a process requiring reusable sorbents. Since the reaction time has been shown to be comparatively short, the approach here will be to come up with a sorbent design that facilitates short contact time so that deep sulfidation of sorbent can be avoided without affecting the sulfur removal capacity. As this would require high gas velocity along with sorbent's high specific surface area, the use of conventional bulk sorbent will lead to incomplete regeneration and significant pressure drop. Sorbents with tailored designs and sizes, however, can help in overcoming such limitations. The criteria for such designs should be to maximize available specific surface area along with short diffusion lengths. Nanosizing of sorbent seems as a good alternative. However, sorbent in the form of nanopowders tend to aggregate and cause mass transfer limitations similar to bulk sorbents. On the other hand, nanostructures having high aspect ratio, like nanofibers, can remain isolated; thus, potentially providing a more suitable framework for carrying out frequent cyclic sulfidation-regeneration operation. These high aspect ratio nanoscale structures can not only retain the properties from their bulk form such as favorable thermodynamics, chemical affinity etc., but they also tend to develop useful properties due to highly anisotropic geometry and confined grain size. Because of the confinement of the grain size and short contacting time, nanofibers will tend to limit the large volume changes and accompanying grain boundary collisions which are typical during repeated sulfidation/regeneration. Thus, it is expected that the use of nanostructured sorbent will not only lead to high specific surface area and improved mass-transfer, it can also lead to an improved mechanical behavior during high temperature cyclic operation. This work will present the results from the experimental investigation of such high-aspect ratio nanofibers for their potential to serve as a regenerable sorbents. Sol-gel based electrospinning was used to synthesize composite zinc and titanium oxide adsorbents in the form of non-woven fiber-mats. Two such samples, with different zinc-to-titanium atomic ratio were selected for further investigation. The Zn-to-Ti ratio for the first sample (Sample- 1) was 3. 69 and for the second sample (Sample- 2 a) it was 1. 17. Salt solutions of the respective metals, with PVP (Mw ~ 1300000) as the binding polymer, were used to prepare the corresponding sol-gels, which were then used as the precursor solutions for electrospinning of the fibers. Calcination of the as-spun fibers at 600 ???C for 4 hrs resulted in zinc-titanate fiber-mats free from polymer. These fiber mats were characterized by substantially high specific surface areas: 151. 7 and 90. 1 m 2 /g respectively. The average fiber diameter for Sample- 1 (post-sintering) was found to be 435 nm and for the second sample it was 714 nm. Fibers were then characterized for their internal crystal structure and surface morphology using the techniques of XRD, SEM and TEM. XRD results and selected-electron-diffraction done using TEM revealed that the electrospun fibers, obtained after the heat-treatment, are multi-phase and polycrystalline in nature. The crystallites formed within a fiber are within the range of 10 ??? 15 nm in size. SEM allowed observation of surface morphology of the fiber mats. Fiber diameters, ranging from 165 nm to 830 nm, were obtained. It was found that the use of inorganic binders, like lithium polysilicate, can help in reducing the spread in the fiber diameters. These specimens were subsequently tested for their high temperature reduction behavior. Testing of the reduction behavior is important as it determines the durability and resistance of the sorbent specimens in a cyclic sulfidation/regeneration operation. Temperature controlled reduction was carried out using a Thermo-gravimetric Analyzer (TGA). Fiber-based sorbents with Zn-to-Ti ratio closer to one were found to be more resistant to deactivation caused by reduction. During the reduction reaction, different compositions of the mixed oxide sorbent exhibited different regimes with different rate-controlling steps. More zinc content in the sorbent implied that the overall reaction rate was controlled by the gas-film diffusion step. Product layer diffusion step becomes rate controlling if there is comparable zinc-to-titanium content (as in Sample - 2 a). In such sample, shrinking-core mechanism can be seen in operation in which inert product layer grows as the active core shrinks. TGA was again used for the sulfidation experiments, carried out at isothermal conditions of 600 ???C with 1 % H 2 S (rest N 2) gas stream (with flow rate of 200 ml/min). It was found that the composite oxides (Zn-Ti ratio ??? 1. 1) based nanofibrous sorbent specimens (Sample- 2 a) were slightly more reactive than the specimens rich in free zinc oxide (e. g. Sample- 1 with Zn-Ti ratio ??? 3. 7, both specimens being pre-reduced). This may be an indication of higher density of active sites and surface defects in polycrystalline complex oxides as compared to simple metal oxides. Equivalent grain model was used for identification of the rate-controlling step. For majority of the reaction duration, chemical reaction step was found to be the rate-controlling step rather than the product layer diffusion ??? an indication of minimal mass transfer resistance offered by the nanofibrous sorbent specimens. During sulfidation, dendritic growth from the parent composite fibers was observed. This was attributed to specific local occurrences of the polar planes of ZnS/ZnO as fiber outer surface along with locally high gas (H 2 S) / vapor (Zn) concentration. These structures may have contributed to increased specific surface area. Also, no sulfate formation was detected post-sulfidation, as confirmed by the results from the EDX and XPS analysis. Absence of formation of any sulfate compounds during the sulfidation of nanofibrous zinc titanate adsorbent is expected to improve the chances of achieving complete regeneration. In addition, formation of wurtzite phase during sulfidation, a distinct crystal form of zinc sulfide, was seen as another potential advantage of using nanostructured sorbent morphology. Although bulk wurtzite is only metastable at temperatures less than 1020 ???C, wurtzite, in its nanocrystalline form, was apparently stable at lower temperatures (??? 600 ???C). Wurtzite tend to oxidize directly to zinc oxide whereas oxidation of sphalerite (another ZnS crystal form) has been reportedly linked with the formation of ZnSO 4 and Zn 3 O(SO 4) 2. Regeneration experiments were carried out at the same temperature as the sulfidation (600 ???C) with a gas stream containing 3 % O 2 (rest nitrogen) flowing at 200 ml /min. Comparing the reaction data for the two different specimens (Sample- 1 vs Sample- 2 a), sorbent specimens rich in zinc titanates (Sample- 2 a) showed faster kinetics than the zinc oxide sorbents (both pre-reduced). It was found that it is possible to achieve complete regeneration without raising the sulfidation temperature (600 ???C). Again, results from the XPS analysis confirmed no formation of sulfates on oxidation even when the regeneration temperature was kept same as the sulfidation temperature. Structural properties of the sorbent specimen like the fibrous morphology, grain size of the fresh sorbent mostly remained intact in the regenerated specimens. Multi-cycle sulfidation and regeneration tests found that the nanofibrous design of zinc titanate sorbents can successfully withstand repeated sulfidation-regeneration operations whithout suffering microstructure degradation while maintainng high sulfur capacities. Progressive improvement in the textural properties of the fiber was seen as the reason for better performance. Activation energy associated with the sulfidation reaction was also found to be atleast 3 times smaller than that needed for the other sorbent geometries. All these observations promise an enhanced performance of composite oxides with nanofibrous morphology in a process requiring regenerable sorbents. These findings confirm the main propositions of this work that the sorbent morphology and overall structure influence the sorbent performance as much as the compositional modifications. The above-discussed modifications in the sorbent morphology helped in overcoming some problem areas generally associated with the compositionally-enhanced metal oxides; for instance their lower reactivity, the requirement of high regeneration temperatures, mass transfer controlled overall rate and the consequent incomplete regeneration, all were found to be absent in the above nanostructured sorbent specimens. Future studies will explore the extent to which these improvements can be sustained in a many-cycle operation...|$|R

The waste is thermally decomposed within the fluidized bed to produce a crude syngas, containing residual tars, unconverted char and entrained ash particles. The crude syngas is then sent to the plasma cyclone converter where all the inorganic material (particulates and heavy metals components) are captured and immobilized into a vitrified slag. Experimental test runs with RDF waste were conducted by varying the operating conditions and contaminants quantity. The results are presented according to solid samples composition, gas composition, and further specific data (e. g., carbon conversion efficiency, leaching test, etc). Particulate loading data and materials mass balance suggested from 40 to 90 % of non-volatile metals (e. g. chromium) and other heavy metals (e. g. vanadium) were incorporated within the slag where they are rendered non-leachable.

40|$|AbstractA key {{challenge}} for future clean power or hydrogen projects via gasification {{is the need}} to reduce the overall cost while achieving significant levels of CO 2 capture. The current state of the art technology for capturing CO 2 from sour syngas uses a physical solvent absorption process (acid gas removal–AGR) such as Selexol™ or Rectisol® to selectively separate H 2 S and CO 2 from the H 2. These two processes are expensive and require significant utility consumption during operation, which only escalates with increasing levels of CO 2 capture. Importantly, Air Products has developed an alternative option that can achieve a higher level of CO 2 capture than the conventional technologies at significantly lower capital and operating costs. Overall, the system is expected to reduce the cost of CO 2 capture by over 25 %. Air Products developed this novel technology by leveraging years of experience in the design and operation of H 2 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) systems in its numerous steam methane reformers.
