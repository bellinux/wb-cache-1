2500|$|Freezing semen is a {{commonly}} used technique {{in the modern}} animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods Semen is often collected using an artificial vagina, electroejaculation, gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools. [...] Patience and technique are keys to successful <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen.</b> There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas {{that can be used}} depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a disposable bag inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male. Electroejaculation is a method of semen collection in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male. The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen. Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca. However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.|$|E

Collection condoms are condoms primarily used to collect semen during sexual intercourse. Contraceptive condoms are generally made of latex, and are designed for contraception and preventing spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Collection condoms are sterile and made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. They are usually non-lubricated and have a teat end or reservoir to collect the sperm.

The semen used in the overnight delivery system was on average 28 hours older when used for insemination compared to the semen used in the courier delivery system. In this study no significant difference was found between semen delivery systems for farrowing rate. Both semen delivery systems produced farrowing rates in excess of 85 %, a very competitive level in the swine industry today. The difference in total pigs born per litter was also nonsignificant in this study. However, the semen delivered via courier did produce a small but statistically significantly larger litter size born alive (10. 48 vs 10. 28) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary. A {{technique}} of cannulation of the epididymis {{of the bull}} with the subsequent establishment of a patent fistula is described, which allows for the repeated <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> epididymal spermatozoa and secretions from the living animal. Before 1959, studies on epididymal spermatozoa and secretions were made with slaughterhouse material (Czarnetzky & Henle, 1938; Lasley & Bogart, 1944 a, b; Lasley & Mayer, 1944; Bialy & Smith, 1959). Semen was expressed through a slit made into a tubule of the epididymis, by pressure exerted from {{the contents of a}} syringe introduced into the cut end of the vas deferens. This method <b>of</b> obtaining epididymal <b>semen</b> has several disadvantages. The donor animal is killed and only the one sample can, therefore, be obtained. There is often a delay between the time of slaughter and the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> the <b>semen,</b> and the collection procedure is not always successful. A method for the <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> ram epididymal <b>semen</b> from the living animal was developed by White, Larson & Wales (1959), which overcame the above...|$|R

The caliber of bulls started changing with Bodacious, and that changed bull riding events.

40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with mature White Leghorn roosters to study variables associated with concentrations of testosterone in blood sampled from a wing vein. Testosterone in blood plasma was unchanged 15, 30, or 45 min after <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> artificially whether or not roosters were trained for <b>collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen.</b> Likewise, cohabitation with hens for 7 to 8 hr was without effect. However, trained roosters had higher (P<. 05) plasma testosterone concentrations after 7 to 8 hr in a new location than untrained roosters. Furdiermore, both groups in the new location had higher testosterone concentrations than the controls not translocated. Plasma testos-terone was decreased (P<. 01) about 50 % within 2 weeks by feeding a diet low in crude protein (2 %) which decreased feed intake 33 % and caused weight loss; those fed 12 % crude protein were unchanged. Variations in concentrations of testosterone among sequential samples of blood collected at 45 -min intervals for 3 hr indicated random pulsatile releases of testosterone as reported for mammals. Sequential sampling at 15 min intervals for 1 to 2 hr revealed that the testosterone increases (up to 10 ng/ml) lasted for about 1 hr and that the returns to basal concentrations required about 1 to 1. 5 hr. The interval between pulsatile releases may be as long as 3 hr in some roosters. These results indicate that roosters have spontaneous and pulsatile releases of testosterone as expected, because roosters release luteinizing hormone episodically during both light and dark cycles of the day...|$|E

40|$|Increased global use {{of highly}} {{productive}} breeds of farm animals has been coupled to loss of genetic diversity in most species. In European countries, various governmental, non-governmental, and private organizations try to preserve genetic diversity of livestock in situ (e. g., by stimulating {{the use of}} indigenous, rare breeds by farmers; in nature reserves; or in noncommercial farms). In the case of poultry, maintaining in situ populations of the noncommercial (fancy) breeds largely relies on hobby farmers. In addition to in situ conservation, gene banks are being established for ex situ conservation. In at least 2 countries, France and The Netherlands, there are limited <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> frozen <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> rare poultry breeds. Since 2003, the CGN has started with a more systematic effort to collect, freeze, and store <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> indigenous Dutch poultry breeds. At present, the CGN gene bank contains <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> 11 Dutch rare poultry breeds. Also, CGN has performed research on the methodology for cryopreservation <b>of</b> fowl <b>semen.</b> This recent work was focused on finding a suitable replacement for glycerol, which is contraceptive in the hen, as a cryoprotectant.

By the end of the 60 days of supplementation, were realized three <b>collections</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> each stallion, on alternate days, for the assessment of fresh, cooled and cryopreserved semen. Motility and sperm motion kinetics using computerized assisted semen analysis and integrity of acrosome and plasmatic membrane using fluorescent dyes were evaluated. In animals that received treatment, it was observed that the fresh semen showed an improvement (P < 0. 05) in total motility (MT; 67. 14 ± 5. 24 x 72. 28 ± 8. 13 %), of the progressive motility (MP; 16. 67 ± 8. 69 x 22. 49 ± 8. 81 %), the average path velocity (VAP; 50. 21 ± 5. 30 µm/s), and the integrity of the plasmatic (MI; 72. 31 ± 6. 65 x 79. 27 ± 5. 30 %) and acrosome membranes (ISRA; 68. 67 ± 5. 79 x 74. 67 ± 6. 88 %). In cooled semen was obtained an increase (P < 0. 05) of the MT, the VAP, MI and ISRA in all moments of the evaluation (24 h, 36 h and 48 h), in animals that received the commercial product. After the evaluation <b>of</b> cryopreserved <b>semen,</b> there was an increase (P < 0. 05) of MT (33. 02 ± 10. 88 x 47, 50 ± 10. 61 %), MP (3. 77 ± 2. 75 x 9, 77 ± 4. 54 %), VAP (39. 29 ± 3. 24 x 44. 87 ± 1. 49 µm/s), and straight line velocity (VSL; 31. 94 ± 2. 02 x 35. 74 ± 1. 46 µm/s), in animals receiving treatment. Thus, the elements present in the commercial product supplied for the animals on the treatment group, may have acted improving the quality <b>of</b> fresh <b>semen,</b> cooled and cryopreserved of the stallions...|$|R
40|$|This study reports {{observations}} on the <b>collection</b> and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> from free-range populations of flying fox in Brisbane, Australia. Semen was successfully recovered by electroejaculation from 107 of 115 wild flying foxes (Pteropus alecto, Pteropus poliocephalus and Pteropus scapulatus). A proportion of ejaculates collected from all three species contained seminal vesicle secretions, the incidence of which appeared related to breeding season. Ejaculate volume was small (5 - 160 mu L), requiring a specialised collection vessel and immediate extension to avoid desiccation. Sperm morphological abnormalities and characteristics are described for the first time. In two species (P. scapulatus and P. alecto), sperm quality varied with breeding season. Dilution in Tris-citratefructose buffer and subsequent incubation (37 degrees C) <b>of</b> Pteropus <b>semen</b> for 2 - 3 h appeared to {{have a negative impact}} on sperm motility and the percentage of sperm with intact plasma membranes and acrosomes and represents a concern for the potential development and use of assisted breeding technology in these species. Preliminary attempts to develop a short-term chilled preservation protocol for flying fox semen revealed that spenn viability (percentage motility and percentage live sperm with intact acrosomes) was significantly reduced after 102 h chilled storage at 5 degrees C; nevertheless, approximately 40 % of the spermatozoa were still motile and contained intact acrosomes. Glycerol was neither protective nor detrimental to sperm survival during chilled storage. Microbial flora of the prepuce, urethra and <b>semen</b> <b>of</b> all species were isolated and their antibiotic susceptibility tested. Tetracycline, penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime were the most effective antibiotics in preventing growth of all identified bacteria; however, their effects on sperm survival were not investigated.

40|$|Semen was {{collected}} from 222 stallions of 13 breed or colour types in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales. A total of 648 collection attempts were made, using an artificial vagina, during 4 consecutive breeding seasons (1974 / 5 to 1977 / 8). Modifications {{were made to}} the techniques used by previous workers because collections were made at commercial studs using minimal animal restraint. Of all collection attempts, 621 (96 %) were successful, while at least one semen sample {{was collected}} from each of 216 stallions (97 %). There were no significant relationships between stallion collection failures and breeding season, time of year or age and breed of stallion. Time of year (seasons and months) was the only factor having a significant relationship with collection failures; highest failure rates occurring in autumn and winter.

40|$|Abstract Background Some breeds {{of sheep}} are highly {{seasonal}} {{in terms of}} reproductive capability, and these changes are regulated by photoperiod and melatonin secretion. These changes affect the reproductive performance of rams, impairing semen quality and modifying hormonal profiles. Also, the antioxidant defence systems seem to be modulated by melatonin secretion, and shows seasonal variations. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the presence of melatonin and testosterone in ram seminal plasma and their variations between the breeding and non-breeding seasons. In addition, we analyzed the possible correlations between these hormones and the antioxidant enzyme defence system activity. Methods Seminal plasma from nine Rasa Aragonesa rams were collected for one year, and their levels of melatonin, testosterone, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GRD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Results All samples presented measurable quantities of hormones and antioxidant enzymes. Both hormones showed monthly variations, with a decrease after the winter solstice and a rise after the summer solstice that reached the maximum levels in October-November, and a marked seasonal variation (P < 0. 01) with higher levels in the breeding season. The yearly pattern of GRD and catalase was close to that of melatonin, and GRD showed a significant seasonal variation (P < 0. 01) with a higher activity during the breeding season. Linear regression analysis between the studied hormones and antioxidant enzymes showed a significant correlation between melatonin and testosterone, GRD, SOD and catalase. Conclusions These results show the presence of melatonin and testosterone in ram seminal plasma, and that both hormones have seasonal variations, and support the idea that seasonal variations of fertility in the ram involve interplay between melatonin and the antioxidant defence system.

40|$|Background: The blood HIV RNA viral load is the best-defined {{predictor}} of HIV transmission, {{in part due}} to ease of measurement and the correlation of blood and genital tract (semen or cervico-vaginal) viral load, although recent studies found semen HIV RNA concentration to be a stronger {{predictor of}} HIV transmission. There is currently no standardized method for semen collection when measuring HIV RNA concentration. Therefore, we compared two collection techniques in order to study of the impact of antiretroviral therapy on the semen viral load. Methodology/Principal Findings: Semen was collected by masturbation from HIV-infected, therapy-naı̈ve {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) either undiluted (Visit 1) or directly into transport medium (Visit 2). Seminal plasma was then isolated, and the HIV RNA concentration obtained with each collection technique was measured and corrected for dilution if necessary. <b>Collection</b> <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> directly into transport medium resulted in a median HIV RNA viral load that was 0. 4 log 10 higher than undiluted samples.

40|$|The present paper describes, to our {{knowledge}} for the first time, the successful <b>collection</b> and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> from the Indian white-backed vulture (Gyps bengalensis), a critically en-dangered bird. Over a period <b>of</b> 2 yr, <b>semen</b> was collected using the manual massage method and evaluated for semen volume, semen pH, sperm concentration, percentage normal/abnormal spermatozoa, and percentage motile spermatozoa. It appears that the concentration of spermatozoa and percentage motile spermatozoa in the Indian white-backed vultures are low com-pared to those in other birds. Tyrode medium supplemented with albumin, lactate, and pyruvate (TALP) {{proved to be the}} best se-men extender compared to two others (Beltsville Poultry Semen Extender and Lake diluent). Furthermore, TALP with 20 % egg yolk and supplemented with 8 % dimethyl sulfoxide maintained 50 % of the initial percentage of motile spermatozoa following cryopreservation and thawing. A computer-aided semen analysis indicated that the spermatozoa of the Indian white-backed vul-ture are extremely active and swim in linear trajectories for up to 5 h following dilution in TALP. The trajectories were linear with time, but we noticed a decrease in the velocity parameters (average path velocity, curvilinear velocity, and progressive ve-locity). Thus, the present study provides baseline data on <b>semen</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the highly endangered Indian white-backed vulture, and these data could be of immense importance to re-productive and conservation biologists attempting to breed these animals in captivity, which to date has not been achieved. gamete biology, sperm, sperm motility and transpor...|$|R
40|$|Aproducer with a 200 -sow unit {{reported}} {{a problem that}} included sows not-in-pig at farrowing time in April 1991. An increase {{in the incidence of}} abortions, mummified fetuses, or vaginal discharges was not evident. The breeding herd was placed on tetracycline (400 grams per ton feed, 444 g/tonne feed). A serologicalscreen for six strains of leptospira (Leptospira pomona, L. icterohaemorrhagiae, L. grippotyphosa, L. canicola, L. bratislava and L. hardjo) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was submitted. Although suspicious antibody titers were detected,clinical signsand records analysis did not support their importance. The problem was limited to sows of at least one parity, which were bred exclusively by artificial insemination (AI). <b>Collection</b> and handling <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> and insemination followed accepted guidelines. However, semen analysis revealed that one of the two heavily used boars had immotile sperm. This boar was culled in April, 1991 and the problem assumed to be solved. However, the owner, now more aware <b>of</b> <b>semen</b> evaluation, found in May 1991 that seven of the eight boars assigned to the next breeding group ejaculated semen in which the sperm were not motile. We contacted Dr. Larry Evans,Iowa State University, who asked whether latex rubber gloves were used during semen collection. He had found a certain brand of latex gloves to be spermicidaLI Latex gloveshad been used on this farm since December 1, 1990. When a boar previously believed to be sterile was collected with the bare hand, sperm motility was normal. When sections of a latex glove (Cypress Corp.,Cleveland, Ohio) were mixed with an aliquot <b>of</b> the <b>semen,</b> all sperm were dead within seconds. Use of the gloves was discontinued on the farm in May 1991,and fertility returned to levels similar to those considered normal for the farm before December 1990 (Figs 1 - 2). We concluded that the increased numbers of sows not-inpig at farrowing time from 12 / 1 / 90 - 5 / 3 / 92 were due to poor semen viability resulting from AI after collecting semen with New Pitts burg Veterinary Clinic, 1436 Lincoln Way West...|$|R
