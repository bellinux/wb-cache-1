3000|$|Introduction: There {{are many}} {{surgical}} techniques {{for treatment of}} endometriomas but determination of the ideal laparoscopic technique remains controversial [...]. There are two risks associated with the surgical treatment of endometriomas: the risk of excessive {{and the risk of}} incomplete surgery.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{our initial}} {{experience with the}} second-generation Single Port Instrument Delivery Extended Reach (SPIDER) laparoendoscopic single-site surgical system in a porcine model. Materials and Methods: In four swine weighing approximately 32 to 35 kg, five nephrectomies, four adrenalectomies, three pyeloplasties, and three partial <b>cystectomies</b> and closures were performed by a single surgeon. The swine {{were placed in the}} lateral flank position under general anesthesia. The SPIDER surgical system was introduced through a single incision and the various urological procures were performed by use of flexible instrumentation. Results: All five nephrectomies, four adrenalectomies, three pyeloplasties, and three partial <b>cystectomies</b> and closures were performed successfully without additional skin incisions. The mean time to set up the SPIDER platform was 3. 5 minutes. The mean operative time for the right and left nephrectomies was 45. 4 minutes and 47. 8 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the right and left adrenalectomies was 37. 6 minutes and 35. 4 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the pyeloplasties for one right and two left ureters was 45. 6 minutes and 47. 3 minutes, respectively. The mean operative time for the partial <b>cystectomies</b> and closures was 18. 6 minutes. There were no noticeable intraoperative complications except for minimal urine leakage in the first pyeloplasty. Conclusions: In this initial pilot evaluation, the second-generation SPIDER surgical system offered intuitive instrument maneuverability and restored triangulation. However, retraction was challenging {{because of the lack of}} strength and the limited ability for precise manipulation of the tip. Future refinements of the technology and prospective studies are needed to optimize the application of this technology in urology. © The Korean Urological Association, 2013...|$|R

Level 3 procedures were being performed by a handful of respondents under direct supervision only.|$|R
30|$|During {{the study}} period 88 laparoscopic {{surgeries}} were performed, including 21 diagnostic laparoscopies, 16 bilateral (BSO) and eight unilateral (USO) salpingo-oopherectomies, 15 ovarian <b>cystectomies,</b> six bilateral tubal ligations (BTL), 18 sub-total hysterectomies (STLH), including ten combined with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomies and four total hysterectomies (TLH), including two bilateral salpingo-oopherectomies. Only one laparoscopy was converted to laparotomy. The patient belonged to the 3 D VS- 1 system group and conversion was performed due to ovarian malignancy diagnosed during surgery.|$|R

30|$|Results: Obtained {{results are}} {{presented}} graphically in percentages by means of diagrams. Majority of patients, or 61 of them (75.3 %) suffered from ovarian endometriosis/endometrium, while 20 patients had pelvic endometriosis. Twelve (12) patients (14.8 %) suffered from endometriosis gradus III/IV. The laparoscopic surgery was successfully performed for all patients, and there were neither conversions in laparotomy nor ovariectomy nor adnexectomy. It were performed 40 cystotomies (66 %) and 21 <b>cystectomies</b> (34 %). The postoperative course with all patients was regular and an average length of hospitalization took 2 [*]±[*] 0.5  days.|$|R
50|$|A cystourethrectomy or cysto-urethrectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which the}} urinary bladder and male urethra are removed. The procedure combines a <b>cystectomy</b> and a urethrectomy.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} of radiation and chemotherapy {{in conjunction with}} transurethral (endoscopic) bladder tumor resection {{can also be used}} to treat invasive disease. Review of available large data series on this so-called trimodality therapy has indicated similar long-term cancer specific survival rates, with improved overall quality of life versus patients undergoing radical <b>cystectomy</b> with urinary reconstruction. These patients are usually highly selected and do not have multi-focal disease or carcinoma in-situ, which is associated with a higher rate of recurrence, progression, and death from bladder cancer versus patients who undergo radical <b>cystectomy.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} there is {{invasion}} of bladder, it is treated in similar manner to abdominal pregnancy and manual placental removal is avoided. However, this may eventually need hysterectomy and/or partial <b>cystectomy.</b>|$|E
30|$|Results: In laparoscopy, we performed: 383 <b>cystectomies</b> (81 %); 52 drainages and coagulations of the cyst wall (11 %), whose 29 for cysts < 3  cm, 18 for omolateral adhesions AFS score > 16 and in five cases both {{of these}} {{conditions}} were fulfilled; 36 adnexectomy (8 %), whose 13 in women > 40  years, 12 for omolateral adhesions AFS score > 16 and 11 cases were due to {{both of these}} conditions. We experienced 11 complications, whose one post-laparotomy and the other ten during or after laparoscopy (one intraoperative and nine postoperative) on a total number of 374 laparoscopic interventions (2.7 %).|$|R
30|$|The bladder {{operations}} were mostly partial <b>cystectomies</b> (n =  41, groups A, B, and C), and shaving of the endometriotic nodule was performed twice (group A). Seventy-two {{percent of them}} were operated upon via laparoscopy; laparotomy was chosen in connection with several DIE lesions. All cases of isolated bladder endometriosis (group A) and concomitant six cases of ureteral shavings were operated laparoscopically (group B). The median size of the bladder nodules was 3  cm (range 2 – 4  cm) and their locations were in the bladder dome in 17 (40  %), the posterior wall in 24 (56  %), and the trigone in two (5  %) of the cases.|$|R
40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a recent advance {{in the field of}} {{gynecological}} surgery. There are innumerable reports in literature on its advantages and disadvantages. However, problems faced by the surgical pathologist during grossing and histopathological reporting of these morcellated specimens have never been discussed before. We present our experience and the difficulties faced by a gynecologic pathologist (first author) and try to provide some clues for their solution. Materials and Methods: Sample size was 153 consecutive laparoscopic specimens, which varied from in toto uterus with cervix, fibroid or ovarian cyst to morcellated specimens. 153 non-laparoscopic gynecologic specimens constituted controls; 34. 0 &#x 0025; were ovarian <b>cystectomies</b> and remaining 66. 0 &#x 0025; were hysterectomies, myomectomies and salpingectomies, of which 36. 6 &#x 0025; were morcellated, rest were in toto. Result: Contents were not seen in majority of the ovarian <b>cystectomies.</b> Many more sections were taken in morcellated specimens, as compared to controls, for identification of endometrium, endocervix and ectocervix. Even then, in occasional cases identification was not possible. Congested bits in morcellated specimens interpreted as endometrium on grossing turned out to be parametrial tissue. Ectocervix could be identified as soft tissue bits covered by whitish membrane. Identification of transformation zone of the cervix was not possible in any of the morcellated hysterectomy specimens. Conclusion: The advantage of laparoscopic gynecological surgery to the patient need not prove to be so for surgical pathologist. The present study does not discourage gynecologists from performing laparoscopic surgeries but wishes to highlight the surgical pathologist&#x 2032;s problems and limitations...|$|R

5000|$|From 1872 {{he was a}} {{hospital}} surgeon in Köln, where in 1875 he introduced Listerian antisepsis. In 1884 he received the title of professor, {{even though he was}} not a member on any university's academic staff.Bardenheuer specialized in genitourinary surgery, and in 1887 performed the first complete <b>cystectomy.</b> This operation involved a patient who was suffering from an advanced bladder tumour that affected both ureters. The patient died two weeks after the surgery from uremia and hydronephrosis [...] - [...] nevertheless, Bardenheuer was able to prove the technical workability of the surgery.

50|$|For muscle {{invasive}} urothelial {{urinary bladder}} cancer {{there are a}} number of treatment options. Gold standard is radical <b>cystectomy</b> as mentioned. In males this usually includes also the removal of the prostate and in females; ovaries, uterus and parts of the vagina.|$|E
30|$|Apart from {{sporadic}} case reports, {{review of}} the literature revealed a total of 14 studies documenting 470 laparoscopic dermoid <b>cystectomies.</b> Spillage occurred in 310 cases (66 %). The significant postoperative complications were seen in only one case [11], with chronic granulomatous peritonitis occurring 9 months postoperatively. However, in some of these studies, {{there was no mention of}} precaution techniques to avoid spillage or measures to clean up the pelvis after surgery. We presume that sticking to the rule of jet-wash irrigation with copious amounts of fluid, removing up to microscopic particles of cyst contents, is the gold standard to avoid complications. Importantly, there was no significant difference in complication rates between the spillage and nonspillage groups in our study. Additionally, cyst size had no impact on spillage rate. Surprisingly, we encountered easier dissection enucleation for larger cysts than for small ones.|$|R
30|$|After obtaining written {{informed}} consent, women {{recruited to}} the study had their laparoscopic procedures performed in the usual manner {{as determined by the}} treating surgeon. Details of the operation, including indications for the procedure, complexity of the procedure, degree of pelvic adhesions, primary operator, surgical outcomes, entry technique and any difficulties encountered, surgical landmark identification, any surgical or anaesthetic complications, and whether conversion to laparotomy was required, were documented by the operating surgeon {{at the conclusion of the}} procedure on a data collection sheet. Simple operative procedures included ovarian <b>cystectomies,</b> bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), management of ectopic pregnancies and excision of stages I–II endometriosis. Complex operative procedures included excision of stage III endometriosis, and advanced procedures included total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and management of stage IV endometriosis. The degree of pelvic adhesions was scored qualitatively from nil to severe.|$|R
