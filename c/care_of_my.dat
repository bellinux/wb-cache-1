Thereafter, {{she spent}} {{three years in the}} United States, where starred in several Hollywood films. She told of how she benefited from the arrangement, explaining it was an American initiative {{at a time when they}} invited all the successful European actresses to perform in their pictures, hoping to create a monopoly. Many suffered from the experience, but she was able to hold her own: [...] "I took <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own interests, blankly refusing to sign an exclusive contract with Universal Studios. I only signed for individual films. In the end, everything worked out fine for me.|$|E
500|$|The {{results of}} Gay's first 2004 US Olympic Trials {{confirmed}} {{his status as}} a rising contender in the 100m and 200m events. Although he did not reach the final of either event, he reached the semis of the highly competitive 100m and posted a 200m personal best of 20.07s in the qualifying stages. A hamstring injury due to dehydration prevented Gay from competing in the 200m final, but he did not see the trials as a missed opportunity, rather a springboard for future events: [...] "I was really focused upon the team, had a great shot, but it was a learning experience—how to take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body." [...] The end of year Track and Field News rankings for United States sprinters showed him to be the eighth fastest 100m runner and the fourth fastest sprinter over 200m that year—indicative of his potential, he was younger than all those ranked ahead of him.|$|E

[...] Her mother stayed with Poe until {{his own death}} in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family {{received}} many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's {{and asked her to}} [...] "be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him". Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors. She provided Virginia with a comforter as her only other cover was Poe's old military cloak, as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank [...] "smiling, even when difficult to get it down". Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.|$|E

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled.

500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people".

He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986.

[...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E
500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, but never mind my leg: take <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E
