25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year. This was due to casting problems with the aluminum three speed transmission case which resulted in technical service bulletins to dealers advising {{of the potential for}} differential failure due to external leaks {{at the front of the}} transmission's <b>counter</b> <b>gear</b> shaft. The revision of the four speed transmission designated for 1961 introduction incorporated a cast iron case and a redesign of the differential pinion shaft to interface with a longer transmission output shaft and a concentric pilot for the revised transmission case. These are among many of the course corrections undertaken by Chevrolet by the end of the 1960 model year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − A <b>counter</b> <b>gear</b> transmits the {{rotation}} angle, so the angular velocity {{ratio of the}} gear does not nec-essarily need to be constant in the meshing process. As a pinion has {{a small number of}} teeth when combined with an internal gear for counters, tooth interference can occur with the use of an involute curve. This paper introduces circular arcs that represent a tooth profile and fillet for the profile design of a pinion through the combination of arcs with lines. The straight line of a rack tooth represents the profile of a mating inter-nal gear. Thus, the circular arc and line maintain contact during {{the rotation}} of the <b>counter</b> <b>gear.</b> This paper presents an analysis of the meshing of the circular arc tooth and rack tooth along with the properties of the <b>counter</b> <b>gear,</b> such as the change in rotational velocity and amount of backlash. The contact ratio of the <b>counter</b> <b>gear</b> is 1 because the tooth contact occurs between circular arcs and line. The initial position of tooth contact, which denotes the simultaneous contact of two teeth, is found. As the rotation of the pinion, only one tooth keeps the contact situation. This meshing property is analyzed by the geometrical constraints of the tooth profile in contact and the results are presented as graphical diagrams in which tooth-arc move-ments are superimposed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSurface rolling {{experiments}} and surface durability tests {{were carried out}} using Cr−Mo and Ni−Mo pre-alloyed sintered steel spur pinion gears with different densities fabricated by powder metallurgy (P/M). The P/M gear specimens were machined from sintered packs made from the single-press single-sinter route and some were surface-rolled using a high-precision CNC form-rolling machine of two roller-dies transverse-type. A fully densified surface layer less than 2 % porosity was obtained on the tooth flank approximately 0. 5 mm thick when P/M pinions with a density of 7. 4 Mg/m 3 or more were surface-rolled using the amount of stock rolled at 0. 15 mm. The load bearing capacity of P/M pinions were estimated by gear running tests using a power re-circulating type testing rig. A <b>counter</b> <b>gear</b> was made of standard grade Cr−Mo wrought steel. All test gears were case-carburized under identical conditions and finished by grinding. The representative damages for every P/M pinion were pitting near the pitch point.

50|$|The Jones Counter is {{a device}} fitted {{to the front}} wheel of a bicycle that counts the {{revolutions}} of the wheel.

One count typically corresponds to about 1/20th of a wheel revolution (this varies if a different gear ratio is used); this provides a resolution of about 10 cm in course length, although overall accuracy, depending on calibration and other factors, is lower, but normally better than 1 part in 1,000.|$|R

Our software uses configuration spaces to model the kinematic function of micro-mechanisms. It uses the configuration spaces to perform real-time simulation, to compute functional kinematic tolerances, and to support parametric design. Designers can visualize system function under a range of operating conditions, can find and correct design flaws, and can optimize dynamical function.

The prototype of CR-WT was tested in the open type wind tunnel with the velocities of 1. 5, 2. 0, 3. 0, 4. 0 and 5. 0 m/s. CR-WT consisted of 8 blades. The blade is made of wood. It consists of 2 hubs 2 axis and 4 arms. The inner axis is clockwise rotation and outer axis is anticlockwise rotation. The inner and outer are in the identical axis. Both axes are driven the pulley by using the <b>counter</b> rotating <b>gear.</b> The analysis of the experimental results showed that the cut in wind speed of CR-WT was 1. 744 m/s and it is increasing when the tangential force ratio increasing.

5000|$|The ASCC {{was built}} from switches, relays, {{rotating}} shafts, and clutches. It used 765,000 electromechanical components {{and hundreds of}} miles of wire, comprising a volume of [...] - 51 ft in length, 8 ft in height, and 2 ft deep. It weighed about 10,000 lb. The basic calculating units had to be synchronized and powered mechanically, so they were run by a 50 ft shaft driven by a [...] electric motor, which served as the main power source and system clock. From the IBM Archives: The Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) was the first operating machine that could execute long computations automatically. A project conceived by Harvard University’s Dr. Howard Aiken, the Mark I was built by IBM engineers in Endicott, N.Y. A steel frame 51 ft long and eight feet high held the calculator, which consisted of an interlocking panel of small <b>gears,</b> <b>counters,</b> switches and control circuits, all only a few inches in depth. The ASCC used 500 mi of wire with three million connections, 3,500 multipole relays with 35,000 contacts, 2,225 counters, 1,464 tenpole switches and tiers of 72 adding machines, each with 23 significant numbers. It was the industry’s largest electromechanical calculator.|$|R
5000|$|The Curta {{calculator}} {{used the}} method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides {{along the side of}} the device. The number on each slide was added to a result <b>counter</b> by a <b>gearing</b> mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating [...] "echelon drum" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "step drum"). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its [...] "6" [...] position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines' complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The shifted drum also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for {{the method of}} complements). The always present tens' complement [...] "overflow 1" [...] which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.|$|R
