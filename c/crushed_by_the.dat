5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{significantly}} underestimating {{the size}} of the position they faced, the Australians had succeeded in the pushing D445 VC Battalion and 3/33 NVA Regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around the battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had either been removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923, {{the unit}} was renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler"). The unit was solely {{responsible}} for Hitler's protection. On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, {{took part in the}} Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to seize control of the city in a coup d'état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local police and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison.

It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach its destination the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her.

In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching Euboea in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to put Eretria under siege. The siege lasted six days before a fifth column of Eretrian nobles betrayed {{the city to the}} Persians. The city was plundered, and the population enslaved on Darius's orders. The Eretrian prisoners were eventually taken to Persia and settled as colonists in Cissia.|$|E
5|$|The {{protracted}} {{period of}} {{war between the}} Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights was ended on 12 October 1398 by the Treaty of Salynas, named after the islet in the Neman River where it was signed. Lithuania agreed to cede Samogitia and assist the Teutonic Order in a campaign to seize Pskov, while the Order agreed to assist Lithuania in a campaign to seize Novgorod. Shortly afterwards, Vytautas was crowned as a king by local nobles; but the following year his forces and those of his ally, Khan Tokhtamysh of the White Horde, were <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Timurids at the Battle of the Vorskla River, ending his imperial ambitions {{in the east and}} obliging him to submit to Władysław's protection once more.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRing shear {{tests were}} carried out on a {{compacted}} low plasticity infilled joint soil from Beihetan site. Different initial water contents (5. 0, 9. 0 and 13. 5 %) were considered. It was observed that the failure envelope is linear for the peak deviator stress but highly non-linear for the residual deviator stress {{in the range of}} high normal stresses (higher than 400 kPa), evidencing the particle crushing effect on the residual strength. Furthermore, this particle crushing effect was water content dependent: the residual friction angle is larger at higher water content. Further grain size analysis on the portion taken in the zone of shear band after each test was performed, and changes of the fractions of 75 µm and 2 µm were compared for different water contents. The results indicate clearly that the effect of water content on particle crushing depends on the particles size. For large particles (> 75 µm), water content increase enhances <b>the</b> particle <b>crushing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fracture mechanism. On the contrary, for smaller particles (< 2 µm), water content increase reduces <b>the</b> particle <b>crushing</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of attrition or abrasion. Deeper analysis of the effect of the ratio of the final to initial fraction of the particle size less than 2 µm, S 2, on the shear strength suggests that the effect of particle crushing on the residual shear strength is mainly through the production of extra clay size particles (< 2 µm) ...|$|R
5|$|There {{were several}} {{candidates}} for the Commonwealth crown considered {{after the death of}} Stephen Báthory, including Archduke Maximilian of Austria. Anna Jagiellon proposed and pushed for the election of her nephew Sigismund Vasa, son of John III, King of Sweden and Catherine Jagellon and the Swedish heir apparent. The Zamoyski faction supported Sigismund, the faction led by the Zborowski family wanted Maximilian; two separate elections took place and a civil war resulted. The Habsburg's army entered Poland and attacked Kraków, but was repulsed there and then, while retreating in Silesia, <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> forces organized by Jan Zamoyski at the Battle of Byczyna (1588), where Maximilian was taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece.

The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam, having {{consolidated}} {{his control}} over Baghdad, now {{turned to face}} the threat posed by the Buyids. To this end, he strengthened his ties with the Baridis of Basra, by handing over Wasit, as previously agreed, appointing Abu Abdallah al-Baridi as vizier of the Abbasid court (although the latter remained at Wasit and did not visit Baghdad), and, finally, by marrying himself to one of al-Baridi's daughters. Bajkam's success against the Buyids was mixed: Wasit was saved from Buyid attack, and the Baridis led a successful campaign in Susiana, but an expedition into Jibal was <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> third Buyid brother, Hasan. The alliance with the Baridis quickly soured, however, as al-Baridi still maintained his ambition of replacing Bajkam, and ajkam was aware of this. In late August 940, Bajkam removed al-Baridi from the vizierate and launched an attack on Wasit, which the Baridis abandoned without resistance. In the meantime, the Baghdad was in turmoil as religious violence had become commonplace, with fanatical members of the Hanbali school imposing their tenets on the general populace.|$|E

5|$|In 1868 popular uprisings {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within the middle classes and the military (led by General Joan Prim), who {{were concerned about the}} ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent into chaos. Uprisings were <b>crushed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> military. The old monarchy returned with the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).|$|E
