Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent <b>color</b> <b>bleeding.</b> However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with {{the exception of the}} 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials [...] "AL" [...] to honor team owner Al Lerner who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.|$|E
50|$|In {{printing}} and graphic arts, mixing of two dissimilar colors in two adjacent printed dots before they dry and absorb in substrate {{is referred to}} as <b>color</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Unless it is done for effect, <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> reduces print quality.|$|E

50|$|Colored {{wrapping}} tissue can be {{used for}} an assortment of visually creative purposes. For example, when wetted, the <b>color</b> <b>bleeds</b> a watercolor-like layer of tissue paper that stays when you peel off the tissue paper. Tissue paper can be crumpled up to form objects, such as flowers.|$|R
50|$|Consumers can refill ink {{cartridges}} {{themselves with a}} kit, or they can take the cartridge to a refiller or remanufacturer where ink is pumped back into cartridges made up of components from previously used cartridge products. PC World reports that refilled cartridges have higher failure rates, print fewer pages than new cartridges, and demonstrate more on-page problems like streaking, curling, and <b>color</b> <b>bleed.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} graphics and 3D rendering, <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> is the phenomenon in which objects or surfaces are colored by reflection of colored light from nearby surfaces.|$|E

50|$|Another {{common problem}} is <b>color</b> <b>bleeding.</b> For example, washing a red shirt with white {{underwear}} {{can result in}} pink underwear. Often only like colors are washed together to avoid this problem, which is lessened by cold water and repeated washings.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} problem, luminance {{interference in}} chroma, is {{the appearance of}} a colored noise in image areas with high levels of detail. This results from high-frequency luminance detail crossing into the frequencies used by the chrominance channel and producing false coloration, known as <b>color</b> <b>bleed.</b> Bleed can also make narrowly spaced text difficult to read. Some computers, such as the Apple II, utilized this to generate color.|$|R
5000|$|However, all {{of these}} {{projects}} had problems with <b>colors</b> <b>bleeding</b> from one phosphor to another. In spite of their best efforts, the wide electron beams simply could not focus tightly enough to hit the individual dots, at least over {{the entirety of the}} screen. Moreover, most of these devices were unwieldy; the arrangement of the electron guns around the outside of the screen resulted in a very large display with considerable [...] "dead space".|$|R
50|$|Diffuse {{interreflection}} {{is apparent}} when light from one diffuse object is reflected onto another. Photon mapping is particularly adept at handling this effect because the algorithm reflects photons from one surface to another {{based on that}} surface's bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and thus light from one object striking another is a natural result of the method. Diffuse interreflection was first modeled using radiosity solutions. Photon mapping differs though in that it separates the light transport from {{the nature of the}} geometry in the scene. <b>Color</b> <b>bleed</b> is an example of diffuse interreflection.|$|R
50|$|Printed {{magazines}} and newspapers often use a halftone system. Typical newsprint paper is not very dense, and has relatively high dot gain or <b>color</b> <b>bleeding,</b> so newsprint is usually around 85 LPI. Higher-quality paper, such as that used in commercial magazines, has less dot gain, and can range up to 300 LPI with quality glossy (coated) paper.|$|E
50|$|This simple {{approach}} {{works well}} {{in areas with}} constant color or smooth gradients, but it can cause artifacts such as <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> in areas where there are abrupt changes in color or brightness especially noticeable along sharp edges in the image. Because of this, other demosaicing methods attempt to identify high-contrast edges and only interpolate along these edges, but not across them.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} kit {{colors in}} 1899 were all white. This {{turned out to}} be problematic at that time. To avoid <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> from the red and yellow club badge when cleaning the white shirts, the badge had to be removed from each shirt prior to washing and then re-attached afterwards. The club therefore changed to dark blue, and is now nicknamed after the dark blue color of their shirts.|$|E
50|$|Greater Buffalo Press (GBP) {{developed}} and improved web-fed four color rotogravure technology, {{which was used}} to print color comic supplements inserted in Sunday newspapers, and color advertising inserts for daily and weekend newspapers. In four-color rotogravure printing, long rolls of newsprint are fed to the press four separate times, one for each color. The ability to align the feeds longitudinally and laterally is critical to quality control, as any misalignment results in color gaps, or <b>colors</b> <b>bleeding</b> to spaces they were not intended to cover. Its principal competitor was Waterbury, Connecticut's Eastern Color Printing.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{artists who}} favor using {{monochromatic}} color palettes (one color but in different shades), especially grey tones, often use India ink {{for its ability}} to be mixed in water for lighter colors as well as its ability to layer <b>colors</b> without <b>bleeding.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Canadian {{animator}} John Kricfalusi (of The Ren & Stimpy Show fame) {{has become}} a prominent critic of digital remastering, particularly in regards to its effects on Western animation. In his blog [...] "John K. Stuff," [...] he has admonished remasters for over-saturating colors and sharpening lines {{to the point of}} <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> (among other criticisms). He has gone on record in his blog to describe remastering as [...] "digital ruination" [...] and [...] "digital destruction." ...|$|E
50|$|Most digital {{cinematography}} systems {{further reduce}} data rate by subsampling color information. Because the human visual system {{is much more}} sensitive to luminance than to color, lower resolution color information can be overlaid with higher resolution luma (brightness) information, to create an image that looks very similar to one in which both color and luma information are sampled at full resolution. This scheme may cause pixelation or <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> under some circumstances. High quality digital cinematography systems are capable of recording full resolution color data (4:4:4) or raw sensor data.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{of the low}} {{capacity}} of Game Boy Advance cartridges (ranging from 4 to 32 MB) {{and the length of}} the video content (generally feature-length movies and episodes), GBA Video Paks are heavily compressed, with visual artifacts marring nearly every frame. The image quality has a similar appearance to early Cinepak compression, and the [...] "quilting" [...] and <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> effect found in other compressed video formats is also present. Also, in cases where certain videos are available both as a 45-minute two-part episodes or a 22-minute edited version, the 22-minute version is used.|$|E
50|$|Dot crawl can {{be greatly}} reduced {{by using a}} good comb filter in the {{receiver}} to separate the encoded chrominance signal from the luminance signal. When the NTSC standard was adopted in the 1950s, TV engineers realized that it should theoretically be possible to design a filter to properly separate the luminance and chroma signals. However, the vacuum tube-based electronics of the time did not permit any cost-effective method of implementing a comb filter. Thus, the early color TVs used only notch filters, which cut the luminance off at 3.5 MHz. This effectively reduced the luminance bandwidth (normally 4 MHz) {{to that of the}} chroma, causing considerable <b>color</b> <b>bleed.</b> By the 1970s, TVs had begun using solid-state electronics and the first comb filters appeared. However, they were expensive and only high-end models used them, while most color sets continued to use notch filters.|$|R

50|$|Version {{one first}} {{appeared}} {{with the release}} of QuickTime 3 on March 30, 1998. The backward-compatible version two was released with QuickTime 4 on March 11, 1999, which mainly included minor improvements and optimizations to the Developer Edition of the encoder, so encoded movies would be backwards compatible with the QuickTime 3 release. Changes for version two were only made to the encoder, not to the compression format. This format uses a YCbCr 4:1:0 color space, which means every block of eight pixels share the same color components, which can cause <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> across pixels. This was solved in version 3 and the Spark version which both use the more common YCbCr 4:2:0 color space. FFmpeg supports decoding of Sorenson Video since 2002, encoding of SVQ1 was added in 2004 for 0.4.9-pre1.|$|E
5000|$|Notable {{differences}} between the PS2 and NGC versions are minor, ranging from shadowing to the framerate itself. The GameCube version continues to use a soft filter over its shadows whilst the PS2 version maintains the same bare bilinear filtering of the original versions. Some shadow spotlights are even missing from the NGC version as well, {{such as in the}} vents of LAX. The NGC version, as can be seen in-game, can slow worse than the PS2 version, yet can reach 60fps where the PS2 doesn't. While the base is similar, unlike the PS2/Xbox/PC version, thermal in the NGC also lacked a final touch, the full screen <b>color</b> <b>bleeding</b> [...] "infrared" [...] post effect.

40|$|Quilts {{need special}} care in cleaning, but even {{professionals}} don 2 ̆ 7 t always {{agree on the}} best methods for cleaning quilts or even {{whether it should be}} done. No two quilts are alike. Methods suited for cleaning one quilt may not be best for another. The fiber content, dyes, and construction make each one unique. Sometimes it may be advisable to clean a quilt. Usually it is best to leave it as is. Deciding whether to clean a quilt involves careful thought. What is the fiber content? How is the quilt constructed? Can it withstand movement or agitation? Will the <b>colors</b> <b>bleed</b> or fade? How valuable is it to you? How will you feel if it is damaged by your choice of cleaning method? Do you have the equipment and space to clean the quilt? Improper cleaning can permanently damage your quilt. Make your decision carefully. Very old, fragile, or valuable quilts should be cleaned by a professional textile conservator - not at home. Contact a local or area museum, university, or the American Institute for Conservation, 1717 K Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20006, 202 / 452 - 9545 for names of professional conservators in your area.

5000|$|Slonem's obsessive and {{repetitive}} {{rendering of}} his subjects reflects his desire to explore issues of spatial complexity, compression and density in what the acclaimed Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler deemed “a consistent investigation of post-cubist abstraction.” The repetitive imagery also makes a reference to Andy Warhol. [...] "I was influenced by Warhol's repetition of soup cans and Marilyn," [...] says Slonem. [...] "But I'm more interested in {{doing it in the}} sense of prayer, with repetition... It's really a form of worship." [...] He is not interested in realism or, unlike Warhol, in advertising or media, and his paintings are neither narrative nor specific in detail. Rather, Slonem's work is deeply rooted in the act of painting. His jarring color choices, spontaneous mark making, and scratched hatch marks are the result of his ongoing fascination with the manipulation and implementation of paint. For Slonem, cross-hatching has [...] "a feeling of a tapestry, it’s like weaving. I’m making <b>colors</b> <b>bleed</b> into each other, I’m revealing the under-painting.
