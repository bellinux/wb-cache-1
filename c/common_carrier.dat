Therefore, the FCC Open Internet Order 2010 regulations, which could only be applied to <b>common</b> <b>carriers,</b> could not be applied to broadband providers.

25|$|The American Messenger Company focused {{primarily}} on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client the United States Postal Service. In 1913 the company acquired a Model T Ford as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle. In 1916 Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919 the company expanded {{for the first time}} outside of Seattle to Oakland, California and changed its name to United Parcel Service. The name change to United Parcel Service was to remind the company expansion that operations were still United under the same organisation and Parcel identified the type of business offered as part of its Service. <b>Common</b> <b>carrier</b> service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> service. At first <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924 a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.|$|E

25|$|The Reading Company {{was forced}} to file for {{bankruptcy}} protection in 1971. The bankruptcy {{was a result of}} dwindling coal shipping revenues, freight being diverted to highways by trucking companies, and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set prices, required fair taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing lines as a <b>common</b> <b>carrier.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{these factors}} {{were related to}} a failure by the Modernisation Plan to {{successfully}} redfine what {{the purpose of the}} railways were - British Railways remained bound by its legal status as a <b>common</b> <b>carrier,</b> which obligated it to provide carriage for virtually any type of goods, regardless of quantity (large or small) from any two stations on the network, at set and published rates. This legislation dated back to the 19th century to prevent the railways abusing their monopoly as the sole practical long-distance transport provider for much of the country but the growth of road transport had left the railways locked into a highly disadvantageous position. Road freight operators had no legal restrictions and could turn down work that was uneconomic, which BR could not, and could easily undercut BR's carriage rates which the railway could not alter without legal consent. The <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> requirements also saddled BR with the necessity to maintain thousands of goods yards and other facilities, plus rolling stock and staff to service them, even when there was ever-decreasing actual demand for such services and such traffic as did exist was very rarely profitable. This issue had been identified during the Great Depression and the Big Four had campaigned for repeal of the <b>common</b> <b>carrier</b> legislation as a 'Fair Deal' during the 1930s. However this did not happen until the Transport Act 1962 gave BR freedom of contract - until then the Modernisation Plan had to commission locomotives, rolling stock and facilities to manage the ever-declining but legally-required wagonload freight traffic.|$|E
