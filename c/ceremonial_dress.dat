5|$|As {{detailed}} in the De Ceremoniis, the Droungarios of the Watch always accompanied the Emperor {{and was a}} frequent participant in various imperial ceremonies, often accompanied by his principal aide, the akolouthos. His <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> is indicated as the skaramangion tunic and a red sagion cloak, while on some occasions he bore a sword, a mace and an axe. The latter weapon was highly unusual for a Byzantine officer, and the French scholar Rodolphe Guilland suggests that this was connected to his command of foreign troops via the akolouthos (who later notably became {{the commander of the}} axe-bearing Varangian Guard). In the 10th century, when several holders of the post were scions of the most prominent families of the military aristocracy, including Eustathios Argyros, John Kourkouas and Manuel Kourtikes, the droungarios occupied the 36th place in the imperial hierarchy and usually held the senior court dignities of anthypatos, patrikios or prōtospatharios.|$|E

25|$|Praxis almost {{disappeared}} {{in the years after}} the 25 de Abril revolution of 1974. Timidly it was reinstated in the 1980s. However the significance of the traditional academic attire changed substantially. In earlier centuries it was common practice for a student to wear if for the length of his studies. Students occasionally slept in it when consumption of wine frustrated their efforts to reach home. The cape would {{get to the end of}} studies, heavily cut by friends and particularly with a deep cut for each girlfriend. Today the academic attire is a <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> to use in formal students ceremonial. It is also somewhat expensive, and not the practical dress of time past.|$|E
25|$|In colonial times, a {{judge in}} Singapore dressed {{in a manner similar}} to some of his {{counterparts}} in the United Kingdom. He wore a long scarlet robe with a grey cape or mantle and a black scarf around his shoulders, a white wing-collared shirt, and bands (a linen collar made of two rectangular pieces tied at the throat). Subsequently, the ordinary and <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> worn by judges was adapted from two of the various forms of court dress of English courts. On 9 January 1993, at the Opening of the Legal Year, the Chief Justice announced that judges would henceforth wear a lightweight black robe over an ordinary white shirt with a turn-down collar and a tie. The difficulty of obtaining shirts with wing collars and the growing sense that the traditional gown was inappropriate for the judiciary of an independent republic were cited as reasons for this change. On ceremonial occasions such as the Opening of the Legal Year, Supreme Court judges wear red robes with a black strip around the collar and extending down the front of the robe. The black strip on the Chief Justice's robe is edged with gold.|$|E

500|$|When the Regiment {{returned}} to Bulawayo, {{it found that}} Brady Barracks had been ransacked, with over four-fifths of the men losing all of their civilian clothes and personal belongings. The RLI was due to transfer to Salisbury in any case, with a state-of-the art headquarters at Cranborne Barracks already under construction, but {{in light of the}} burglary it relocated first to Inkomo Garrison, about [...] away from the capital. The Battalion settled at Cranborne in April 1962, {{and at the same time}} received approval from the British College of Arms for its regimental badge. The RLI's <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> was also adopted at this time: tartan green was chosen with peaked caps. A riot at Kariba occasioned the RLI's deployment to resolve the violence, but on arrival the troops found that they had little to do, their mere presence having restored order. They instead found work assisting in Operation Noah, an animal-rescue exercise made necessary by the construction of the Kariba Dam on the Zambezi and resultant rising of the waters into what became Lake Kariba.|$|E
500|$|The {{reverse is}} based on a statue of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii, {{designed}} by Thomas R. Gould, and intended [...] "to symbolize the past and future glory of the Kingdom [...] ". The sculpture that stands in downtown Honolulu (1883) is a replacement for one that sank while being transported from Germany; the original (1880) was later salvaged and stands at Kohala on the island of Hawaii. The coin features a Hawaiian chieftain in <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> surmounting the top of a hill, with his arm extended in greeting. He represents Hawaii rising from obscurity. The palm tree that rises above him is intended to signify romance. A Hawaiian village at Waikiki Beach with Diamond Head nearby are seen behind him, representing history and antiquity. The design is almost free of lettering, with only [...] "E PLURIBUS UNUM" [...] ("Out of many, one") and 1778 1928 to be seen. Ferns are visible under that Latin motto: Houston wanted the plants removed, but Beach insisted on retaining them to balance the design. Juliette Fraser had made a number of sketches, all with the same basic design elements, but with the chieftain in various poses and with Diamond Head in different positions.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{visited his}} {{aunt and uncle}} in Windsor on leave in May 1975, [...] "proudly wearing his uniform", {{journalist}} Tony Wanless writes. Turned out in the RLI's tartan green <b>ceremonial</b> <b>dress</b> and green beret, he was conspicuous walking along Ouellette Avenue, one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. [...] "He had the uniform and looked a little different," [...] Richard told the Windsor Star a year later, [...] "but I never forgot his face." [...] Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused {{to leave the house}} alone. While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he [...] "didn't want it associated with his adopted country". He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.|$|E
