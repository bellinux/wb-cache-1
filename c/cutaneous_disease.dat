6000|$|... [Footnote 59: In the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions, vol. liii. (1870), Dr. Ogle has adduced some curious {{physiological}} facts {{bearing on}} {{the presence or absence}} of white colours in the higher animals. He states that a dark pigment in the olfactory region of the nostrils is essential to perfect smell, and that this pigment is rarely deficient except when the whole animal is pure white, and the creature is then almost without smell or taste. He observes that there is no proof that, in any of the cases given above, the black animals actually eat the poisonous root or plant; and that the facts are readily understood if the senses of smell and taste are dependent on a pigment which is absent in the white animals, who therefore eat what those gifted with normal senses avoid. This explanation however hardly seems to cover the facts. We cannot suppose that almost all the sheep in the world (which are mostly white) are without smell or taste. The <b>cutaneous</b> <b>disease</b> on the white patches of hair on horses, the special liability of white terriers to distemper, of white chickens to the gapes, and of silkworms which produce yellow silk to the fungus, are not explained by it. The analogous facts in plants also indicate a real constitutional relation with colour, not an affection of the sense of smell and taste only.] ...|$|E

Discontinuation or reduction of immunosuppressive therapy is recommended when KS arises in the setting of iatrogenic immunosuppression. However, with AIDS-related KS, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown to prevent, or induce regression of, KS. Some AIDS patients have complete resolution of the lesions and prolonged remission while continuing the therapy. Therefore, HAART should be considered first-line treatment for these patients, though they may require other treatments at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease</b> is rare, {{and there}} is a lack of {{literature}} on clinical evidence for treatment options. The objective of this report is to illustrate that acitretin may be effective in treating <b>cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease.</b> Design: A patient with <b>cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease</b> refractory to antibiotics, steroids, and surgical excision was treated with acitretin for a period of four months and was closely monitored for improvement in the lesion. Setting: This was a patient in the authors’ medical dermatology clinic. Participants: A single patient was involved. Results: The patient had continuous improvement in her <b>cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease</b> throughout a four-month treatment course with softening of the plaque and decreased erythema. She chose to discontinue treatment after four months due to hair loss with acitretin. Conclusion: <b>Cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease</b> is a rare, benign, generally self-limited, lymphoproliferative disease of unknown etiology. It typically occurs as histiocyte-rich inflammatory infiltrates, manifesting as red papules and plaques in older women, without predilection for site. Treatment is usually unnecessary, unless the lesions persist and are bothersome to the patient or cause functional deficits. Treatments are based on case reports and include surgery, radiation, and medical options. Our experience with a patient with a case of <b>cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease</b> persisting after surgical excision demonstrates that acitretin may be an effective therapeutic option for <b>cutaneous</b> Rosai-Dorfman <b>disease...</b>|$|R

Although skin problems might sometimes seem minor compared with other major systemic diseases frequently seen in this age group, accurate diagnosis and proper management help reduce the morbidity and positively influence their life quality. Because of various senile changes in skin, elderly people are predisposed to certain dermatological disorders. The most common <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases</b> that will be characterized {{in this article are}} broadly categorized into inflammatory dermatoses, cutaneous infections, vascular disorders, and neoplasms. Management of these <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases</b> in elderly population requires particular attention to their inherent physical and physiological weaknesses and associated complicated problems...|$|R
40|$|This review {{will discuss}} the role of {{angiogenesis}} in specific <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases.</b> Scientific evidence now points {{to the role of}} angiogenesis in tumor development and many other cutaneous disorders. Angiogenesis is a complex process that involves angiogenic growth factors and inhibitors, many of which could be a potential target for pharmacologic intervention. Antiangiogenic agents have recently been applied to dermatologic diseases with promising efficacy. Learning objectives: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to recognize <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases</b> where angiogenesis is likely to be an important factor, recognize scenarios where angiogenic therapy may be useful in conjunction with traditional therapies, and be able to use angiogenic-mediating agents in the treatment of dermatologic disease. © 2009 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Background Homoeopathic therapies are {{routinely}} {{used for the}} management of skin diseases. However, {{there is a lack of}} evidence-based data on their effectiveness. Objectives To assess the evidence for the efficacy of homoeopathic treatments in dermatology. Methods We designed a systematic review of the controlled clinical trials (January 1962 -April 2011) investigating homoeopathic therapies for the treatment of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases.</b> We collected data from MEDLINE, PubMed, Current Contents, HomInform (Glasgow), reference lists, specialist textbooks and contacts with homoeopathic manufacturers. There was no restriction on language. Subsets were defined according to treated skin disease/condition. For each subset, two reviewers extracted data for information on study quality, type of remedy, population and outcomes. Results After an extensive search, we isolated a very limited number of trials investigating homoeopathic treatments for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases.</b> Overall, of the 12 trials with interpretable results, nine trials indicated no positive effects of homoeopathy. The three trials showing a positive effect were of low methodological quality. Conclusions Reviewed trials of homoeopathic treatments for <b>cutaneous</b> <b>diseases</b> were highly variable in methods and quality. We did not find sufficient evidence from these studies that homoeopathy is clearly efficacious for any single dermatological condition. © 2011 British Association of Dermatologists.

50|$|The GG {{genotype}} at -1254G>A in PTGER4 {{is associated}} with the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated <b>cutaneous</b> <b>disease</b> (NECD). NECD is a non-allergic hypersensitivity reaction involving the acute development of wheals and angioedema in response to NSAID consumption in individuals with a history of chronic urticarial. The G allele at the -1254 position leads to lower PTGER4 gene promoter function, lower levels of EP4, and presumably thereby less of the anti-inflammatory effects of EP4.|$|E
