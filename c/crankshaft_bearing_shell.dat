50|$|Many {{people think}} that {{long-term}} use may induce additional wear {{due to lack of}} oil lubrication. For the <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> half <b>shells</b> and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing’s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled at what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional <b>bearing</b> <b>shells</b> with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles. In a start stop system the short stop times keep the engine and oil warm, retaining lubrication. Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. Mazda i-stop used in their Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to restart their engine by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to develop a}} tool to assess the {{theoretical}} resource <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> of internal combustion engine. As a result, two methods for evaluating of the theoretical resource <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearings</b> have been developed {{on the basis of the}} calculation of hydro-mechanical characteristics of bearings: the minimum film thickness and the extent of the zone of boundary friction. Under the theoretical resource of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> it is understood that during his work an increase of the radial clearance in the area of potential exposure (boundary friction) is over the limit. The first technique is based on the bearing life dependence on the ratio between the minimum film thickness and its maximum allowable value. The second technique is based on the molecular-mechanical theory of friction and wear fatigue theory. Thus, these techniques may be used to estimate the resource of the <b>crankshaft</b> journal <b>bearings</b> at the design and finishing stage.

In this paper, a method of fault detection in diesel engine is developed based on symmetrical polar coordinates and image recognition. In this method, time-domain waveform of vibration signal is transformed into snowflake-shaped in mirror symmetry pattern without time-frequency analysis. By the comparison of the geometric features of the snowflake images from different wear conditions of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> in diesel engines, we use centroid position and direction angle of the petal in snowflake image as features to detect the fault. Then, fuzzy c-means (FCM) are used to detect the conditions of the engine according to these features. In order to validate the methods, some experiments have been performed, the experimental results show that the centroid position and direction angle of the petal in snowflake image can reflect the information of different wear conditions in <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing,</b> and the fault of <b>crankshaft</b> <b>bearing</b> can be detected accurately.
