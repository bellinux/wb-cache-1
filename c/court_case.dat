40|$|Tax {{implications}} of financial planners 2 ̆ 7 advice {{have a significant}} impact on the wealth of their clients. Tax <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> can be a valuable source for their research on relevant tax issues. Unfortunately, Daily et al. (2010) show that the opinions in Tax <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> mentioning 2 ̆ 2 depreciation 2 ̆ 2 have become increasingly difficult to read. If the prior finding holds true for the <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> that financial planners frequently refer to, the declining readability may hinder and/or prolong their tax research. Our study assesses the readability of Tax <b>Court</b> <b>cases</b> citing the Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C.) Sections that are particularly relevant to financial planners. These code sections include Retirement Savings Account (RSA) Sections and General Financial Planning (GFP) Sections. We find that there is no significant difference in the readability between <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> based on the type of case decisions (regular or memorandum). In contrast, there is a significant difference in the readability of these <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> by code sections. Such difference in the two sections is reinforced by the finding that the readability only deteriorates for the <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> citing the GFP Sections. These results suggest that tax research on <b>court</b> <b>cases</b> can be burdensome and, therefore, detract from financial planning efforts...|$|R

Swamiji came clean in all these <b>court</b> <b>cases.</b> The fact that a guru of a community had to go through trial in <b>court</b> <b>cases,</b> resulted in a character assassination of sorts.|$|R
