5|$|After Darlington {{bought the}} {{railroad}} bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, {{he made his}} intentions with the five decade-old bridge clear. He took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision {{to make the most}} out of the crossing. He also figured that the bridge would make a good approach for drivers <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.|$|E

500|$|Early US {{pressings}} of {{the album}} included a blurb for a [...] "Freak Out Hot Spots!" [...] map. Inside the gatefold jacket the small ad was aimed at people <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> Los Angeles and it listed several famous restaurants and clubs including Canter's and The Whiskey A Go-Go. The ad also claimed information concerning police arrests. It states: [...] "Also shows where the heat has been busting frequently, with tips on safety in police terror situations". [...] Those interested in the map were instructed to send $1.00 to MGM Records c/o 1540 Broadway NY. NY. address. [...] The map was only available for a limited time, since the blurb was not included on later pressings and the space was left blank., It was eventually reprinted and included with The MOFO Project/Object, a four-disc audio documentary on the making {{of the album}}, released posthumously by the Zappa Family Trust in 2006.|$|E
500|$|The punishments {{doled out}} to the Quakers {{intensified}} as their perceived threat to the Puritan religious order increased. [...] These included the stocks and pillory, lashes with a three-corded, knotted whip, fines, imprisonment, mutilation (having ears cut off), banishment and death. [...] When whipped, women were stripped to the waist, thus being publicly exposed, and whipped until bleeding. [...] Such was the fate of Dyer's Newport neighbor, Herodias Gardiner who had made a perilous journey through a 60-mile wilderness to get to Weymouth in the Massachusetts colony. [...] She had made the arduous trek with another woman and with her [...] "Babe sucking at her Breast" [...] to give her Quaker testimony to friends in Weymouth. [...] Similarly, Katharine, the wife of Richard Scott, and a younger sister of Anne Hutchinson, had received ten lashes for <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> her future son-in-law, Christopher Holder, in prison. This was the setting into which Mary Dyer stepped, upon her return from England.|$|E
2500|$|Haile Selassie visited Jamaica on 21 April 1966, and {{approximately}} {{one hundred thousand}} Rastafari from all over Jamaica descended on Palisadoes Airport in Kingston, having heard that the man whom they considered to be their messiah was <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> them. Spliffs and chalices were openly smoked, causing [...] "a haze of ganja smoke" [...] to drift through the air. Haile Selassie arrived at the airport {{but was unable to}} come down the mobile steps of the airplane, as the crowd rushed the tarmac. He then returned into the plane, disappearing for several more minutes. Finally, Jamaican authorities were obliged to request Ras Mortimer Planno, a well-known Rasta leader, to climb the steps, enter the plane, and negotiate the emperor's descent. Planno re-emerged and announced to the crowd: [...] "The Emperor has instructed me to tell you to be calm. Step back and let the Emperor land". This day is widely held by scholars to be a major turning point for the movement, and it is still commemorated by Rastafari as Grounation Day, the anniversary of which is celebrated as the second holiest holiday after 2 November, the emperor's Coronation Day.|$|E

2500|$|Two other {{significant}} churches {{in this part}} of the city are the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios and the San Francisco Acatepec. Nuestra Señora de los Remedios is the best known as it is the church that is located on top of the Cholula Pyramid. This church was built in 1594 and is home to an image of the Virgin of the Remedies, the patron of Cholula. The first church collapsed in an earthquake in 1854 and rebuilt. The new church was damaged again by an earthquake in 1999 but repaired. The pyramid it is on was a pilgrimage site in pre-Hispanic times, and it remains one now with people <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>visit</b> this Virgin image. [...] The San Francisco church is what is left of a Franciscan monastery dedicated to Diego de Alcalá. The monastery was demolished by the Marquis of Mancera in 1673, under the false impression that it had been built without royal permission. In 1686, the church was restored as a parish by the Count of Monclova. The church was constructed in the early 16th century and finished during the middle of the 18th, when its tabernacle was constructed. It maintains its original Churrigueresque altar, which contains numerous small paintings.|$|E
