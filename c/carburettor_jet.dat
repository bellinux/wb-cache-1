5000|$|Two {{models were}} produced, the 'Standard model' which had {{acetylene}} lighting and bulb horn, priced in 1930 at £57/10/6 and the 'De Luxe model' which had electric lighting and instrument panel, priced in 1930 at £63/2/6. In 1931 both were designated A/2 and minor changes included a four speed gearbox with improved gear ratios with lower 1st and higher top gear {{and a more}} rounded petrol tank, the Amal <b>carburettor</b> <b>jet</b> was changed from 70 to 55 and {{the diameter of the}} exhaust pipe was increased with ports on the head spaced further apart (65/8" [...] instead of 51/8").|$|E
50|$|Each stage gave either {{large or}} small cars a disadvantage. High {{altitude}} of up to 9,000 {{feet above sea level}} gave a disadvantage to small cars as it robbed them of power, requiring altitude correctors to the <b>carburettor</b> main <b>jet</b> to maintain the correct air/fuel mixture to the engine.|$|R
5000|$|Carburettors are {{provided}} with a float chamber to provide a constant hydrostatic head of fuel above the <b>carburettor's</b> metering <b>jets,</b> thus a constant pressure. The float chamber itself does not vary the pressure according to demand, but it does vary the supply flowrate with demand, to keep this pressure constant.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{cars were}} live axle 1600cc Ford 'Kent' Crossflows with rear-exit exhausts. The spec {{included}} a Caterham lightened & balanced flywheel, uprated competition clutch cover and drive plate, Caterham distributor with Ignitor electronic ignition, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) <b>carburettors,</b> main <b>jets</b> size 120, 30mm venturi, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 100 bhp at 6000 rpm. They ran on list 1A Michelin MXT tyres.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the Zenith was perfected around 1906-1908 by Francois Baverey of Lyon, France. The <b>carburettor</b> had two <b>jets,</b> one for rich mixture, one for lean. The mixture was then {{combined}} in the right proportions for the engine's speed and load.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{the engine}} {{supplier}} changed to Vauxhall, with 1600 {{single overhead cam}} engines being used. They featured a ported & skimmed cylinder head, standard Vauxhall camshaft, flywheel and clutch cover plate, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) <b>carburettors,</b> main <b>jets</b> size 115, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 101 ps at 5,500 rpm and a max torque of 107 lb ft at 3,600 rpm. The main visual difference between the Fords and the Vauxhalls was that the Vauxhalls had a side-exit exhaust, {{as opposed to the}} rear exit of the Fords.|$|R

40|$|DESCRIPTION. The Gray {{horizontal}} engine {{is of the}} 4 Cycle single acting type and has a single cylinder. It is fitted with a reciprocating fuel pump, which forces the gasoline into the ordinary type or <b>jet</b> <b>carburettor.</b> The pump action is determined by a shaft governor, which has a range of from 200 to 400 R. P. M's., but is very erratic at the lower speeds. When the speed rises above that for which the governor is set, the exhaust valve is held open, and the automatic inlet valve remains closed and by a system of levers, the pump is prevented from delivering its charge.

40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{detection}} of small leaks from the primary system of a Nuclear Pressurised Water Reactor. Leak rates of 12 g/s are invariably difficult to detect and locate. The typical leak indicators in a nuclear reactor control room are a drop in pressure and level from the pressuriser, and the air sampler detecting particulate matter. However, {{in both cases the}} leak is normally quite substantial by the time any parameters or values are obviously outside the normal operating conditions. Therefore, a small leak could go undetected for a significant amount of time. As part of the reactor safety studies, {{it is important to have}} more information about small leaks. Due to the lack of small leak data, the solution was to construct a high pressure water rig producing temperatures and pressures close to those experienced in the primary circuit, these being 200 ºC and 100 bar respectively. Pressure is maintained by a vane water pump and heating is achieved by passing a high current through a small diameter, thin walled pipe. To reproduce different size cracks, various size <b>carburettor</b> <b>jets</b> are used. The water on exiting this crack, flashes to steam and immediately meets metallic pipe lagging, which is typical of most primary systems. With the typical crack scenario recreated it is now important to add sensors that will detect conditions associated with a small leak. These sensors are either mounted on or around the lagging material. The parameters that are monitored include vibrations, acoustics, thermal variations, moisture change, air flow and pressure adjustment leaving a predetermined outlet. The sensor outputs are pre-processed and the nonlinear data are applied to an artificial neural network, whereas the other data are applied to a digital logic system. The results showed that with 13 different leak rates, separated by only 1. 4 g/s the ANN was able to correctly differentiate and identify different leak sizes with a certainty of over 97 %. The results from all the analysis are further presented graphically through an Operator Advisory System. This informs the operator of the predicted leak size and location. All of the available sensor data relevant to the leak can be viewed and location of the leak is presented by a three dimensional model of the reactor system.

50|$|The {{connecting}} rods {{for the two}} cylinders are {{side by side on}} the same crank pin making firing points equidistant. The engine is mounted directly on the chassis frame. It can be seen from the illustration the rearmost bracket rolls over the flywheel making the rear mountings much further apart from the front set than would be allowed by mounting the engine direct from the very short block. Magneto, distributor and water pump are driven by skew gear from the front of the crankshaft as are the pinions and chains which drive the valve shafts operating the sleeve valves. The two <b>jet</b> <b>carburettor</b> incorporates a silencer on its air intake. The first jet is used only at starting or at idle.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{detailed}} visualization of {{the transport of}} fuel film has been performed in a small carburetted engine with a transparent manifold at the exit of the carburettor. The presence of fuel film is observed significantly on {{the lower half of}} the manifold at idling, while at load conditions, the film is found to be distributed all throughout the manifold walls. Quantitative measurement of the fuel film in a specially-designed manifold of square cross section has also been performed using the planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) technique. The measured fuel film thickness is observed to be of the order of 1 nun at idling, and in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 4 mm over the range of load and speed studied. These engine studies are complemented by experiments conducted in a carburettor rig to study the state of the fuel exiting the carburettor. Laser-based Particle/Droplet Image Analysis (PDIA) technique is used to identify fuel droplets and ligaments and estimate droplet diameters. At a throttle position corresponding to idling, the fuel exiting the carburettor is found to consist of very fine droplets of size less than 15 mu m and large fuel ligaments associated with length scales of the order of 500 mu m and higher. For a constant pressure difference across the carburettor, the fuel consists of droplets with an SMD of the order of 30 mu m. Also, the effect of liquid fuel film on the cold start HC emissions is studied. Based on the understanding obtained from these studies, strategies such as manifold heating and varying <b>carburettor</b> main <b>jet</b> nozzle diameter are implemented. These are observed to reduce emissions under both idling and varying load conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} effect of different high octane fuels (such as eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol) on engine’s performance behaviour of a biofuel based dual fuel engine. A single cylinder Diesel engine was modified and tested under dual fuel mode of operation. Initially the engine was run using neat diesel, neat mahua oil as fuels. In the second phase, the engine was operated in dual fuel mode by using a specially designed variable <b>jet</b> <b>carburettor</b> to supply the high octane fuels. Engine trials were made at 100 % and 40 % loads (power outputs) with varying amounts of high octane fuels up-to the maximum possible limit. The performance and emission characteristics of the engine were obtained and analysed. Results indicated significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency simultaneous reduction in smoke and NO emissions in dual fuel operation with all the inducted fuels. At 100 % load the brake thermal efficiency increased from 25. 6 % to a maximum of 32. 3, 30. 5, and 28. 4 %, respectively, with eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol as primary fuels. Smoke was reduced drastically from 78 % with neat mahua oil a minimum of 41, 48, and 53 %, respectively, with eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol at the maximum efficiency point. The optimal energy share for the best engine behaviour was found to be 44. 6, 27. 3, and 23. 2 %, respectively, for eucalyptus oil, ethanol, and methanol at 100 % load. Among the primary fuels tested, eucalyptus oil showed the maximum brake thermal efficiency, minimum smoke and NO emissions and maximum energy replacement for the optimal operation of the engine...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to carry out an investigastion into {{suitable}} alternatives to gasoline for use in modern automobiles. The fuel would provide the western world with a means of extending the natural gasoline resources and the third world a way of cutting down their dependence on the oil producing countries for their energy supply. Alcohols, namely methanol and ethanol, provide this solution. They {{can be used as}} gasoline extenders or as fuels on their own. In order to fulfil the aims of the project a literature study was carried out to investigate methods and costs of producing these fuels. An experimental programme was then set up in which the performance of the alcohols was studied on a conventional engine. The engine used for this purpose was the Fiat 127 930 cc four cylinder engine. This engine was used because of its popularity in the European countries. The Weber fixed <b>jet</b> <b>carburettor,</b> since it was designed to be used with gasoline, was adapted so that the alcohol fuels and the blends could be used in the most efficient way. This was mainly to take account of the lower heat content of the alcohols. The adaptation of the carburettor was in the form of enlarging the main metering jet. Allowances for the alcohol's lower specfic gravity were made during fuel metering. Owing to the low front end volatility of methanol and ethanol, it was expected that `start up' problems would occur. An experimental programme was set up to determine the temperature range for a minimum required percentage `take off' that would ease start-up since it was determined that a `take off' of about 5 % v/v liquid in the vapour phase would be sufficient for starting. Additions such as iso-pentane and n-pentane were used to improve the front end volatility. This proved to be successful. The lower heat content of the alcohol fuels also meant that a greater charge of fuel would be required. This was seen to pose further problems with fuel distribution from the carburettor to the individual cylinders on a multicylinder engine. Since {{it was not possible to}} modify the existing manifold on the Fiat 127 engine, experimental tests on manifold geometry were carried out using the Ricardo E 6 single cylinder variable compression engine. Results from these tests showed that the length, shape and cross-sectional area of the manifold play an important part in the distribution of the fuel entering the cylinder, ie. vapour phase, vapour/small liquid droplet/liquid film phase, vapour/large liquid droplet/liquid film phase etc. The solvent properties of the alcohols and their greater electrical conductivity suggested that the materials used on the engine would be prone to chemical attack. In order to determine the type and rate of chemical attack, an experimental programme was set up whereby carburettor and other components were immersed in the alcohols and in blends of alcohol with gasoline. The test fuels were aerated and in some instances kept at temperatures ranging from 50 oC to 90 oC. Results from these tests suggest that not all materials used in the conventional engine are equally suitable for use with alcohols and alcohol/gasoline blends. Aluminium for instance was severely attacked by methanol causing pitting and pin-holing in the surface. In general this whole experimental programme gave valuable information on the acceptability of substitute fuels. While the long term effects of alcohol use merit further study, it is clear that methanol and ethanol will be increasingly used in place of gasoline...|$|R
