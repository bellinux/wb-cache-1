2500|$|Initially, {{sublimation}} printing, where {{a special}} ink is printed onto the keycap {{surface and the}} application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard <b>clear</b> <b>coating</b> was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or [...] "keycaps", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} paint {{products}} {{are used for}} their aesthetic and anti-corrosive properties. Isocyanates are consistently found in automobile paint products, particularly in <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> polyurethane products. <b>Clear</b> <b>coat</b> is typically sprayed via pressurized air {{by means of an}} auto-spray robot. In <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> repair situations, manual, air-powered spray guns are used, and manual spray Operators administer the <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> material. The isocyanates are a primary anti-corrosive agent in polyurethane products. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not established a Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) have set Recommended Exposure Limit (REL) and Threshold Limit Value (TLV), respectively. NIOSH recommends a 0. 005 parts per million (ppm), 10 -hour Time Weighted Average (TWA), and a ceiling exposure of 0. 020 ppm in a 10 minute period. Similarly, ACGIH recommends a 0. 005 ppm, 8 hour TWA. Automobile manufacturers use <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> in a variety of ways. Some may use <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> with blocked isocyanates, or isocyanates that are completely reacted, and others may use <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> products that allow isocyanates to be liberated during an application, baking, and curing process. The research objective {{of this study was to}} characterize exposure, focusing on a single manufacturer’s use of isocyanate-containing <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> in their Paint Department. A newly evaluated medium (ISO 17734) using di-n-butylamine as a derivative agent, in a denuder tube, was selected instead of NIOSH methods 5521, 5522, and 5525. The ISO evaluated medium was selected to reduce secondary hazard exposure to toluene in impingers. Second, a medium developed by SKC, Inc., called ISO-CHEK®, was not selected because of the short collection time, sensitivity of the medium after collection, and storage and shipping requirements for analysis. Sampling took place over two days, one day for manual spray operations with 2 personal samples from Operators, and 4 area samples collected, and the second day for auto-sprayer Inspectors with 4 personal samples collected. The samples were then analyzed for hexamethylene diisocyanates (HDI) monomer and homopolymer species. The 0. 005 ppm, 10 hour TWA; the 0. 020 ppm ceiling limit (10 minutes); and the 0. 005 ppm 8 -hour TWA TLV were not exceeded on either day of sampling. Neither the area nor the personal samples exceeded the 10 hour TWA, ceiling limit, or TLV. In fact, the results had to be recalculated in to parts per billion (ppb). The average exposure for manual spray Operators was 0. 052 ppb for the homopolymer, and 0. 024 ppb for the monomer species. For auto-spray Inspectors, the average was 0. 053 ppb for the homopolymer component and 0. 021 ppb for the monomer species. Though the average isocyanate concentration was similar for both Operators and Inspectors, the averages are still below REL and TLV recommendations. These data provided preliminary information regarding the exposure to isocyanates from <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> use, and also provide context for future evaluation of isocyanate use at this automobile manufacturer. The low concentration of isocyanates could indicate working ventilation systems, liberation of isocyanate species to non-hazardous forms, or low volatilization of isocyanates from the <b>clear</b> <b>coat...</b>|$|R

40|$|Degraded {{clear and}} {{pigmented}} epoxy coatings were investigated by dielectric sorption analysis (DSA). Differences in dynamics of absorption, {{due to increased}} hydrophilicity, crosslinking and porosity, were found between UV degraded and undegraded epoxy coatings. Desorption was observed for longer degradation times, caused by swelling of the coating, squeezing out the excess of water. Model system measurements of pigmented coatings with various filters on top reproduced the desorption behaviour. Due to crack formation during DSA measurements, clear coatings showed fluctuating results, a result of release of tension of the UV degraded <b>clear</b> <b>coating</b> by humidified nitrogen. Pigmented coatings did not show this behaviour, resulting in an increasing water absorption trend with increasing degradation times. Larger desorption peaks were found for lower frequencies, indicating that either polarization takes place or water-hydrophilic interaction.

Surface coating of MDF was conducted using epoxy acrylate resin either for clear and pigmented coatings. Titanium dioxide was used for white pigmented coatings.

Curing was carried out by using 350 kV electron beam accelerator at 1. 35 mA current and 1. 6 m/min conveyor speed to get the absorbed dose of 3 Mrad. Effect of coating thickness was evaluated by measuring the physical, mechanical and chemical properties of cured samples, i. e., hardness, gloss, transparency, adhesion, abrasion resistance, and chemical, solvent and stain resistance.

Adding nanoparticles to a conventional coating could improve its UV-protecting properties, thus decreasing {{the need for}} maintenance of coated wood products. Wood products could thereby replace non-wood alternatives, which could result in lower environmental impacts.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Automotive paints {{have used}} an {{ultraviolet}} (UV) absorbing <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> system for nearly thirty years. These <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> have become of forensic interest when comparing paint transfers and paint samples from suspect vehicles. <b>Clear</b> <b>coat</b> samples and their ultraviolet absorbers are not typically examined or characterized using Raman spectroscopy or microspectrophotometry (MSP), however some past {{research has been}} done using MSP. Chemometric methods are also not typically used for this characterization. In this study, Raman and MSP spectra were collected from the <b>clear</b> <b>coats</b> of 245 American and Australian automobiles. Chemometric analysis was subsequently performed on the measurements. Sample preparation was simple and involved peeling the <b>clear</b> <b>coat</b> layer and placing the peel on a foil-covered microscope slide for Raman or a quartz slide with no cover slip for MSP. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering suggested three classes of spectra, and principal component analysis confirmed this. Factor loadings for the Raman data illustrated that much of the variance between spectra came from specific regions (400 – 465 cm- 1, 600 – 660 cm- 1, 820 – 885 cm- 1, 950 – 1050 cm- 1, 1740 – 1780 cm- 1, and 1865 – 1900 cm- 1). For MSP, the regions of highest variance were between 230 – 270 nm and 290 – 370 nm. Discriminant analysis showed that the three classes were well-differentiated with a cross-validation accuracy of 92. 92 % for Raman and 91. 98 % for MSP. Analysis of variance attributed differentiability of the classes to the regions between 400 – 430 cm- 1, 615 – 640 cm- 1, 825 – 880 cm- 1, 1760 – 1780 cm- 1, and 1860 – 1900 cm- 1 for Raman spectroscopy. For MSP, these regions were between 240 – 285 nm and 300 – 370 nm.

All samples were of the sample length and diameter, allowing direct comparison of the maximum loads reached before failure, which are directly indicative of the Modulus of Rupture (MOR). Two constructions were tested both containing the same unidirectional fiber but with different support structure.
