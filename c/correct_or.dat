5|$|During the Jeopardy! round, {{except in}} {{response}} to the Daily Double clue, contestants are not penalized for forgetting to phrase their response {{in the form of a}} question, although the host will remind contestants to watch their phrasing in future responses. In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E

Calligraphic works often use variant Chinese characters, which are deemed <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> incorrect case-by-case, but in general, more popular variants are more likely to be correct.

25|$|When a {{justiciable}} issue arises, the decision-maker must give the parties a fair opportunity {{to present their}} cases and to <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> contradict any relevant statements prejudicial to them.

25|$|Following the Indian example, {{it might}} be argued that {{judicial}} review is a basic feature of the Constitution and cannot be removed through the use of ouster clauses. However, the basic features doctrine was rejected by the High Court in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989). On appeal, the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to rule on whether the position taken by the High Court is <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E
25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, {{it is virtually impossible to}} know whether a jury has been <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E

25|$|Neo-creationism is a pseudoscientific {{movement}} {{which aims}} to restate creationism in terms {{more likely to be}} well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the scientific community. It aims to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture. This comes in response to the 1987 ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Edwards v. Aguillard that creationism is an inherently religious concept and that advocating it as <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> accurate in public-school curricula violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{the courts}} possess {{the power of}} {{judicial}} review to <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> nullify executive acts or decisions which are contrary to the executive's statutory powers or otherwise contravene administrative law principles. The low incidence of judicial disagreement with the executive in Singapore has been noted by commentators, but may {{not necessarily mean that}} the judiciary is unduly deferential to the executive. It may be the case that the executive has attained a high degree of fairness in its own decision-making. In 1989, Parliament intentionally curtailed the judiciary's ability to exercise judicial review of executive decisions made pursuant to the Internal Security Act.|$|E
25|$|Software errors not {{detected}} by software testers during development can {{find their way}} into released versions of computer and video games. This may happen because the glitch only occurs under unusual circumstances in the game, was deemed too minor to <b>correct,</b> <b>or</b> because the game development was hurried to meet a publication deadline. Glitches can range from minor graphical errors to serious bugs that can delete saved data or cause the game to malfunction. In some cases publishers will release updates (referred to as patches) to repair glitches. Sometimes a glitch may be beneficial to the player; these are often referred to as exploits.|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} {{generally}} remembers Lamarck for {{a theory of}} inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique. However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, {{a reflection of the}} wisdom of the time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent <b>correct,</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that any of these assumptions are <b>correct,</b> <b>or</b> even likely. Linguistic opinion is that click consonants may well be a relatively late development in human language, that they are no more resistant to change or any more likely to be linguistic relics than other speech sounds, and that they are easily borrowed: at least one Khoisan language, ǁXegwi, is believed to have reborrowed clicks from Bantu languages, which had earlier borrowed them from Khoisan languages, for example. The Knight and Mountain article {{is the latest in a}} long line of speculations about the primitive origin of click consonants, which have been largely motivated by the outdated idea that primitive people speak primitive languages, which has no empirical support.|$|E
25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E

25|$|Oroonoko is now {{the most}} studied of Aphra Behn's novels, {{but it was not}} {{immediately}} successful in her own lifetime. It sold well, but the adaptation for the stage by Thomas Southerne (see below) made the story as popular as it became. Soon after her death, the novel began to be read again, and from that time onward the factual claims made by the novel's narrator, and the factuality of the whole plot of the novel, have been accepted and questioned with greater and lesser credulity. Because Mrs. Behn was not available to <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> confirm any information, early biographers assumed the first-person narrator was Aphra Behn speaking for herself and incorporated the novel's claims into their accounts of her life. It is important, however, to recognise that Oroonoko is a work of fiction and that its first-person narrator—the protagonist—need be no more factual than Jonathan Swift's first-person narrator, ostensibly Gulliver, in Gulliver's Travels, Daniel Defoe's shipwrecked narrator in Robinson Crusoe, or the first-person narrator of A Tale of a Tub.|$|E
25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but if the question was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was not fair. They said that all questions were compulsory so there should not be any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required to tick some of the boxes in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E
25|$|Pro mode for {{keyboards}} shows during gameplay ten white {{keys and}} the corresponding black keys, as the full range cannot be displayed on screen; Two visual cues are given to the player to identify what position on the controller they should play relative to the keys shown on-screen. One cue is through highlighting the entire lane that corresponds to a played note whether <b>correct</b> <b>or</b> not; this {{is designed to help}} keep the player's hand positions correlated on the unit. A second cue is uniquely grouped coloring of a channel containing a set of 5 keys matching similar markings on the keyboard unit to identify the correct area of the keyboard that the player should be on. Pro keyboard charting includes notes and chords using a combination of white and black keys. On Easy or Medium Pro keys, the range of keys on screen does not shift, but on Hard and Expert the range of keys shown on the screen shifts as the song necessitates, requiring the player to move their own hands in turn. Arrow indicators are displayed to indicate when the displayed area is about to shift left or right, giving the player time to compensate.|$|E
