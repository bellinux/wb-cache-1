Using Van Thiel´s typology of agentification, {{it turns out}} that the four countries have all followed trajectories of external agentification, but at a different pace, in different periods, and in varying degrees. Furthermore, an analysis of secondary data indicates mixed effects of external agentification. Public law-based inter-municipal <b>companies</b> (<b>type</b> 2) and private law based municipal-owned limited <b>companies</b> (<b>type</b> 3) seem to have some positive economic effects, although transaction costs may increase. The political effects are clearly negative in the sense that accountability becomes more problematic. Due to the lack of data, the findings on organisational effects are inconclusive...|$|R

50|$|From its {{inception}} the RAF had seaplane tenders, which {{as part of}} Marine Craft Section, were used for rescue, but these were really only designed for refueling and rearming the seaplanes in service with the RAF. Development of a purpose-built boat for rescue began in 1932 with the 200 Class seaplane tenders, followed by the 100 Class ASR (Air Sea Rescue) boats which entered service in 1940. Perhaps the best known 100 Class boats were the British Power Boat <b>Company</b> <b>Type</b> Two 63 ft HSL, {{also known as the}} 'Whaleback' after their distinctive design.|$|E

These models eventually culminated in the Type 223, a transatlantic transport for about 100 passengers at a speed around Mach 2. At about the same time Sud Aviation in France was developing the similar Super-Caravelle design, and in November 1962 the efforts were merged to create the Concorde project.|$|E

An example of the former is the British Power Boat <b>Company</b> <b>Type</b> Two 63 ft HSL. The designation in this case comes not from the curve along the gunwale, but from the fore and aft arch in the deck.|$|E
