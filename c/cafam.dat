5000|$|In 1965, a {{group of}} women, led by artist Edith R. Wyle (grandmother of actor Noah Wyle), called the [...] "Folk Art's High Priestess" [...] by the LA Times, channeled their passion for {{indigenous}} art into The Egg and The Eye gallery. The gallery sold fine craft and traditional art from world cultures; the restaurant served over 50 varieties of omelettes. The success of this concept spurred {{the formation of the}} nonprofit Craft and Folk Art Museum in 1973. When the gallery was converted to a museum, the restaurant took on the gallery's former name: The Egg and The Eye. From the beginning, <b>CAFAM</b> was a “living museum” offering artist-led workshops and educational programs. <b>CAFAM</b> held early shows for now-prominent artists, including Frank Romero, Otto Natzler, Dale Chihuly, and Sam Maloof. Edith Wyle was CAFAM's Artistic Director from 1973 - 1984, when she retired. At that point, she {{became a member of the}} Board of Trustees, and took the title of Founder/Director Emeritus. In 1976, <b>CAFAM</b> initiated Los Angeles’ first multicultural festival, the International Festival of Masks. This two-day celebration of folk art, dance, music, and food drew up to 40,000 people through 1994. When Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in July 1984, the Festival of Masks was chosen to be an official event of the Olympic Arts Festival; it was produced over a three-day weekend, July 20 - 22, 1984. After 24 years, the restaurant closed forever at the end of June 1989, when the museum had to move temporarily during renovations. The museum was in residence in the historic May Company department store from November 1989 through the end of 1992. Moving the offices and the library next door (at 5800 Wilshire) to its original building at 5814 Wilshire, <b>CAFAM</b> mounted exhibitions in various off-site venues and hired the architectural firm of Hodgetts + Fung to reconfigure the museum, reopening as a merged structure May 12, 1995. At the end of 1997, <b>CAFAM</b> closed due to financial difficulties; at the time, it was believed to have shut down for good. The permanent collection was sold at auction; the library was given to the L.A. County Museum of Art Research Library; and the institutional archives (staff files, 1965 - 1997) were given to UCLA Young Research Library Special Collections. However, Patrick Ela, who was CAFAM's Administrative Director from 1975 - 1984 and then Executive Director until his resignation in 1996, working with Al Nodal, the General Manager of the L.A. Department of Cultural Affairs, developed a partnership between the <b>CAFAM</b> Board and the City of L.A., which allowed the museum to reopen after 14 months in February 1999.|$|E

50|$|The Craft and Folk Art Museum (<b>CAFAM),</b> Los Angeles, USA, was {{incorporated}} in 1973 and began formal museum operations in 1975.

Like the present-day museum, the gallery showed contemporary craft objects and folk art. A popular restaurant on the mezzanine featured {{a long list of}} ethnically inspired omelettes. When the commercial gallery was converted to a private, nonprofit museum, the restaurant took the name of the former gallery, The Egg and The Eye. The restaurant closed forever, as part of a major renovation, on June 30, 1989. The renovated museum re-opened May 12, 1995, then closed temporarily at the end of 1997, and finally re-opened February 11, 1999.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{participation}} of non-state providers in public service delivery in post-conflict reconstruction societies particularly {{for the provision of}} education. Using a qualitative research method the literature regarding state capacity and governance in war-to-peace transitions is assessed to identify {{the pros and cons of}} private sector intervention. As a case study the model of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in education in Colombia is analysed in order to examine the extent to which engagements with non-state actors can be a complementary strategy to assist former combatants and victims during the implementation of a potential peace agreement between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – FARC. The Colombian model developed through the Familiar Compensation Fund – Cajas de Compensación Familiar – may be an alternative to offering educational programmes for children and youth ex-combatants. In the light of the plausible signing of a final peace agreement the provision of effective incentives in terms of basic public services will be a key driver for peacebuilding. The importance of education in development and processes of reintegration is well known, but the challenge is how to deliver adequate teaching services for children and young fighters in a context characterized by low state capacity and resource constraints. According to institutional frameworks, the model of PPPs in Colombia has served to deliver social programmes to poor communities, former combatants and victims of the armed conflict. Therefore, the case study is framed in four regions: Bogotá, Antioquia, Putumayo and Caquetá where the majority of the municipalities of the post-conflict will be concentrated except for Bogotá. The Familiar Compensation system, also known as Social Security Institutions, is a fundamental actor in the development of the Colombian social policy. Apart from providing social welfare services to workers and targeted communities, these institutions are key allies of the government in the implementation and execution of public programmes regarding the delivery of education, housing and health services given their experience, infrastructure, good practices and national coverage to reach the population in urban and rural regions. This innovative coordination between the public and private sector is also seen in the active role the Family Compensation Fund has in the articulation and definition of public policies at national and regional levels. Likewise, the SSIs have participated actively in the delivery of public education through different type of contracts under specific socio-economic requirements and governmental policies in order to benefit disadvantaged children and adults including demobilized and victims. The SSIs <b>CAFAM,</b> COMFAMILIAR PUTUMAYO, COMFACA and COMFAMA operate a variety of educational and complementary programmes according to the needs of each region. Some of them have worked together to deliver non-traditional educational services in municipalities intensely affected by the internal conflict, which are funded by both governmental and international agencies. In a post-conflict setting, the intervention of the SSIs as non-state providers would be crucial for state building as a result of the coordination mechanisms developed so far between the state and the private sector; the institutional and operational capacity of the SSIs in the provision of social services; and the accountability mechanism created to supervise and control the Family Compensation system through the Superintendence of Family Subsidy. Hence strengthening engagements with non-state actors in Colombia may contribute to restoring legitimacy and accountability in marginalized regions exercising the state an indirect role in service delivery via regulation and monitoring. Still accountability will need to be reinforced since some SSIs have been intervened due to political clientelism and local elite capture of decision-making, which have undermined their social impact in the communities where they operate. Nonetheless, the successful experiences of the Family Compensation Funds – among which are entrepreneurship, housing, microcredit, and education services – can be replicated and articulated in rural areas following the alternative model of PPPs in service delivery.
