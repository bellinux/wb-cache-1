Only a few standard methods for testing these physical properties of <b>covering</b> <b>materials</b> for greenhouses exist.

25|$|In the past, spherical nonporous {{implants}} {{were placed}} in the intraconal space and the extraocular muscles were either left unattached or were tied over the implant. Wrapping these implants allows attachment of the muscles to the <b>covering</b> <b>material,</b> a technique that seems to improve implant movement and reduce the incidence of implant migration. Porous implants may be saturated with antibiotic solution before insertion. Because the brittle nature of hydroxyapatite prevents direct suturing of the muscles to the implant, these implants are usually covered with some form of wrapping material. The muscles are attached to the implant in a technique similar to that used for spherical non-porous implants. The muscles may be directly sutured to porous polyethylene implants either by passing the suture through the implant material or by using an implant with fabricated suture tunnels. Some surgeons also wrap porous polyethylene implants either to facilitate muscle attachment or {{to reduce the risk of}} implant exposure. A variety of wrapping materials have been used to cover porous implants, including polyglactin or polyglycolic acid mesh, heterologous tissue (bovine pericardium), homologous donor tissue (sclera, dermis), and autogenous tissue (fascia lata, temporalis fascia, posterior auricular muscle, rectus abdominis sheath).|$|E

40|$|TYPOLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL ASPECTS OF THE GREENHOUSES IN ITALY In {{the last}} years a large {{application}} of innovative technologies was observed in greenhouse cultivations. The design of a greenhouse requires skills in {{different fields such as}} the structures, the <b>covering</b> <b>materials,</b> the equipment for the microclimate control, the sensors and the environmental impact. The most diffused greenhouses in Italy are characterized generally by plastic film coverings and by very simplified conditioning equipment systems. Actually the market requires agronomic products for extended periods of the year and with a high quality, as a consequence the introduction of innovative technologies will be once more necessary. The paper deals with the constructive and equipment aspects which characterise the greenhouses, particularly greenhouse structures, <b>covering</b> <b>materials</b> and equipment are critically analysed in detail. Structural materials and shapes of the greenhouses are analysed {{as a function of the}} crops, the <b>covering</b> <b>materials,</b> the climatic conditions of the site and in relation with the standards in use. The properties of the most common <b>covering</b> <b>materials,</b> glass, rigid plastics, plastic films are described in relation with their applications. The physical and mechanical properties of the materials are discussed in relation to the agronomic requirements of the crops and to the expected lifetime of the materials. The environmental impact of the greenhouse cultivation is studied and solutions to increase its sustainability are presented: a large introduction of the soilless cultivation and the use of biodegradable plastics as <b>covering</b> <b>materials.</b> The soilless cultivation allows the reduction of the agro-chemicals, the contamination of the underground water with a higher quality of the yield. The use of the biodegradable plastics as greenhouse <b>covering</b> <b>materials</b> will improve the environmental sustainability of the greenhouse production eliminating the problem of the recycling of the plastic films produced by non-biodegradable polymeric materials...|$|R

The {{four types of}} the aforementioned soil <b>covering</b> <b>materials</b> were examined to determine their arsenic adsorption efficiency, equilibriumtime as well as adsorption isotherms. The results revealed that among soil <b>covering</b> <b>materials</b> mixed with arsenic-contaminated soil at 10 % w/w, the efficiency of arsenic adsorption of fly ash, lateritic soil, lime and limestone powder were 84, 60, 38 and 1 % respectively. The equilibrium time for lateritic soil at pH 4 was achieved within 4 hrs, whereas pH 7 and 12, the equilibrium time was 6 hrs. For fly ash, 2 hrs were required to reach the equilibrium at pH 12, while the equilibrium time was attained within 6 hrs at pH 4 and 7. Furthermore, lateritic soil possessedhigh arsenic adsorption efficiency at pH 7 and 4 and best fit with the Langmuir isotherm. The fly ash showing high arsenic adsorption efficiency at pH 12 and 7 fit the Freundlich isotherm at pH 12 and Langmuirisotherm at pH 7. This indicated that lateritic soil was suitable for arsenic adsorption at low pH, whilst at high pH,arsenic was well adsorbed by fly ash.
