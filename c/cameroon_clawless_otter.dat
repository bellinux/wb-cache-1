40|$|Drought {{conditions}} in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, from 1990 to 1993 caused much of the Bushmans River to dry up, thus forcing Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> Aonyx capensis (Schinz), spotted-necked otters Lutra maculicollis (Lichtenstein) and water mongooses Atilax paludinosus (Cuvier) to coexist in restricted ranges. The diet of the three carnivores was compared by analysing their scats to {{determine the amount of}} trophic overlap. Expressed as relative percentage frequency, the three most common prey categories found in Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> scats were crab Potamonautes perlatus (Milne Edwards) (51 %), insect (19 %) and fish Tilapia sparrmanii (Smith) (18 %). In spotted-necked otter scats, fish (47 %), crab (38 %) and frog (8 %) were the most common, while in water mongoose scats, insect (28 %), crab (26 %) and mammal (15 %) were most abundant. Water mongooses and spotted-necked otters ate similar sizes of crabs, significantly larger than those eaten by the Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters.</b> Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> ate a wide range of crab sizes, including specimens much larger than those taken by the other two carnivores. Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> and water mongooses ate similar size fish, significantly smaller than spotted-necked otters. The results show that even during enforced cohabitation in a relatively small range during drought conditions, there is separation of diets in these three carnivores. Articl...|$|R
50|$|Their predators {{are mainly}} barn owls and grass owls, but also include pythons, mole snakes, wildcats, mongooses, and cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters.</b>|$|R
50|$|As far {{as their}} diet goes, the Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> {{probably}} feed on fairly soft prey {{items such as}} small land vertebrates, frogs, and eggs.|$|R
50|$|In {{freshwater}} habitats, {{the main}} source of food primarily consists of crabs, frogs, insects, and fish. Although crabs are available in all of their habitats, other prey in their diet may vary seasonally and change prey availability. Due to this seasonal change, the Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> usually is seen to consume higher amounts of fish in the winter (10-30%) than in the summer (0-10%). Predation on waterfowl is rarely seen, but in the winter Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> have been seen to kill domestic ducks, geese, coots, or swans.|$|R

40|$|The diet of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> was {{assessed}} at two sites along the Bloukrans River using faecal analysis. Spraints (n = 78) were collected during 2000 and 2001 and analysed using the relative {{frequency of occurrence}} and the reconstituted wet weight methods. Both methods found crab (Potamonautes perlatus) {{to be the most}} important component (> 50 %) of the diet. Frog, Xenopus and Rana spp., (11 – 42 %) was the second most important component while fish (Micropteris salmoides) was relatively unimportant (< 14 %). Although the diet of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> in the Eastern Cape Province was similar to that reported elsewhere, the fact that they were preying on an alien invasive fish and not the indigenous endemic Sandelia bainsii is significant.

40|$|Among the 4 African otter species, the Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> (Aonyx congicus) is {{the least}} known because of the {{remoteness}} of its Central African equatorial rainforest range. Its distribution, status, and biology {{in the field are}} now being investigated and preliminary results are introduced. Two missions in Gabon, followed by one in Congo, allowed us to gather local information, to find tracks and to identify otters in their habitat. Further, we were able to start developing a network to gather more information about the 2 otter species present in this region. The current distribution of the Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> (Gabon, Congo, Republic Democratic of Congo, south of Cameroon and RCA, north of Angola, and probably west of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi) was mapped from this information network {{as well as from the}} locality data of museum specimens. Data about its biology and current status were gathered from local sources and from field biologists working in Gabon and Congo. Threats seem mainly to be deforestation, hunting for bush meat and use for witchcraft materials. Four visits to the collections of natural history museums of London, New York, Paris, and Tervueren (Belgium), provided useful criteria to differentiate Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> from Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> (Aonyx. capensis). A possible sympatric overlap zone may occur between these species and might imply hybridization. However, this needs to be studied further...|$|R
50|$|However, some {{authorities}} {{consider the}} Congo/Cameroon <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> to be a separate species (A. congicus). Under this view, {{only the first}} three of the above list would be subspecies of A. capensis.|$|R
50|$|Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> are {{characterized}} by only partial webbing (between the toes of their black feet and no webbing on their front feet), and small, blunt, peg-like claws. They have very sensitive forepaws, which they use for foraging. Other otters have fully webbed feet and strong, well-developed claws. <b>Clawless</b> <b>otters</b> have slender, serpentine bodies with dense, luxurious fur and long tails. All otters have been exploited for their thick, velvety fur. Their head and body length measure to be about 600-1,000 mm (24-39 in.), and their tail length is between 400 and 710 mm (16-28 in.). These large otters can weigh between 14 and 34 kg.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of their movement patterns, seven Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> Aonyx capensis were caught in two rivers and radio-tracked between 1993 and 1995. Total range length varied from 4. 9 to 54. 1 km and core length from 0. 2 to 9. 8 km. Total area of water used varied between 4. 9 and 1062. 5 ha, and core areas from 1. 1 to 138. 9 ha. As predicted using the resource dispersion hypothesis, total home-range length was correlated with mean reed bed (high food density patch) nearest neighbour distance. The pattern of home-range use by females was suggestive of territoriality. Male Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> had overlapping home ranges, both with other males and with females. Articl...|$|R
50|$|The Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> {{be found}} in {{freshwater}} habitats that range from South Africa northward to Ethiopia {{in the east and}} Senegal in the west. This species is commonly found in Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Zaire, and Zimbabwe. However, this species is rare to find in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, and Uganda. It is very or extremely rare to see this species in Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lesotho, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, and Rwanda. A. capensis is absent in ecosystems in central African rain forest region of the Congo Basin where A. congicus, of Congo <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> is found.|$|R
40|$|The annual and {{seasonal}} diet of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> (Aonyx capensis (Schinz, 1821)) in the Olifants and Eerste rivers, Western Cape Province, South Africa, is described. Seasonal diet {{is discussed in}} relation to the availability of river crabs (Potamonautes perlatus) and fish. Crabs were found to be the main prey and fish the second most common prey of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> in the rivers during all seasons. Plant material ranked third in the diet of the otters from the Olifants River but only seventh in the Eerste River. Other prey included frogs, insects, birds and mammals. In {{terms of the number of}} prey, crabs again dominated the diet in both rivers. There was no significant difference between the relative numbers of crabs in spraints (faeces) from the two rivers. The percentage occurence of prey of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> in both rivers shows an increase in the amount of crab in summer and a corresponding decrease in the number of fish eaten. There was a significant seasonal difference in size of crabs eaten by the otters in the Olifants and Eerste rivers. The seasonal fluctuation in crab and fish corresponded to the expected frequencies as determined by trapping. Articl...|$|R
5000|$|The Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> are {{primarily}} solitary creatures, {{but have been}} seen to travel in family groups. Density of A. capensis in freshwater habitats ideally reach 1 otter per 2-3 km of stream. During the day hours, Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> typically escape {{the heat of the}} sun by hiding in dense vegetation on islands or burrowing underground. Burrows can reach up to 3 m in depth and have several entrances above or below water. Dens or burrows include rolling places, spots on the ground where the otter rolls to dry its fur, as well as multiple sprainting sites. Dens may be reused by several otters in a family group or at separate times. Breeding season for Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> starts around December and with the gestation period of 63 days, litters can be born around February. Litter size is 1-3 pups that are born with pale, smoky-gray, wooly fur. Eye-opening for the pups is seen in 16-30 days after which pups are able to venture out of the den. Weaning occurs at 45-60 days and the young become fully independent of the mother after 1 year. As with most otters, this otter species have an elaborate vocal repertoire that includes 4 main vocalizations: 2 whistles (1 low-pitched and 1 high-pitched), a grunt, and a variable noise described as a [...] "Hah!" [...] to express anxiety. Growls and snarls may be given as threats while humming-like noises may be used as a begging call in the pups. Other sounds may include squeals, mewing, and snuffing noises. Not hunting or after hunting, Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> typically emerge from the water to rest upon the shore. Rolling and rubbing is done to dry and groom the fur or can be done to scent-mark areas. Otters usually bask in the sun or can return undercover to sleep. Walking on land is awkward for Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> so they are observed to either walk slowly or do a seal-like trot. The tail can either be carried off the ground with its tip curving upwards, or dragged on the ground leaving a distinct trail. These otters are able to carry objects or prey while walking on land by holding them against the chest with one paw while hobbling on three legs. Carrying offspring on land may results in the female using both front feet to carry the young and then hobble on its back legs. Due to the awkwardness on land, Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> typically spend minimal time travelling on land.|$|R
50|$|Large {{wildlife}} species {{present in}} the reserve include South African giraffes, plains zebras, black wildebeests, kudus, nyalas, bushbucks, waterbucks, impala, warthogs, crocodiles, leopards, hyenas, vervet monkeys, vhacma baboons, common duikers. Also occasionally seen are hippopotami, bushpigs, Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters,</b> and red duikers.|$|R
50|$|Reproduction {{may occur}} {{throughout}} the year. Newborn cubs of A. congius are white {{in color and}} do not reach their adult color of brownish white until about 2 months old. The <b>clawless</b> <b>otter's</b> life span is probably an average of 10-15 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{work being}} done by the University of Stellenbosch {{investigating}} otters as biological indicators of freshwater ecosystem in South Africa is progressing well. The first aim of the project is to assess the role of both species of otter (spotted-necked otters Lutra maculicollis and Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> Aonyx capensis) in freshwater ecosystems, and the factors and mechanisms responisble for limiting their populations (their role as biological indicators will be inferred from these results) and secondly, to contribute {{to our understanding of}} carnivore behavioural ecology. The first stage in determining the distribution and status of spotted-necked <b>otters</b> and Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters,</b> in South Africa, and possible effects of environmental variants have, is almost complete. A detailed autecological study of Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> in two rivers is now the main focus of the project. Six otters have had radio transmitters implanted: MP/ 300 /L, implantable transmitter, 40 g 80 x 20 mm diameter cylinder (Telonics Inc., Arizona, USA). Since implanting, one male has died of unknown causes. A post mortem revealed total healing from the operation. Much new behavioural and ecological information has been gained by the use of the radio tracking. One adult male has a home range of at least 45 km, much more than first expected for the species. Work has also been done in the Eastern Cape Province determining the diet of three coexisting carnivores, spotted-necked <b>otters,</b> Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> and water mongoose (Atilax paludinosus). This work is about to be submitted for publication. We thank the Southern African Nature Foundation (WWF), for providing funds, and Mazda Wildlife Fund for providing a vehicle for the project...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper draws {{together}} current {{knowledge on}} the distribution of otters in South Africa. Aonyx capensis is more widespread than Lutra maculicollis, which is adapted to feed on fish, and hence is limited to areas which can support them, whereas <b>clawless</b> <b>otters</b> are adapted to eat the more widespread crabs and frogs. Otters are protected in reserves and national parks. Hunting outside of these areas is not a serious threat, but habitat degradation and loss due to rapid expansion of the human population. Two otter species occur in South Africa: the Cape <b>clawless</b> <b>otter</b> Aonyx capensis and the spotted-necked otter Lutra maculicollls.
