5|$|One {{question}} of constitutional interpretation that was highlighted during the parliamentary debates pertained {{to the former}} Article 22H which had been incorrectly inserted into the Constitution by the Constitution (Amendment) Act 1991 in January 1991. Article 22H(1) provided that the President might, acting in his discretion, withhold his assent to any bill passed by Parliament (other than a bill to which Article 5(2A) applied) if the bill provided for the circumvention or <b>curtailment</b> of the discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. At that time, Article 5(2A), which entrenched certain core constitutional provisions (of which Article 22H(1) was one) by requiring {{the approval of the}} electorate at a national referendum for their amendment, had not been brought into force.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, Parliament {{intended}} to amend Article 22H {{to restrict the}} President's powers thereunder to only non-constitutional bills which provided for the circumvention or <b>curtailment</b> of the President's discretionary powers conferred upon him by the Constitution. Because Article 5(2A) was not in force, a question arose {{as to whether the}} President had the power under Article 22H(1) to withhold his assent to any bill seeking to amend any of the provisions referred to in Article 5(2A), and specifically to any bill seeking to amend Article 22H. President Ong Teng Cheong stated that in the interest of testing out the system, he wished to have this question referred to the courts for a ruling, and that he would accept as correct whatever interpretation of Article 22H was given by the court. In response to his request, Article 100 was inserted into the Constitution by Parliament for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1907 Mahler, {{exhausted}} {{from the effects of}} the campaign against him in Vienna, took his family to Maiernigg. Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria. Anna recovered, but after a fortnight's struggle Maria died on 12 July. Immediately following this devastating loss, Mahler learned that his heart was defective, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist, who ordered a <b>curtailment</b> of all forms of vigorous exercise. The extent to which Mahler's condition disabled him is unclear; Alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence, though Mahler himself, in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907, said that {{he would be able to}} live a normal life, apart from avoiding over-fatigue. The illness was, however, a further depressing factor; at the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed, and never revisited.|$|E

5|$|This <b>curtailment</b> of governors' {{powers as}} the Emperors' representatives may have lessened the {{political}} dangers of an all-too-powerful class of Imperial delegates, {{but it also}} severely limited governors' ability to oppose local landed elites, specially those of senatorial status, which, although with reduced opportunities for office holding, retained wealth, social prestige, and personal connections. – specially in relatively peaceful regions without a great military presence. On one occasion, Diocletian had to exhort a proconsul of Africa not to fear the consequences of treading on the toes of the local magnates of senatorial rank. If a governor of senatorial rank himself felt these pressures, one can imagine the difficulties faced by a mere praeses. That accounts for the strained relationship between the central power and local elites: sometime during 303, an attempted military sedition in Seleucia Pieria and Antioch made Diocletian to extract a bloody retribution on both cities by putting to death a number of their council members for failing their duties of keeping order in their jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without <b>curtailment,</b> which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of {{administrator}} of the Aldeburgh festival, and race relations adviser to the Greater London Council. His attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing. In February 1982 it was announced that he was to become director of the British section of Amnesty International, but the appointment was opposed by many of the organisation's membership, and after a month of controversy Thorpe withdrew from the post. He kept his position as chairman of the political committee of the United Nations Association, but in 1985 the progression of Parkinson's disease, which had first been diagnosed in 1979, led to the <b>curtailment</b> of most of his public activity. He continued to live in North Devon, and in 1987 accepted the honorary presidency of the North Devon Liberal Democrat association, formed after the Liberal–SDP merger. He thought he might return to parliament via a life peerage in the House of Lords, but although friends lobbied on his behalf, the merged party's leadership refused to recommend him. Within the party generally, feelings towards him warmed, and when he attended the 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation.|$|E

The activation of AGC units, controllable loads and energy storage system used in the secondary frequency control is termed as the controllable synergistic capability for the basis of the automatic synergistic capability. If the uncertainties increase further, the controllable synergistic capability will run out, and the <b>curtailments</b> of loads and renewable generations are inevitable.

5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered <b>curtailment</b> of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of water-borne supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as <b>curtailment.</b> While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

30|$|From {{the results}} shown in Figs.  8 and 9, {{we can see}} that two gas {{pipelines}} hardened and three gas pipelines hardened has nearly the same gas and power load <b>curtailments.</b> However, compared with none gas line hardened and one gas line hardened, load <b>curtailments</b> obviously decrease. Similarly, 7 – 10 power transmission lines hardened also have nearly the same results. As the costs will increase if more lines are hardened, 7 power transmission lines and 2 gas pipelines hardened is the most economic and effective plan to protect integrated energy system from attacks.|$|R

30|$|In {{the second}} iteration, {{a new set}} of {{candidate}} solutions is derived from the best round- 1 solution κ _ 1 =κ̃_ 1 ^ 2. The best candidate, κ _ 2 = κ̃^ 3 _ 2, eliminates the risk from a complete failure to trip generators at Bus 22 in response to a fault in transformer 7 or a double circuit failure at lines 25 and 26. This is achieved through a combination of generation <b>curtailments</b> and extra SPS capacity; it opts for committing SPS capacity at Bus 21 (g_ 4) to diversify the SPS response. The other two candidates shown heavily rely on an increase in generation <b>curtailments</b> and protection costs in order to minimize the risk exposure—yet not enough gain is achieved to compensate these extra costs.|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that losses are less persistent than profits and that stock prices anticipate the lower persistence of losses. Yet the underlying explanation for these results is unclear. One explanation lies in the abandonment option, whereby firms with losses {{are more likely to}} curtail operations (e. g., Hayn [Hayn C (1995) The information content of losses. J. Accounting Econom. 20 (2) : 125 – 153]). Another explanation involves timely loss recognition stemming from conservative accounting (e. g., Basu [Basu S (1997) The conservatism principle and the asymmetric timeliness of earnings. J. Accounting Econom. 24 (1) : 3 – 37]). We provide direct evidence that <b>curtailments</b> are an important factor contributing to the lower persistence of losses. An implication of our results is that popular measures of conservatism, such as the measure proposed by Basu, also reflect <b>curtailments...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{integration of}} wind energy in power {{systems can be}} responsible for the occurrence of over-generation, especially during the off-peak periods. This paper presents a dedicated methodology to identify and quantify the occurrence of this over-generation and to evaluate some of the solutions that can be adopted to mitigate this problem. The methodology is applied to the Portuguese power system, in which the wind energy is expected to represent more than 25 % of the installed capacity in a near future. The results show that the pumped-hydro units will not provide enough energy storage capacity and, therefore, wind <b>curtailments</b> are expected to occur in the Portuguese system. Additional energy storage devices can be implemented to offset the wind energy <b>curtailments.</b> However, the investment analysis performed show that they are not economically viable, due to the present high capital costs involved. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
