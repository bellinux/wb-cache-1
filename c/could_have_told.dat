I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|After he had cut Blakelock, Hill said, Silcott {{told him}} he was cool and asked what he had seen. Hill said he replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] and that Silcott said, [...] "Well, you can go." [...] He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again.

500|$|Mars Attacks! drew mixed {{responses}} from critics. Based on 63 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 52% of the reviewers enjoyed the film, {{with an average}} score of 5.9/10. By comparison, Metacritic calculated an average score of 52/100 from 19 reviews. Roger Ebert observed the homages to the 1950s science fiction B movies. [...] "Ed Wood himself <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> us what's wrong with this movie: the makers felt superior to the material. To be funny, even schlock has to believe in itself. Look for Infra-Man (1975) or Invasion of the Bee Girls (1973) {{and you will find}} movies that lack stars and big budgets and fancy special effects but are funny and fun in a way that Burton's megaproduction never really understands." ...|$|E
500|$|Seven {{opposition}} political parties, including Al Wefaq and the National Democratic Action Society, {{issued a}} joint statement rejecting the government's charge that the demonstrators were armed and condemning [...] "the heinous massacre" [...] perpetrated by police, including the prevention of ambulances from reaching the site to ferry the wounded to hospital. They demanded {{the resignation of the}} government and the formation of a new one to investigate the [...] "crime" [...] and submit political reforms. Ibrahim Sharif, the head of National Democratic Action Society and a Sunni Muslim, said protesters were not given enough time to evacuate the area and that government <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them hours before or even by small papers thrown from helicopters. He told the BBC that [...] "throughout the day there were rumours we would have another 24 hours, but the attack has come without [...] warning." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ghost of a Chance" [...] {{introduced}} {{several important}} characters {{that would be}} regularly featured throughout the series. Among them were prosecuting attorney Ed Danvers, played by Željko Ivanek, and police department bosses Colonel Burt Granger and Captain George Barnfather, played by Gerald F. Gough and Clayton LeBouef, respectively. Ivanek was cast by his long-time friend Fontana, who thought Danvers was written in a dull and simple way, but felt confident Ivanek could [...] "make it a real character". The episode also introduced Officer Chris Thormann (Lee Tergesen), who would become {{the center of a}} significant season one subplot in the next episode, [...] "", when he would be shot in the head during a failed arrest. Detective Tom Pellegrini, who handled the real-life Latonya Kim Wallace case and served {{as the basis for the}} Tim Bayliss character, appeared on-screen [...] as the police officer who first discovered Adena Watson's body. Pellegrini, who was still haunted by his failure to solve the Wallace case, specifically asked to be in that scene. During filming, he stayed close to the actress who played Watson, which Secor interpreted as an attempt to make amends to the real Wallace child. Although Pellegrini personally advised Secor on his performance, the actor later said he learned more about how to play Bayliss by watching Pellegrini during that scene than anything else the detective <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him.|$|E

500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. She asked me if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} founded by Savage in {{response}} to the suicide of Billy Lucas and other teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be, such as with Raymond Chase, Tyler Clementi, Ryan Halligan, Asher Brown, and Seth Walsh.

I wish I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that, however bad things were, however isolated and alone he was, it gets better." [...] In September, they launched their YouTube channel. A one-hour special aired on February 21, 2012, hosted by Savage. A second hour long [...] "It Gets Better" [...] special was aired on both MTV and Logo networks on October 9, 2012. On May 3, 2011, a video ad developed by Google Chrome was launched during an episode of Glee and later aired across the nation.|$|E

6000|$|It was a {{fair enough}} question, but I did not answer him, and simply turned the pad over with a {{movement}} of instinctive secrecy: I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him he <b>had</b> put to flight the psychology of Nina Almayer, her opening speech of the tenth chapter and the words of Mrs. Almayer's wisdom which were {{to follow in the}} ominous oncoming of a tropical night. I <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that Nina had said: [...] "It has set at last." [...] He would have been extremely surprised and perhaps have dropped his precious banjo. Neither <b>could</b> I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that the sun of my sea-going was setting too, even as I wrote the words expressing the impatience of passionate youth bent on its desire. I did not know this myself, and {{it is safe to say}} he would not have cared, though he was an excellent young fellow and treated me with more deference than, in our relative positions, I was strictly entitled to.|$|R

2500|$|In 2007, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council faulted CKNW, a {{radio station}} in Vancouver, British Columbia for airing [...] "potentially {{dangerous}} information" [...] during the Dawson College shooting. During the incident, CKNW had simulcast content from its sister stations in Montreal which included students speaking by cellphone from inside the school. A Vancouver man complained that the content <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the gunman where the students were. The council said {{that as a result}} of modern technology reducing geographic distance as a barrier, CKNW had breached Section 10 (coverage of violent situations) of the broadcast code. The station broadcast the decision as required, but did not air an apology.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in The New Yorker {{separately}} supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics {{are out to}} destroy films, explaining, [...] "Someone <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Iñárritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play,' before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job." [...] In The New York Times, Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus, the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying {{too close to the}} sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's Against Interpretation in the dressing-room mirror.|$|E
2500|$|On July 3, 1988 the USS Vincennes {{shot down}} Iran Air Flight 655 killing 290 {{passengers}} and Cockburn {{set out to}} cover the story with Ken Silverstein. The Pentagon claimed that the incident came about because the USS Vincennes misidentified the Airbus A300 for an F-14 Tomcat about to attack. Cockburn challenged this account in his Wall Street Journal column. Later, Alexander and Ken Silverstein would research and co-author {{an article on the}} incident for Harper's Magazine in September 1988. The Harper's piece concluded [...] "A pair of binoculars <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the officers of the Vincennes what was flying overhead. But binoculars don’t cost half a billion dollars.

2500|$|The {{operators}} had {{not been}} trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. There was a temperature indicator downstream of the pilot-operated relief valve in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer that <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them the valve was stuck open, by showing that {{the temperature in the}} tail pipe remained higher than it should have been had the pilot-operated relief valve been shut. This temperature indicator, however, {{was not part of the}} [...] "safety grade" [...] suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators {{had not been}} trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight of the operators.|$|E
2500|$|Ahab {{seems to}} have had no model in real life, though his death may have been based on an actual event. On May 18, 1843, Melville was aboard The Star, which sailed for Honolulu. Aboard were two sailors from the Nantucket who <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that they had seen their second mate [...] "taken out of a {{whaleboat}} by a foul line and drowned". The model for the Whaleman's Chapel of chapter 7 is the Seamen's Bethel on Johnny Cake Hill. Melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the Acushnet, and he heard a sermon by the chaplain, 63-year-old Reverend Enoch Mudge, who is at least in part the model for Father Mapple. Even the topic of Jonah and the Whale may be authentic, for Mudge was a contributor to Sailor's Magazine, which printed in December 1840 the ninth of a series of sermons on Jonah.|$|E
2500|$|An {{interim report}} was {{issued by the}} investigative panel headed by Yotaro Hatamura. [...] In the report, the panel {{concluded}} that poor internal communication by the Japanese government and faulty knowledge and actions by TEPCO employees contributed to the disaster. [...] The Japanese cabinet was not informed of the government's System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information, which <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them of the wind direction's effect on the spread of radiation, which would have allowed them to make better decisions on which areas to evacuate around Fukushima Daiichi. [...] TEPCO workers mistakenly believed that the isolation condenser for reactor No. 1 was still working, when it was not, delaying efforts to try other methods to cool the reactor. [...] TEPCO workers turned off an emergency cooling system on reactor No. 3 for seven hours to try to switch to another system that was not working, allowing the reactor to overheat more quickly.|$|E

2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Another measure, {{directed}} {{directly at}} the Dutch trade system outside the direct Franco-Dutch relations, was the founding {{of a number of}} chartered trading companies that were intended to compete with the Dutch VOC and WIC, but also make inroads on the Dutch Baltic trade, like the already mentioned West India Company and the French East India Company, both formed in 1664, and given monopolies in France. These caused the Dutch some anxiety, but proved eventually not very successful. The same applied to the Compagnie du Nord that Colbert set up in 1669 to compete with the Dutch in Scandinavia. This was supposed to engross the Dutch salt trade with especially Norway, and replace it with French salt. Unfortunately, the French salt with a high magnesium content proved unfit for preserving herring (as the Dutch <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Colbert, because they had tried to sell it to the Norwegians themselves, when the Iberian salt trade was closed to them). France therefore had to subsidise these exports, and also the otherwise uncompetitive French shipping rates. Despite government pressure the Bordeaux wine merchants [...] were unwilling to shift their exports away from Dutch carriers, or do without Dutch prefinancing of their operations. The unprofitability of its operations, combined with Dutch dumping policies in the trade of Baltic naval stores, forced the winding up of the company in 1675.|$|E
