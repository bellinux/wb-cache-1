40|$|The heat {{capacities}} between T = (5 and 320) Ðš and the enthalpies {{of phase}} transitions of <b>cyclohexyl</b> <b>formate,</b> acetate, butyrate, and valerate in the condensed state {{were determined by}} adiabatic calorimetry. All the substances were found to form glasses. Cyclohexyl acetate had a solid-to-solid transition. The configurational entropies of the investigated substances in the liquid state were considered according to Adam-Gibbs theory. The enthalpies of hole formation in liquid esters were estimated from the temperature dependences of their densities. The heat capacity jumps at fusion, glass transition and vaporization of the compounds were analyzed {{in terms of the}} hole theory of liquids...|$|E
