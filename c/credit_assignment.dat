40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} whether class participation/interaction in an online, large enrollment learning environment improves student learning capability. This study will examine findings from a convenience sample of 185 students enrolled in an online Growth and Development class offered in the fall of 2009. The majority of the sample were female (82. 16 %) and had self-identified as a pre-nursing (65. 4 %) student. In addition, there is a fairly even distribution among the students regarding academic standing (Frosh, Soph, Jr, and Sr.) The online class format offered students the option of participating in seven class discussions using the BlackBoard system as extra credit opportunities. This study will use participation in the extra <b>credit</b> discussion <b>assignment</b> as a measure of class participation and grades on individual and final exams as measures of learning capability. Correlations between the number of extra <b>credit</b> <b>assignments</b> completed and exam grades will be examined.

5000|$|Interest in {{learning}} classifier systems was reinvigorated {{in the mid}} 1990s largely due to two events; {{the development of the}} Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning, and the introduction of significantly simplified Michigan-style LCS architectures by Stewart Wilson. [...] Wilson's Zeroth-level Classifier System (ZCS) focused on increasing algorithmic understandability based on Hollands standard LCS implementation. [...] This was done, in part, by removing rule-bidding and the internal message list, essential to the original BBA <b>credit</b> <b>assignment,</b> and replacing it with a hybrid BBA/Q-Learning strategy. ZCS demonstrated that a much simpler LCS architecture could perform as well as the original, more complex implementations.

50|$|In {{the sixth}} step, the rule {{parameters}} of any rule in M are updated {{to reflect the}} new experience gained from the current training instance. Depending on the LCS algorithm, a number of updates can take place at this step. For supervised learning, we can simply update the accuracy/error of a rule. Rule accuracy/error is different than model accuracy/error, since it is not calculated over the entire training data, but only over all instances that it matched. Rule accuracy is calculated by dividing {{the number of times}} the rule was in a correct set C by the number of times it was in a match set M. Rule accuracy {{can be thought of as}} a 'local accuracy'. Rule fitness is also updated here, and is commonly calculated as a function of rule accuracy. The concept of fitness is taken directly from classic genetic algorithms. Be aware that there are many variations on how LCS updates parameters in order to perform <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> and learning.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} {{imperative for}} business process preservation comes from several pressures. Heavily regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacture must fully document processes {{so that they}} can be audited, reproduced, or diagnosed. Long-lived companies must manage services across multiple changes in technical environments. Organisations that use escrow services to mitigate risk must be confident that all of the needed information is demonstrably included in the escrow agreement and services. Organisations undergoing major staff changes must ensure that they retain the knowledge needed to operate or re-instate production processes. In addition to publications and data, academics need the software and process information to assess the validity of the data and the derived scientific claims. The same provenance information that can provide a key in regulated industries can also support <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> in academia. All industries benefit from analysis of processes that may lead to their continuous improvement. Memory institutions need to document the provenance of their digital collections as they undergo format-shifts to prove the authenticity or quality of their process products.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{important}} {{concepts that}} emerged {{in the early days of}} LCS research included (1) the formalization of a bucket brigade algorithm (BBA) for credit assignment/learning, (2) selection of parent rules from a common 'environmental niche' (i.e. the match set M) rather than from the whole population P, (3) covering, first introduced as a create operator, (4) the formalization of an action set A, (5) a simplified algorithm architecture, (6) strength-based fitness, (7) consideration of single-step, or supervised learning problems and the introduction of the correct set C, (8) accuracy-based fitness (9) the combination of fuzzy logic with LCS (which later spawned a lineage of fuzzy LCS algorithms), (10) encouraging long action chains and default hierarchies for improving performance on multi-step problems, (11) examining latent learning (which later inspired a new branch of anticipatory classifier systems (ACS)), and (12) the introduction of the first Q-learning-like <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> technique.

5000|$|In 1995, Wilson {{published}} his landmark paper, [...] "Classifier fitness based on accuracy" [...] {{in which he}} introduced the classifier system XCS. [...] XCS took the simplified architecture of ZCS and added an accuracy-based fitness, a niche GA (acting in the action set A), an explicit generalization mechanism called subsumption, and an adaptation of the Q-Learning <b>credit</b> <b>assignment.</b> XCS was popularized by its ability to reach optimal performance while evolving accurate and maximally general classifiers {{as well as its}} impressive problem flexibility (able to perform both reinforcement learning and supervised learning) [...] XCS later became the best known and most studied LCS algorithm and defined a new family of accuracy-based LCS. ZCS alternatively became synonymous with strength-based LCS. XCS is also important, because it successfully bridged the gap between LCS and the field of reinforcement learning. Following the success of XCS, LCS were later described as reinforcement learning systems endowed with a generalization capability. [...] Reinforcement learning typically seeks to learn a value function that maps out a complete representation of the state/action space. Similarly, the design of XCS drives it to form an all-inclusive and accurate representation of the problem space (i.e. a complete map) rather than focusing on high payoff niches in the environment (as was the case with strength-based LCS). Conceptually, complete maps don't only capture what you should do, or what is correct, but also what you shouldn't do, or what's incorrect. Differently, most strength-based LCSs, or exclusively supervised learning LCSs seek a rule set of efficient generalizations {{in the form of a}} best action map (or a partial map). Comparisons between strength vs. accuracy-based fitness and complete vs. best action maps have since been examined in greater detail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reinforcement {{learning}} (RL) algorithms {{attempt to}} assign {{the credit for}} rewards to the actions {{that contributed to the}} reward. Thus far, <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> has been done in one of two ways: uniformly, or using a discounting model that assigns exponentially more credit to recent actions. This paper demonstrates an alternative approach to temporal <b>credit</b> <b>assignment,</b> taking advantage of exact or approximate prior information about correct <b>credit</b> <b>assignment.</b> Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are used to model <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> information. IIR filters generalise exponentially discounting eligibility traces to arbitrary <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> models. This approach can be applied to any RL algorithm that employs an eligibility trace. The use of IIR <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> filters is explored using both the GPOMDP policy-gradient algorithm and the Sarsa(Î») temporal-difference algorithm. A drop in bias and variance of value or gradient estimates is demonstrated, resulting in faster convergence to better policies. ...|$|E

40|$|Overview of Program StressAlyzer {{is a set}} of {{computer}} modules running on Windows-based PCs, which help students develop expertise in analyzing very fundamental problems in Mechanics of Materials. Each module is devoted to a single topic, such axial loading, shear force and bending moment diagrams, etc. Each module typically begins with very simple problems; subsequent problems become progressively more complex. The total number of problems ranges from 20 to 40, depending on the module. For most problems, randomly generated versions are offered. This allows a user to try the same type of problem multiple times. There are brief reviews of the relevant theory, either {{at the beginning of a}} module or interspersed between problems. However, it is best to use StressAlyzer in conjunction with the other activities of a typical Mechanics of Materials course, including lectures, a textbook and so forth. StressAlyzer can be used, for example, as required homework <b>assignments,</b> as extra <b>credit</b> <b>assignments,</b> or as review before examinations. Each module typically requires 2 to 5 hours to complete. By keeping a log file, the program tracks the user's successful completion of problems. The user can quit after completing any number of problems, and then call up the log file and resume work at a later time. The log file can be submitted for grading either electronically as an email attachment, or by handing in a diskette. Accompanying material with book # E 10091...|$|R
40|$|Single-agent {{reinforcement}} {{learners in}} time-extended domains and multi-agent systems {{share a common}} difficulty known as the <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> problem. Multiagent systems have the structural <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> problem of determining the contributions of a particular agent to a common task. Instead, time-extended single-agent systems have the temporal <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> problem of determining the contribution of a particular action {{to the quality of}} the full sequence of actions. Traditionally these two problems are considered different and are handled in separate ways. In this article we show how these two forms of the <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> problem are equivalent. In this unified framework, a single-agent Markov decision process can be broken down into a single-time-step multiagent process. Furthermore we show that Monte Carlo estimation or Q-learning (depending on whether the values of resulting actions in the episode are known at the time of learning) are equivalent to different agent utility functions in a multi-agent system. This equivalence shows how an often neglected issue in multi-agent systems is equivalent to a well-known deficiency in multi-timestep learning and lays the basis for solving time-extended multi-agent problems, where both <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> problems are present. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multiagent {{systems have}} had a {{powerful}} impact on the real world. Many of the systems it studies (air traffic, satellite coordination, rover explo-ration) are inherently multi-objective, but they are often treated as single-objective problems within the research. A very important concept within multiagent sys-tems is that of credit assignment: clearly quantifying an individual agentâs impact on the overall system performance. In this work we extend the concept of <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> into multi-objective problems, broadening the traditional multiagent learning framework to account for multiple objectives. We show in two domains that by leveraging established <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> principles in a multi-objective setting, we can improve performance by (i) increasing learning speed by up to 10 x (ii) reducing sensitivity to unmodeled disturbances by up to 98. 4 % and (iii) producing solutions that dominate all solutions discovered by a traditional team-based <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> schema. Our results suggest that in a multiagent multi-objective problem, proper <b>credit</b> <b>assignment</b> is as important to performance as the choice of multi-objective algorithm. ...|$|E
40|$|Giving âextra creditâ work to {{students}} {{has been a}} controversial and hotly debated pedagogical issue for the last 20 years (Blood et al. 1993; Groves 2000; Muztaba Fuad and Jones 2012; Norcross et al. 1989; Weimer 2011). Previous work {{has focused on the}} faculty perspective discussing benefits and drawbacks associated with extra credit work (e. g. Hill et al. 1993; Norcross et al. 1989). Other scholars have investigated the use and effects of pop quizzes and other extra <b>credit</b> <b>assignments</b> on studentsâ final grades (Thorne 2000; Oley 1993). Some authors have criticized that the empirical exploration of understanding studentsâ motivational and performance efforts remains scarce and ârarely appears in the literatureâ (Mays and Bower 2005, p. 1). Besides a gap of empirical work it further appears that most existing studies stem from Psychology or Information Science. Yet it is surprising that, even though the topic of extra credit is considered a common practice in marketing education (Ackerman and Kiesler 2007), there is a wide gap within the marketing education literature. For example, a quick search in the Journal of Marketing Education for the keyword âextra creditâ shows only 25 search results; yet none of those papers address motivational or performance effects of extra credit. A further search in Marketing Education Review yielded no results at all. To the authorsâ knowledge, the topic has only been addressed once by Ackerman and Kiesler in the 2007 MEA Proceedings who conclude that for âsuch a common part of the marketing education curriculum, we know surprisingly little about its impact on studentsâ (p. 123) ...|$|R

The ensemble learning methods produce models that are either homogenous or heterogeneous. Homogenous algorithms which use the same algorithm with different parameter either by introducing randomness or by manipulating input attributes, model outputs or training instances with a process of âbaggingâ or âboostingâ as has been described in [121].
