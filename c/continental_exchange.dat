40|$|Studies of Iron Age {{artefacts}} from Britain tend to {{be dominated}} either by the study of metalwork, or pottery. This thesis presents a study not only of a different material, but also {{a different type of}} object: glass beads. These are found in a range of different sizes, shapes, colours, and employ a variety of different decorative motifs. Thus far, glass beads have been studied through typology (Guido 1978 a) and compositional analysis (Bertini 2012; Henderson 1982), yet a thorough analysis of the social context of glass beads remains absent. Through an analysis of glass beads from four key study regions in Britain, this thesis aims not only to address regional differences in appearance and chronology, but also to explore the role that this object played within the networks and relationships that constructed Iron Age society. It seeks to understand how they were used during their lives and how they came to be deposited within the archaeological record, in order to establish the social processes that glass beads were bound within. The results indicate that glass beads were a strongly regionalised artefact, potentially reflecting differing local preferences for colour and motif. In addition, glass beads, in combination with several other types of object, were integral to Middle Iron Age dress. Given that the first century BC is often seen as a turning point in terms of settlements and material culture, this supports the possibility of strong <b>continental</b> <b>exchange</b> during an earlier period for either glass beads or raw materials. However, by the Late Iron Age in the first century BC and early first century AD, their use had severely diminished...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{increased}} competition between European stock exchanges {{has reduced the}} cost of trading and increased the variety of trading mechanisms. The London Stock Exchange, which initiated the competition in 1986 by setting up the SEAQ-I market, attracted considerable trading volume in Continental equities in the late 1980 s. Later, however, <b>Continental</b> <b>exchanges</b> recovered most of the trading volume from London upon restructuring their auction systems so as to offer very low trading costs, greater transparency and continuous trading via an automated order book. At the same time, the spreads quoted by SEAQ-I dealers increased considerably. Lately, potential competition by continuous auction systems is threatening even the market for British equities, and prompting the London Stock Exchange to replace its former SEAQ system with an automated order book. As in Continental Bourses, this automated auction system is expected to run in parallel with a dealership market for large trades. So trading systems appear to be converging towards a dualistic structure all over Europe. The paper documents these developments, and considers how the competition between European exchanges is likely to evolve and which opportunities and dangers the future may hold for them. ...|$|R

Although studies on insular taxa have improved our understanding of macroevolutionary phenomena, we know little about the macroevolutionary dynamics of <b>continental</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Here we study the evolution of eight Carnivora families that have migrated across the Northern Hemisphere to investigate if continental invasions also result in explosive diversification dynamics. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate speciation and extinction rates from a substantial dataset of fossil occurrences while accounting for the incompleteness of the fossil record. Our analyses revealed a strongly asymmetrical pattern in which North American lineages invading Eurasia underwent explosive radiations, whereas lineages invading North America maintained uniform diversification dynamics. These invasions into Eurasia were characterized by high rates of speciation and extinction. The radiation of the arriving lineages in Eurasia coincide with the decline of established lineages or phases of climate change, suggesting differences in the ecological settings between the continents {{may be responsible for}} the disparity in diversification dynamics. These results reveal long-term outcomes of biological invasions and show that the importance of explosive radiations in shaping diversity extends beyond insular systems and have significant impact at continental scales...|$|R

50|$|The {{two other}} {{official}} forms of reaching freedom, parole and exchange, was common among high-ranking officers. Parole specifically dealt with individual {{prisoners of war}} and so {{the process of being}} removed from imprisonment or house arrest, and instead placed on parole, was a very simple and speedy process. This was what most British and German prisoners of war sought after. The degree of liberty when on parole varied and the breaking of parole was common, as many used it just to make desertion easier. Some British and Hessian prisoners of war were paroled to American farmers. Their labor made up for shortages caused by the number of men serving in the <b>Continental</b> Army. <b>Exchange,</b> however, was a very complex and slow process because it involved negotiation and diplomacy between a new and inexperienced nation and a state that absolutely refused to recognize American independence. A major hindrance to exchange was the reluctance of the British to concede non-rebel status to her adversaries. The British's perception of the Americans being rebels prevented exchange. A degree of mutual acceptance between Congress and the States, of the principle of exchange and procedure in its implementing must have been attained by the end of March, 1777. Exchange handled primarily by Congress instead of state powers. While state and local government had considerable power over parole, the federal government had power of negotiating exchanges.|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} in situ {{measurement of}} δ 18 O in atmospheric CO 2 opens a new door to differentiating between CO 2 source and sink components with high temporal resolution. Continuous 13 C–CO 2 measurement systems have already been commercially available for some time, but until now, only few instruments {{have been able to}} provide a continuous measurement of the oxygen isotope ratio in CO 2. Besides precise 13 C/ 12 C observations, the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer is also able to measure the 18 O / 16 O ratio in CO 2, but the precision and accuracy of the measurements have not yet been evaluated. Here we present a first analysis of δ 18 O-CO 2 (and δ 13 C-CO 2) measurements with the FTIR analyser in Heidelberg. We used Allan deviation to determine the repeatability of δ 18 O-CO 2 measurements and found that it decreases from 0. 25 ‰ for 10 min averages to about 0. 1 ‰ after 2 h and remains at that value up to 24 h. We evaluated the measurement precision over a 10 -month period (intermediate measurement precision) using daily working gas measurements and found that our spectrometer measured δ 18 O-CO 2 to better than 0. 3 ‰ at a temporal resolution of less than 10 min. The compatibility of our FTIR-spectrometric measurements to isotope-ratio mass-spectrometric (IRMS) measurements was determined by comparing FTIR measurements of cylinder gases and ambient air with IRMS measurements of flask samples, filled with gases of the same cylinders or collected from the same ambient air intake. Two-sample t tests revealed that, at the 0. 01 significance level, the FTIR and the IRMS measurements do not differ significantly from each other and are thus compatible. We describe two weekly episodes of ambient air measurements, one in winter and one in summer, and discuss what potential insights and new challenges combined highly resolved CO 2, δ 13 C-CO 2 and δ 18 O-CO 2 records may provide in terms of better understanding regional scale <b>continental</b> carbon <b>exchange</b> processes...|$|R
30|$|During the {{classical}} gold standard, aggravated levels of {{political or economic}} uncertainty manifested themselves in large deviations of the sight-rate from the mint-par (Clare 1902, p. 98). To uncover how the investment demand for bills of exchange reacted to such events, Table  3 splits the sample into observations within and outside (or on) the gold points. Of note, the vagaries to determine the gold points introduce an important caveat to this approach. Still, for observations laying outside the gold points according to the values reported in the “Exchange rates during the gold standard” section, the top panel suggests that the interest-parity condition as regards the London investment demand for <b>continental</b> bills of <b>exchange</b> {{can no longer be}} rejected for the case of Paris (whereas there is only a rejection at the 10 % level for the case of Amsterdam) 9. Although the London banker was, reportedly, “content with a safe and steady rate of interest” (Thomas 1921, p. 78), sufficiently large opportunities to make a chance profit did, perhaps, give rise to more active short-term investment activity in higher yielding bills of exchange on established financial centres such as Paris. Conversely, according to the bottom panel, the results of (3) differ hardly when distinguishing between observations within and outside the gold points. For the continental investment demand for London bills of exchange, where exchange rate risk was hedged, this distinction should indeed be less relevant.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{reconstruct}} the anthropogenic paleozoogeography of introduced Neotropical mammals in the West Indies provide new analytical foundations for evaluating island and <b>continental</b> human interaction, <b>exchange,</b> colonization, and animal management. Key questions in these investigations concern the timing, source, population viability, and environmental impact of continental faunal translocations in the pre-Columbian insular Caribbean. To investigate these issues we analyzed Sr/Sr, Pb/Pb, Pb/Pb, and Pb/Pb isotope ratios from environmental samples and agouti (Dasyprocta sp.) and opossum (Didelphis cf. marsupialis) remains from Ceramic Age (500 BC - AD 1500) archaeological deposits on the islands of Nevis, Carriacou, and Mustique in the Lesser Antilles. This study was undertaken to assess the suitability of agouti and opossum tooth enamel for isotopic analysis, characterize local bioavailable Sr and Pb isotope ratios, and distinguish possible local and non-local agouti and opossum individuals. We demonstrate large intra-island variability in bioavailable Sr across multiple islands giving rise to potential equifinality in identifying taxa of non-local origin. We argue, consequently, for the necessity of comprehensive environmental sampling at the island scale to better define the range and mean of bioavailable Sr for a given locale. Our results further show that Pb isotope analysis of sampled taxa is problematized to varying degrees by modern anthropogenic lead contamination, even for well-preserved 2 ̆ 7 clean 2 ̆ 7 tooth enamel from intact archaeological specimens and {{raise questions about the}} utility of this method for evaluating past animal translocations and the use of small mammals for establishing local bioavailable Pb. Despite these results, Sr data are sound and, in combination with vetted Pb ratios, indicate that agouti and opossum were established as living populations on Carriacou and Nevis as early as ca. AD 600 / 800, and possibly earlier. These results establish baseline data for evaluating exchange networks involving living animals or their parts, potential captive management of agouti and opossum, and the ecological impact of exotic species during the Pre-Columbian era in the West Indies...|$|R

40|$|Understanding of the tropospheric {{mid-latitude}} ozone {{trends in}} the free troposphere depends on several forcing mechanisms varying in different directions: change of <b>continental</b> emissions, Sratosphere-Troposphere <b>Exchange</b> (STE), upward ozone flux from the boundary layer (BL) and long range transport. The western Mediterranean is a well suited region to study the change of European emission but also the role of long range transport of other continental emissions (Ravetta et al., 2007). Moreover, Wilson et al., 2012, show a difference of ozone trend in south Europe compared to north and central Europe but south Europe is much less represented. In this work, the tropospheric ozone variability is derived from regular vertical profiles obtained using two types of instruments during the time period 1990 - 2010 at Observatoire de Haute Provence in Southern France (44 N, 6 E) which {{is included in the}} NDACC network: ECC balloon borne ozonesondes and a UV DIAL lidar. The latter provides data in the altitude range 3 - 14 km. A ground based UV photometer is also used since 1998. Seasonal variations in 2 -km layers in the troposphere (2 - 8 km) for four five years periods were analysed with 3 -days three dimensional backward trajectories calculated for each vertical profile during twenty years. Four source regions are identified: [Europe (lat> 45 N) ], [Eastern Mediterranean], [Spain/Africa/North America (lat 40 N) ]. Considering lidar and ozonesondes data seperatly we cannot identify a clear bias due to the measurement method while differences are related to the sampling conditions. Using lidar and ECC observation together, we have shown that there is a good correlation between ozone variability and changes of the transport pattern in the free troposphere, but no significant trends are observed above 3 km. In the lower troposphere, there is, however, a significant downward trend which is linked to the evolution of the planetary boundary layer height and changes in continental emissions. We will show also a joint analysis of ozone layers and the climatology of aerosol and water vapor layers. Water vapor profiles are obtained from the VAÏSALA sondes flown with the ECC sonde since 1990. The aerosol profiles are provided by the CALIPSO mission since 2006 using a trajectory approach to get a better matching between OHP observations and satellite data...|$|R

Eutrophication and some European waters of restricted <b>exchange.</b> <b>Continental</b> Shelf Research 23, 1635 e 1671). This estimation is based on the measurements of currents and the modelling of water exchange at the outlets to the ocean. However, observations of the temperature and salinity in the inner channels imply that residence time is greater in these regions of the lagoon. To resolve this apparent contradiction, spatial measurements of the temperature and salinity were made with a meter for conductivity, temperature and depth along the principal channels of the western portion of the lagoon, with a sampling frequency of two per second. Evaporation rates of 5. 4 mm day 1 were measured in a salt extraction pond adjacent to the lagoon and used to determine the residence time through salinity differences with the incoming seawater. In June 2004, the water flooding in from the ocean had an average salinity of 36. 07 which contrasted with a maximum of 37. 82 at mid ebb on a spring tide, corresponding to a residence time of > 7 days; the mean residence time was 2. 4 days. As the tide flooded into the channels, the existing water was advected back into the lagoon. Although there was a small amount of mixing with water from another inlet, the water body from the inner lagoon essentially remained distinct with respect to temperature and salinity characteristics. The residence time of the water was further prolonged at the junction between the main channels, where distinct boundaries were observed between the different water masses. As the water ebbed out, the shallow Western Channel was essentially isolated {{from the rest of the}} outer lagoon, and the water from this channel was forced down the Ramalhete Channel, from where it was unable to exit the lagoon in one tidal cycle due to the extensive path length of w 14 km to the sea. Although the overall exchange rate of water is short in the outer lagoon, this study emphasizes that management models should take into account additional complexities that might arise from the much longer exchange rates of the inner lagoon. For example, the principal sewage discharge for the urban area of Faro is into the section of the Ramalhete Channel where efficient flushing is impeded by the relatively high residence times of the water body in this channel. The implementation of the techniques used for this study are a quick and relatively cost effective approach to testing assumptions about water quality and exchange in shallow coastal systems...|$|R
