The performance of the ± 45 -degree FRP laminates is {{compared to that of}} unidirectional FRP laminates of different manufacturers and amounts of materials. Results indicate that the ultimate capacity of ± 45 -degree FRP laminate strengthened rectangular columns is slightly lower than that of columns strengthened with fibers in the hoop direction. However, the ± 45 -degree columns exhibit a higher ductility probably due to the enlargement of the failure zone as allowed by the given fiber orientation. The larger failure zone ensures better energy dissipation with more material participating in the stress redistribution. Numerical analysis supports the laboratory findings. Suggestions for implementation in design guidelines for concrete confinement using FRP laminates with different fiber orientations are made...|$|E

40|$|Nanostructures {{have been}} lauded for their quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>capabilities</b> and {{potential}} applications in future devices. Compound semiconductor nanostructures are being {{integrated into the}} next generation of photovoltaic and light emitting devices to take advantage of their unique optical characteristics. Despite their promise, adoption of nanostructure based devices has been slow. This is {{due in large part to}} difficulties in effective fabrication and processing steps. By manipulating the surface energy of various components during growth, we can control the final structure and corresponding optoelectronic characteristics. Specifically I will present on GaSb quantum dots embedded in GaAs and GaAs nanowires using novel substrate and catalyst materials. GaSb quantum dots embedded in a GaAs matrix are ideal for devices that require capture of minority carriers as they exhibit a type II band offset with carrier concentration in the valence band. However, during GaAs capping, there is a strong driving force for the dot to demolish into a distribution of intact dots, rings, and GaSb material clusters. We demonstrate the ability to mitigate this effect using both chemical and kinetic means: we alter the surface chemistry via the addition of aluminum, and use droplet epitaxy as an alternative quantum dot formation method. Secondly, the growth of high quality GaAs on silicon has always been restricted due to material incompatibilities. With the emergence of increasingly smaller low power electronics, there is a demand to integrate optoelectronic devices directly on the surface of CMOS sensor stacks. Utilizing the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism we are able to demonstrate the growth of high quality GaAs nanowires on polycrystalline substrates at low temperatures. This allows for the growth of III-V nanowire based devices directly on the metal pads of pre-packaged CMOS chips.

40|$|Researchers {{have argued}} {{for many years}} {{that one of the}} {{conditions}} for omnidirectional reflection in a one-dimensional photonic crystal is a strong refractive index contrast between the two constituent dielectric materials. Using numerical simulations and the theory of Anderson localization of light, in this work we demonstrate that an omnidirectional band gap can indeed be created utilizing low refractive index contrast materials when they are arranged in a disordered manner. Moreover, the size of the omnidirectional band gap becomes a controllable parameter, which now depends on the number of layers and not only on the refractive index contrast of the system, as it is widely accepted. This achievement constitutes a major breakthrough in the field since it allows for the development of cheaper and more efficient technologies. Of particular interest is the case of high index contrast one-dimensional photonic crystal fibers, where the propagation losses are mainly due to increased optical scattering from sidewall roughness at the interfaces of high index contrast materials.

The substrate induced interactions (SII) involve sub-lattice-resolved, and enhanced intrinsic spin-orbit couplings, the extrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC), and the orbital gap related to {{the transfer of the}} electronic charge from graphene to the substrate. Furthermore, magnetic impurity atoms are deposited to the graphene surface and the corresponding exchange field is included in the band dispersion. A Rashba coupling dependent pseudo Zeeman term arising due to the interplay of SIIs was found to be responsible for the spin degeneracy lifting and the spin polarization. The latter turns out to be electrostatic doping and the exchange field tunable and inversely proportional to the square root of the carrier concentration. The strain field, on the other hand, brings about the valley polarization. The intra-band plasmon dispersion for the finite doping and the long wavelength limit has also been obtained. The dispersion involves the q 2 / 3 behavior and not the well known q 1 / 2 behavior. The uniform, uniaxial strain does not bring about any change in this behavior. However, the plasmon dispersion gets steeper for the wavevector perpendicular to the direction of strain and is flattened for wave vectors along the direction of the strain with the term responsible for the flattening proportional to the strain field. The stronger <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> of GrTMD Plasmon compared to that of standalone, doped graphene is an important outcome of the present work.

In this work, we examine the idea of allowing an application developer to customize the scoping rules of its underlying language. We demonstrate that such an ability can serve as the cornerstone of a security architecture for dynamically extensible systems. A run-time module system, ISOMOD, is proposed for the Java platform to facilitate software isolation. A core application may create namespaces dynamically and impose arbitrary name visibility policies (i. e., scoping rules) to control whether a name is visible, to whom it is visible, and in what way it can be accessed. Because ISOMOD exercises name visibility control at load time, loaded code runs at full speed. Furthermore, because ISOMOD access control policies are maintained separately, they evolve independently from core application code. In addition, the ISOMOD policy language provides a declarative means for expressing a very general form of visibility constraints.

40|$|Abstract. An {{attractive}} operational regime {{without any}} large ELMs, namely “High Recycling Steady ” (HRS) H-mode, {{has been found}} on JFT- 2 M during Y 2000 campaign after a boronization. Recent experiments have been concentrated on the studies of the access conditions for the HRS regime, {{in terms of the}} pedestal parameters. The HRS regime was more likely at higher edge density and lower edge temperature, which corresponds to the normalized electron collisionality of νe * ≥ 1 at the edge pedestal. The effects of the plasma shape were also investigated. Then, we have newly extended the HRS operational regime toward higher energy <b>confinement</b> utilizing the <b>capability</b> of both high triangularity δ ≥ 0. 7 and elongation κ ≥ 1. 6 operation under the double-null (DN) configuration. The energy confinement time enhancement factor (H 89 P) in the HRS plasma under the DN configuration increased up to ~ 2 at around ne/nGW ~ 0. 4, which was close to that of the standard ELMy H-mode regime having large ELMs under the single-null (SN) configuration (δ/κ ~ 0. 4 / 1. 4). A series of parameter scan was also performed in the q 95 -δ space under the limiter (LIM) configuration. The HRS H-mode was easily reproduced in the D-shaped plasmas, while the large ELMs appeared in the circular cross-sectional shape. These observations indicate an important role of plasma shaping to access the HRS regime as well as edge cpllisionality. A key feature of the HRS H-mode is a reduction of the transient heat load to the divertor target due to large ELMs. It was estimated to be about ~ 0. 3 MW/m 2 in the typical HRS plasmas, which was significantly small in comparison with the transient heat load of ELMy H-mode discharge. The edge MHD activities in the frequency range of the order of 10 - 100 kHz were recognized to be important for an enhanced particle transport and steady H-mode edge condition in the absence of large ELMs...|$|R

SiOxNy is a promising material for applications in thin-film solar cells as well as for wafer based silicon solar cells, like silicon heterojunction solar cells. However, many issues relevant to the material properties have not been studied yet, such as the role of the deposition condition and precursor gas concentrations on the optical and electronic properties of the films, the composition and structure of the nanocrystals. The results presented in the thesis aim to clarify the effects of annealing and oxygen incorporation within nc-SiOxNy films on its properties in view of the photovoltaic applications. Silicon nano-crystals (Si NCs) embedded in a dielectric matrix were proposed as absorbers in all-Si multi-junction solar cells due to the quantum <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> of Si NCs, that allows a better match to the solar spectrum thanks to the size induced tunability of the band gap. Despite the efficient solar radiation absorption capability of this structure, its charge collection and transport properties has still to be fully demonstrated. The results presented in the thesis aim {{to the understanding of the}} transport mechanisms at macroscopic and microscopic scale. Experimental results on SiOxNy thin films and SRC/Si multilayers have been obtained at macroscopical and microscopical level using different characterizations techniques, such as Atomic Force Microscopy, Reflection and Transmission measurements, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The deep knowledge and improved understanding of the basic physical properties of these quite complex, multi-phase and multi-component systems, made by nanocrystals and amorphous phases, will contribute to improve the efficiency of Si based solar cells. ...|$|E
30|$|III-Nitride based {{materials}} are highly attractive for making vertical microcavity (MC) light emitters such as strongly coupled polariton lasers and conventional vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) {{due to their}} large exciton binding energies and wide spectra tuning range in the ultraviolet-visible region [1 – 12]. So far, electrically pumped polariton emitters and conventional VCSELs have been demonstrated in III-nitride based MCs at room temperature (RT). However, the p-side designs including indium-tin-oxide (ITO) transparent conducting layer (TCL) and dielectric materials based current aperture in the reported devices induce a negative guiding effect and lateral optical loss [13 – 15]. To provide a sufficient positive guiding effect, Cheng et al. utilized an intra-cavity low-index AlN layer {{to serve as a}} lateral optical/current aperture and achieved a high-quality-factor (Q) emission; however, no lasing action was observed in their MC light emitter {{due to the lack of}} TCL [16]. A similar work, in which an oxidized AlInN aperture has been implanted in to a GaN-based LED, has been demonstrated by Castiglia et al. [17]. In 2014, a GaN-based MC emitter featuring a Si-diffusion-defined current aperture developed by Yeh et al. shows a good current <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> [18]. Although the current flow can be well-confined in the non-Si-diffused area, the near zero index contrast between diffused and non-diffused area cannot provide a sufficient lateral optical confinement. Recently, Leonard et al. proposed an approach using ion-implantation to define the current aperture. In their result, the index contrast between the implanted and the non-implanted p++GaN can be enhanced to 0.05 [9]. In this letter, we propose an alternative design using self-aligned SiO 2 aperture featuring a low index and high resistance. Within this structure, the index contrast between the p-GaN and surrounded SiO 2 aperture can be enlarged to about 1 and provide a better lateral optical confinement. Through this approach, a multi-transverse mode behavior resulted from the strong lateral optical confinement can be observed in the measured spectra. Moreover, a strong excitonic gain emission generated from the devices with a small aperture size reveals the possibility of such devices to be pushed into lasing action or even polaritonic operation [19, 20].|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies on}} the Large Helical Device {{during the last two}} years are reviewed. After the start of LHD {{experiment}} in 1998, the magnetic field has been gradually raised up to 2. 89 T. The heating power has been increased, up to 4. 2 MW for NBI, 1. 3 MW for ICRF, and 0. 9 MW for ECRH, Upgrading the key hardware systems has led to the extension of the plasma parameters to (i) higher T_e [T_e(0) = 4. 4 keV at = 5. 3 x 10 ^ 18 m^- 3 and P_abs = 1. 8 MW], (ii) higher confinement [tau_E = 0. 3 s, T_e(0) = 1. 1 keV at = 6. 5 x 10 ^ 19 m^- 3 and P_abs = 2. 0 MW] and (iii) higher stored energy W_p^dia = 880 kJ. High performance plasmas have been realized in the inward shifted magnetic axis configuration (R= 3. 6 m) where the helical symmetry is recovered and the particle orbit properties are improved by trade off of MHD stability properties due to the appearance of the magnetic hill. The energy confinement was systematically higher than that predicted by the Intemational Stellerator Scaling 95 up to a factor of I. 6 and was comparable with ELMy H-mode <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> in tokamaks. This confinement improvement is attributed to the configuration control (the inward shift of magnetic axis) and to the formation of the high edge temperature. The achieved average beta value reached 2. 4 % at B= 1. 3 T, the highest beta value ever obtained in helical devices, and so far no degradation of confinement by MHD phenomenon is observed. The inward shifted configuration has also led to successful ICRF minority ion heating. ICRF power up to 1. 3 MW was reliably injected into the plasma without significant impurity contamination and a plasma with a stored energy of 200 kJ was sustained for 5 sec by ICRF alone. As another important result long pulse discharges of more than I minute were successfully achieved separately with NBI heating of 0. 5 MW and with ICRF heating of 0. 85 MW. ...|$|E
40|$|This Addendum supplements, and to {{some extent}} replaces, the {{preliminary}} description of environmental radiological surveillance programs for low-level waste burial grounds (LLWBG) used in the parent document, 11 Technology, Safety and Costs of DecolliTlissioning a Reference Low-Level Waste Burial Ground, 11 NUREG/ CR- 0570. The Addendum provides additional detail and rationale for the environmental radiological surveillance programs for the two referenced sites and inventories described in NUREG/CR- 0570. The rationale and performance criteria herein are expected to be useful in providing guidance for determining the acceptability of environmental surveillance programs for other inventories and other LLWBG sites. Two generic burial grounds, one located on an arid western site and the other located on a humid eastern site, are reference facilities considered in this Addendum, and as described in the parent document (NUREG/CR- 0570). The two sites are assumed to have the same capacity for waste, the same radioactive waste inventory, and similar trench characteristics and operating procedures. The climate, geology, and hydrology of the two reference sites are typical of existing western and eastern sites, altnough a single population distribution was chosen for both. Each reference burial ground occupies about 70 hectares and includes 180 trenches filled with a total of 1. 5 x 10 {sup 6 } m{sup 3 } of radioactive waste. In acldition, there are 10 slit trenches containing about 1. 5 x 10 {sup 3 } m{sup 3 } of high beta-gamma activity waste. In this Addendum environmental surveillance programs are described for the several periods {{in the life of a}} LLWBG: preoperational (prior to nuclear waste receipt); operational (including interim trench closures); post-operational (after all nuclear waste is received), for both short-term {up to three years) and long-term (up to 100 years) storage and custodial care; and decommissioning (only for the special case of waste removal). The specific environmental monitoring requirements for final site characterization and certification surveys are beyond the scope of this Addendum. Data collection associated with site reconnaissance and preselection is not specifically addressed, but it is recognized that such data may be useful in designing the preoperational program. Predisposal control measures, quality assurance, and record-keeping (other than inventory records) associated with waste disposal operations are also not addressed. The primary intent of routine environmental surveillance at a LLWBG is to help ensure that site activities do not cause significant transport of radioactivity from the site, resulting in an unacceptable health hazard to people. Preoperational environmental surveillance serves to determine for later comparison the background radioactivity levels, either naturally occurring or the result of man&#x 27;s activities (e. g. world-wide fallout or an adjacent nuclear facility), in and around the proposed burial ground site. The operational environmental surveillance program is used to estimate radiological conditions, both onsite and offsite as a possible result of burial ground activities, including trench closure(s). These data help to determine LLWBG compliance with regulatory requirements. During the post-operational period environmental surveillance should normally be an extension of the program carried out during operations, with appropriate deletions (or modifications) to account for the differences between operational and post-operational activities at the site. During the long-term storage and custodial care period, environmental surveillance serves to verify the radionuclide <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> of the burial ground and to identify problem situations requiring remedial action. For waste removal (exhumation), the environmental surveillance program is again modified to account for the greatly increased potential for direct radiation and contamination spread. At the time of decommissioning, "environmental surveillance" takes on a new meaning, from that of an ongoing program to one of site "characterization" and dose assessment, requiring more rigorous statistical design and testing than described for the other surveillance periods at a LLWBG. The environmental surveillance programs suggested in this Addendum are based on the radionuclide inventories given in Section 7 of NUREG/CR- 0570 and the potential critical pathways determined for the reference sites. The Addendum suggests the use of exposure pathway analysis to evaluate the potential critical pathways to man from radionuclides in the waste. Hence, the monitoring programs recommended for the two reference sites include those nuclide/media resulting in the highest potential radiation dose or those in which the greatest buildup of contaminants can be expected. Appropriate use is made of existing regulations and other published reports and guides on the subject of environmental surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} {{geological}} storage (CCGS) {{has been considered}} as the most romising option to reduce anthropogenic CO 2 emission to the atmosphere, since this technology allows proven fossil fuel reserves {{to be used with}} low emission greenhouse gases. CCGS is defined as a technology of capturing CO 2 emitted from major stationary sources such as fossil fuel generated power plants and cement industries, and then compacting to become dense fluid (supercritical) CO 2 and transporting it usually via pipeline to a site for being injected into suitable deep rock formation. In the rock formations, CO 2 will be confined and by time dissolved to rock formation for long period of times, ranging from hundred years, even in millennia. With mature technology of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) experienced by petroleum industries since 1970 ???s, abandoned oil and gas reservoirs are the most readily formation for CO 2 storage. However, limited distribution of the reservoirs worldwidely including their lack of collocation with the stationary sources of CO 2, which may lead to ineffective cost of CO 2 transportation, have prompted deep saline aquifers to become prospective CO 2 storage. In case of geological formation in Japan, deep saline aquifers with low permeability sedimentary rocks are expected to become the most readable CO 2 geological storage in near future. Yet, study of CO 2 behaviour in low permeable rock is needed due to limited data about detail physics governing CO 2 flow in sedimentary rocks and inadequate information about geomechanical response of low permeable rock to CO 2 injection. Based on these reasons, this study undertook experimental and numerical investigation of hydro-mechanical properties of low permeable rock during injection of CO 2. In Chapter 1, the general framework and the background of the problems areexplained, as well as detail plan and brief introduction of the method employed in this study. Literature review is presented in Chapter 2 to illustrate the existing body of knowledge that has been established by previous researchers. It comprises the brief introduction of the CCGS and the constraints encountered in the development of CCGS. Lack of data about CO 2 -brine multiphase flow systems and geomechanical behaviour of low permeable rock are some of the major problems encountered in the iv design of CO 2 geological storage in low permeable rock formation. Therefore, this study sought to fill these gaps, adding to the existing body of knowledge by performing experimental and numerical study on hydro-mechanical properties of low permeable rock during injection of CO 2. In this way, newly experimental system of flow pump permeability test was developed in order to measure CO 2 -water relative permeability and specific storage of low permeable rock and to examine its geomechanical response during injection of CO 2. The flow pump permeability test with new experimental system is illustrated in Chapter 3. Ainoura sandstone was used as rock specimen, representing sedimentary rock with low permeability. Initial pore pressure, confining pressure, and temperature applied on the rock specimen were generated to mimic reservoir condition in deep underground. Supercritical CO 2 was injected into the rock specimen saturated with water at constant flow rate. The pressures in the upstream and downstream of the rock specimen as well as its longitudinal and lateral strain were continuously measured. In order to interpret experimental results, numerical analysis was developed by modifying the mathematical model of constant flow pump permeability test to deal with two phase drainage displacement flow. It was observed that there are three flow regimes of CO 2 flowing through the rock specimen. Relative permeability to CO 2 is low, about 0. 15 of the relative permeability to water at 100 % water saturation. This implies a low efficiency of CO 2 -water displacement in low permeable rock leading to better CO 2 <b>confinement</b> <b>capability</b> of the Ainoura sandstone. The specific storage of low permeable rock increased due to the injection and more pronounced as mechanical rather than hydraulic process. Given by its efficiency and faster determination, flow pump permeability test with new experimental system could provide an alternative approach to measure both relative permeability and storage capacity of low permeable rock injected with CO 2 with a more standardized geotechnical laboratory method. The investigation of CO 2 solubility effect on CO 2 injection into low permeable rock is presented in Chapter 4. Solubility trapping is a potential trapping mechanism which might be taking place for the case of low permeable rock. Therefore, numerical analysis was developed to investigate CO 2 solubility based on multiphase and multiv component of mass balance law while Henry???s law was used to quantify the amount of CO 2 dissolved into the water. The result suggested that the solubility of CO 2 decreases the injection pressure by about - 0. 821 MPa to - 5. 45 MPa for CO 2 fraction dissolved from 0. 002 % to 0. 005 %. In addition, CO 2 solubility increases significantly the permeation of CO 2 in low permeable rock by 47 % to 87 %. This indicates the solubility of CO 2 could contribute in reducing potential overpressure with more CO 2 saturation flowing into low permeable rock formation. In Chapter 5, the investigation of geomechanical response of low permeable rock under injection of CO 2 is presented. Numerical analysis based on poroelasticity theory was developed to examine the alteration of stress-strain on the rock specimen induced by the injection. It was observed such a poroelastic expansion of the rock specimen during the injection. The onset of its dilatancy occurred at the condition of the generated pore pressure beyond 60 % of the confining pressure applied. Given an increase in the porosity and permeability of the rock specimen, 4 % and 2. 5 times of their respective initial values respectively, the failure in the rock specimen did not occur. However, their effects on the rock specimen deformations are considerable. As the data of CO 2 -water relative permeability on the Ainoura sandstone has been obtained in the experimental test as explained in Chapter 3, the data was used in a field scale numerical simulation to investigate the potential ground uplift might be induced by injection of CO 2 in low permeable rock (Chapter 6). A field scale model of homogeneous and isotropic Ainoura sandstones formation was created using hydromechanical coupling TOUGH 2 -FLAC 3 D with Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model. It was found that the injection of CO 2 generated a ground uplift, accounted for average 0. 9 cm/year. The peak of the uplift reached about 4. 94 cm, 8. 5 cm and 21 cm at the period of 5, 10, and 25 years. The results suggested that the injection of CO 2 into low permeable rock formation just generates a low ground uplift although its storage capacity is quite small compared to the expected storage capacity for CO 2 geological storage in deep saline aquifer...|$|E
