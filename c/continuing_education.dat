40|$|This article {{deals with}} the theme of teacher <b>education,</b> {{especially}} with <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> and its relation with the low quality of public school systems. It presents analyses from a research on the main educational programs implemented {{by the government of}} the State of São Paulo in the 1982 - 1994 period. Together with the documental analysis, an empirical research was carried out including a case study of one the <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> programs envisaged {{at the time of the}} implementation of the Standard School Program (1991 - 1994). The analyses made of the educational literature and of the educational programs reveal that teacher <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> was seen as a strategic element to build up teacher competence. The text moves on to register the presence of a discourse that has given support to the growing importance attributed to teacher <b>continued</b> <b>education,</b> projects and actions aiming at improving the quality of education systems. The discourse of incompetence is then described and problematized. The different forms assumed by this discourse are presented, according to the context in which it appears, and also the various appropriations made by the several agents involved in the teacher <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> policies, from the architects of the programs to the participating teachers. It is proposed that the argument of incompetence has founded reductionist and homogenizing practices of <b>continued</b> <b>education.</b> The importance is highlighted of taking into account, when conceiving <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> policies, the heterogeneity that characterizes the teaching staff and schools, and also of developing broader educational policies targeting the actual improvement of the educational services and not just the competence of their teachers...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{construction}} of a partnership in the <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> of a Science teacher during the development of a collaborative research.

The <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> process involved a reflective intervention strategy, called autoscopy, simulating a "room of mirrors" (SCHÖN, 2000), which led the teacher to reflect on her educational practice. The results demonstrate that the collaborative research, focused on the dialogue and comradeship, mediated the solution of conflicts experienced in the process and favored the decision-making in the consolidation of <b>continued</b> <b>education</b> strategies concerning the teacher...|$|R

5|$|America's Asian {{conflicts}} against Japan, North Korea, and North Vietnam brought Sun Tzu to {{the attention}} of American military leaders. The Department of the Army in the United States, through its Command and General Staff College, has directed all units to maintain libraries within their respective headquarters for the <b>continuing</b> <b>education</b> of personnel in the art of war. The Art of War is mentioned as an example of works to be maintained at each facility, and staff duty officers are obliged to prepare short papers for presentation to other officers on their readings. Similarly, Sun Tzu's Art of War is listed on the Marine Corps Professional Reading Program. During the Gulf War in the 1990s, both Generals Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Colin Powell employed principles from Sun Tzu related to deception, speed, and striking one's enemy's weak points. However, the United States and other Western countries have been criticised for not truly understanding Sun Tzu's work and not appreciating The Art of War within the wider context of Chinese society.|$|E

5|$|Enrollment grew to {{approximately}} 1,000 students by 1969, beyond {{the capacity of}} its original campus, so the school purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a career planning center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew's Café opened. In 1984, the school's <b>continuing</b> <b>education</b> center (later named the J.

In 1990, the school opened a baking and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N.

5|$|Research {{into the}} atom by faculty members John R. Dunning, I. I. Rabi, Enrico Fermi and Polykarp Kusch placed Columbia's Physics Department in the {{international}} spotlight in the 1940s after the first nuclear pile was built to start what became the Manhattan Project. In 1928, Seth Low Junior College was established by Columbia University in order to mitigate the number of Jewish applicants to Columbia College. The college was closed in 1938 due to the adverse effects of the Great Depression and its students were subsequently absorbed into University Extension. In 1947, the program was reorganized as an undergraduate college and designated the School of General Studies {{in response to the}} return of GIs after World War II. In 1995, the School of General Studies was again reorganized as a full-fledged liberal arts college for non-traditional students (those who have had an academic break of one year or more, or are pursuing dual-degrees) and was fully integrated into Columbia's traditional undergraduate curriculum. Within the same year, the Division of Special Programs—later the School of <b>Continuing</b> <b>Education,</b> and now the School of Professional Studies—was established to reprise the former role of University Extension. While the School of Professional Studies only offered non-degree programs for lifelong learners and high school students in its earliest stages, it now offers degree programs in a diverse range of professional and inter-disciplinary fields.|$|E
