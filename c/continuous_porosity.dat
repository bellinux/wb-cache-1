40|$|The {{porosity}} of fibrous {{materials is}} an important factor to their insulating performance. This paper considers the optimal porosity distribution of non-uniform fibrous porous medias for thermal insulation. Heat flow through the fibrous porous media is described by a coupled conduction-radiation heat transfer model which is numerically solved by using Finite Volume Method, and the optimal porosity distribution corresponding to the minimum total heat transfer is derived by applying a BFGS quasi-Newton optimization procedure. Variable analysis shows that the optimal porosity distribution is typically piecewise in conductive heat transfer dominated porous medium. For practical reasons, the change of porosity distribution across the thickness of the fibrous porous media may need to be continuous. To derive such a <b>continuous</b> optimal <b>porosity</b> distribution, a small penalty item should be introduced into the objective function. The study shows that, a <b>continuous</b> optimal <b>porosity</b> distribution generally has relatively high porosity at both boundaries and relatively low porosity in the centre region. The optimal distribution depends on many factors such as fibre radius, fibre emissivity, temperature difference, and overall mean porosity. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

30|$|The {{absence of}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>porosity</b> and/or large vesicles (Fig.  6 g) {{supports}} the {{absence of a}} free fluid at run conditions. Such textural features can be therefore interpreted as a precipitation sequence upon quenching of a single volatile-rich “liquid” phase. Because (Ca,Mg,Fe)-carbonate liquids cannot be vitrified, carbonate dendrites precipitate first; a free fluid phase, solute-rich, separates from the silicate “residual liquid” afterwards; progression of quenching is finally responsible for the precipitation of the solute from the fluid in the form of silicate droplets and Na-carbonate. The carbonate layer is entirely liquefied in this experiment, so the amount of volatiles dissolved in the liquid formed can be estimated at ≈ 20  wt.% H 2 O and ≈ 25  wt.% CO 2.|$|E

An incident shock wave is initiated in the gaseous phase interacting with a porous filter inducing a transmitted and a reflected wave. To take into account the discontinuity jump in the porosity between the gaseous phase and the porous filter, an approximate Riemann solver is used to compute homogeneous non-conservative Euler equations in porous media using ideal gas state law.

Large-scale results provided by the multiple-domain formulation depend strongly on the microscopic interfacial conditions. No satisfactory agreement between the single- and multiple-domain approaches is obtained when using previously suggested conditions written directly at the interface between the liquid and the porous medium.

40|$|Introduction: Biofiltration of {{volatile}} organic compounds is a biological method in which air containing contaminant is passed through a packed bed and the pollutant is transferred from gas phase to biofilm where it is degraded by microorganisms. Degrading microbial activity is strongly influenced by moisture content of bed {{so that it is}} considered as the most important factor for controlling optimum performance of biofiltration. A solutions for reduction of the bed drying problems is use of water super absorbents which are able to store and maintain water. Methods: For the first time, a two-dimensional dynamic model of biofiltration of hexane contaminated air is presented in which terms of moisture content and axial dispersion are considered in mass transfer equations. Effects of water super absorbent including <b>continuous</b> increase in <b>porosity</b> of the bed and specific surface area were entered into the equations. The equations were discretized by Finite Volume Method for solving numerically. Then, to determine the accuracy of model predictions, biofiltration experiments were done in flow rate of 0. 7 l/min and inlet concentration of 2 g/m 3. Results: The model could present a pattern of decline in moisture content of the bed after moistening stop. Experimental data of increasing of pollutant outlet concentration because of bed moisture reduction were well predicted by the model (standard error = 0. 45 %) and an estimation of end point was presented. Conclusion: The results indicated that consideration of moisture content term under unsteady state conditions can develop the model performance and describe biofiltration process with all its complexities...|$|R

The assembly–disassembly–organization–reassembly (ADOR) mechanism is a recent method for preparing inorganic framework materials and, in particular, zeolites.

For Ba 6 GaNb 9 O 30 and Ba 6 InNb 9 O 30 pellets, the SEM images have revealed good, dense internal microstructures, with well-bonded grains and only discrete porosity; in contrast Ba 6 ScNb 9 O 30 pellets had a poorer microstructure, with many small and poorly-bonded grains gathered in agglomerates, resulting in significant <b>continuous</b> <b>porosity</b> and poorly defined grain boundary regions.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} powder {{metallurgy}} for op-toelectronic packages {{in order to}} reduce the cost of laser packages. Conventional die compaction (DC) and metal injection molding (MIM) are used for the shaping of powder metallurgy. The distin-guishing types of inherent porosity in DC and MIM steels have their respective effects on the defect mechanisms of laser welding joints. For DC steel with 85 % relative density and <b>continuous</b> <b>porosity,</b> the rising gas pressure pushes the molten metal out of the welding regions, resulting in weak and unstable welding joints. For MIM steel with more than 95 % relative density, the laser power dom-inates the defect mechanisms, and the defect-free welding joints with optical spot size of 400 µm can be attained by using laser power of less than 1. 0 kW. Although elimination of inherent poros-ity in MIM steel under optimum welding condition can give rise to additional postwelding-shift (PWS), it is still controlled to less than 2 µm, resulting in optical coupling loss of less than 15 %. The advantage of applicability of the MIM method to several materials makes it possible to employ SS 316 L, Kovar, and Invar, which have the characteristic of better property for laser welding but difficult machining, as the metal housing in low-cost lightwave communica-tion system. Thus, using MIM Invar with low coefficient of thermal expansion can minimize the tracking error, which is an important issue for bidirectional and triple-directional optoelectronic pack-ages. The reliability data demonstrate that the laser modules using MIM steel as construction housing are stable and reliable.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the fabrication and assembly {{of a solid}} oxide fuel cell system is described which enables effective scaling of the fuel delivery, manifold, and fuel cell stack components for applications in miniature and microscale energy conversion. Electrode materials for solid oxide fuel cells are developed using sputter deposition techniques. A thin film anode is formed by co-deposition of nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ). This approach provides a mixed conducting inter-facial layer between the nickel electrode and electrolyte layer. Similarly, a thin film cathode is formed by co-deposition of silver and yttria-stabilized zirconia. Additionally, sputter deposition of yttria-stabilized zirconia thin film electrolyte enables high quality, continuous films to be formed having thicknesses {{on the order of}} 1 - 2 {micro}m. This will effectively lower the temperature of operation for the fuel cell stack significantly below the traditional ranges at which solid oxide electrolyte systems are operated (600 - 1000 C), thereby rendering this fuel cell system suitable for miniaturization, Scaling towards miniaturization is accomplished by utilizing novel micromachining approaches which allow manifold channels and fuel delivery system to be formed within the substrate which the thin film fuel cell stack is fabricated on, thereby circumventing the need for bulky manifold components which are not directly scalable. Methods to synthesize anodes for thin film solid-oxide fuel cells (TFSOFCs) from the electrolyte and a conductive material are developed using photolithographic patterning and physical vapor deposition. The anode layer must enable combination of the reactive gases, be conductive to pass the electric current, and provide mechanical support to the electrolyte and cathode layers.

The emerging technology of suspension plasma spraying was explored to produce thin and gas tight nano-structured solid oxide fuel cells electrolytes, which {{in an effort}} to develop a cost-effective and scalable fabrication technique for high performance solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Glycine-nitrate process (GNP) produced cerium oxide (CeO[subscript 2]) and gadolinium oxide (Gd[subscript 2]O[subscript 3]) nano-powders were used to prepare suspensions and then separately injected to form composite GDC electrolyte coatings. A dynamic mask system has been developed to control the heating effects of a high-temperature plasma deposition process. The experimental results of the nano-structured SOFCs GDC electrolytes production by means of a RF suspension plasma spraying process using the newly proposed mask were compared to the ones without mask. The potential of this deposition technique to improve the electrolyte coating uniformity and to reduce the coating porosity was demonstrated. SOFCs anodes require long triple phase boundary (TPB) and appropriate gas diffusion pass for the fast transport of both fuel and exhaust gases, but the area where gas diffusion passes are especially required would be different from the area suitable for electrochemical reaction in the anodes. Functionally graded anodes in both composition and porosity have been proposed to fulfill the anodic functions in adequate anodic areas. On the basis of the optimized spraying conditions and the laboratory-developed solution feeding system, NiO-GDC functionally graded nanostructure anodes were prepared using solution plasma spraying (SolPS) process. Then the microstructure and material composition of the anodes were analyzed. A graded distribution in contents of both nickel and GDC was confirmed in the coating. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) observation exhibited a <b>continuous</b> variation in <b>porosity</b> from 35 % to 9 % along the direction across the coating thickness.
