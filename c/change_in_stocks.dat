50|$|A food {{balance sheet}} is a {{comprehensive}} compilation of a selected country's food supply during a specific time period. The food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how it is produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply). The total quantity produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> that may have occurred {{since the beginning of}} the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{evolutionary}} model of industry dynamics yielding en- dogenous business cycles with 'Keynesian' features. The model describes an economy composed of firms and consumers/workers. Firms belong to two industries. The first one performs R&D and produces heterogeneous machine tools. Firms {{in the second}} industry invest in new machines and produce a homogenous consumption good. Consumers sell their labor and fully consume their income. In line with the empirical literature on investment patterns, {{we assume that the}} investment decisions by firms are lumpy and constrained by their financial structures. Moreover, drawing from behavioral theories of the firm, we assume boundedly rational expectation formation. Simulation results show that the model is able to deliver self-sustaining patterns of growth characterized by the presence of endogenous business cycles. The model can also replicate the most important stylized facts concerning micro- and macro-economic dynamics. Indeed, we find that investment is more volatile than GDP; consumption is less volatile than GDP; investment, consumption and <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> are procyclical and coincident variables; employment is procyclical; unemployment rate is countercyclical; firm size distributions are skewed but depart from log-normality; firm growth distributions are tent-shaped.

40|$|Export {{markets for}} New Zealand lamb have changed rapidly {{over the past}} decade. Traditional markets have been in decline, while new markets, in Continental Europe, the Middle East and Asia have grown rapidly. The nature of the lamb being {{exported}} has also changed. Exports of frozen carcasses are diminishing in importance, while demand for high value cuts continues to grow. This study examines the outlook in major export markets for New Zealand lamb, {{in terms of the}} prices and level of demand, and the global market for New Zealand lamb in terms of aggregate supply and demand, the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks,</b> and the world price. This required the identification of market segments within the international lamb market and the estimation of demand and price response parameters for each market segment, using a suitable theoretical model. Econometric estimates were obtained using a joint product model, which allowed production to be estimated as a single commodity, while demand and price equations for each market segment were estimated for up to six related cuts of lamb: chilled and frozen carcasses, chilled and frozen bone-in cuts, and chilled and frozen boneless cuts. Estimates were used in a spreadsheet model to generate forecasts for each of the identified markets.

With worries related to transportation fuels being recognized, would there be reason for concern with heating fuels? As the new year approached, the refineries seemed to have no problem with supplies and RFG stocks were eased in about the second week of December. In Maine, the southern half of the state was effected by the gasoline substitution but seven of Maine`s sixteen counties were directed to follow the recommended criteria. Since the major population concentration lies in the southern three counties, concern was real. Attention paid to emission testing had come to a head in the fall, and RFG complaints were likely. There have been years when snow and cold arrived by Thanksgiving Day. In northern Maine, snow easily covers the ground before the SHOPP survey begins. The fall slipped by with no great shocks in the weather. December was more of the same, as the weather continued to favor the public.

40|$|This thesis summarises {{research}} {{on the use of}} economic approaches in management decision making in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery. Lobster fisheries globally tend to be well researched and data-rich yet economics is not widely integrated in the management process. This is surprising given that they supply a luxury food market and the entire supply chain is focussed on economic benefit. Lobster fisheries also tend be resilient to recruitment overfishing (Pollock, 1993), which means the basic management objective of biological sustainability tends to be easily met so there is scope to consider other goals of management. The use of economics in lobster fishery management is reviewed for fisheries globally. In some lobster fisheries, economic benefit is formally measured and reported as “sustainable economic yield”, which is the long-run, sustainable revenue from harvests minus the costs of harvesting. Reporting of economic yield does not always imply the use of this data in management decision processes, however there are cases where maximum economic yield (MEY) is used as a formal target including in Australian and New Zealand fisheries for Panulirus cygnus, P. ornatus and Jasus edwardsii. Bioeconomic models that combine stock, cost and price information are now being used in lobster fisheries including P. interruptus, P. argus, P. cygnus, J. edwardsii and Homarus americanus to evaluate regulations such as catch limits, season length, gear limits, and type. Economic theory has also been influential in the evolution of management systems used to constrain catch, in particular through the increased use of market-based and rights-based systems. These systems aim to provide incentives and mechanisms for the transfer of catch to more efficient operators and reward for conservative stock management that protects future harvests. Economic approaches can be used to resolve resource sharing issues in lobster fisheries with most research dealing with recreational and commercial interactions. A bioeconomic analysis of the Tasmanian rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery was conducted using a length- and sex-based model. The model was spatially and temporally structured to account for differences in costs of fishing and price. The analysis concluded that the current total allowable commercial catch (TACC) was too high to maximise economic yield and left the industry vulnerable to temporal changes in productivity. Alternative pathways to lower TACCs were explored but although these affected economic yield, differences were minor. Despite operating under ITQ management for over a decade, the presence of tradeable catch shares was insufficient for industry to motivate changes in the TACC to target MEY. Industry and government were motivated to exercise stewardship, in terms of acting to prevent stock collapse, but were reluctant to accept that economic yield and asset values could increase with lower catches. This bioeconomic analysis of different harvest strategies proved valuable in this debate, demonstrating a need for formal economic analysis as part of the suite of information used for setting TACCs even with the incentives provided by ITQs. The bioeconomic modeling approach was also used to examine the feasibility of a novel approach to increase productivity in the Tasmanian rock lobster fishery, which was to translocate lobsters from slow growth areas to faster growth areas. <b>Change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> in response to translocation was assessed in comparison to the change in TACC that would be required to produce the same effect. These operations appeared viable with strongly positive net present value. When combined with quota management, a translocation of 100, 000 lobsters per annum improved most performance measures on a similar scale as would be achieved by a reduction in the total allowable catch of around 10...|$|E

40|$|The global {{economic}} recovery which {{had begun in}} mid 2009 has continued, though its strength has varied from one region to another. The emerging economies have been the driving force, propelling the revival of international trade. The upturn is more gradual in the advanced economies, as is generally the case after an economic recession accompanied by a financial crisis. Moreover, {{there has been some}} loss of momentum {{in the past few months}} owing to the difficult transition to a self-sustaining recovery, as the fiscal stimuli initially introduced in the midst of the crisis are giving way to a general move towards the consolidation of public finances. In the euro area, significant divergences have become apparent between the performance of the economies which have been able to take advantage of the strengthening foreign demand and that of countries facing major structural adjustments. In that context, the projections indicate that the recovery will be maintained, but will be weaker for a time than at the beginning of 2010. In Belgium, too, the hesitant revival in activity which had begun in the second half of 2009 was consolidated and has since been maintained. So far it has been slightly stronger than previously expected. Overall, following a contraction of 2. 7 p. c. in 2009, growth is forecast at 2. 1 p. c. in 2010 and 1. 8 p. c. in 2011, slightly outpacing growth in the euro area. In view of the slump in GDP during the recession, the resilience of the labour market was a welcome surprise. The decline in employment was both limited and short-lived: altogether, job losses totalled 38, 400 units between the end of 2008 and the end of 2009. These losses were already more or less offset by jobs created during the first two quarters of 2010. According to the projections, job creations are likely to exceed 56, 000 units during 2010, with a further 15, 000 units in 2011. The resilience of employment is due to the use of flexible arrangements during the period of the economic slowdown and to a decline in the hourly productivity. In that context, the unemployment rate increased from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 7. 9 p. c. in 2009 and 8. 5 p. c. in 2010. It is projected at 8. 6 p. c. in 2011. The recovery was initiated in 2009 by the end of the movement towards stock reduction and by the export revival triggered by the marked strengthening of international trade. Domestic demand excluding the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> is also likely to gain momentum, boosted initially by private consumption. Households are in fact expected to reduce their savings ratio to its pre-crisis level, as uncertainties regarding the labour market prospects and the value of financial assets have receded. In 2011, housing and business investments will also start contributing to the growth of domestic demand. Inflation measured by the HICP is forecast to dip slightly during the coming year, so that – as an annual average – it will increase from the rate of 0 p. c. recorded in 2009 to 2. 3 p. c. this year before subsiding to 2. 1 p. c. in 2011. According to the latest data, Belgium’s public finances will end the year 2010 with a deficit of 4. 8 p. c. of GDP, which is a 1. 2 percentage point improvement on 2009. In the absence of a budget for the federal government and social security for 2011, assuming no policy change, and given the continuing consolidation of economic conditions, the deficit is forecast at 4. 7 p. c. The government debt ratio is projected to continue rising in 2010 and 2011, but at a much more modest pace than in the two previous years. In 2010, the debt ratio is estimated at 97. 6 p. c. of GDP. In 2011 it will rise further, to 99. 8 p. c. of GDP. Belgium, macroeconomic projection, Eurosystem...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{previous}} forecasts {{were published in}} February 2009, the downturn in activity and international trade in late 2008 and early 2009 {{has proved to be}} even sharper than initially expected. An unprecedentedly deep recession has spread across the various economic regions of the world, requiring resolute action in the monetary and fiscal sphere. There are signs which suggest some stabilisation of both financial market conditions and business and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, the adjustments to be made to employment, investment and the position of financial institutions are likely to hamper the economic recovery. The sharp cyclical downturn in the euro area at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 had a major impact on economic activity in Belgium. In particular, both industrial production and foreign trade in goods plummeted from October 2008. According to the national accounts data, real GDP was down by 1. 7 p. c. {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, falling by a further 1. 6 p. c. in the first quarter of 2009, the deepest recession since the Second World War. The decline in activity should decelerate sharply from the second quarter of 2009, and give way to a modest recovery in 2010. Thus, having grown by 1 p. c. in 2008, GDP is set to contract by 3. 5 p. c. on average in 2009 and by 0. 2 p. c. in 2010. In the face of the abrupt contraction in activity, firms reacted for example by reducing agency work and greatly increasing their use of temporary lay-offs. Such systems offer a provisional buffer against the effect on employment of fluctuations in production. However, taking account of the deep and sustained decline in activity, the number of persons employed is likely to decline progressively. As an annual average, net job losses are forecast at 36, 000 and 80, 000 persons respectively in 2009 and 2010. The unemployment rate is set to rise from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 9. 2 p. c. in 2010, reaching 9. 7 p. c. by the end of 2010. In 2009, all the main expenditure categories – domestic demand, <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>stocks</b> and net exports – are set to be seriously affected, directly or indirectly, by the recession in global demand and the repercussions of the global financial crisis; in 2010, their contribution to the change in GDP is forecast to be broadly neutral. Exports of goods and services are projected to record a very marked fall in 2009, following the collapse of foreign demand. They are likely to continue falling slightly in 2010. In the absence of support from domestic demand, the profile of imports is expected to mirror that of exports. Following the curb on growth in 2008 resulting from the stagnation of real disposable income in a context of rising inflation, private consumption is set to fall in 2009, mainly owing to the plunge in share prices and the deterioration in economic conditions and the labour market outlook, both these factors contributing to an increase in the savings rate. In the context of the decline in their capacity utilisation rate, gloomy forecasts for demand, the high cost of external financing and the reduction in the financial resources generated by their own activity, businesses are likely to cut their investment in 2009 and 2010, following more than four years of sustained vigour. Investment in housing is also set to fall in 2009 and 2010, continuing the slowdown which began in 2007. Having peaked at 5. 9 p. c. in July 2008, inflation in Belgium eased rapidly and should continue to fall in the short term, becoming negative for a time. This situation, likely to last only a few months, is due mainly to base effects connected with the record prices of petroleum products during the summer of 2008. Once these base effects have faded away, inflation is expected to return to positive figures at the end of 2009, though remaining low up to the end of the projection period, owing to the rapid attenuation of pressure from import prices and wages. In all, as an annual average, inflation is expected to reach 0. 1 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 3 p. c. in 2010, having stood at 4. 5 p. c. in 2008. The health index is projected to rise by 0. 8 p. c. in 2009 and 1. 1 p. c. in 2010. Reflecting both the fall in labour productivity, following the cyclical weakness, and the still sustained rise in hourly labour costs, unit labour costs in the private sector rose by 3. 9 p. c. in 2008 and are likely to rise by a further 2. 9 p. c. in 2009, as a result of high indexation which follows from the surge in inflation in 2008. In 2010, they should remain more or less steady. This deceleration between 2009 and 2010 is due partly to the cyclical recovery in labour productivity. Also, the growth of hourly labour costs is set to fall from 3. 5 p. c. in 2008 to 2. 3 p. c. in 2009 and 0. 4 p. c. in 2010. The deterioration in labour market conditions is expected to result in wage growth moderation. According to the provisional figures published by the NAI in March 2009, Belgium’s public finances recorded a deficit of 1. 2 p. c. of GDP in 2008. In the macroeconomic context depicted above and in the light of the measures approved by the federal government and the regional governments, e. g. in connection with the recovery plans, that deficit is expected to reach 5. 5 p. c. of GDP in 2009 and 6 p. c. in 2010, if policy remains unchanged. After having declined continuously since 1993, to reach 84 p. c. in 2007, the ratio of public debt to GDP began rising again in 2008, mainly as a result of the capital injections and loans granted to financial institutions. In 2009 and 2010, the general government debt is expected to record a further sharp rise to 97. 4 and 103 p. c. of GDP respectively. Belgium, macroeconomic projections, Eurosystem...|$|E

The investments tend to be more risky during the period of December 2007 until know.

We find some evidence that cash flow has a positive impact on the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> of cash, which suggests that Asian firms are borrowing constrained and that they save more when their cash flow increases so {{that they will be able}} to finance future investments. Moreover, we find in the developed economy sample that, as expected, cash flow has a positive impact on the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> of cash only in the case of the smallest firms, which are more likely to be borrowing constrained, and find in the developing economy sample that, as expected, the positive impact of cash flow on the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> of cash declines with firm size. In addition, we find that the cash flow sensitivity of cash declined after the global financial crisis. Finally, we find some evidence that Tobin's q has a positive impact on the <b>change</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stock</b> of cash...|$|R

" The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine (1) the influence of financial performance to <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> return (2) to identify variables that have a dominant influence on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> return LQ- 45 index. For three-year study period (2003 to 2005). The sample study was conducted with a purposive sampling method and acquired 19 companies in the sample. The tools used to analyze existing data in this study were (1) financial ratio analysis covering debt equity ratio (DER), return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and the price earnings ratio (PER) (2) -assisted linear regression analysis using computer program SPSS V 12. 0. The results showed that financial performance is represented DER, ROA, ROE, and PER did not have a significant influence on <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> return LQ- 45 either simultaneously or partially. The R 2 = 0475 indicates that the stock price variation can be explained by the regression model amounted to 47. 5 %. From the analysis of research data with the help of the program and SPSS V 12. 0. Regression equation showing the relationship between independent variables with the dependent variable is: Y = 0049 - 0001 DER + 0080 ROA ROE 0043 + 0007 + PE...|$|R
40|$|Being able to {{quantify}} the probability of large price <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> markets is of crucial importance in understanding financial crises that affect {{the lives of people}} worldwide. Large <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> market prices can arise abruptly, within a matter of minutes, or develop across much longer time scales. Here, we analyze a dataset comprising the stocks forming the Dow Jones Industrial Average at a second by second resolution in the period from January 2008 to July 2010 in order {{to quantify}} the distribution of <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> market prices at a range of time scales. We find that the tails of the distributions of logarithmic price changes, or returns, exhibit power law decays for time scales ranging from 300 seconds to 3600 seconds. For larger time scales, we find that the distributions tails exhibit exponential decay. Our findings may inform the development of models of market behavior across varying time scales...|$|R
40|$|In {{the chaotic}} {{financial}} environment of East Asia in 1997 - 98, daily <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> prices {{of as much}} as 10 percent became commonplace. The authors analyze what type of news moved the market in those days of extreme market jitters. They find that movements are triggered by both local and neighbor-country news. News about agreements with international organizations and credit rating agencies have the most weight. Some of those large <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>stock</b> prices, however, cannot be explained by any apparent substantial news but seem to be driven by herd instincts in the market itself. On average, the one-day market rallies are sustained with the largest one-day losses are recovered - suggesting that investors overreact to bad news.
