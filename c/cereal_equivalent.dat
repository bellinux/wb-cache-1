Food consumption increases exceed production during early development, leading to imports. Consumption eventually stabilizes at high incomes, but production falls short in land-scarce countries.

40|$|International audienceIn 2000, the World {{population}} was 6. 2 billion people; it reached 7 billion in 2012 {{and is expected}} to reach 9. 5 billion (± 0. 4) in 2050 and 11 billion (± 1. 5) in 2100, according to the 2012 UN projections (Gerland et al. in Science 346 : 234 – 237, 2014). The trend after 2100 {{is still one of the}} global demographic growths, but after 2060, Africa is the only continent where the population would still increase. The amount of water consumed annually to produce the food necessary to meet the needs of the populations varies greatly between countries, from about 600 to 2500 m 3 /year per capita (Zimmer in L’empreinte eau. Les faces cachées d’une ressource vitale. Charles Léopold Meyer, Paris, 2013), depending on their wealth, their food habits, and the percentage of food waste they generate (on average, 30 % of the food produced is wasted). In 2000, the total food production was on the order of 3300 million tons (in <b>cereal</b> <b>equivalents).</b> In 2014, it is estimated that about 0. 8 billion inhabitants of the planet suffer from hunger (FAO in World agriculture: towards 2030 – 2050. FAO, Rome, 2014. [URL] and do not get the nutrition they need to be in good health or, in the case of children, to grow properly (both physically and intellectually). This food deficit was on the order of 40 million tons of <b>cereal</b> <b>equivalents</b> in 2014. The number of inhabitants with a food deficit was about 0. 85 billion before the 2008 crisis and was decreasing annually, but it increased abruptly after 2008 up to 1 billion inhabitants and is slowly decreasing now. Assuming a World average water consumption for food of 1300 m 3 /year per capita in 2000, 1400 m 3 /year in 2050, and 1500 m 3 /year in 2100, a volume of water of around 8200 km 3 /year was needed in 2000, 13, 000 km 3 /year will be needed in 2050, and 16, 500 km 3 /year in 2100 (Marsily in L’eau, un trésor en partage. Dunod, Paris, 2009). Can bioenergy be added to food production? Will that much water be available on Earth, and where will it come from? Is climate change going to modify the answers to these questions? Can severe droughts occur? Can there be conflicts related to a food deficit? Some preliminary answers and scenarios for food production will be given in this paper from a hydrologist’s viewpoint...|$|R
40|$|Background: Breakfast cereals {{exhibit a}} wide {{variability}} in nutritional quality, and differences {{are not easily}} grasped by consumers. A simplified nutritional information system might contribute to help consumers make healthier foodchoices. A five-category colour label based on the Food Standards Agency Nutrient profiling system (FSA score) has been proposed in France to be implemented on the front-of-pack of foods (the five-colour nutrition label - 5 -CNL). Objectives were to evaluate {{the ability of the}} 5 -CNL to discriminate nutritional quality between types of breakfast cereals, within a category and in equivalent products, as well as its ability to change through product reformulation. Methods: Nutritional information was collected through an Internet and supermarket research for N = 433 breakfast cereals (N = 380 complete data included in the analyses). Breakfast cereals were categorized according to common attributes in terms of processing and/or ingredients used. The FSA score and 5 -CNL category allocation were computed for each cereal. Nutrient content and FSA score were compared across types of cereals. Distribution within the 5 -CNL categories was assessed across types of <b>cereals</b> and for <b>equivalent</b> products. Impact of reformulation (reduction of 5 and 10 % in simple sugar, saturated fat and sodium) on the 5 -CNL category allocation was compared to original allocation with Bapkhar’s tests of homogeneity of marginal distribution. Results: Variability in nutritional quality of breakfast cereals was high, as reflected by the FSA score (range − 7 - 22 for a theoretical range of − 15 - 40) and the 5 -CNL (all five categories represented). The 5 -CNL allowed for discrimination across types of cereals, within categories of breakfast <b>cereals</b> and for <b>equivalent</b> products (at least 3 categories of the 5 -CNL represented). Reformulation scenarios allowed for significant change in 5 -CNL allocation: 5 % reduction in sugar lead to a modification of the label for 4. 21 % of products while a reduction of 10 % of sugar, saturated fat and sodium lead to a modification of the label for 19. 2 % of products. Conclusion: The 5 -CNL adequately discriminates between breakfast cereals. It would therefore be an adequate tool for consumer information on nutritional quality of foods in the French context...|$|R

40|$|Transition economies have {{historically}} been important producers of agricultural products. Under central planning, distortions resulted in atypical food consumption and associated production patterns compared to market economies, with low and medium-income populations producing and eating high-income, livestock-rich diets. Using market economy consumption patterns as benchmarks, we identify to what extent various turning points have been reached in food consumption patterns and self-sufficiency ratios as transition economies adjust to market conditions. We develop a model using the concept of <b>cereal</b> <b>equivalent</b> factor values to measure progress and compare and contrast country changes in food consumption and production with a commensurate, resource-use approach. transition economies, food, agriculture, consumption patterns...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{materials}} {{are used as}} soil amendments in productive agriculture to increase or replace soil organic matter and provide essential plant nutrients. Two field trials were undertaken in Tasmania (a temperate region located between latitudes 40 ° and 44 ° south and between longitudes 143 ° and 149 ° east) over two years to quantify changes to biological, chemical and physical properties of soil and to determine crop responses from applying locally available organic materials to a texture contrast soil. Lime amended biosolids (LAB) and anaerobically digested biosolids (ADB) were applied at both sites with application rates calculated from local EPA guidelines. Lime and fertiliser (L+F) was applied at both sites, with application rates based on nitrogen requirement of the crop. Poppy mulch (PM) and poppy seed waste (PSW) were applied at one site only, with application rates based on industry recommendations. Results showed that the application of bio-resources can produce <b>equivalent</b> <b>cereal</b> crop yields to inorganic fertiliser, for two successive seasons following application. LAB applied at 1 NLBAR (for cereals) and PM applied at 17. 5 wet t/ha increased soil pH by 0. 9 and 0. 6 units respectively within 9 months of application. Without further application of P, a season of growing cereals did not reduce soil Colwell P from pre-trial levels for the LAB treatment. However, an increase in Colwell P after the second year is of major concern for potential leaching and surface run-off of mobile P.

40|$|We report some of {{the results}} from a 15 -year long {{rotational}} trial conducted at ICRISAT in the Southern Peninsular India that will eventually {{form the basis for}} a detailed model evaluation of Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). This model will then be used to design crop rotations that have higher productivity and lower risks than conventional rotations like rainy fallow and post rainy sorghum or chickpea. The experimental results reported here show that this is entirely feasible. Our specific objectives were to: 1) quantify the benefits of grain legumes to non-legumes in the cropping system rotations; and 2) identify improved and sustainable cropping system options for crop productivity and intensification. Variability in the onset and distribution of monsoonal rains in June-July constitute a key risk of crop production on Vertisols. As such, fields are usually left as fallow during the rainy season (kharif) and cropped with sorghum or chickpea during only the post-rainy season (rabi) on stored soil moisture. However, due to the high water holding capacity of Vertisols, there is an opportunity to make better use of both seasons, and as such, a crop intensification approach with sequential double cropping was explored. Besides the extra crop yield gained from double -cropping, this practice may help to reduce erosion in the rainy season. Vertisols {{in this part of the}} world are generally deficient in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. Response to N fertilization is much higher than with any other nutrient, and the response in the rainy season is greater than in the post-rainy season (Katyal, 1988). Legume-based systems have been particularly successful in providing N inputs where fertilizer is of marginal economic benefit as well as providing grain as part of the crop production system. In India, farmers remove stalks from the field for fodder, however relatively little N is removed in this process because stalks have very low N content. Legume root material and nodules remaining in the soil have shown positive residual effects on the subsequent <b>cereal</b> crop <b>equivalent</b> to 30 - 40 kg N ha- 1 (Kumar Rao et al., 1983). While this is not large enough to approach potential crop yields of rainy season crops, even a moderate N input could double the yield because the soils may supply as little as 30 kg N ha- 1 to cereal crops. Such results led to the establishment of a long-term experiment at ICRISAT to examine the productivity of cropping systems with improved technologies including broad bed furrow land management, high yielding varieties, fertilizers and the inclusion of short duration legume crops in rotations...|$|R
40|$|Per capita food {{consumption}} and production changes during economic development are analyzed using a resource-based <b>cereal</b> <b>equivalent</b> measure. Diet up-grades to livestock products during economic development {{contribute to an}} increase in per capita food resource use by a factor of five or more. Food consumption changes are generally consistent across countries and are only marginally affected by a country’s food production resource base (land). Food consumption increases tend to exceed food production increases in early stages of development, leading to food import needs. In later stages of development, per capita {{food consumption}} stabilizes. Continued increases in production allow the closing of the consumption-production gap for some countries at high income levels. Consumption of pork and poultry meat show the largest percentage increase during economic development; however, beef and dairy products are less efficient in resource use and therefore command a majority of the productive resources for livestock production at all income levels. economic development, food consumption, agricultural self-sufficiency...|$|E
