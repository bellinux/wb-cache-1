500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> eye. We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the feel, all with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E
500|$|Cal {{exhibits}} many masculine characteristics {{when he is}} a child. He writes, [...] "I {{began to}} exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> eraser, for instance." [...] In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are {{turned off by the}} blood in the Iliad, Cal is [...] "thrilled to [...] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations." [...] Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, [...] "Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In his {{maiden speech}} in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, [...] "I am a socialist not through reading a {{textbook}} that has <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gnarls Barkley {{described}} the Violent Femmes' version as: [...] "I might {{compare it to}} a calm pond. I <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> reflection in it. And I seemed to be momentarily at peace. This track sounds entirely different in the rain, and supports some intriguing lilypads." [...] The Violent Femmes hosted a YouTube contest beginning June 10, 2008, with a cash award of $1,000USD and [...] "other cool prizes" [...] for creating and submitting a promotional video clip.|$|E
2500|$|Miller {{was part}} of Charlie Company of the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, a unit which {{took part in the}} Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004. [...] Los Angeles Times {{photographer}} Luis Sinco took a photo of 20-year-old Miller leaning against a wall, smoking a cigarette. [...] In explaining the photograph, Sinco said that [...] "His expression <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> eye. To me, it said: terrified, exhausted, and glad just to be alive. I recognized that look because that's how I felt too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sugizo finds all {{religions}} very interesting, and loves to read lots of books about them. Since {{his father was}} a Buddhist, while his mother was a Protestant, from the young age he has often been in contact with things related to church and Protestantism. Currently he's more into Buddhism, or more specifically, Buddha himself. Ever since he was little he was curious about occult subjects.

2500|$|On 15 May 1942 after photographing German destroyers berthed at {{the port}} of Kiel, Spitfire pilot Flight Lieutenant D. W.

[...] Later in the month Constance Babington Smith decided the scale was too small ... then something unusual <b>caught</b> <b>my</b> eye ... some extraordinary circular embankments ... I then dismissed the whole thing from my mind. [...] Then a year later on 22 April 1943, Bill White and Ron Prescott in RAF de Havilland Mosquito DZ473 were sent from Leuchars to photograph damage from Allied bombing at the Stettin railyards: [...] "On leaving Stettin, we left our cameras running all down the north coast of Germany, and when the film was developed, it was found to contain pictures of Peenemünde." [...] The Medmenham interpreters studied the elliptical earthworks (originally photographed in May 1942) and noticed an [...] "object" [...] long projecting from what was thought to be a service building, although it had mysteriously disappeared on the next frame.|$|E
