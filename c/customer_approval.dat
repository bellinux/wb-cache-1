The research was conducted to understand the sectors adopting HVM and uncover the benefits of this type of manufacturing. Summary The main approaches of high value manufacturing are customer-based solutions, ‘just in time’ manufacturing, and lean implementation to establish innovative manufacturing. The key benefits of HVM on a company’s strategy are in terms of cost savings, increase in efficiency and waste reduction, increase in profitability, improved <b>customer</b> <b>approval,</b> and a sustainable competitive advantage, as well as benefits on a country’s economy and the environment. Companies can utilize HVM as a strategic approach to increase profit margins and maintain competitiveness in the industry. The qualitative interviews were conducted with HVM companies in Finland. Conclusions The main drivers for HVM adoption were found to be an increase in value creation and the ability to obtain a sustainable competitiveness in a developed country environment. The main benefits of HVM were found to be profit and value benefits including cost savings, efficiency improvements, waste reduction, and an increase in customer satisfaction.

40|$|Companies {{implement}} effective {{project management}} to successfully operate in turbulent market cycles and ensure {{the success of}} their endeavors. Project management is indispensable for most industrial sectors and is employed in a variety of for-profit and non-profit organizations. It can be considered as a management method that contributes value to a variety of organizations. Many practitioners and researchers have attempted to identify the causes of project failure, the factors of project success, and the criteria to gauge this success. There has been little agreement on what constitutes project success. In response to the widespread debate surrounding project success, several lists dealing with factors related to project success have been published. The lack of agreement on the definition of project success renders the quest to identify the factors that contribute to successful project implementation moot. Without knowing what constitutes success, we cannot know what contributes to it. Practitioners are interested in recommendations for implementing project success factors and the corrective or preventative actions that should be taken if the project fails to meet one or more project success criteria. Project management and related research are, therefore facing severe criticism for not fulfilling their contributory expectations within the management discipline. The purpose of this research is to identify relationships between the project management body of knowledge and short- and long-term project success. The project management body of knowledge includes nine knowledge areas: integration, scope, time, cost, quality, communication, risk, human resources, and procurement management and five project management process groups (initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing process groups) (PMBoK, 2004), while project success is related to budget/cost, schedule, customer satisfaction, user satisfaction, stakeholder satisfaction, project team satisfaction, strategic contribution of the project, financial objectives, technical objectives, performance objectives, commercial benefit for contractors, commercial benefit for customer, scope, personal growth, <b>customer</b> <b>approval,</b> profitability, and sales. This study is based on a self-conducted survey of 163 members of the Project Management Institute / German Chapter from October 8, 2013 to January 31 st, 2014, who are project managers, project coordinators, or project team members. The business areas included in the survey are computers / information technology, construction, engineering, education, government, health care, manufacturing, software development, and telecommunications. Pearson chi-square tests and Fisher 2 ̆ 7 s exact tests were performed to examine whether relationships exist between the project management body of knowledge and project success (short-term and long-term project success). The study revealed significant evidence of relationships between the outputs of the project management body of knowledge and short- and long-term project success. The study revealed also that project success depends on the project type, project size and project business area. The main contributions of this dissertation are: (a) an empirically based investigation of the relationship between outputs of the management processes and the project judgment criteria; (b) a closing of the existing gap in the literature regarding the link between factors that contribute to project success and ways to measure it (in previous studies project success criteria and success factors have been investigated in isolation); (c) a holistic analysis of the project management body of knowledge by providing an organized view of the outputs of each project management process that could influence short- and long-term project resulting outcomes; and (d) a framework for the analysis and improvement of project outcomes by using the theory of constraints...|$|E

At an exhibition called [...] "L'art de la soie" [...] held at the Musée Galliera in Paris in 1927, Charvet presented dressing gowns and neckties in matching patterns, together with pyjamas, shirts and handherchieves. The company developed a practice of sending merchandises to its <b>customers</b> for <b>approval,</b> allowing them to select some or none and return the rest, subsequently {{referred to as the}} Charvet method. It conceived a range of free-form bold printed tie patterns which gained wide popularity in the USA. [...] "Its chic was in their unfussy, nonchalant bearing. To the delight of their many admirers, the Charvets' open settings facilitated blending with all kind of fancy suits [...] The original Charvet prints became the first, and regrettably almost the last, bold figured necktie to symbolize upper-class taste". Some such bold Charvet Art Deco ties which had belonged to John Ringling are on display at the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art. These patterns, for which charvet became a generic name, [...] "foreshadowed" [...] the colorful designs which became popular after the war. The company also produced beach linen robes with patterns up to two feet in diameter.|$|R

Spiegel stockholders received shares of Beneficial stock, and Spiegel became a wholly owned subsidiary. During the early 1970s, several charges were leveled against Spiegel by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regarding some of the company's marketing tactics. In 1971, the FTC accused Spiegel of failing to adequately disclose credit terms in some of its statements and catalog ads. The company also was cited for its handling of credit life insurance policies, {{as well as for}} offering free home trials without informing <b>customers</b> that credit <b>approval</b> was required before a product would be shipped. Moreover, in 1974, the FTC charged that Spiegel's debt collection policies treated customers unfairly.

40|$|Web-based {{applications}} {{are one of}} the most widely used types of software and have become the backbone of the e-commerce and communications businesses. These {{applications are}} often missioncritical for many organizations, but generally suffer from low <b>customer</b> loyalty and <b>approval.</b> Although such concerns would normally motivate the need for highly-reliable and well-tested systems, web-based applications are subject to constraints in their development lifecycles that often preclude complete testing. To address these constraints, this research explores user-visible web-based application errors in the context of web-based application error detection and classification. The main thesis of this work is that user-visible web-based application errors have special properties that can be exploited to improve the current state of web application error detection, testing, and development. This thesis is evaluated using seven specific falsifiable hypotheses. This research presents highly-precise, automated approaches to the testing of web-based applications that reduce the cost of such testing, making its adoption more feasible for developers. Additionally, a model of user-visible web application error severity is constructed, backed by a human study, to refute the current underlying assumption of error severity uniformity in defect seeding for this domain, as well as to propos...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{success of}} {{marketing}} lies in {{creation of an}} impression {{in the minds of}} the customers thereby fostering brand recall and further purchase intention. The challenge, however, is to hit the right buy button of the brain to deliver what the customer exactly requires. The functioning of the human brain has been the central focus of psychology and neuroscience researchers. Neuroscience combined with marketing has helped evolve the discipline of neuromarketing with precision and reliability. This research paper explores the impact of various persuasion attempts (traditional and neuroscientific adopted by the marketer) on customer privacy and in turn its impact on customer relations. The research has been conducted in Indian cities of Delhi/NCR, Bengaluru and Mumbai over a period of three months. It is concluded that traditional persuasion attempts do not always affect customer privacy adversely but at times cause disturbance to the customers which might affect the customer relations in the long run. Neuroscientific persuasion attempts, on the other hand, have adverse impact on customer privacy and customer relations as these techniques unintentionally reveal the inner secrets of the <b>customers</b> without their <b>approval</b> and awareness. Managerial implications are also considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{customers}} {{active involvement}} {{has been the}} focus in almost every software development project in the past decade. The latest and most popular agile developments methodologies require <b>customers</b> feedback and <b>approval</b> during the development process. IT-development companies usually manage requirements using a formal requirement specification document. This document is created and prepared for experts and programmers in the development project. Since customers normally don t understand the requirement document, a simple and understandable version of it needs to be provided {{in order for them to}} be able to participate in the development process. The process of translating or converting formal requirements to a simpler or informal version is usually done manually by the development team. The possibility of converting formal to informal requirements has been investigated earlier. Since boiler plates are used in the conversion, an application that support creating and editing boiler plates is required. This thesis will study how this conversion can be performed in practice using user stories, boiler plates and a requirement management application. This thesis will also investigate whether developers from the industry see any advantage in this conversion. The result of this thesis is divided into two main parts. The first part describes how the conversion is performed, challenges and limitations in this process and the new user stories created as result of this conversion. The described conversion is a semi-automated process. The second part presents the results from the interviews conducted with employees from IT-companies in the industry.
