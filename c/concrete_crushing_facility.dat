40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJason BergtoldMarkets for {{alternative}} fuels are emerging and are {{of great interest}} to both public and private companies, as well as government agencies looking to differentiate fuel sources to achieve improved and sustainable operational efficiencies. This creates a growing need for innovation and an increased supply of biofuel feedstocks for bioenergy options such as bio-jet fuel. This thesis aims to assess the logistical feasibility of producing oilseed bio feedstocks and the practicality of building new <b>crush</b> <b>facilities</b> specifically for bio-jet fuel production in Kansas. A logistical optimization model is built by applying data to estimate the potential Kansas supply of rapeseed as a possible feedstock option; transportation and facility costs associated with building; and proposed <b>crushing</b> <b>facility</b> sites, by considering the estimated demand for bio-jet fuel within Kansas. The developed optimization model determined that even average yields per acre and modest adoption rates by farmers willing to incorporate rapeseed into their crop rotations could provide enough feedstock to supply one or two <b>crushing</b> <b>facilities,</b> depending on a variety of additional factors, including bio-jet fuel demand in Kansas. Sensitivity analysis was performed on key model factors and determined that the most influential factor on both size and number of proposed <b>crushing</b> <b>facilities</b> was the market demand for bio-jet fuel. Ultimately, further research is required to better understand the actual market demand for bio-jet fuel within Kansas and how competition or supply supplementation of other bio feedstocks can affect the size or number of proposed <b>crushing</b> <b>facilities.</b> There are currently six oilseed <b>crushing</b> <b>facilities</b> operating in Kansas; although all are dedicated to soybean or sunflower seed. Further studies may find these sites as viable alternative options to building new <b>crushing</b> <b>facilities</b> for a separate type of feedstock...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{redistribute}} moment within a reinforced concrete frame or structure is an intrinsic requirement in design. This is generally dealt with using the established neutral axis depth factor, the ku approach, with fixed hinge lengths, which require the flexural member to fail by <b>concrete</b> <b>crushing</b> and which, in turn, requires large strains in the tension reinforcement. As longitudinally plated flexural members tend to fail by plate debonding or plate fracture before the <b>concrete</b> <b>crushes,</b> {{an alternative approach}} is presented {{which is based on}} variable hinge lengths, which can cope with beam failure at any tension reinforcement strain, and which can be applied to both longitudinally plated and unplated structures.

40|$|Recycling and reuse {{of waste}} {{materials}} is a topic of global concern and of great international interest. The urgent need for recycling is driven mainly by environmental considerations, due to the increase scarcity {{of natural resources and}} the increasing cost of land fill in most countries. Construction and demolition (C&D) materials are generated by regeneration of infrastructure such as demolition activities of buildings and construction activities of tunnels and roads. Recycled <b>crushed</b> brick, <b>crushed</b> <b>concrete,</b> <b>crushed</b> basaltic rock are viable substitute materials for natural construction materials in engineering applications such as pavement subbase and other road construction applications. This study focuses on the applicability of crushed brick blends with <b>crushed</b> <b>concrete</b> and <b>crushed</b> basaltic rock in pavement subbase material as well as bedding and backfill material for drainage systems. Construction and demolition materials account for a major proportion of the waste materials present in landfills in Australia. <b>Crushed</b> <b>concrete</b> and <b>crushed</b> brick are major components of demolition materials in Australia. Crushed rock used in this study originates from 'basalt floaters' or surface excavation rock (basalt) which commonly occurs near the surface to the north and west of Melbourne, Australia. The materials for the experimental works were collected from a recycling facility in Victoria, Australia The engineering characteristics of various proportions of crushed brick blends with <b>crushed</b> <b>concrete</b> and <b>crushed</b> rock, obtained from an extensive laboratory testing include high level tests such as static triaxial tests and repeat load triaxial tests are presented in this study. Finite element modelling on pavement application was done by using finite element program 'PLAXIS'. The engineering properties obtained were compared with existing local road authority specifications for pavement subbase or light duty base material and backfill material for drainage systems to ascertain the potential use of crushed brick blends. The research indicates that initially up to 25 % of crushed brick could be safely added to <b>crushed</b> <b>concrete</b> and <b>crushed</b> rock as pavement subbase material. Depending on the results of field trials, {{it may be possible to}} increase the percentage of crushed brick added in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{progressive}} collapse behaviour of reinforced concrete (RC) structures requires consideration {{of material and}} geometric non-linearity, <b>concrete</b> <b>crushing</b> and rebar fracture. Compressive arch action (CAA) and catenary action (CTA) are the main resisting mechanisms against {{progressive collapse}} following a column loss. Hence, many studies have concentrated {{on the development of}} CAA and CTA in RC beams, but without considering the effect of bar fracture and the reduction in beam effective depth due to <b>concrete</b> <b>crushing.</b> Taking these additional factors into account, an analytical model to predict the structural behaviour of RC beams under a column removal scenario was developed.
