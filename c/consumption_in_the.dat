5|$|Both {{strontium}} and strontianite {{are named}} after Strontian, {{a village in}} Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it {{was identified as a}} new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then-newly discovered process of electrolysis. The production of sugar from sugar beet was in the 19th century the largest application of strontium (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode ray tubes, as much as 75 percent of strontium <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States was used for the faceplate glass.

There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. Federal Reserve System) undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives.

40|$|Abstract—Exhausted energy {{consumption}} becomes a world-wide issue nowadays. Computing contributes {{a large portion}} of {{energy consumption}}. The concept of green computing has been popularized. Along with the rapid development of China, energy issue becomes more and more important. We believe that green computing would play a very important role in China. However, past publications mainly focused on electricity <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> data centers, while there are other important sources of electricity <b>consumption</b> <b>in</b> computing. <b>The</b> concept of green computing should be also applied to these sources. In this paper, we present and analyze the data on <b>the</b> electricity <b>consumptions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT industry (including the telecommunication and computer industries) and by household computers in five major Chinese cities during 2005 - 2009. The analysis will demonstrate the necessity of green computing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> IT industry and in household computers in China.
