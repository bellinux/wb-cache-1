5|$|Although much of Hornung's {{work has}} fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories {{continued}} to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung's stories dealt with {{a wider range of}} themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.|$|E
5|$|Late {{in their}} careers, {{the class was}} {{identified}} as the A <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pennant numbers of all the submarines were prefixed with an A, becoming A-2 to A-7. None of the boats, however, ever displayed an A on their conning towers. Havmanden and Thetis were the first two boats taken out of service when they were stricken in April 1928. Havfruen was the last boat removed from service when she was stricken in May 1932.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} in 1994. An {{outstanding}} student, Shen Chia-yi, is popular among her teachers and classmates.

One day, Ching-teng is caught masturbating during <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> principal reseats him, placing him in front of Chia-yi.|$|E
5|$|USS Indiana (BB-1) was {{the lead}} ship of her <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first {{battleship}} in the United States Navy comparable to foreign battleships of the time. Authorized in 1890 and commissioned five years later, she was a small battleship, though with heavy armor and ordnance. The ship also pioneered {{the use of an}} intermediate battery. She was designed for coastal defense and as a result, her decks were not safe from high waves on the open ocean.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} may {{be divided}} into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that Pteranodon species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.|$|E
5|$|After the breakout, the Austro-Hungarian navy saw {{very little}} action, {{spending}} {{much of its}} time in its base at Pola (now Pula, Croatia). The navy's general inactivity was partly caused {{by a lack of}} coal, which became a problem as the war progressed, and partly by a fear of mines in the Adriatic (which also kept the Italian navy in port for most of the war). They did, however, leave Pola to bombard Ancona in May 1915. On 23 May 1915, four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola, the members of the Tegetthoff <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast. The Austro-Hungarian ships bombarded the important naval base at Ancona, and later the coast of Montenegro, without opposition; by the time Italian ships arrived on the scene, the Austro-Hungarians were safely back in Pola.|$|E
5|$|Ebrey {{argues that}} {{although}} most of Emperor Wu's fiscal policies were repealed during Eastern Han, their damage to the merchant <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subsequent laissez-faire policies of Eastern Han allowed the wealthiest landowners to dominate society, ensuring that China's economy would remain firmly agrarian-based for centuries. The Eastern Han central government lost {{an important source of}} revenue by relinquishing its salt and iron industries and purchasing its armies' swords and shields from private manufacturers. However, this loss of revenue was often compensated by higher taxes levied on the merchants.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, {{he spent}} {{a week in the}} {{religious}} class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain took note of his intelligence. One teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> best reading skills. He also attended Sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly, often carrying his father's bag. A controversy erupted at one such session, when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of Christianity. Achebe later included a scene from this incident in Things Fall Apart.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|Millhouse was a vocal {{advocate}} of his broader constituency, championing their {{case in a}} party dominated by rural conservatives. He {{wrote a paper on}} the 'Liberal Case for Electoral Reform', arguing for a fairer electoral system, as it was biased against voters resident in the capital city, Adelaide, whether they be progressive or conservative, Liberal or Labor. Many younger urban middle class voters, who would have normally been attracted to the LCL, were abandoning the party for Labor owing to their dissatisfaction with the malapportioned electoral system known as the 'Playmander'. But this concerned the rural conservatives little, who hoped to retain their hold on power through the present system, which included a Legislative Council where suffrage was based on land ownership, resulting in a body dominated by the ruling <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rural landholders, and a 16–4 LCL majority. Millhouse's paper was quickly ignored.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 1868, Khrimian {{was ordained}} as a bishop in Etchmiadzin. On 4 September 1869 {{he was elected}} as the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, who was the de facto leader of the Armenian {{community}} of the Ottoman Empire in both religious and secular matters. According to Ali Tekkoyun, a Turkish scholar of religion, his election indicated that the Amira (wealthiest) <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> imperial authorities lost power over the Armenians as went against their interests. He cleared the patriarchate's debt and sought to increase the provincial representation in the Armenian National Assembly. As the de facto political leader of the Christian Armenian millet {{in the eyes of}} the Sublime Porte, he prepared a detailed report documenting instances of oppression, persecution, and miscarriage of justice in the Armenian provinces and presented the document to the Sublime Porte. Khrimian used the position to advance the interests and conditions of the poor and oppressed provincial Armenians.|$|E
5|$|Smeli was {{the second}} of her <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fourth {{submarine}} of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Royal Yugoslav Navy). She was launched on 1 December 1928. She and Osvetnik arrived in the Bay of Kotor on 9 December 1929. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships were engaging in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. In October 1934, Smeli visited Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia, and the Kelibia Roads {{off the coast of}} Tunisia. In August and September 1937, Smeli, along with the British-made submarine Hrabri and the depot ship Zmaj, visited Greece, including the port of Piraeus, and the islands of Crete and Corfu.|$|E
5|$|The {{undergraduate}} schools {{maintain a}} restrictive Early Action admissions program, as {{students who have}} applied through an Early Decision process at another school {{are not permitted to}} apply early to Georgetown. 94% of students accepted for the class of 2017 were in the top 10% of their <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interquartile range of SAT scores was 700–770 in Reading/Writing and 680–780 in Math. Georgetown accepts the SAT and ACT, though it does not consider the writing portion of either test. Over 55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and about 70% of aid distributed in the form of grants or scholarships.|$|E

5|$|Violet Clay (1978) and A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) {{are each}} about an {{unmarried}} protagonist's career in a creative profession. In A Mother and Two Daughters {{the main character}} resists the temptation {{to get married and}} chooses instead to focus on her work. A Mother and Two Daughters and A Southern Family (1987) each depend heavily on a southern setting and employ themes traditionally associated with social problems in the South. Some of their themes include racial discrimination, social-economic <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cultural differences between generations. Many characters struggle to reduce the gap between the rich and poor or try to break free from a dominant cultural tradition, with mixed success.|$|E
5|$|With Kirchner leading all the pre-election polls {{by a wide}} margin, her challengers {{focused on}} forcing her into a ballotage. To win in a single round, a presidential {{candidate}} in Argentina needs either more than 45% of the vote, or 40% of the vote and a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the runner-up. However, with 13 challengers splitting the vote, Kirchner won the election decisively {{in the first round}} with just over 45% of the vote, followed by 23% for Elisa Carrió (candidate for the Civic Coalition) and 17% for former Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna. Kirchner was popular among the suburban working <b>class</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rural poor, while Carrió and Lavagna both received more support from the urban middle class. Kirchner lost the election in the large cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario.|$|E
