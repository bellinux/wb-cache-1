5|$|To {{support the}} effort, other PAVN {{elements}} would <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city {{from the west}} and south. Since no code name had been applied to the new offensive, Dũng suggested that it be named the Ho Chi Minh Campaign. The Politburo concurred on 14 April.|$|E
5|$|In 1820–21, {{the federal}} land surveys {{had reached the}} disputed area from two directions, {{progressing}} southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed {{they were part of}} Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{withdrew from}} the war on 8 September. Kesselring {{immediately}} moved to secure Rome, where he expected an Allied airborne and seaborne invasion. He ordered the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division and 2nd Parachute Division to <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city, while a detachment made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the Italian Army staff at Monterotondo in a coup de main. Kesselring's two divisions were faced by five Italian divisions, two of them armoured, {{but he managed to}} overcome the opposition, disperse the Italian forces and secure the city in two days.|$|E
50|$|Wilkur {{is a town}} in the Mount Jeffcot ward of {{the local}} {{government}} area of the Shire of Buloke and the Warracknabeal ward of the Shire of Yarriambiack, Victoria, Australia.

5|$|The rain {{eventually}} became heavier, making the conditions treacherous and bringing the safety car back out. This put a temporary stop {{to the battle}} between Aston Martin and Corvette for first and {{second place in the}} GT1 class. The second place Corvette had been quicker in the wet conditions, but it was not allowed to further <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Aston Martin during the safety period. After problems for both of the Barazi-Epsilon LMP2s, Binnie Motorsports brought its class leading LMP2 car to the garage to ensure that the car was prepared for the weather and could hold on to the lead until the finish.|$|E
5|$|As the {{two ships}} closed Truxtun's ship held the weather gauge, the {{position}} upwind from his opponent which {{allowed him to}} close or break off. However the heavy winds caused Constellation to heel so much that her leeward gunports had to remain closed. Truxtun decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing past L'Insurgentes to reach her leeward side. From there Constellation could bring more of her guns to bear. With Constellation approaching his frigate fast, Barreaut tried {{to communicate with the}} Americans. The American frigate ignored the French hail, closing to within fifty yards of L'Insurgente before opening up with a broadside. Loaded with double shot, the opening American salvo struck the French frigate's quarterdeck. Barreaut's vessel replied with her own broadside that damaged Constellation's fore topmast. Midshipman David Porter, stationed in the rigging of Constellations damaged mast, managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse. L'Insurgente attempted to <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> American frigate to board her, but Constellation held the weather gage and had less damage to her rigging, enabling her to avoid Barreaut's attempt to draw alongside.|$|E
5|$|Lydiard {{remained}} cruising off Havana, and on 15 September sighted the French 84-gun Foudroyant. The Foudroyant, {{carrying the}} flag of Vice-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, had been dismasted in a storm and was carrying a jury-rig. Despite the superiority of his opponent and the nearness of the shore Lydiard attempted to <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> French vessel and opened fire. Anson came under fire from the fortifications at Morro Castle, while several Spanish ships, including the 74-gun San Lorenzo, came out of Havana to assist the French. After being unable to manoeuvre into a favourable position and coming under heavy fire, Lydiard hauled away and made his escape. Anson had two killed and 13 wounded during the engagement, while the rigging was badly cut. Foudroyant meanwhile had 27 killed or wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{years that}} {{followed}} witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 {{that there was no}} substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out {{towards the end of the}} decade changed things considerably. In 1831, <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir Mark Cubbon, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.|$|E

25|$|Maclagan {{opened the}} batting for England, and made 72 {{before she was}} the fifth woman out with England on 116, just before <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day. On day two, England moved on to 154, with Betty Archdale making 32 not out. In their second innings, Australia fared better, and were 99 for 5 at <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second day. Maclagan failed to take a wicket in her 28 overs, but it was Mary Spear's five wickets that did the damage, as the home team were all of for 138, a total which {{included}} 63 runs scored over {{more than four hours}} from Essie Shevill. England were thus set just 32 for the win, which they secured with the loss of just one wicket.|$|E

25|$|Cameron and Layne {{replaced}} Bancroft and Parker, Ollivierre keeping wicket. Derbyshire's team included Charles Ollivierre, Richard's brother, who had toured {{with the}} West Indies in 1900.

25|$|The patrol ships took up station one {{either side}} of Gulflight, Iago <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{starboard}} side and Filey further ahead on the port. While under escort, Gulflight's second officer, Paul Bowers, reported sighting a submarine ahead some 28 minutes before the ship was hit. He reported this to the captain who decided that the submarine must be British, as the escorts had not reacted to its presence. The submarine was visible for 5 minutes and then disappeared.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{differences}} apply in Scotland {{relative to the}} rest of the United Kingdom. For example, Easter Monday is not a bank holiday.

Despite this, it is custom and practice to follow the rest of the UK and banks <b>close</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last Monday and not the first.|$|E
