50|$|Natural fibers {{are also}} used in {{composite}} materials, much like synthetic or glass fibers. These composites, called biocomposites, are a natural fiber in a matrix of synthetic polymers. One of the first biofiber-reinforced plastics in use was a cellulose fiber in phenolics in 1908. Usage includes applications where energy absorption is important, such as insulation, noise absorbing panels, or <b>collapsable</b> areas in automobiles.|$|E
5000|$|Consistent {{with its}} 3+1 name, the Trepiùno's {{packaging}} concept combines an overall short length with high h-point seating [...] - [...] and a seating configuration where {{the front passenger}} can slide forward toward a reconfigurable dashboard with an inward-folding <b>collapsable</b> glovebox [...] - [...] thus enabling sufficient room for one full-size rear passenger along with a fourth, strictly occasional, [...] "emergency" [...] child seat behind the driver [...] - [...] or enabling a pure 3-seat or 2-seat vehicle by folding one or both rear seats.|$|E
5000|$|The Kodak Retina IIIc and IIc (USA/West Germany) <b>collapsable</b> lens 35mm {{rangefinder}} cameras of 1954 {{took the}} supplementary lens idea {{to the extreme}} with their interchangeable lens [...] "components." [...] This system allowed swapping the front cell component of their standard Schneider Retina-Xenon C 50mm f/2 lenses (a Double Gauss) for Schneider Retina-Longar-Xenon 80mm f/4 long-focus and Schneider Retina-Curtar-Xenon 35mm f/5.6 wide-angle components. Component lens design is tightly constrained {{by the need to}} reuse the rear cell and the lenses are extremely bulky, range limited and complex compared with fully interchangeable lenses, but the Retina's interlens Synchro-Compur leaf shutter restricted lens options.|$|E
50|$|Since {{taking up}} its {{home at the}} Ontological Theater at St. Mark's in 1992, the OHT has also been {{nurturing}} {{a new generation of}} artists who share Foreman's goals and passion for theater. Through internship, staffing, summer residency and curation efforts, the OHT has been a starting point for many artists making their mark in New York City and internationally including David Herskovits, Artistic Director of Target Margin Theater, Damon Keily, Artistic Director of American Theater in Chicago, some of the artists of <b>Collapsable</b> Giraffe, Radiohole, Elevator Repair Service, National Theater of the United States of America, Doorika, Richard Maxwell, Juliana Francis, Sophie Haviland, Robert Cucuzza, DJ Mendel, Ken Nintzel, Marie Losier, and Young Jean Lee.|$|E
30|$|Theorem 3.1. Every {{retractable}} {{complex is}} <b>collapsable.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{class of}} <b>collapsable</b> {{complexes}} {{is bigger than}} the class of retractable complexes.|$|E
3000|$|In fact, {{the proof}} of Theorem 3.1 defines the leader {{election}} algorithm [7] for <b>collapsable</b> complexes: [...]...|$|E
30|$|Any s-recursively {{contractible}} complex can be reduced, by {{a sequence}} of retractions, to an arbitrarily chosen subcomplex generated by some simplex. However for <b>collapsable</b> complexes, {{as well as for}} *-recursively contractible complexes, such reduction is not always possible (see Figure 2).|$|E
30|$|Retractable, <b>collapsable,</b> and recursively {{contractible}} complexes {{are examined}} in this article. Two leader election algorithms are presented. The Nowakowski and Rival theorem on the fixed edge property in an infinite tree for simplicial maps is extended to a class of infinite complexes.|$|E
30|$|The ≤ 2 -complex in the Figure 4 {{contains}} eight 2 -simplices: { 126 }, { 146 }, { 256 }, { 456 }, { 145 }, { 134 }, { 135 }, { 235 }. The only single 1 -simplices are: { 12 }, { 23 }, { 34 }. We need four {{copies of}} this complex taken in pairs for each we glue the thick 1 -simplices { 23 }, { 34 } to obtain two <b>collapsable</b> complexes. Each {{of them has}} two single 1 -simplices { 12 } and its copy) with common vertex: a star. We glue them again along these stars. The intersection is a star and the complex obtained is *-recursively contractible but not <b>collapsable.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{construct}} a complex as {{the union of}} two copies of the ≤ 2 -complex presented on the Figure 5. In this case the copies differ by one vertex (the first copy has six vertices, the other has seven vertices: we add the vertex I here and, respectively, triangulate the simplex { 126 } onto {I 16 } and {I 26 }, adding the 1 -simplex {I 6 }). We identify respective pairs of vertices 2, 3, 4, and the vertex 1 from first copy with the vertex I from the other copy. The obtained complex is still <b>collapsable</b> but has only one single 1 -simplex { 1 I}.|$|E
40|$|A unique field instrument, {{called the}} PARABOLA, a <b>collapsable</b> support boom, which is self {{contained}} and easily transportable to remote sites {{to enable the}} acquisition of radiance data for almost the complete (4 pi) sky and ground-looking hemispheres in only 11 seconds was designed. The PARABOLA samples in 15 deg {{instantaneous field of view}} sectors in three narrow bandpass spectral channels simultaneously. Field measurement on a variety of earth surface cover types using a truck boom, a specially designed pickup truck mounting system, and a hot air balloon were studied. The PARABOLA instrument has potential for climatological and other studies which require characterization of the distribution of diffuse solar radiation within the sky hemisphere...|$|E

40|$|Background: The RCP is a 14 French <b>collapsable</b> {{percutaneous}} cardiovascular {{support device}} positioned in the descending {{part of the}} thoracic aorta via the femoral artery. A 10 patient first in man study demonstrated device safety and significant improvement in renal function among high risk PCI patients. We now report haemodynamic and renal efficacy in patients with ADHF. Methods: Prospective non randomised study seeking to recruit 20 patients with ADHF with a need for inotropic or mechanical circulatory support with: i) EF < 30 % ii) Cardiac index(CI) < 2. 2 L / min / m 2 Outcome measures included: 1) Cardiac index (CI) 2) Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure (PCWP) 3) Urine output / serum creatinine 4) Vascular / device complications 5) 30 day mortalityResults: INTERIM ANALYSIS (n= 12) The {{mean age of the}} study group was 64 years, with a mean baseline creatinine of 193 umol/L, eGFR 38 ml/min. The intended RCP treatment period was 24 hours. During RCP treatment there was a significant mean reduction of PCWP at 4 hours of 17 % (25 to 21 mmHg p= 0. 04). Mean CI increased at 12 hours by 11 %, though not reaching significance (1. 78 to 1. 96 L/min/m 2 p= 0. 08). RCP insertion prompted substantial diuresis. Urine output tripled over the first 12 hours compared to baseline (55 ml/hr vs 213 ml/hr p= 0. 03). This was associated with significantly improved renal function, a 28 % reduction in serum creatinine at 12 hours (193 to 151 umol/L p= 0. 003), and a increase in eGFR from 38 ml/min to 50 ml/min (p= 0. 0007). 2 patients previously refused cardiac transplantation were reassessed and successfully transplanted within 9 months of RCP treatment on the basis of demonstrable renal reversibility. There were no vascular or device complications. There were 2 deaths at 30 days, one from multi-organ failure and sepsis, and one from intractable heart failure - neither were device related. Conclusion: RCP support in ADHF patients was associated with improved haemodynamics, and an improvement in renal function. The Reitan Catheter Pump may have a role in providing percutaneous cardiovascular and renal support in the acutely decompensated cardiac patient, and may have a role in suggesting renal reversibility in potential cardiac transplant patients. Further data will be reported at recruitment completion...|$|E
