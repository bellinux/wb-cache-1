When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F.

It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax".

Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the <b>circular</b> <b>die.</b> The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.

40|$|Rubber pads can be {{employed}} to cut or form sheet metals when acted upon by high pressures in conjunction with suitable tooling. This phenomenon has been incorporated into a production technique known as the Guerin process. It is advantageous in that the manufacturing of the closely mating conventional steel punch and dies can be eliminated, resulting in exceptional press work economies. However, its application has been limited {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the process variables. This thesis analyzes the effects of the rubber characteristics and tool geometry upon the punching of circular holes in aluminum sheet by confined rubber press pads. A Hydrostatic Shear Theory was developed to predict the pressure necessary for punching. Seven rubber compounds were physically tested to obtain bases of comparison for analyzing their punching performances. Four diameters of <b>circular</b> <b>dies</b> were used in conjunction with one type of aluminum sheet to study the punching behaviour of each of the rubbers. Experimental results show that punching occurs in two stages of fracture - primary and secondary. For a given tool geometry the criteria for the initiation of primary fracture is a critical volume rubber displacement. Modified empirical equations are derived from the Hydrostatic Shear Theory relating the experimental primary fracture pressure to tool geometry, material resistance, and rubber stiffness as determined compression - deflection tests. The press pad thickness and rate of loading are also found to influence primary fracture. Secondary fracture appears to depend upon the depth of die employed. The effects of lubrication and lamination of the press pads are briefly explored tor both primary and secondary fracture.

40|$|Convective drying of {{wastewater}} sludges and sawdust/sludge mixtures was studied. The {{first part}} of this work was an experimental study performed in a cross-flow convective dryer using 500 g of wet material extruded through a disk with <b>circular</b> <b>dies</b> of 12 mm. The results showed that the sawdust addition has a positive impact on the drying process from a mass ratio of 2 / 8, on a dry basis, with observed drying rates higher than the original sludge. The second part of this work consisted of developing a drying model in order to identify the internal diffusion coefficient and convective mass transfer coefficient from the experimental data. A comparison was made between fitted drying curves, well represented by the Newton’s model, and the analytical solutions of the diffusion equation applied to a finite cylinder. Variations of dimensional characteristics such as the volume and exchange surface of the sample bed were obtained by X-ray tomography. This technique allowed confirm that shrinkage, which is an important phenomenon occurring during sludge and sawdust/mixture drying, must be taken into account. The results showed that both the internal diffusion coefficient and convective mass transfer coefficient were affected by mixing and sawdust addition. The internal diffusion coefficient changed from 7. 77 × 10 - 9 m 2 /s for the original sludge to 7. 01 × 10 - 9 m 2 /s for the mixed sludge and then increased to 8. 35 × 10 - 9 m 2 /s for the mixture of a mass ratio of 4 / 6. The convective mass transfer coefficient changed from 9. 70 × 10 - 8 m/s for the original sludge to 8. 67 × 10 - 8 m/s for the mixed sludge and then increased to 12. 09 × 10 - 8 m/s for the mixture of a mass ratio of 4 / 6. These results confirmed that sawdust addition was beneficial to the sludge drying process as the mass transfer efficiency between the air and material increased. Reinforcing the texture of sludge by adding sawdust can increase the drying rate and decrease the drying time, and then the heat energy supply will be reduced significantly. The study also showed that neglecting shrinkage phenomenon resulted in an overestimation for the internal diffusion coefficient for the convective drying of sludges and sawdust/sludge mixtures.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Obvious {{viscoelastic}} phenomena, such as die-swell and exit-pressure losses, appear when a viscoelastic fluid {{leaves a}} die. It is generally {{believed that the}} die-swell ratio (B), the melt shear modulus (G), and the exit-pressure drop (Pex) are important parameters for the characterization of the elastic behavior of viscoelastic fluids during die flow. There may be, therefore, some interrelations between them. In the present article, relationships among G, B, and Pex are discussed. On the basis of previous work, some expressions for describing relationships between B and G,Pex, and B, as well as Pex and G during flow of viscoelastic fluids in a long <b>circular</b> <b>die</b> are proposed. The values of G are estimated from the measured B during extrusion of a carbon black and calcium carbonate-filled rubber compound, and predictions of G by using the measured data of Pex are compared with its calculations from the B data during capillary extrusion of a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) melt. The results showed that G increases linearly with increasing shear stress. Furthermore, a good agreement was obtained among these theoretical calculations of G at high shear stress level, also being consistent with predictions by using the Bagley–Duffey equation.

Incorporating freezing as a pre-treatment of drying in tekwan production was a beneficial step in conventional method but not in extrusion cooking. Recooked tekwan produced from the combination of 55 % extrusion moisture, 100 and 150 rpm screw speed with a thickness of 10 mm had a texture profile closer to the fresh sample (extrudates) and fresh tekwan sample from the conventional method.

40|$|Advanced High Strength Steels (AHSS) are {{becoming}} increasingly popular in automotive design because of possible weight savings due to the high strength. However, traditional methods are not capable of predicting fracture in AHSS, leading to expensive redesign due to poor prediction of stamping and crash worthiness. Many scenarios in which fracture is a concern in automotive applications {{are in the range}} of quasi-static through intermediate strain rates (up to 850 /s). Studies with high-speed hydraulic equipment and Hopkinson bars have shown that there is a dependence of fracture on strain rate, and that it may be a complex relationship. Recent work on quasi-static fracture has shown that the dependence of ductility on the stress triaxiality and Lode parameter must be accounted for, but this dependence has not been investigated in the dynamic range. The aim of the current thesis is to contribute a new methodology based on an instrumented drop tower that will allow for testing of ductility for low to intermediate strain rates over stress triaxialities ranging from one third to two thirds. The methodology begins with a very in-depth understanding of plasticity based on multi-axial experiments, continues with qusistatic punching experiments, and finishes with dynamic punching experiments. In the punching experiments, a thin sheet is clamped into a <b>circular</b> <b>die</b> and loaded in membrane tension through out-of-plane punching. The state of stress is changed from equi-biaxial to approximately uniaxial through the introduction of cutouts in the sides the membrane specimen. (cont.) The quasistatic punching experiments are verified against a multi-axial fracture testing technique previously demonstrated by other researchers. From application of the aforementioned methodology to a steels used in sheet metal forming and crash worthiness, the current thesis has shed insight into the dependence of ductility on stress triaxiality, Lode parameter, and strain rate for quasi-static to intermediate strain rates. by Carey Leroy Walters.

40|$|In some powder {{metallurgy}} part forming, when high compacting loads {{would require a}} too large single shrink fitted die, or the inner die diameter is very large but the compaction area is modest, twice shrink fitted dies, which are relatively expensive and complex to build, should be used. In both cases, at any given compacting load, the design should minimise dimensions and stresses. The design targets are minimum die size, optimum intermediate diameter and optimum interference, with maximum stresses on each die item lower than those allowable for the selected materials. In dual mode, for fixed overall dimension, intermediate diameters and shrink fitting interference should enable to maximise the compacting load without exceeding the allowable maximum stresses. In {{the first part of}} this work, for cylindrical shapes (<b>circular</b> profile <b>dies)</b> and axisymmetric plane stress problems, dimensions, interferences and stress–strain states have been analytically calculated to optimise doubly shrink fitted dies in the abovementioned sense. In the second part, the same evaluations for axisymmetric generic problems have been carried out by finite element method (FEM) approach integrated in an optimisation procedure. The minimum overall dimensions of the die are presented as a function of the ratio between applied load and maximum allowable stress. Corresponding interferences and optimum diameters have been calculated. Some approximate equations for a quick and handy optimisation are presented. The differences between analytical and numerical results obviously depend on the consideration of the actually stressed length, or compact height, and total die height. The comparison indicates that FEM analyses are needed since analytical calculations generally give low approximations, especially for some die geometries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thanks {{to the low}} weight, {{magnesium}} alloys feature high {{specific strength}} and stiffness properties. Thus they prove to be promising materials for todays ambitious automotive light weight construction efforts. Due to their comparative low formability at room temperature the process of magnesium sheet hydroforming can be improved at temperatures higher than 200 °C by the activation of additional sliding planes. This paper illustrates the determination of mechanical properties for the hydroforming of magnesium sheets at elevated temperature. In particular the mechanical behavior at elevated temperature was investigated {{by means of the}} tensile test and of the hydraulic bulge test. For the determination of the strains an optical measurement system was introduced into the experimental set-up. The exact knowledge of the strain condition in the area of diffuse necking enabled the determination of the flow curve in the tensile test also beyond the uniform elongation. The influence of temperature and strain rate was analyzed as well as the influence of uni- and biaxial stress state on the flow curve. Using <b>circular</b> and elliptic <b>dies</b> with different aspect ratio the hydraulic bulge test served to determinate the forming limit curves at three different elevated temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Annual {{production}} {{of sewage sludge}} in Europe is estimated at more than eleven million tons of dry matter content [1]. Use in agriculture and incineration are the main ways of valorization. In this context, drying of residual sludge appears as an essential step after mechanical dewatering. It reduces the costs of storage, transport and allows the sludge stabilization. However, this process is highly energy consuming and {{still needs to be}} optimized as it constitutes an important economic and environmental issue [2]. Polymers are usually employed in the conditioning step in order to promote particle aggregation, making the dewatering easier. The past decades, the application of pre-hydrolized polyaluminium chlorides (PACls) as coagulant has increased, particularly in China, Japan, Russia and Western Europe [3]. As a consequence, PACls are extensively investigated for their coagulation performance, characterization and speciation [3]. In this work, the influence of Polyaluminium chloride (PAX- 14) co-conditioning with linear polyelectrolytes on sludge dewatering and drying performances was investigated. Experiments were conducted on activated sludge samples collected after thickening from the wastewater treatment plant of the Grosses- Battes (Belgium). Two cationic polymers were tested, each of them in combination with PAX for sludge flocculation prior to mechanical dewatering and their effects on sludge convective drying. The one referenced as 640 LH was a linear polymer with a low molecular weight, whereas the 640 CT was a linear one with a high molecular weight. After conditioning, the dewatering step was realized by using a normalized filtration-expression cell (AFNOR 1979) under 5 bar of pressure. Then, the specific resistance to filtration was determined from the follow-up of filtrate mass with time, using the Carman-Kozeny equation [4]. Figure 1 shows the experimental design. For convective drying experiments, the cake recovered after filtration was extruded through a <b>circular</b> <b>die</b> of 14 mm diameter and cut at a height of 14 mm, yielding cylindrical samples with mass of approximately 2. 5 g, as used in several industrial belt dryers. Individual extrudates have been dried in a specially designed convective micro-dryer. Results reported in this paper were obtained with the following operating conditions: air temperature of 130 °C, at ambient humidity (absolute humidity ~ 0. 005 kgwater/ kgdry air) and a superficial velocity of 1 m/ s. Results show that, the dry solids content of the dewatering cake increases with increasing Polyaluminium chloride dosage for both series of experiments. It supposes that PAX contributed to improve solids capture, depicted on Fig. 2. Concerning drying, it appeared that the samples treated by the dual PAX/ polymers combination showed higher drying rates than samples conditioned by polymer without PAX addition, allowing a reduction of the drying time (see Fig. 3). Table 1 shows the drying characteristics of the samples. The drying time decreases and the average drying rate increases with the dual conditioners addition, while the initial water content decreases as well as the total amount water to be removed.

40|$|Renewable {{cellulose}} nanofibrils (CNFs) and chitin nanofibrils (ChNFs) {{are very}} attractive bionanoparticles {{due to their}} outstanding properties such as remarkable mechanical properties, flexible surface functionalities, thermostability, barrier properties, large surface area, biocompatibility and for their global availability from renewable resources and food waste. Nowadays, the research concerning materials based on CNFs and ChNFs {{is still in its}} infancy. This thesis deals with fundamental and groundbreaking research regarding CNF- and ChNF-based materials (fibers, hollow fibers and scaffolds) in connection with additive manufacturing techniques. The merging of defined nanoscale building blocks with advanced additive manufacturing techniques is of eminent importance for the preparation of multiscale and highly functional materials with de-novo designed architectures. In terms of mechanical properties, one major bottleneck to maximize those of materials based on CNFs and ChNFs (e. g. nanopapers and macroscale fibers) is to find pathways to control their direction of alignment and understand how preferred alignment correlates with macroscale mechanical properties. In this context, I processed CNF and ChNF dispersions into high-performance macroscopic fibers using much more environmentally friendly routes compared to the established processes to produce cellulose- and chitin-based macrofibers. In chapter 2, I show that strain-rate controlled wet-stretching of rehydrated macroscale fibers composed of CNFs and ChNFs induces a high degree of orientation and also that the degree of alignment scales with macroscale mechanical stiffness. I find similar degrees of alignment in both types of nanofibril-based macrofibers, yet substantially different macroscale stiffness, with the CNF-based fibers (ECNF = 33 GPa) outperforming the ChNF-based ones (EChNF = 12 GPa) considerably. These differences can be correlated to the mechanical properties of the underlying cellulose I and α-chitin crystals and the degree of crystallinity of the nanofibrils, which both govern the stiffness of an individual nanofibril. This study likely demonstrates the maximum performance in terms of stiffness of materials prepared by CNFs and ChNFs and reveals a critical difference in the performance of both classes of bionanoparticles. Beyond mechanical properties, I explored the capabilities of CNFs and ChNFs in the field of tissue engineering by fabricating scaffolds with potential applications as temporal supports during the regeneration of bone tissue. This study is shown in chapter 3. The development of hierarchically ordered materials having designed porosities from the macro to nanoscales remains very challenging in material science and engineering. Such materials are essential {{to a wide range of}} technologies, in particular for tissue engineering, where producing hydrogel scaffolds with multi-scale topographies potentially allows the instruction of cellular behavior to target the organization of tissues. To address these issues, I developed a simple inverse templating strategy that enables the preparation of nanofibrillar hydrogel scaffolds with defined porosities in the macro- and nanoscale. First, together with the Wessling group (DWI), we designed a lithographic process that furnishes sacrificial gyroid scaffolds, based on a resin that degrades in alkaline media. After infiltration with hydrogels of highly crystalline and stiff CNFs and ChNFs, the templates were simply dissolved in mild alkaline solution, and hydrogel replicas of the templates were obtained. This simple approach represents a platform fabrication method for a range of hydrogel-based materials with de novo designed pore geometries. Subsequent cell studies in collaboration with Dr. John Hardy (presently at Lancaster University, UK) and Laura de Laporte (DWI) confirmed the biocompatibility of the CNF and ChNF-based scaffolds and revealed important differences in terms of cell attachment. Differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (HMSCs) into osteogenic outcome could be facilitated using a collagen bone mimetic coating, rendering these scaffolds interesting for bone tissue engineering. In the last study performed in this thesis (shown in chapter 4), I continued using the concept of reverse templating but this time using CNF hollow tubes as sacrificial templates to create macroscale tubular cell constructs. I demonstrate that dispersions of CNFs can be processed into complex shapes, and used as a sacrificial template to prepare freestanding cell constructs. I showcase the approach for the fabrication of hollow fibers using a controlled extrusion through a <b>circular</b> <b>die</b> into a coagulation bath. The dimensions of the hollow fibers are tunable, and the final tubes combine the nanofibrillar porosity of the CNF hydrogel with a sub-millimeter wall thickness and centimeter-scale length provided by the additive manufacturing technique. I also demonstrate that covalent and supramolecular cross-linking of the CNFs can be used to tailor the mechanical properties of the hydrogel tubes within one order of magnitude and in an attractive range for the mechanosensation of cells. The resulting tubes are highly biocompatible and allow for the growth of mouse fibroblasts into confluent cell layers in their inner lumen. A detailed screening of several cellulases enables to degrade the scaffolding, temporary CNF hydrogel tube in a quick and highly cell-friendly way, and allows the isolation of coherent cell tubes. I foresee that the growing capabilities of 3 D printing techniques in combination with the attractive features of CNFs – sustainable, globally abundant, biocompatible and enzymatically degradable – will allow to make plant-based biomaterials with hierarchical structures and on-demand degradation useful for instance to engineer complex tissue structures to replace animal models, and for implants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{method for}} joining of sheet edges was investigated. It {{makes use of}} the sheared faces under high-speed. The {{temperature}} remarkably elevates and the material softens in the thin severely deformed layer. The cut faces are contacted each other with sliding motion immediately after shearing. Sheet materials are a pure aluminum A 1050 and its alloy A 5052. Two similar sets of <b>circular</b> shearing punch, <b>die</b> and sheet are concentrically stacked in the device for performing the simultaneous shearing. The upper sheared circular sheet slides into the hole of the lower one for joining shortly after the shearing. Strain-rate order was about 104 /s in shearing, where the punches were driven by a drop-weight. Quasi-static test was also conducted for comparison. Joining was achieved only in the high-speed test. Joining boundary was not visible at the central portion in thickness, though the gap openings were seen near both sheet surfaces. Joining efficiency was evaluated as the relative strength to the tensile strength of the material. It was improved as the shearing clearance becomes smaller. The maximum efficiency was about 30 % for A 1050 material. It is about 25 % for A 5052. It was at most 10 % in the joining of A 1050 and A 5052...|$|R
