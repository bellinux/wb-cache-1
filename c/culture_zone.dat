40|$|The {{direction}} of sunshine or the installation sites of environmental control {{facilities in the}} greenhouse result in different temperature and humidity levels in the various zones of the greenhouse, and thus, the production quality of crop is inconsistent. This study proposed a wireless-networked decentralized fuzzy control scheme to regulate the environmental parameters of various <b>culture</b> <b>zones</b> within a greenhouse. The proposed scheme can create different environmental conditions for cultivating different crops in various zones and achieve diversification or standardization of crop production. A star-type wireless sensor network is utilized {{to communicate with each}} sensing node, actuator node, and control node in various zones within the greenhouse. The fuzzy rule-based inference system is used to regulate the environmental parameters for temperature and humidity based on real-time data of plant growth response provided by a growth stage selector. The growth stage selector defines the control ranges of temperature and humidity of the various <b>culture</b> <b>zones</b> according to the leaf area of the plant, the number of leaves, and the cumulative amount of light. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is stable and robust and provides basis for future greenhouse applications...|$|R

40|$|Green-lipped mussels (Perna viridis) were {{collected}} from seven fish <b>culture</b> <b>zones</b> (FCZs) in Hong Kong and analyzed for okadaic acid (OA). A conventional HPLC method was modified by incorporating a proteinase K digestion step. Results suggest that a higher recovery (2. 5 times higher) of OA was obtained from spiked samples after the addition of 1. 08 mg proteinase K in comparison with samples incubated without the proteolytic enzyme. For the hepatopancreas (HP) of individual field-collected mussels, the additional digestion step can enhance OA extraction by 3. 1 times. Spatial and temporal variations in OA concentrations in the mussels from various FCZs were investigated. The highest concentration of OA in mussel HP samples was 1164. 9 ng/g HP wet wt. With respect to OA concentrations in whole mussel tissues from seven sites and four seasonal samplings, the concentrations were between 70. 0 and 131. 0 ng/g wet wt., which did not exceed the generally recognized international regulatory criteria (> 200 ng/g) for OA. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{apparently}} increasing {{trend of}} red tide occurrences and/or harmful algal blooms {{has become a}} global issue, particularly in coastal zones with 'cultural eutrophication', but no effective measures have been developed yet for detection and early warning, {{in order to prevent}} public health problems and the threat of economic losses. A multiple-probe-and-sensor based telemetry system has been developed to monitor water quality parameters, hydrographic variables and meteorological conditions, in order to provide almost real time and continuous data for red tide studies. Several red tides have been detected with the system during the study period and this suggests that it potentially fulfills the purposes of detection and early warning. However, there is still room to improve, upgrade and develop further this prototype system to apply it widely to coastal regions, particularly fish <b>culture</b> <b>zones</b> in which red tides occur frequently and intensively. Real-time telemetric data can provide background information concerning red tide formation conditions, and can be extended to bio-ecological studies so as to enhance our understanding of the interactions between red tides and marine microalgal dynamics, by overcoming the limitations of the traditional approaches. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Serratia ficaria {{was first}} {{described}} in 1979 as a Gram-negative facultative anaerobic rod. S. ficaria {{was found in}} figs, but also isolated from human specimens in a few cases. We now report an isolate of S. ficaria from sputum specimen. A 46 -year-old man was suffering from a chronic renal failure of five years, four months of peritoneal dialysis and one week of fever due to respiratory tract infection, accompanied by cough. Sputum culture yielded a Gram-negative rod. It was identified as S. ficaria and the antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by automated Vitek II (bioMerieux). The tested S. ficaria strain was susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, cefepime, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, imipenem, meropenem, tigecycline and ciprofloxacin. This strain was resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cephalothin, cefoxitine, cefuroxime and ceftriaxone. The patient was treated successfully (80 mg trimethoprim/ 400 mg sulfamethoxazole twice daily for 7 days) S. ficaria is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for intestinal colonization or serious infections such as septicaemia, gall bladder empyema in immunocompromised patients. The fig tree and fig {{play an important role}} in human colonization. It should be remembered that S. ficaria infections may be encountered frequently especially in fig tree <b>culture</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R
