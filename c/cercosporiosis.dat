The articles are {{the first in a series}} on the disease, which is pandemic in every continent. One of INIBAP's main objectives is to stamp out black <b>cercosporiosis</b> by providing producers with resistant cultivars. A bibliography on the subject, sponsored by CTA and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), has been compiled by the documentation services of the Institut de Recherches sur les Fruits et. Agrumes (IRFA) (Fruit and Citrus Research Institute) and the Union of Banana Exporting Countries and has been included in the issue.

40|$|Severe {{defoliation}} {{of olive}} trees {{due to the}} fungus Mycocentrospora cladosporioides (Sacc.) P. Costa ex Deighton, the causal agent of <b>cercosporiosis,</b> has been observed in Apulia (southern Italy) {{during the last three}} years. Although old mature leaves are primarily affected by the fungus, attacks to younger, 4 - to 5 -month-old leaves, have also been found. Trials aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of different control schedules by using copper oxychloride are in progress. Preliminary results indicate that in cv Leccino four treatments (February, April, end of August and late September) are required to effectively reduce the disease. <b>Cercosporiosis</b> attacks on olive drupes (cvs Coratina, Leccino, and Frantoio) in young and intensive groves were also recorded. Disease symptoms on the fruits varied according to the cultivar and ripening stage...|$|E
40|$|Olive tree <b>cercosporiosis,</b> due to Mycocentrospora cladosporioides (Sacc.) P. Costa ex Deighton, is described, {{focusing}} {{the attention}} on {{recent advances in}} {{the knowledge of the}} biology and control. Usually, M. cladosporioides is responsible for severe defoliation of olive trees, but fruits can also be attacked. Contrary to the current belief that only mature leaves are affected by the fungus, attacks have also been observed in 5 to 6 month-old leaves. Moreover, slight differences have been observed in symptoms shown by fruits of cvs Frantoio and Coratina; the ones of Coratina, especially the ripe ones, exhibited a yellow halo around the sunken, dark-brown lesions, which was absent or barely visible in the drupes of cv Frantoio. No specific control measures are recommended and the two copper fungicides treatments usually applied against olive scab are considered effective for disease control. However, results of control trials demonstrate that they are not enough to effectively reduce <b>cercosporiosis,</b> thus suggesting that a different control schedule is necessary, mainly when climatic conditions favour the diseas...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the relative susceptibility of new cultivars to the main diseases of a crop is a key point to consider prior to their release to the nursery industry. This study provides a rigorous characterization of the resistance of 15 new olive cultivars and their genitors (‘Arbequina,’ ‘Frantoio,’ and ‘Picual’) to the three main aerial diseases, peacock spot, anthracnose, and <b>cercosporiosis</b> caused by Spilocaea oleagina, Colletotrichum acutatum, and Pseudocercospora cladosporioides, respectively. To do so, developing leaves and detached green-yellowish fruit were inoculated in laboratory tests with S. oleagina and C. acutatum, respectively, using conidial suspensions of both pathogens. Additionally, a previously validated rating scale {{was used to assess}} the incidence of leaves with symptoms of S. oleagina or P. cladosporioides and the fruit rot incidence of C. acutatum in the trees for four years under field conditions. As a result, only two of the cultivars were susceptible to peacock spot, most likely because these new cultivars were previously screened for resistance to the disease on previous phases of the breeding program. Conversely, the 15 cultivars were susceptible or moderately susceptible to <b>cercosporiosis.</b> Five of the 15 new cultivars were classified as resistant to anthracnose, with four of them descendants of ‘Frantoio’ × ‘Picual’ crosses. In addition, the cultivars resistance to C. acutatum showed a negative linear correlation with the total phenols content of olive oil. This information regarding disease reaction of the new olive cultivars is essential for nursery industry and growers. This research was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (project AGL 2004 - 7495 co-financed by the European Union FEDER Funds) and by the Andalusia Regional Government (project P 08 -AGR- 03635).

40|$|Olive {{as other}} woody {{perennial}} crops {{can be affected}} by several systemic pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and several vector-borne viruses. The most important olive diseases, caused by different pathogens, are described in this text. Pathogen biology, diagnostic technique and control strategies are reported for each disease. The main and widespread bacterial disease, caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi, is the olive knot. As concerns {{the most important and}} widespread fungal diseases, in this text are described the olive leaf spot, Verticillum wilt, <b>cercosporiosis,</b> anthracnose, fruit rot, parasitic brusca, root rot, sooty mold and wood rot. Infections caused by viruses are generally symptomless and do not result in diseased plants. Although, viruses do not cause detrimental disease on olive varieties, the infected olive trees represent a reservoir of virus inoculum for other crops, where these viruses are known to cause severe disease. Detection of these viruses represent an important critical step in the sanitary improvement of this crop. Recently, molecularbased assays have been effectively implemented to detect at least 8 of the 15 viruses known to infect this crop. Sanitation program using in vitro culture of shoot tip and thermotherapy have been recently described to recover virus-free plantlets.

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar, em cafeeiro suscetível, a proteção contra a cercosporiose, pela aplicação da proteína harpina e acibenzolar-S-metil (ASM), e avaliar seu efeito na germinação de conídios e crescimento micelial {{in vitro}}. No primeiro experimento, cafeeiros tratados com ASM (25, 50, 100, 200 &# 956;g mL- 1) receberam o inóculo de uma suspensão de conídios de Cercospora coffeicola, e a severidade da doença foi avaliada aos 30 e 60 dias após a inoculação. No segundo experimento, cafeeiros foram aspergidos com harpina (7, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 &# 956;g mL- 1), tendo-se utilizado o mesmo procedimento. No terceiro experimento, plantas aspergidas previamente com ASM (200 &# 956;g mL- 1) ou harpina (15 &# 956;g mL- 1) foram tratadas novamente com esses produtos, aos 30 dias após terem recebido inóculo do patógeno. ASM e harpina protegeram os cafeeiros contra cercosporiose 30 dias após a inoculação com C. coffeicola. Entretanto, 60 dias após a inoculação, apenas o ASM (200 &# 956;g mL- 1), com uma ou duas aplicações, protegeu as plantas contra C. coffeicola. Os cafeeiros foram protegidos contra cercosporiose, em reaplicação de harpina, 30 dias após o primeiro tratamento com essa proteína. Harpina e acibenzolar-S-metil não inibiram o desenvolvimento micelial nem a germinação in vitro dos conídios do patógeno. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the protective effect of harpin protein and acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) against brown eye spot, in coffee plants, {{and its effect on}} in vitro conidial germination and mycelial growth of Cercospora coffeicola. In the first assay, plants treated with ASM (25, 50, 100, 200 &# 956;g mL- 1) received the inoculum of a C. coffeicola conidial suspension, and the disease severity was evaluated 30 and 60 days after inoculation. In the second assay, plants were sprayed with harpin (7. 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 &# 956;g mL- 1) following the same procedure. In a third trial, plants previously sprayed with ASM (200 &# 956;g mL- 1) or harpin (15 &# 956;g mL- 1) were treated again with these products 30 days after pathogen inoculation. ASM and harpin protected the coffe plants against brown eye spot 30 days after inoculation with C. coffeicola. However, 60 days after inoculation, only ASM (200 &# 956;g mL- 1), with one or two applications, conferred protection to plants against C. coffeicola. Coffee plants were protected against <b>cercosporiosis,</b> when harpin was reapplied on plants 30 days after a previous treatment with this protein. Harpin and acibenzolar-S-methyl did not inhibit the in vitro conidial germination and the mycelial growth of the pathogen...|$|E
