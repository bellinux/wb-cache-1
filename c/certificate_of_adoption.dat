5000|$|Closed {{adoption}} (also called [...] "confidential" [...] {{adoption and}} sometimes [...] "secret" [...] adoption) {{is a process}} by which an infant is adopted by another family, and {{the record of the}} biological parent(s) is kept sealed. Often, the biological father is not recorded—even on the original birth <b>certificate.</b> An <b>adoption</b> <b>of</b> an older child who already knows his or her biological parent(s) cannot be made closed or secret. This used to be the most traditional and popular type <b>of</b> <b>adoption,</b> peaking in the decades of the post-World War II Baby Scoop Era. It still exists today, but it exists alongside the practice <b>of</b> open <b>adoption.</b> The sealed records effectively prevent the adoptee and the biological parents from finding, or even knowing anything about each other (especially {{in the days before the}} Internet). The International Association of Adopted People does not support any form <b>of</b> closed <b>adoption</b> as it is detrimental to the psychological well being of the adopted child. However, the emergence of non-profit organizations and private companies to assist individuals with their sealed records has been effective in helping people who want to connect with biological relatives to do so.|$|R

40|$|Using a rich panel dataset of SMEs {{active in}} the {{manufacturing}} sector in Viet Nam, this paper investigates the drivers of firm productivity, focusing on {{the role played by}} international management standards certification. We develop and test the hypothesis that, controlling for technological innovation (product and process) and other variables related to technological capabilities, international standards are still conducive to higher productivity, through improved management practices associated with their adoption. In line with the requirement of continuous improvement implied by most international standards, the main findings show that the possession of an internationally recognized standard certificate leads to significant productivity premium. We further investigate the relationship between technological innovation and standard adoption. We find that the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>adoption</b> is higher when firms implement technological innovations and that the effect of certification on productivity is particularly strong for firms with technological innovation...|$|R
