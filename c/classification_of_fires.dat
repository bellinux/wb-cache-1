40|$|Abstract. Fire {{regimes are}} {{shifting}} worldwide because of global changes. The relative contribution of climate, topography and vegetation greatly determines {{spatial and temporal}} variations in fire regimes, but the interplay of these factors is not yet well understood. We introduce here a novel <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> according to dominant fire spread pattern, an approach considered in operational firefighting, to help understand regional-scale spatial variability in fire regimes. Here, we studied whether climate, topography and fuel variables allowed the prediction of occurrences from different fire spread patterns in Catalonia, NE Spain. We used a correlative modelling approach based on maximum entropy methods, and examined, through variation partitioning, the relative contribution of different factors on determining their occurrence. Our results accurately predicted the occurrence of different fire spread patterns, {{and the results were}} consistent when temporal validation was conducted. Although forest fuel factors made a higher contribution to the occurrence of convective fires, wind-driven fires were strongly related to topographic and climate factors. These findings may have a strong impact on investigations into how fire regimes may be projected into the future under forecast global change as they suggest that future environmental changes may affect different fire spread patterns in an idiosyncratic manner...|$|E

Nevertheless, for most ecosystems, this system works fine. The framework used by Wade and colleagues in this chapter is applied to ecosystems beyond the western US.

Many examples are available to describe how fire affects the functioning of ecosystems, such as influencing plant succession, fuel accumulations, structure and composition of vegetation, insect and disease populations, nutrient cycling, productivity, diversity, and habitats for wildlife.

The problem is that fire severity maps are commonly developed from satellite imagery {{that is difficult to}} use for planning wildfire responses before a fire has actually happened and can’t be used for real-time wildfire management because of the timing of the imagery delivery. Moreover, imagery is difficult to use for controlled fires such as prescribed burning. This study, called FIRESEV (FIRE SEVerity Mapping Tools) created a comprehensive set of tools and protocols to deliver, create, and evaluate fire severity maps for all phases <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> management. The first tool is a Severe Fire Potential Map (SFPM) that quantifies the potential for fires to burn with high severity, should they occur, for any 30 m x 30 m piece of ground across the western United States. This map was developed using empirical models that related topographic, vegetation, and fire weather variables to burn severity as mapped using the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) digital products. This SFPM map is currently available on the Fire Research and Management Exchange System (FRAMES, [URL] web site and can be used to plan for future wildfires or for managing wildfires in real time, e. g. by including it as a layer in Wildland Fire Decision Support System or other GIS analysis. The next tool was the inclusion <b>of</b> a <b>fire</b> severity mapping algorithm in the Wildland Fire Assessment Tool (WFAT) developed by the National Interagency Fuels Technology Transfer (NIFTT) team.

Because <b>of</b> flickering and random characteristics <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> these features are powerful discriminants. The behavioral change of {{each one of these}} features is evaluated, and the results are then combined according to the Bayes classi-fier for robust fire recognition. In addition, a priori knowledge <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> events captured in videos is used to significantly improve the classification results. For edited newscast videos, the fire region is usually located {{in the center of the}} frames. This fact is used to model the probability <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> as a function of the position. Experiments illustrated the applicability of the method.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a hybrid}} approach in data mining {{to predict the}} size <b>of</b> forest <b>fire</b> using meteorological and forest weather index (FWI) variables such as Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), temperature, Relative Humidity (RH), wind and rain. The hybrid model is developed with clustering and classification approaches. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is used to cluster the historical variables. The clustered data are then used as inputs to Back-Propagation Neural Network classification. The label dataset having value greater than zero in fire area size are clustered using FCM to produce two categorical clusters,i. e. :Light Burn, and Heavy Burn for its label. On the other hand, fire area label with value zero is clustered as No Burn Area. A Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is trained based on these data to classify the output (burn area) in three categories, No Burn Area, Light Burn and Heavy Burn. The experiment shows promising results depicting <b>classification</b> size <b>of</b> forest <b>fire</b> with the accuracy of confusion matrix around 97, 50...|$|R

The changes in the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> ignitable liquids are presented in this review. Furthermore, a new standard on extraction <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> debris with solid phase microextraction (SPME) was released. Advantages and drawbacks of this technique are presented and discussed. Also, the standard on cleanup by acid stripping has not been reapproved. Fire debris analysts that use the standards {{should be aware of}} these changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{reliable}} electronic nose system designed from {{the combination of}} various semi-conductor metal oxide gas sensors (MOGS) {{is applied to the}} detection <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> resulting from various sources in a kitchen. The time series sig-nals obtained from the same source <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> are highly correlated, and different sources <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> exhibit unique patterns in the time series data. Therefore, the error back-propagation (BP) method can be effectively used for the <b>classification</b> <b>of</b> the tested smell. The accuracy of 99. 6 % is achieved by using only a single training data set from each source <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> The accuracy achieved with the k-means algorithm is 98. 3 %, which also shows the high ability of the EN in detecting the early stage <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> from various sources.

40|$|Given the {{stochastic}} nature <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> {{ignition and}} spread, a modeling approach {{is needed to}} estimate the range <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> effects possible on current and future landscapes. We are developing a nationwide Fire Scenario Builder (FSB) that creates self-consistent, spatially explicit U. S. prescribed and wildland fire scenarios for use in modeling both current and projected fire effects, including fire emissions. The FSB creates stochastic fire location and size scenarios {{that are consistent with}} known weather, vegetation, and land management controls on fire ignition and spread. At its core, the FSB is based on a coarse-scale <b>classification</b> and quantification <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> regimes and tunable land management strategies. Fire regime attributes are created from reconstructed fire history, historical fire records, and potential natural vegetation. The FSB also utilizes weather and climate information from global climate model output. The climate projections used in this effort are those from the NCAR Climate Systems Model which contains the CCM 3 atmospheric model at T 42 resolution, but the FS B methodology is not limited to a particular model or resolution. The FSB utilizes in parallel known statistical relationships between climate, vegetation, and fire to create fire-ignition probabilities and a probability distribution <b>of</b> estimated <b>fire</b> sizes. The FSB is still under development, but we present initial results from forecasts for 1996 - 2000 and 2046 - 2050 based on initial vegetation, lightning, and relative humidity relationships. Future work will utilize dynamical downscaling of the GCM output using the MM 5 mesoscale model to increase spatial resolution and adapt the FSB to application at multiple spatial scales...|$|R
