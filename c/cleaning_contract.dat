40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} contract design on the enforceabil-ity of quality in outsourced public contracts. Using a four-year panel data of 102 <b>cleaning</b> <b>contracts,</b> {{our findings suggest that}} quality enforcement highly depends on the ex ante contracting process. Moreover, since those quality improvements are not accompanied by prices increases, our results suggest that public contract managers have significant leeways to reduce rent-seeking behaviors for standard transactions. Such findings are in line with propositions from the theoretical literature on the endogenous veri-fiability of quality. They also depart from previous studies on this issue by focusing on determinants of enforcement that are left to the managers’ discretion...|$|R

5000|$|While {{throwing}} {{out a number}} of letters and deleting a bunch of emails which don't interest him, Maddox almost deletes an email from a whistle blower on a Midlands hospital. The source reports that the hospital is in poor hygiene and that health and safety is ignored, and encloses a number of photographs. Freddy prompts him that his whistle blower may be uncovered, however Maddox is adamant he won't give up the source. Carol chastises both Maddox and Freddy for their expenses related to recent stories they worked on. Maddox is handed a judgement on revealing his source for the hospital story, after missing a summons hearing after not reading the letter, with failure to give the source meaning that Maddox could go to prison. Looking to Oliver for help with a lawyer, Oliver refuses and tells him to give up the source. After leaving a lunch with Carol and Oliver, Maddox is arrested and taken to prison to share a cell with Dangerous Brian. Maddox gives up the name of the source, and then settles into a depression after release from prison. Freddy analyses footage of the source being arrested, spotting that although she is a [...] "cleaning lady", she is not what she appears.

40|$|The work {{comprises}} a {{case study}} and evaluation of the contractual procedures and management techniques attending the disposal of urban waste in a well endowed and rapidly expanding municipality in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The work is in six parts. The first part traces the evolution of Jeddah as a point on the South North Caravan route across Arabia and its importance as the gateway to the Holy Cities of Mecca and Madina. The second part outlines the development of cleaning services in the national context, {{and the evolution of}} cleaning services in Jeddah. The third part offers {{a detailed description of the}} operational aspects of the first comprehensive <b>cleaning</b> <b>contract</b> for the City of Jeddah, and the performance specification that accompanied it. The fourth part outlines the computer mapping system established by the contractor on which the annual costing of the cleansing operation could be based. It also describes how this system was used by the Municipality in updating planning information. The fifth part analyse the different aspects of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>contract,</b> evaluates the performance of the contractor during the first five years contract, and attempts to identify the optimum way of spending money in order to provide the required service at an acceptable level of cost. Having analysed and compared the various aspects of the collection and disposal of waste in Jeddah, the writer in the sixth part concludes that Jeddah has gained many financial, administrative and environmental advantages by awarding the city cleaning operations to a private contractor through a competitive tendering process. The writer also demonstrates that the contractor's urban data base, if continually updated, could further assist the development control procedures and urban planning techniques of the Jeddah Municipality...|$|E
40|$|This {{report shows}} that some {{international}} students are being exploited and suffering {{racism in the}} workplace. Last year, almost 300, 000 people came {{from around the world}} to begin their studies in Australia. Many find they must work to support themselves and the government recognises that, allowing them to work for 40 hours a fortnight during term time. There has been little research on the working experiences of international students in Australia. This is surprising given the plethora of media reports, evidence to inquiries and investigations pursued by the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) — so many of which have found that international students are frequently exploited. In the retail cleaning industry, many international students — around half of whom are born in India — are exploited because the industry is in crisis. Barriers to entry are low, so new contractors can win business from large shopping centre owners like Westfield and Colonial First State. Having won a <b>cleaning</b> <b>contract</b> at a low price, these operators soon find the easiest route to profitability is to intensify the workloads of the cleaners they employ. This means demanding that cleaners do more work in less time, leading to extreme workloads that can impact upon the health and safety of their cleaners. Hygiene can also suffer, as cleaners are forced to take shortcuts. It can also mean cutting pay or conditions. Or contractors can seek to deliberately underpay cleaners. In some cases, they do all three. Sham contracting and ignoring workplace laws are also a significant problem. In fact, an FWO investigation into the cleaning industry in Victoria recently found that 44 per cent of audited employers were breaking workplace laws. All these problems can be intensified because of the many sub-contractors that can stand between the ultimate client — the shopping centre owner — and the cleaner. With each looking to make a profit, less and less is left for the cleaners doing the work. Shopping centre owners like Westfield also contribute to the crisis by insisting on cutting back on the value of their contracts, forcing contractors to shift an even greater burden on to cleaners. International students are left bearing the brunt of this crisis, with the majority struggling to pay even their rent. A third also worked additional time without pay, exacerbating an already difficult financial situation. Some are also asked to violate their visas, putting them at risk of deportation. This report serves to highlight the need for shopping centre owners to support reform of the retail industry and end a crisis that is putting the welfare of its workers at risk. Shopping centre cleaners themselves have been campaigning for fundamental reform of their industry, seeking an end to extreme workloads, low pay and a culture that fosters a lack of respect and, at times, discrimination. This report was jointly launched by Victorian TAFE International and United Voice...|$|E
