An unsheltered exercise yard (palaestra) also formed part of the complex. The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under-floor system connected to three furnaces. Such furnaces required several metric tons of wood each day.|$|E
5|$|One of Reich's first {{patients}} was Lore Kahn, a 19-year-old woman {{with whom he}} had an affair. Freud had warned analysts not to involve themselves with their patients, but {{in the early days of}} psychoanalysis the warnings went unheeded. According to Reich's diaries, Kahn became ill in November 1920 and died of sepsis after sleeping in a bitterly <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> she had rented as a place for her and Reich to meet (both his landlady and her parents had forbidden their meetings). Kahn's mother suspected that her daughter had died after a botched illegal abortion, possibly performed by Reich himself. According to Christopher Turner, she found some of her daughter's bloodied underwear in a cupboard.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} the Sledge Store, or Phase IV. The {{building}} was erected in 1978/79, and originally housed the science offices, <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> and travel store. It is now used mainly as the travel store or sledge store. The huge amount of mountaineering or camping equipment for use in Antarctica is maintained and stored here. The cold store remains, with four large freezers storing all the base's frozen food. It was named after Sir Vivian Fuchs, BAS Director from 1958 to 1973.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the frequency of electromagnetic radiation and the energy of each individual photon is why ultraviolet light can cause sunburn, but visible or infrared light cannot. A photon of ultraviolet light will deliver a high amount of energy– enough to contribute to cellular damage such as occurs in a sunburn. A photon of infrared light will deliver a lower amount of energy– only enough to warm one's skin. So, an infrared lamp can warm a large surface, perhaps large enough to keep people comfortable in a <b>cold</b> <b>room,</b> but it cannot give anyone a sunburn.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{contained}} {{at least}} one substantial bath house, in the north-western wing. This included the latrine, which formed an L-shape around a dressing room (apodyterium). The dressing room led to the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> (frigidarium) which contained a cold plunge bath and whose mosaic floor, decorated with a design of fish and sea creatures, is still well preserved under a modern protective building. This mosaic suggests an individual treatment of the standard sea animal and fish designs that circulated in copy books. The frigidarium had {{at least one}}, possibly two, plunge pools – {{one of these is}} now detached from the building owing to landslides.|$|E
25|$|The first {{practical}} vapour-compression {{refrigeration system}} {{was built by}} James Harrison, a British journalist who had emigrated to Australia. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 {{on the banks of}} the Barwon River at Rocky Point in Geelong, Victoria, and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated beef sales to the United Kingdom. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship Norfolk for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{the payment}} of {{indemnities}} to soldiers, former combatants received 20 francs for each month spent on the front. Prisoners received 15 francs and were not recognised as veterans. Thus, prisoners united to try to claim their rights. The Fédération Nationale des Anciens Prisonniers de Guerre included 60,000 former prisoners. One of these wrote, “Our glory is to have had, instead of citations, ribbons and stripes, the honours of the post, the hot room, the <b>cold</b> <b>room,</b> the reprisal prison”. Politically, they managed to secure several rights, notably the ability to repatriate the bodies of soldiers {{who had died in}} captivity and especially to have them benefit from the distinction Mort pour la France, which they obtained in 1922. The Sarrebourg Necropolis was dedicated to them. However, the ex-prisoners did not manage to lay hold of the 1.26 billion francs in indemnities that they had claimed.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-speed}} door is a {{very fast}} door some with opening speeds of up to 4m/s, mainly used in the industrial sector where {{the speed of a}} door has an effect on production logistics, temperature and pressure control. high-speed clean room doors are used in pharmaceutical industries for the special curtain and stainless steel frames. They guarantee the tightness of all accesses. The powerful high-speed doors have a smooth surface structure and no protruding edges. Therefore, they can be easily cleaned and depositing of particles is largely excluded. High-speed doors are made to handle a high number of openings, generally more than 200000 a year. They need to be built with heavy duty parts and counterbalance systems for speed enhancement and emergency opening function. The door curtain was originally made of PVC, but was later also developed in aluminium and acrylic glass sections. High Speed refrigeration and <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> doors with excellent insulation values was also introduced with the Green and Energy saving requirements.|$|E

500|$|Just {{outside the}} walls of the city, on the {{floodplain}} of the Oued Khoumane, was found a series of interlocking courtyard buildings, of which the largest contained a hammam, or bath. This is an L-shaped structure, with a <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> paved with flagstones and benches running along the sides. At the end is found a plunge pool with three steps leading into it. From the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> one moved to a vestibule {{at the corner of the}} building, decorated with a relief of a shield taken from the Arch of Caracalla. From there, one moved into the warm room, still covered by a vault, and finally into the hot room. The vault of this has now been restored, but it is possible to see the channels in the floor through which the hot air passed. Beyond this a furnace heated the room, as well as the hot water which would have flowed into basins in the corners. The courtyard of which this hammam formed the western limit was large, and contained numerous large silos for grain storage. To the south of this courtyard was one evidently designed for reception, with long narrow rooms to the east and west, one of which was painted red, with a low bench or divan at one end. Further south a third courtyard, only partially excavated, seems to have been devoted to domestic use. The plan, with its large courtyards and narrow rooms, is very different from the contemporary one or two-roomed structures inside the walls, probably inhabited by the Berbers of the Awraba tribe. It is dated by coins and pottery to the reign of Idris I, and has been identified as his headquarters [...]|$|E
2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I say to myself. “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{existence}} of the upper and under currents of air which mark the phenomena of the trade-winds, and of land and sea breezes, may be beautifully illustrated in two adjoining rooms, in one of which a good fire is burning, while in the other there is none. If the door between the two rooms be thrown open, the cold air will enter the heated room in a strong current, or, in other words, as a violent wind. At {{the same time the}} heated air of the warm room ascends and passes the contrary way into the <b>cold</b> <b>room,</b> at {{the upper part of the}} same doorway; while in the middle of this opening, exactly between the two currents, the air appears to have little or no motion. The best way to show this experiment is to introduce the flame of a candle into the doorway between a hot and a <b>cold</b> <b>room.</b> If the flame be held near the bottom of the doorway, where the air is most dense, it will be strongly drawn towards the heated room; and if held near the top of the door it will be drawn towards the <b>cold</b> <b>room</b> with somewhat less force; while midway between the top and bottom the flame will be scarcely disturbed.|$|E
