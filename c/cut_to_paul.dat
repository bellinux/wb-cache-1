5000|$|When Hurricane Sandy made {{landfall}} on October 29, 2012, The New York Times posted {{an opinion}} piece titled, [...] "A Big Storm Requires Big Government". [...] The piece argued that FEMA was needed in natural disasters and alleged that statements by Mitt Romney {{might be taken}} as supporting <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> the agency. [...] Romney {{refused to comment on}} The New York Times opinion of his positions. [...] Some commentators had previously suggested that Romneys refusal <b>to</b> rule out <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> FEMA (should <b>Paul</b> Ryans budget plans be implemented) was evidence Romney plans <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> FEMAs budget by 20 to 40 percent. President Barack Obama has proposed a 3 percent cut.|$|R

5|$|Early {{plans for}} the Interstate Highway System include a route along roughly the same {{alignment}} as the present I-35 through the Twin Cities area, but are not detailed enough to show exactly how the cities would be served. When preliminary urban routes were laid out in 1955, a split alignment was chosen to serve both cities equally. South of the Twin Cities, I-35 followed the corridor of old US65, which had followed Lyndale Avenue between Burnsville and downtown Minneapolis. I-35E was located parallel <b>to</b> MN13, which <b>cut</b> northeast <b>to</b> Saint <b>Paul</b> from old US65 south of the Minnesota River. North of the metropolitan area, I-35 closely paralleled US61, which passed through Saint Paul; I-35W paralleled old US8 from Minneapolis northeast through New Brighton {{and then to the}} present day I-35E–I-35W split at Columbus near Forest Lake, near where old US8 had joined US61. The Minnesota Legislature defined I-35E as part of unmarked Legislative Route390, which stretched south to the Iowa state line and north to the city of Duluth along I-35.|$|R

Its attempts to address the problems through policies of spending cuts and reducing labour costs have been controversial, particularly <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> education spending that are seen as threatening Finland's successful public education system. These austerity measures have partly been implemented due to European Commission pressure, which has urged Finland to improve its adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact and reform its labour market to improve competitiveness. On 22 July 2015, Sipilä announced his government's commitment to reducing Finnish wage costs by 5% by 2019, an internal devaluation caused by Finland's loss of the ability to devalue its currency to boost competitiveness.|$|R
