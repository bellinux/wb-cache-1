40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three stand-alone essays interlinked {{within the context of}} banking markets in sub-Saharan Africa. This research is motivated by the lack of comparative research on North-South and South-South foreign direct investment (FDI), especially on the service sector and on the African context, despite the rapid expansion of multinationals from developing and emerging countries over the last two decades. Theoretically, this thesis builds on strategy, corporate finance and organizational economics theories. The first chapter compares the financial performance of the foreign affiliates of global banks to that of regional African banks in sub-Saharan Africa over a 10 -year period. The results suggest that affiliates of regional African banks are significantly less profitable (lower return on equity and higher <b>cost</b> <b>income</b> <b>ratio)</b> than those of global banks. Furthermore, the performance differentials are not strongly related to the quality and sectoral allocation of banks’ loan portfolio but to differences in their access to funding. The second chapter examines the benefits and drawbacks of being part of a large banking group by analyzing the flows of internal capital between foreign affiliates located in an emerging economy, South Africa, and their global headquarters. It provides evidence for a support motive to internal funding, as foreign affiliates receive on average more internal group funding when their solvency ratio declines. However, using the event of the East Asian Crisis, I show that foreign affiliates’ balance sheet are not immune to “reversal of fortune” when other members of their banking group need large amounts of internal capital to cushion capital losses, leading to abrupt reallocation of internal capital. Finally, using an instrument variable technique I find a positive impact of the volume of internal funding received by a foreign affiliate on its credit supply in the mortgage market. In the third chapter I examine how environmental and firm factors influence the organizational structure of multinational banks relying on survey data on commercial banks located in 14 sub-Saharan African countries. I find evidence of a positive and significant association between several indicators of environmental distance between host and home countries (institutional, economic and cultural distance) and centralization of operational processes inside multinationals. In addition, I find that lower quantity of “hard” information available on borrowers in the host markets and higher reliance on qualitative or “soft” information by bank managers is negatively and significantly associated with centralization...|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the banking sector performance in Zimbabwe is motivated by the unique developments that typified the sector during the period 2009 - 2014 after emerging from an economic crisis. The Zimbabwean economy returned to stability and growth in 2009, after a decade long economic decline. Economic stability brought about growth in deposits, loans, assets, capitalization and profits during this period. The banking sector {{has been accused of}} excessive profiteering through overpricing their products, which culminated in the intervention by the authorities in the sector. The interest rates spread, fees and other charges were presumed to be high which motivated the need to understand whether the banking sector is efficient or inefficient given the high interest rate spreads between the deposit rates and lending rates. Furthermore the high interest rates have raised the question of whether banks were exploiting their market power to price their products highly or whether their prices were determined by the dictates of market forces. Continued profitability of the sector also called for an investigation into what was driving the persistence of profitability over time. The primary objective of this research was to measure the performance of the banking sector during the period 2009 - 2014. The study contributes to the empirical literature by measuring and assessing the drivers of banking sector competition, efficiency and profitability and applying them at much disaggregated levels. This study also contributes to the debate on the relationships among the performance measures of competition, profitability and efficiency. The study adopted a number of methods which contributes to the array of tools central banks can employ to measure bank performance. The study employed a number of methodologies to measure the competition, efficiency and profitability performance of the banking sector. Competition was estimated using the new empirical industrial organisation methods of Panza and Rose (1987) and the Lerner (1934) Index was used. Cost and revenue efficiency was estimated using the two step methods of Data Envelopment Analysis followed by the Tobit regression method. An assessment of the persistence and drivers of profitability was measured using the Generalised Method of Moments. This study shows that the banking sector was operating under monopolistic competition market structure. This implies that banks held some market power as a result of product differentiation due to unique features such as brands, image and advertising, among others. The study indicates that competition increased during the period 2009 - 2014. Market power/competition in the banking sector during the study period was driven by capital adequacy, non-performing loans, liquidity risk, cost-income ratio, economic growth and government policy on pricing of bank products. The study suggests that the banking sector experienced an average inefficiency level of approximately 35 per cent in relationship with the best performing institutions in the sample. As a result of stability experienced in the economy, the average revenue and cost efficiency increased between 2009 and 2014. The study further established that the discord around the implementation of the indigenisation and empowerment law, coupled with the government intervention in the banking sector had a negative impact on the banking sector efficiency. It also found that efficiency is determined by market power, capital adequacy, <b>cost</b> <b>income</b> <b>ratio,</b> economic growth, inflation, market share and profitability. The Granger Causality test between cost efficiency and market power suggests that causality is bidirectional. On the other hand granger causality between revenue efficiency and market power is unidirectional and positive, running from revenue efficiency to market power. The result implies that policy measures should bring a balance between increasing competition and improving the revenue efficiency. The study shows that the banking sector was profitable during the period 2009 to 2014. The profitability was a reflection of a stable macroeconomic environment, typified by low inflation levels, despite the crises during this period. It further reveals that the banking sector‟s profitability persisted over time, reflecting the regulatory structure of the sector. The study established that profitability was determined by market power, non-performing loans, liquidity risk, capital adequacy, bank size and cost efficiency. This implies profitability was driven by bank specific determinants. There are a number of policy implications derived from the study. Regulatory measures such as forced consolidations can lead to excessive market power by the banking institution; hence it should be moderated. Banks should enhance credit risk because NPLs has been dragging profits. Banks should take advantage of the various measures introduced, such as the setting up of the special purpose vehicle and credit reference bureau. The government should avoid tampering with market forces as this reduces competition, efficiency and profitability and put in place measures that grow the economy as it increases the efficiency and profitability of the banking sector...|$|E

Performance of the industry depends heavily on {{the accuracy of the}} decisions made at managerial level. This study uses multiple linear regression technique and feed forward artificial neural network in predicting bank performance. The study aims to predict bank performance using multiple linear regression and neural network. The study then evaluates the performance of the two techniques with a goal to find a powerful tool in predicting the bank performance. Data of thirteen banks for the period 2001 - 2006 was used in the study. ROA was used as a measure of bank performance, and hence is a dependent variable for the multiple linear regressions. Seven variables including liquidity, credit risk, <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio,</b> size, concentration ratio, inflation and GDP were used as independent variables. Under supervised learning, the dependent variable, ROA was used as the target output for the artificial neural network. Seven inputs corresponding to seven predictor variables were used for pattern recognition at the training phase. Experimental results from the multiple linear regression show that two variables: credit risk and <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio</b> are significant in determining the bank performance.   Two variables were found to explain about 60. 9 percent of the total variation in the data with a mean square error (MSE) of 0. 330. The artificial neural network was found to give optimal results by using thirteen hidden neurons. Testing results show that the seven inputs explain about 66. 9 percent of the total variation in the data with a very low MSE of 0. 00687. Performance of both methods is measured by mean square prediction error (MSPR) at the validation stage. The MSPR value for neural network is lower than the MPSR value for multiple linear regression (0. 0061 against 0. 6190). The study concludes that artificial neural network is the more powerful tool in predicting bank performance. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of second phase of issuing banking licences, on the determinants of allocative, scope, and cost efficiencies of Indian scheduled commercial banks. The paper follows a two stage estimation process. In the first stage, allocative, scope and cost efficiency scores are estimated following Data Envelopment Analysis. Thereafter, in the second stage, using these scores, determinants of the stated efficiencies are analysed by specifying a regime switching panel regression model. Prior studies, both {{in the context of}} Indian and international banks, do not measure and analyse the determinants of scope efficiencies of Banks. The findings reveal that reforms had little impact on the stated measures of efficiency. However, on each of these efficiency parameters, state owned banks perform better than private or even foreign owned banks. Further, the paper finds that profitability, size, ownership and economic growth rate are significant determinants of the stated efficiency measures. As expected, we find {{that as a result of}} competition, net interest margins of Indian public and private sector banks have come close to global standards. Reforms have resulted in adoption of global asset classification norms which has resulted in rationalisation of risk across assets. We also find that bigger banks tend to be more efficient although {{the impact of}} size on all stated measures of efficiency is diminishing over time. Thus, in order to enhance efficiency, policy measures must encourage banks to reduce their <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio</b> and enhance their size measured as log of deposits. Accordingly, in order to enhance efficiency, banks need to introduce a number of investment products that are linked to the risk of advances, thus catering to the diversified expectation of depositors. Another way for banks to enhance their efficiency is by offering a wide array of products and services which would result in higher scope efficiency by reducing the <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio.</b> Banks, Financial Reforms, Scope Efficiency, Cost efficiency, Allocative efficienc...|$|R

The major determinants of the crises arise from excessive credit depth (measured as private credit to GDP ratio) and illiquidity of the banking sector (credits to deposits ratio). The implementation of explicit deposit insurance schemes is also a pro–crisis factor due to the moral hazard effect they tend to cause. On the contrary, higher values of remittance inflows to GDP decrease the susceptibility to banking crises. These findings are robust under both methodologies. Lower bank concentration, bigger values of <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratios</b> as well as a higher level of economic liberalization make countries more vulnerable to banking crises, as derived from the logit analysis. ...|$|R

A two-stage Stochastic Frontier Approach is used to estimate the cost efficiency and the profit efficiency, and a fixed effect panel data analysis is applied to test the determinants of bank profitability. The findings indicate that the profit efficiency of Singaporean banks is more heavily impacted by the Global financial crisis than the cost efficiency. Large banks are more profit efficient and less cost efficient than small banks. The exogenous factors, bank size and the market share, are significantly positively related to the profit efficiency and negatively related to the cost efficiency.

This analysis was done using a cross-sectional regression analysis of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with data provided from the World Bank. The regression shows significantly positive results between economic growth and firms using banks to finance investments, bank <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio</b> and bank credit to bank deposits, while significantly negative results are shown in financial system deposits and stock market total value traded. However, seeing as financial sector development is diverse and dynamic, these measurements and the regression done here will not provide a comprehensive picture of the state of financial sector development in SSA...|$|R
40|$|The present {{outcomes}} of global financial crisis {{have started a}} discussion over the bank’s liquidity and its determinants. Due to mismanagement of the liquidity risk, {{it has become the}} major hurdle in the funds and capital management policy. In the current study analysis, we have conducted this work in order to examine the capital adequacy of banking sector in Pakistan for the Risk based Assets with their impact on the liquidity position over a period from 2003 to 2011. For this purpose panel data analysis has been performed and both the industry specific and firm specific factors have been considered with the TIER I capital. A conceptual model has been developed for this purpose and key findings have been explained for the financial experts to make the future decision. The {{outcomes of}} the study states the fact that there exists a significant relationship of Loan to assets ratio with both firm specific and industry specific factors like Tier I capital, funding cost for the firm, <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio</b> and GDP growth rate over a period of study...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Net Interest Margin (NIM), Loan to Deposit <b>Ratio</b> (LDR), <b>Cost</b> to <b>Income</b> <b>Ratio</b> (CIR) toward Return On Asset (ROA) of Domestic Banks and Foreign Banks in Indonesia from 2011 to 2015. The population {{of this research is}} all domestic banks and foreign banks in Indonesia that operate from 2011 to 2015. This research uses purposive sampling method as sampling technique, therefore total samples of this research is 92 domestic banks and 10 foreign banks. The analysis technique that is used in this research is multiple linear regression analysis. This research also uses Chow test to compare the influence of CAR, NIM, LDR, CIR toward ROA between domestic banks and foreign banks. The result of analysis shows that CAR, NIM, LDR, and CIR have significant influence toward ROA in domestic banks. Meanwhile, only CAR and CIR in foreign banks show significant influence toward ROA. Chow test result shows that there is different influence of CAR, NIM, LDR, CIR toward ROA between domestic banks and foreign banks. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about Pakistani {{domestic}} commercial banks to search some internal factors of banks {{that are considered}} as determinants of profitability of bank. Return on assets ratio has been taken as dependent variable, whereas, Cost i. e. <b>cost</b> to <b>income</b> <b>ratio,</b> LIQ i. e. liquid assets to short term funding and liquid assets to customers, LOSRES i. e. Loan loss reserves to gross loans ratio and EQAS i. e. ratio of share capital as percentage of total assets variables have been taken as independent variables. After the application of Hausman Test panel data regression of random effects has been applied over ten years data ranging from 2001 - 2010 of domestic banks incorporated in Pakistan to find out empirical results. The results denote that Cost, EQAS and LOSRES are statistically significant as independent variables and negatively related to the return on assets and results of these variables are also according to expected signs. The fourth variable that is LIQ is also according to expected sign and is negatively associated with return on assets but it not statistically significant. F-statistics of the model is 33. 63 that mean model is a good fit...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{conducted}} {{to compare the}} determinants of profitability of the domestic and foreign banks operating in Indonesia. The Random Effect Model is employed with balanced panel data on 27 commercial banks, using quarterly data {{for the period of}} 2010 to 2010. In order to find out the differences in the profitability determinants, the sample of banks is divided into two sub-samples based on share ownership (domestic and foreign). The bank-specific determinants such as Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), Loan to Deposit Ratio (LDR), Non Performing Loan (NPL), <b>Cost</b> to <b>Income</b> <b>Ratio</b> (CIR), Loss Provision (LP) and also from macroeconomic determinants (NIM sensitivity to GDP, and NIM sensitivity to Inflation) employed simultaneous and individually toward Profitability which is proxied by Return on Asset (ROA). The results reveal that the profitability determinants of domestic banks are not much different from the determinant factors of foreign banks, namely Cost-to-Income Ratio and Loss Provision, meanwhile the other variables are not able to explain the variability of domestic and foreign banks’ profitability. However, the Loss Provision variable indicates the different sign of significance, which means that there are differences in the behavior of banks in obtaining their income and managing their credit risk. In other side, the average intercept and explanatory power of the model of domestic banks is higher for than foreign bank, which shows that the profitability of domestic banks are better than foreign bank...|$|R
40|$|UK housing {{policies}} are currently {{failing to meet}} the needs generated by newly forming households of increasingly diverse income, compositional type and ethnic group. Proper provision of appropriate healthy, safe and affordable housing for these varied needs, in the most cost-effective manner, is vital on grounds of social justice, health protection, economic efficiency and the avoidance of political tensions. The paper offers first a legally usable definition of ‘affordable’. Then evidence is presented of the declining affordability of both renting and owning. Since 1980 the proportion of average male earnings taken by rent has risen by 93 % (public sector), 37 % (voluntary sector) and 122 % (private sector). In terms of owner-occupancy, the house price index has risen at twice the rate of earnings since 1970 and at five times the rate since 1993. The mortgage <b>cost</b> to average <b>incomes</b> <b>ratio</b> has worsened by 43 % over the past decade and is highly differential by region. This sharp worsening of housing affordability in both main sectors is largely explained by...|$|R
