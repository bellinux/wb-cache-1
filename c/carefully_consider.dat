500|$|Much of Longfellow's work is {{categorized}} as lyric poetry, but he experimented with many forms, including hexameter and free verse. His published poetry shows great versatility, using anapestic and trochaic forms, blank verse, heroic couplets, ballads, and sonnets. Typically, he would <b>carefully</b> <b>consider</b> {{the subject of}} his poetic ideas {{for a long time before}} deciding on the right metrical form for it. Much of his work is recognized for its melodious musicality. As he says, [...] "what a writer asks of his reader is not so much to like as to listen".|$|E

500|$|If one is {{interested}} in making something {{for the public to}} view—be it a painting, a book, an album, a film, or a video game, should the POSSIBLE harm that may come out of this work be grounds for its suppression from society? This is, in a sense, pre-crime.

500|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{announcement}} made {{prior to the}} start of the season was the return of the Romulans to Star Trek.

500|$|Wollstonecraft was {{not alone}} in {{focusing}} her revolutionary writings on education; as Alan Richardson, a scholar of the period, points out, [...] "most liberal and radical intellectuals of the time viewed education as the cornerstone of any movement for social reform". One reason these thinkers emphasized the training of the young mind was the pervasive acceptance during the 18th century of Locke's theory of mind. He posited that the mind is a [...] "blank slate" [...] or tabula rasa, free from innate ideas, and that because children enter the world without preconceived notions; whatever ideas they absorb early in life will fundamentally affect their later development. Locke explained this process through a theory he labelled the association of ideas; the ideas that children connect, such as fear and darkness, are stronger than those ideas adults associate, therefore instructors, according to Locke, must <b>carefully</b> <b>consider</b> what they expose children to early in life.|$|E

Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury {{that every one of}} the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to <b>carefully</b> <b>consider</b> them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened.

500|$|The {{creation}} {{process for}} Kikuuiki was different {{to that of}} Shin-shiro, where each member worked alongside Yamaguchi in a two-person meeting, and later working on the songs together as a band. For Kikuuiki, Yamaguchi recorded each song's demo, then in a meeting the band would discuss the song's feel and emotions, listing everything on a white board. Yamaguchi would then leave the other four band members {{to work on the}} song together, while he worked on their next song. Afterwards, he would return to the studio and make suggestions on their progress on the first song. This meant that Yamaguchi had less input on Kikuuiki than on the band's previous albums, which made him feel more like the band's producer. The lessened input made Yamaguchi feel that he had come to trust each member's musical abilities much more than before. On previous albums, the members needed to compromise or give up on ideas that they had, however on Kikuuiki they found that they understood each other much better. This led to the members expressing themselves more, such as drummer Keiichi Ejima, who showcased his taste in rock music strongly in the sound he created for the album. Many songs were still being created when they were recording, unlike previous albums where songs were entirely finished before recording the final take. This meant that many spontaneous ideas were included on the album. An example of this was the band wanted to add a chorus, they collected together all the people who {{happened to be in the}} studio at the time, including their musical director. The spontaneous process led to the song [...] "Klee", written about the paintings of Swiss-German painter Paul Klee, to be recorded in a single take. Similarly, the song [...] "Coelacanth to Boku" [...] was inspired by the atmosphere of Yamaguchi's room as the album was being created. Instead of featuring repeating sounds on the album, Sakanaction decided to <b>carefully</b> <b>consider</b> how each sound-effect effected the song, and included very few repeating sounds.|$|E

In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption.|$|E

2500|$|Insufficient {{knowledge}} of the basics of special relativity, especially {{the application of the}} Lorentz transformation in connection with length contraction and time dilation, led and still leads to the construction of various apparent paradoxes. Both the twin paradox and the Ehrenfest paradox and their explanation were already mentioned above. Besides the twin paradox, also the reciprocity of time dilation (i.e. every inertially moving observer considers the clock of the other one as being dilated) was heavily criticized by Herbert Dingle and others. For example, Dingle wrote a series of letters to Nature {{at the end of the}} 1950s. However, the self-consistency of the reciprocity of time dilation had already been [...] demonstrated long before in an illustrative way by Lorentz (in his lectures from 1910, published 1931) and many others—they alluded to the fact that it is only necessary to <b>carefully</b> <b>consider</b> the relevant measurement rules and the relativity of simultaneity. Other known paradoxes are the Ladder paradox and Bell's spaceship paradox, which also can simply be solved by consideration of the relativity of simultaneity.|$|E
