5|$|A {{natural setting}} for problem of Apollonius is inversive geometry. The basic {{strategy}} of inversive methods is to transform a given Apollonius problem into another Apollonius {{problem that is}} simpler to solve; the solutions to the original problem are found from the solutions of the transformed problem by undoing the transformation. Candidate transformations must change one Apollonius problem into another; therefore, they must transform the given points, <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> lines to other points, <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> lines, and no other shapes. Circle inversion has this property and allows the center and radius of the inversion circle to be chosen judiciously. Other candidates include the Euclidean plane isometries; however, they do not simplify the problem, since they merely shift, rotate, and mirror the original problem.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described in print, and is important in number theory via Ford <b>circles</b> <b>and</b> the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E

50|$|Since not {{all points}} of the trisectrix can be {{constructed}} with <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> compass alone, it is really required as an additional tool next to compass <b>and</b> <b>circle.</b> However {{it is possible to}} construct a dense subset of the trisectrix by <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> compass, so while you cannot assure an exact division of an angle into n parts without a given trisectrix, you can construct an arbitrarily close approximation by <b>circle</b> <b>and</b> compass alone.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of her {{suffrage}} and publishing work, Gordon was well-known in California political <b>circles,</b> <b>and</b> even received 200 votes for State Senate in 1871.

Gordon used her position as a journalist covering the debate {{to stay in touch with}} lawmakers and lobby the governor for the final signature.|$|E

5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined in his famous 1859 book The Origin of Species.

5|$|Brezhnev {{consolidated}} his {{own position}} over the Government Apparatus by strengthening Podgorny's position as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, literally head of state, {{by giving the}} office some of {{the functions of the}} Premier. The 1977 Soviet Constitution strengthened Podgorny's control of the Council of Ministers, by giving the post of head of state some executive powers. In fact, because of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers became subordinate to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. When Podgorny was replaced as head of state in 1977 by Brezhnev, Kosygin's role in day-to-day management of government activities was lessened drastically, through Brezhnev's new-found post. Rumours started circulating within the top <b>circles,</b> <b>and</b> on the streets, that Kosygin would retire due to bad health.|$|E

5|$|If {{the three}} given circles are {{mutually}} tangent, Apollonius' problem has five solutions. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles.

This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
