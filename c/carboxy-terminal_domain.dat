5|$|Isoform “a” {{of human}} CASS4 is {{considered}} the predominant species, and at 786 amino acids is the longest one. Amino acid sequence homology of this isoform of human CASS4 with other family members is 26% overall identity and 42% similarity. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the CASS4 protein SH3 domain was shown {{to interact with the}} FAK C-terminus, despite the lowest overall similarity to other SH3 domains in the CAS group. In addition, human CASS4 has a limited number of candidate SH2-binding sites, estimated at 10, which is similar to EFS (estimated at 9) and in contrast to p130Cas/BCAR1 and NEDD9, which have 20 and 18 respectively. The CASS4 C-terminus has a short region of CAS family homology, but lacks obvious similarity at the level of primary amino acid sequence. It also lacks a YDYVHL sequence at the N-terminal end of the FAT-like <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>domain,</b> even though this motif is conserved among the other three CAS family proteins and is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. Although this lack of sequence similarity may mean a reduced functionality of the CASS4 protein, molecular modeling analysis performed by Singh and colleagues using p130CAS/BCAR1 structures as templates suggested an almost identical fold between CASS4 and p130CAS/BCAR1 within their SH3 domains, and substantial similarity within 432-591 residues of CASS4 and 449-610 residues of p130Cas/BCAR1 at the level of secondary and tertiary structures. Also, the similar periodicity of α-helices and β-sheets in both CASS4 and p130Cas/BCAR1 provides another confirmation for the idea of well-conserved structures within the family members.|$|E

The phenotypic effects of these B-box 2 changes on the restriction of retroviral infection depended on the potency of restriction and the affinity of the TRIM 5 α interaction with the viral capsid, two properties specified by the B 30. 2 (SPRY) domain.

40|$|Retroviral {{integrase}} catalyses {{the integration}} of viral DNA into host target DNA, which is an essential step in {{the life cycle of}} all retroviruses 1. Previous structural characterization of integrase???viral DNA complexes, or intasomes, from the spumavirus prototype foamy virus revealed a functional integrase tetramer 2, 3, 4, 5, and it is generally believed that intasomes derived from other retroviral genera use tetrameric integrase 6, 7, 8, 9. However, the intasomes of orthoretroviruses, which include all known pathogenic species, have not been characterized structurally. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, we determine an unexpected octameric integrase architecture for the intasome of the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumour virus. The structure is composed of two core integrase dimers, which interact with the viral DNA ends and structurally mimic the integrase tetramer of prototype foamy virus, and two flanking integrase dimers that engage the core structure via their integrase <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>domains.</b> Contrary to the belief that tetrameric integrase components are sufficient to catalyse integration, the flanking integrase dimers were necessary for mouse mammary tumour virus integrase activity. The integrase octamer solves a conundrum for betaretroviruses as well as alpharetroviruses by providing critical <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>domains</b> to the intasome core that cannot be provided in cis because of evolutionarily restrictive catalytic core domain???carboxy-terminal domain linker regions.

40|$|The Homer {{family of}} adaptor {{proteins}} {{consists of three}} members in mammals, and homologs are also known in other animals but not elsewhere. They are predominantly localized at the postsynaptic density in mammalian neurons and act as adaptor proteins for many postsynaptic density proteins. As a result of alternative splicing each member has several variants, which are classified primarily into the long and short forms. The long Homer forms are constitutively expressed and consist of two major domains: the amino-terminal target-binding domain, which includes an Enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) homology 1 (EVH 1) <b>domain,</b> and the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> self-assembly <b>domain</b> containing a coiled-coil structure and leucine zipper motif.

50|$|Bivalirudin, a 20 {{amino acid}} polypeptide, is a {{synthetic}} analog of hirudin. Like the hirudins {{it is also}} a bivalent DTI. It has an amino-terminal D-Phe-Pro-Arg-Pro domain that is linked via four Gly residues to a dodecapeptide analog of the carboxy-terminal of hirudin. The amino-terminal domain binds to the active site and the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>domain</b> binds to exosite 1 on thrombin. Different from the hirudins, once bound thrombin cleaves the Arg-Pro bond at the amino-terminal of bivalirudin and as a result restores the functions to the active site of the enzyme. Even though the <b>carboxy-terminal</b> <b>domain</b> of bivalirudin is still bound to exosite 1 on thrombin, the affinity of the bond is decreased after the amino-terminal is released. This allows substrates to substartes to compete with cleaved bivalirudin for access to exosite 1 on thrombin. The use of bivalirudin has mostly been studied in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. A few studies indicate that bivalirudin is non-inferior compared to heparin and that bivalirudin is associated with a lower rate of bleeding. Unlike the hirudins, bivalirudin is only partially (about 20%) excreted by the kidneys, other sites such as hepatic metabolism and proteolysis also contribute to its metabolism, making it safer to use in patients with renal impairment; however, dose adjustments are needed in severe renal impairment.|$|E
