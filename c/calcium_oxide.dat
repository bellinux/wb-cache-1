5|$|The bulk {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} ash {{has been found to}} be approximately 65% silicon dioxide, 18% aluminium oxide, 5% ferric oxide, 4% each <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> and sodium oxide and 2% magnesium oxide. Trace chemicals were also detected, their concentrations varying as shown: 0.05–0.09% chlorine, 0.02–0.03% fluorine, and 0.09–0.3% sulphur.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of the}} molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E

50|$|Hydration is an {{important}} process in many other applications; {{one example is the}} production of Portland cement by the crosslinking of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxides</b> and silicates that is induced by water. Hydration is the process by which desiccants function.|$|R
30|$|The above {{correlation}} {{is valid}} for coal ash with <b>calcium</b> <b>oxides</b> (CaO) less than 10 %. If CaO {{is more than}} 10 %, then such coal ash that is classified above as ‘medium type of sintering’ is to be considered as High sintering type.|$|R
5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han forces had horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (<b>calcium</b> <b>oxide)</b> at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy alkaline earth metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E

5|$|As {{expected}} from periodic trends, lanthanum {{has the largest}} atomic radius of the lanthanides and the stable group 3 elements. Hence, {{it is the most}} reactive among them, tarnishing slowly in air and burning readily to form lanthanum(III) oxide, La2O3, which is almost as basic as <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide.</b> A centimeter-sized sample of lanthanum will corrode completely in a year as its oxide spalls off like iron rust, instead of forming a protective oxide coating like aluminium and lanthanum's lighter congeners scandium and yttrium. Lanthanum reacts with the halogens at room temperature to form the trihalides, and upon warming will form binary compounds with the nonmetals nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, boron, selenium, silicon and arsenic. Lanthanum reacts slowly with water to form lanthanum(III) hydroxide, La(OH)3. In dilute sulfuric acid, lanthanum readily forms the aquated tripositive ion : this is colorless in aqueous solution since La3+ has no f electrons. Lanthanum is the strongest and hardest base among the lanthanides and group 3 elements, which is again {{expected from}} its being the largest of them.|$|E

25|$|Calcination of {{limestone}} using charcoal fires to produce quicklime has been practiced since antiquity by cultures {{all over the}} world. The temperature at which limestone yields <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> is usually given as 825°C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO2 pressure is {{only a tiny fraction}} of the partial CO2 pressure in air, which is about 0.035 kPa.|$|E
50|$|Huntite often {{occurs in}} {{combination}} with other Mg/Ca carbonates such as dolomite, magnesite, and hydromagnesite. Large deposits of huntite occur in Turkey and Greece and these are commercially exploited because of its fire retardant properties. Huntite thermally decomposes over a temperature range of about 450-800 °C, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving a residue of magnesium and <b>calcium</b> <b>oxides.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} producing century eggs {{is the development}} and improvement from the aforementioned primitive process. Instead of using just clay, a mixture of wood ash, <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide,</b> and salt {{is included in the}} plastering mixture, thereby increasing its pH and sodium content. The addition of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> and wood ash to the mixture lowers the risk of spoilage and also increases the speed of the aforementioned primitive process. A recipe for creating century eggs through this process starts with the infusion of three pounds of tea in boiling water. To the tea, three pounds of <b>calcium</b> <b>oxide</b> (or seven pounds when the operation is performed in winter), nine pounds of sea salt, and seven pounds of ash from burned oak is mixed into a smooth paste. While wearing gloves to prevent the chemicals from burning the skin, each egg is individually covered by hand, then rolled in a mass of rice chaff to keep the eggs from adhering to one another before they are placed in cloth-covered jars or tightly woven baskets. The mud slowly dries and hardens into a crust over several months, and then the eggs are ready for consumption.|$|E
