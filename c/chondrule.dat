Radial pyroxene <b>chondrules</b> {{are larger than}} cryptocrystalline <b>chondrules,</b> while nonporphyritic <b>chondrules</b> have a broader size-frequency distribution than the porphyritic, and porphyritic olivine-pyroxene <b>chondrules</b> are larger than porphyritic pyroxene <b>chondrules.</b> This last result {{is due to a}} reaction of fine-grained olivine with free silica to form pyroxene during mild thermal metamorphism of the whole-rocks...|$|R
40|$|The <b>chondrules</b> and {{matrices}} in ALH- 77015 chondrite (L 3) {{were analyzed}} with an electron probe microanalyzer.

Fragmentation of <b>chondrules</b> cannot explain the chemistry of the matrices. A clear correlation between Ca and Al has been noted in the <b>chondrules.</b> The correlation can be interpreted by assuming that the <b>chondrules</b> were formed from the solar nebula through the crystallization of anorthite and Ca-rich pyroxene...|$|R
40|$|Textures of <b>chondrules</b> in the unequilibrated {{ordinary}} chondrites {{have been}} summarized {{on the basis}} of the processes of their formation inferred from the results of previous experiments. The <b>chondrules</b> studied are classified by their textures into the following four groups : (1) those formed by complete melting of the precursor materials, (2) those formed by incomplete melting of the precursor materials, (3) "lithic fragments" or "lithic chondrules" formed through low temperature heating of the precursor materials, and (4) complex <b>chondrules</b> formed by accretion of two <b>chondrules</b> or by squeezing out the liquid. Groups (1) and (2) are further classified into different subgroups depending on their texture and constituent minerals. The subgroups in group (1) include barred olivine <b>chondrules,</b> radial pyroxene <b>chondrules,</b> and glassy <b>chondrules.</b> In group (2), the subgroups are porphyritic olivine and pyroxene <b>chondrules,</b> porphyritic olivine <b>chondrules,</b> and porphyritic pyroxene <b>chondrules.</b> The porphyritic olivine and pyroxene <b>chondrules</b> include the following specific types : normal porphyritic olivine and pyroxene ones without relict minerals, <b>chondrules</b> with relict minerals, <b>chondrules</b> which are Ca- and Al-rich, which have been intensively heated, and which are metal-rich. The conditions of formation of these different <b>chondrules</b> have been estimated by comparing them with the experimentally reproduced textures. Group (1) is interpreted to have been heated at aboveliquidus temperatures, about 1500 ℃, and cooled at rates of (10) ^ 4 -(10) ^ 2 °/hr, with most suitable rates of (10) ^ 3 °/hr for barred olivine <b>chondrules,</b> and (10) ^ 2 - 1 °/hr, with most suitable rates of several tens°/hr for radial pyroxene <b>chondrules.</b> Group (2) was heated at subliquidus temperatures (probably between 1200 - 1000 ° and 1500 ℃, and cooled at various rates, relatively rapidly for porphyritic olivine <b>chondrules</b> and slowly for euhedral tabular pyroxene. Group (3) without spherical form was heated near or below solidus temperatures...|$|R

40|$|Chronometer {{using the}} {{short-lived}} extinct-nuclide (26) Al {{has been applied}} to <b>chondrules</b> in order to obtain of their formation ages. Previous studies were mostly performed on Al-rich <b>chondrules,</b> which constitute only 1 % of all <b>chondrules,</b> because of their high Al/Mg ratios. Recently, (26) Al ages of major ferromagnesian <b>chondrules</b> in least equilibrated ordinary chondrites (OC) have been obtained. However, (26) Al ages of ferromagnesian <b>chondrules</b> in least equilibrated carbonaceous chondrites (CC) are very limited. Particularly, age data of FeO-poor (Type I) <b>chondrules</b> in CC have been scarcely obtained, because of their fine textures and lack of phases with high Al/Mg (> 100) ratios. In order to clarify the origin and formation processes of <b>chondrules,</b> we started systematic investigations on Type I <b>chondrules</b> in the most pristine CC (CO 3. 0 Yamato- 81020), by examining textures, bulk chemical compositions, (26) Al ages and oxygen isotopic compositions. We find Type I <b>chondrules</b> in CC formed contemporaneously with ferromagnesian <b>chondrules</b> in OC...|$|R
40|$|Chromium-rich <b>chondrules</b> {{constitute}} {{less than}} 0. 1 {{percent of all}} ordinary chondrite (OC) <b>chondrules</b> and comprise three groups: chromian-spinel <b>chondrules,</b> chromian-spinel inclusions, and chromite-rich mafic silicate (CRMS) <b>chondrules.</b> Chromian-spinel <b>chondrules</b> (typically 100 - 300 microns in apparent diameter) exhibit granular, porphyritic and unusual textures and occur mainly in H chondrites. Their morphologies are distinct from the irregularly shaped chromian-spinel inclusions of similar mineralogy. Chromian-spinel <b>chondrules</b> and inclusions consist of grains of chromian-spinel embedded in plagioclase (Pl) or mesostasis of Pl composition. Many also contain accessory ilmenite (Ilm), high-Ca pyroxene (Px), merrillite (Mer), and rare olivine (Ol); some exhibit concentric mineral and chemical zoning. CRMS <b>chondrules</b> (300 - 1100 microns in apparent diameter) are generally larger than chromian-spinel <b>chondrules</b> and occur in all metamorphosed OC groups. Most CRMS <b>chondrules</b> are nearly spherical although a few are ellipsoidal with a/b aspect ratios ranging up to 1. 7. Textures include cryptocrystalline, granular, radial, barred, and porphyritic varieties; some contain apparently relict grains. The <b>chondrules</b> consist of chromite (Chr), Ol and Pl, along with accessory Mer, troilite (Tr), metallic Fe-Ni (Met), Px and Ilm. The mesostasis in CRMS <b>chondrules</b> is nearly opaque in transmitted light; thus, they can be easily recognized in the optical microscope. Based on the similarity of mineralogy and chemistry between CRMS <b>chondrules</b> of different textures (opaque chromite-rich mesostasis, skeletal morphology of Ol grains, similar bulk compositions) we suggest that these <b>chondrules</b> form a genetically related population...|$|R
40|$|There are {{two types}} of glass-rich <b>chondrules</b> in unequilibrated {{ordinary}} chondrites (OC) : (1) porphyritic <b>chondrules</b> containing 55 - 85 vol% glass or microcrystalline mesostasis and (2) nonporphyritic <b>chondrules,</b> containing 90 - 99 vol% glass. These two types are similar in mineralogy and bulk composition to previously described Al-rich <b>chondrules</b> in OC. In addition to Si-, Al- and Na-rich glass or Ca-Al-rich microcrystalline mesostasis, glass-rich <b>chondrules</b> contain dendritic and skeletal crystals of olivine, Al 2 O 3 -rich low-Ca pyroxene and fassaite. Some <b>chondrules</b> contain relict grains of forsterite +/- Mg-Al spinel. We suggest that glass-rich <b>chondrules</b> were formed early in nebular history by melting fine-grained precursor materials rich in refractory (Ca, Al, Ti) an moderately volatite (Na, K) components (possibly related to Ca-Al-rich inclusions) admixed with coarse relict forsterite and spinel grains derived from previously disrupted type-I <b>chondrules...</b>|$|R
50|$|The LL group {{includes}} {{many of the}} most primitive ordinary chondrites, including the well-studied Semarkona (type 3.0) chondrite. However, most LL chondrites have been thermally metamorphosed to petrologic types 5 and 6, meaning that their minerals are homogeneous in composition and <b>chondrule</b> borders are difficult to discern.|$|E
50|$|Chondrules {{can range}} in {{diameter}} {{from just a}} few micrometers to over 1 cm. Again, different kinds of chondrites contain different ranges of <b>chondrule</b> sizes: they are smallest in CH, CM, and CO chondrites (see meteorite classification), moderately large in CR, CV, L, LL, and R chondrites, and largest in some CB chondrites (see table). Other chondrite groups are intermediate between these.|$|E

Kamacite, with deformed Neumann bands, and taenite, twinned troilite. Copper. Mode: metal+troilite 10%.|$|E
40|$|Fifty-eight Allende <b>chondrules</b> {{were studied}} to {{investigate}} secondary anhydrous alteration of <b>chondrules.</b> Nepheline and sodalite replace anorthite-normative cryptocrystalline groundmass and plagioclase. These reactions presumably took place by replacement of Ca of the anorthite component by 2 (Na, K) introduced from <b>chondrules,</b> and are called alkali-Ca exchange reactions. The degree {{of the reaction}} is variable among chondrules; a few <b>chondrules</b> display the reaction in the peripheral parts only. In contrast, the primary groundmass in some other <b>chondrules</b> was totally replaced by nepheline and sodalite. Most of the Allende <b>chondrules</b> were subjected to the alkali-Ca exchange reaction. Some Ca-rich phases such as hedenbergite, andradite, grossular, kirschsteinite and wollastonite, rarely occur intimately with nepheline and sodalite in groundmass. These Ca-rich phases are also secondary products in <b>chondrules.</b> During the alkali-Ca exchange reaction, part of the CaO released from anorthite was used to form the Ca-rich phases in <b>chondrules.</b> Since the abundance of the Ca-rich phases is too low, CaO was mostly lost from <b>chondrules</b> during the alkali-Ca exchange reaction. CAIs and <b>chondrules</b> in oxidized CV chondrites include similar secondary minerals, suggesting {{that both of them}} were subjected to the alkali-Ca exchange reaction under similar conditions...|$|R
40|$|Major {{and trace}} element {{analyses}} of over 180 individual <b>chondrules</b> from 12 carbonaceous chondrites are reported, including individual analyses of 60 <b>chondrules</b> from Pueblito de Allende. Siderophile elements in most <b>chondrules</b> are depleted, {{compared to the}} whole chondrite. Correlations of Al-Ir and Ir-Sc among <b>chondrules</b> high in Ca and Al were observed. A Cu-Mn correlation was also found for <b>chondrules</b> from some meteorites. No correlation was observed between Au and other siderophile elements (Fe, Ni, Co and Ir). It is suggested that these elemental associations {{were present in the}} material from which the <b>chondrules</b> formed. Compositionally, <b>chondrules</b> appear to be a multicomponent mixture of remelted dust. One component displaying an Al-Ir correlation is identified as Allende-type white aggregates. The other components are a material chemically similar to the present matrix and sulfides-plus-metal material. Abundances of the REE (rare earth elements) were measured in ordinary Allende <b>chondrules</b> and were 50 % higher than REE abundances in Mokoia chondrules; REE abundances in Ca-Al rich <b>chondrules</b> were similar to REE abundances in Ca-rich white aggregates...|$|R
40|$|Major element {{contents}} of chondrite groups were volatility controlled and established in a nebula after formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions but before <b>chondrules</b> formed. Elemental abundances in <b>chondrules</b> tend to correlate with chemical affinity. Calcium was fractionated from Al by a planetary, not a nebular process. <b>Chondrules</b> were contemporaneous with igneous activity and aqueous and thermal metamorphism. Planetary bodies of varied size and structure co-existed {{during the first}} 50 - 80 million years of the Solar System, when <b>chondrules</b> formed and impact was common. We propose that most <b>chondrules</b> formed by impacts on differentiated bodies...|$|R
50|$|The {{result of}} U-corrected Pb-Pb dating has {{produced}} ages of 4567.35 ± 0.28 My for CAIs (A) and chondrules with ages between 4564.71 ± 0.30 and 4567.32 ± 0.42 My (B and C) (see figure). This {{supports the idea}} that CAIs crystallization and <b>chondrule</b> formation occurred {{around the same time}} during the formation of the solar system. However, chondrules continued to form for approximately 3 My after CAIs. Hence the best age for the original formation of the solar system is 4567.7 My. This date also represents the time of initiation of planetary accretion. Successive collisions between accreted bodies {{led to the formation of}} larger and larger planetesimals, finally forming the earth-moon system in a giant impact event.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of olivine and pyroxene in chondrules varies widely, although the range is usually narrow within any single <b>chondrule.</b> Some chondrules contain very little iron oxide (FeO), resulting in olivine and pyroxene that {{are close to}} forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and enstatite (MgSiO3) in composition. These are commonly called Type I chondrules by scientists, and often contain large amounts of metallic Fe. Other chondrules formed under more oxidizing conditions and contain olivine and pyroxene with large amounts of FeO (e.g., olivine with the formula (Mg,Fe)2SiO4). Such chondrules are called Type II. Most chondrites contain both Type I and Type II chondrules mixed together, including those with both porphyritic and nonporphyritic textures, although there are exceptions to this.|$|E
50|$|Meteorites {{contain a}} record of {{accretion}} and impacts during all stages of asteroid origin and evolution; however, the mechanism of asteroid accretion and growth is not well understood. Evidence suggests the main growth of asteroids can result from gas-assisted accretion of chondrules, which are millimeter-sized spherules that form as molten (or partially molten) droplets in space before being accreted to their parent asteroids. In the inner Solar System, chondrules {{appear to have been}} crucial for initiating accretion. The tiny mass of asteroids may be partly due to inefficient <b>chondrule</b> formation beyond 2 AU, or less-efficient delivery of chondrules from near the protostar. Also, impacts controlled the formation and destruction of asteroids, and are thought to be a major factor in their geological evolution.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{kinds of}} the stony, {{non-metallic}} meteorites called chondrites contain different fractions of <b>chondrules</b> (see table below). In general, carbonaceous chondrites contain the smallest percentage (by volume) of <b>chondrules,</b> including the CI chondrites which, paradoxically, {{do not contain}} any <b>chondrules</b> despite their designation as chondrites, whereas ordinary and enstatite chondrites contain the most. Because ordinary chondrites represent 80% of the meteorites that fall to earth, and because ordinary chondrites contain 60-80% <b>chondrules,</b> it follows {{that most of the}} meteoritic material that falls on earth (excluding dust) is made up of <b>chondrules.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{processes}} that acted upon <b>chondrules</b> after their formation {{are as important}} clues {{to the nature of}} the early solar nebula as are the exact {{processes that}} formed the <b>chondrules.</b> Recent experiments have studied the rim forming processes and the effects the processes have on <b>chondrules.</b> We present below information on how matrix inclusions found within <b>chondrules</b> may have been formed and the potential usefulness of this information...|$|R
50|$|Chondrules {{display a}} wide variety of textures, which can be seen when the <b>chondrule</b> is sliced open and polished. Some show textural {{evidence}} for extremely rapid cooling from a molten or nearly completely molten state. Pyroxene-rich chondrules that contain extremely fine-grained, swirling masses of fibrous crystals only a few micrometers in size or smaller are called cryptocrystalline chondrules. When the pyroxene fibers are coarser, they may appear to radiate from a single nucleation site on the surface, forming a radial or excentroradial texture. Olivine-rich chondrules may contain parallel plates of that mineral, surrounded by a continuous shell of olivine and containing feldspathic glass between the plates; these are known as barred textures. Other observed textural features that are clearly the result of very rapid cooling are dendritic and hopper-shaped olivine grains, and chondrules that are composed entirely of glass.|$|E
50|$|Mason Gully is an {{ordinary}} chondrite- {{a group of}} meteorites which are frequently found on the Earth's surface and make up {{a large proportion of}} the observed meteorite falls. It was identified as belonging to the H chemical class, which has a high siderophile element component (H), typically contains small chondrules, and has an oxygen isotopic signature closest to the terrestrial fractionation line out of all ordinary chondrites. A petrologic type of 5 indicates it has undergone a moderate amount of thermal metamorphism, which has caused some chemical homogenization and resulted in less distinct <b>chondrule</b> edges and secondary mineral growth. This meteorite shows low levels of terrestrial weathering, consistent with residing in a region of low precipitation for 7 months. The stone was 3 cm in length along the longest axis, approximately 50% fusion crusted, and has a porosity of 10.7%. It exhibits very low levels of shock and is therefore classified as an S1.|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that chondrules {{formed by the}} melting of solid materials and, by default, the early solar nebula is the preferred location for <b>chondrule</b> formation. Agglomeratic olivine (AO) chondrules supply perhaps the most intriguing, direct evidence for <b>chondrule</b> formation from agglomeration of solids. We review the characteristics of AO chondrules and discuss their implications for understanding <b>chondrule</b> precursors and <b>chondrule</b> evolution...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{chemical}} compositions of {{the various}} petrographic types of <b>chondrules</b> and inclusions in Type 3 carbonaceous chondrites (excluding those affected by metamorphism) have been determined by microprobe defocused-beam analysis. Inclusion compositions follow approximately the theoretical compositional trajectory for equlibrium condensation. <b>Chondrules</b> occurring in the same meteorites have higher silica contents and show only slight overlap with inclusion compositions. Dust fusion is apparently an inadequate mechanism for producing the wide chemical variations observed among <b>chondrules.</b> Impact-melting models require sampling of complex target rocks which are unknown as components of meteorites; this mechanism also demands efficient mechanical processing of <b>chondrules</b> before accretion. A genetic relationship between <b>chondrules</b> and inclusions in carbonaceous chondrites {{is suggested by the}} compositional continuum between these objects. A condensation sequence which dips into the liquid stability field at lower temperatures is advocated for the production of both inclusions and <b>chondrules.</b> Textural relationships between intergrown <b>chondrules</b> and inclusions support such a sequence. This model suggests that the assembled components (inclusions and <b>chondrules)</b> of carbonaceous chondrites are related by a common process...|$|R
40|$|Studies of sulfides in Allende {{show that}} {{pyrrhotite}} occurs mainly within <b>chondrules</b> {{and has been}} partially replaced by pentlandite.

40|$|The major-element {{compositions}} of 47 individual Chainpur (LL- 3) <b>chondrules</b> were determined. There {{appears to}} be no correlation between Na and Al, in contrast with the correlation previously found in Bjurbole <b>chondrules</b> in which these elements are characteristically found in equal molar proportions. The correlation in Bjurbole <b>chondrules</b> is considered to be the effect of metamorphism. The compositional variations among Chainpur <b>chondrules</b> point to a fractionation which basically involved only silica. This can best be explained as being the result of vapor fractionation which took place during or after the formation of the <b>chondrules.</b> The ratio of Ca to Al in the individual <b>chondrules</b> is generally close to the value 1. 08, which {{has been found to be}} characteristic of the chondrites in general...|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} an Al-rich <b>chondrule</b> from Mokoia. SIMS {{analyses}} of plagioclase and pyroxene {{show that the}} bulk <b>chondrule</b> REE pattern was originally like group II CAIs.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} opaque {{minerals}} in primitive ordinary chondrites suggest that metal grains exposed at <b>chondrule</b> boundaries were corroded when volatile elements recondensed after the transient heating event responsible for <b>chondrule</b> formation.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the bulk {{composition}} and the dynamic melting conditions on the texture of olivine chondrules were investigated {{in a series of}} heating experiments. It is shown that variations in the olivine <b>chondrule</b> textures can be produced by varying the FeO/(FeO + MgO) ratio between the average Type IA and Type II <b>chondrule</b> compositions, could affect the texture of a <b>chondrule</b> at a constant initial melting temperature and heating time. A range of the heating times and the masses of precursor spheres caused variations in the degree of melting and in <b>chondrule</b> textures. <b>Chondrule</b> textures were distributed on a graph of initial temperatures vs. FeO/(FeO + MgO) ratios as bands parallel to the olivine disappearance curve.

40|$|<b>Chondrules</b> can {{be divided}} into two broad textural types: {{porphyritic}} and nonporphyritic. Porphyritic <b>chondrules</b> are the most common in most chondrites and range texturally from olivine-rich (PO) to intermediate (POP) to pyroxene-rich (PP). Barred olivine (BO) <b>chondrules</b> can be considered a special case of porphyritic. Compositionally they {{can be divided}} into type I and II. Nonporphyritic are less abundant than porphyritic <b>chondrules</b> in most chondrites [...] they make up approximately 125 % of the <b>chondrules</b> in ordinary chondrites [...] and range texturally from glassy (g) to cryptocrystalline (C) to radial pyroxene (RP). Compositionally nonporphyritic differ from porphyritic <b>chondrules</b> and within this group they are very similar to one another. Here we (1) review and contrast the characteristics of the nonporphyritic and porphyritic chondrules; (2) specify some of the problems associated with the origins of the textural and compositional differences between them; and (3) suggest a possible scenario for their origin, which may have important implications for the evolution of <b>chondrules...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract–We {{review the}} 26 Al ages of <b>chondrules</b> in various type 3. 0 chondrites. The 26 Al ages of <b>chondrules</b> are 1 – 3 Myr after calcium-aluminum-rich {{inclusion}} (CAI) for LL 3. 0, CO 3. 0, and Acfer 094 (Ungrouped C 3. 0). Available data for <b>chondrules</b> in CR chondrites indicate that many <b>chondrules</b> are relatively younger (‡ 3 Myr), although data from <b>chondrules</b> in CR 3. 0 {{are not yet}} available to confirm their younger ages. The total ranges for the 26 Al ages of <b>chondrules</b> in a single chondrite group are more than 0. 5 – 1 Myr. However, most <b>chondrules</b> show relatively narrow range of ages in a single chondrite group (0. 2 – 0. 4 Myr, 1 SD), which might be short enough to preserve the group-specific chemical and isotope signatures against radial diffusion of solid in the disk. Distinct oxygen isotope reservoirs might exist in the protoplanetary disk simultaneously, which could be spatially separated...|$|R
40|$|The {{recently}} proposed compositional {{classification scheme}} for meteoritic <b>chondrules</b> divides the <b>chondrules</b> into groups {{depending on the}} composition of their two major phases, olivine (or pyroxene) and the mesostasis, {{both of which are}} genetically important. The scheme is here applied to discussions of three topics: the petrographic classification of Roosevelt County 075 (the least-metamorphosed H chondrite known), brecciation (an extremely important and ubiquitous process probably experienced by greater than 40 % of all unequilibrated ordinary chondrites), and the group A 5 <b>chondrules</b> in the least metamorphosed ordinary chondrites which have many similarities to <b>chondrules</b> in the highly metamorphosed 'equilibrated' chondrites. Since composition provides insights into both primary formation properties of the chondruies and the effects of metamorphism on the entire assemblage it is possible to determine the petrographic type of RC 075 as 3. 1 with unique certainty. Similarly, the near scheme can be applied to individual <b>chondrules</b> without knowledge of the petrographic type of the host chondrite, which makes it especially suitable for studying breccias. Finally, the new scheme has revealed the existence of <b>chondrules</b> not identified by previous techniques and which appear to be extremely important. Like group A 1 and A 2 <b>chondrules</b> (but unlike group B 1 <b>chondrules)</b> the primitive group A 5 chondruies did not supercool during formation, but unlike group A 1 and A 2 <b>chondrules</b> (and like group B 1 <b>chondrules)</b> they did not suffer volatile loss and reduction during formation. It is concluded that the compositional classification scheme provides important new insights into the formation and history of <b>chondrules</b> and chondrites which would be overlooked by previous schemes...|$|R
