5000|$|This form of {{operation}} has not necessarily been {{a function of}} train length; sometimes {{it was the most}} convenient way to set up push-pull operation in pre-HEP days without <b>converting</b> <b>coaches</b> to cab control operation.

40|$|This chapter contextualizes Dublin’s Pike Theatre Club {{within a}} history of {{collective}} creation in Ireland.

This chapter argues that issues of gender, authorship, authority, and attribution have impacted on the historical positioning of the Pike, revealing collective creation as central to its working processes and showcasing often unacknowledged aspects of Swift’s role in the theatre...|$|E
