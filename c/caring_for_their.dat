25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> horses and grooming them well, are not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range}} of equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E

25|$|Egg depositers: deposit eggs on a {{substrate}} (tank glass, wood, rocks, plants). Egg depositors usually lay fewer eggs than egg-scatterers, {{although the}} eggs are larger. Egg depositors fall into two groups: those that <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eggs, {{and those that do}} not. Among egg depositors that <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> eggs are cichlids and some catfish. Egg depositors that <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young can be divided into two groups: cavity spawners and open spawners.|$|R

25|$|Nurses are {{not truly}} doctor's assistants. This is {{possible}} in certain situations, but nurses more often are independently <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> patients or assisting other nurses. Registered Nurses treat patients, record their medical history, provide emotional support, and provide follow-up care. Nurses also help doctors perform diagnostic tests. Nurses are almost always working {{on their own or}} with other nurses. Nurses will assist doctors in the emergency room or in trauma care when help is needed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear whether the preorbital gland {{secretions}} of North American deer emit an odor that is significant in terms of chemical communication. Most of the time, the glands remain in the closed position, but {{they are capable of}} opening them in certain circumstances. For example, a rutting male may dilate its preorbital glands in order to signal aggression to another nearby male. Female deer often open their glands while <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young.|$|E
25|$|The {{conditions}} affecting {{homeless people}} are somewhat specialized and have {{opened a new}} area of medicine tailored to this population. Skin conditions, including scabies, are common because homeless people are exposed to extreme cold {{in the winter and}} they have little access to bathing facilities. They have problems <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> feet and have more severe dental problems than the general population. Diabetes, especially untreated, is widespread in the homeless population. Specialized medical textbooks have been written to address this for providers.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{the amount}} of time {{adolescents}} spend on work and leisure activities varies greatly by culture as a result of cultural norms and expectations, as well as various socioeconomic factors. American teenagers spend less time in school or working and more time on leisure activities—which include playing sports, socializing, and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> appearance—than do adolescents in many other countries. These differences may be influenced by cultural values of education and {{the amount of}} responsibility adolescents are expected to assume in their family or community.|$|E
25|$|While working {{briefly in}} a {{department}} store, Cotten helped a child wandering through the aisles find her mother. The child was Penny Seeger, and the mother was the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger. Soon after this, Cotten again began working as a maid for Ruth Crawford Seeger and Charles Seeger and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children, Mike, Peggy, Barbara, and Penny. While working with the Seegers (a voraciously musical family that included Pete Seeger, a son of Charles from a previous marriage) she remembered her own guitar playing from 40 years prior {{and picked up the}} instrument again and relearned to play it, almost from scratch.|$|E
25|$|In {{her final}} nine years, Bianco {{interspersed}} children's books with novels for young adults. These all featured {{young people who}} were {{in one way or another}} isolated or alienated from mainstream society and the joy, success, prosperity and social acceptance seemingly enjoyed by their peers. One of those books, Winterbound, about two girls, still in their teenage years, who are called upon to assume adult responsibilities in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young siblings, when the parents have to go away suddenly, was a runner-up for the 1937 Newbery Medal showcasing excellence in youth literature. In 1971, upon the establishment of the Newbery Honor, the work was retroactively distinguished with that prestigious citation.|$|E

25|$|At {{the height}} of his success, Worth {{reformed}} the highly popular trend, the crinoline. It had grown increasingly large in size, making it difficult for women to manage even the most basic activities, such as walking through doors, sitting, <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> children, or holding hands. Worth wanted to design a more practical silhouette for women, so he made the crinoline more narrow and gravitated the largest part to the back, freeing up a woman’s front and sides. Worth’s new crinoline was a major success. Eventually, Worth abandoned the crinoline altogether, creating a straight gown shape without a defined waist that became known as the princess line.|$|E
25|$|In the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), males {{sometimes}} {{see their}} nest full of eggs {{fall prey to}} groups of marauding females; some males, {{when they see a}} group of females approaching, swim away from their nest and start poking their snout into the substrate, as would a female raiding a nest. This distraction display commonly fools the females into behaving as if a nest has been discovered there and they rush to that site, leaving the male's real nest alone. Bowfin (Amia calva) males <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> free-swimming fry exhibit a related distraction display when a potential fry-predator approaches; they move away and thrash about as if injured, drawing the predator's attention toward himself.|$|E

Charlie returns after many years to his family's Brooklyn home and finds that his mother now suffers from dementia. Although she recognizes him, she is mentally confused. Charlie's father, who had broken off contact with the family many years before, does not recognize him. Charlie is only able to reconnect with his now-friendly younger sister, Norma, who had hated him for his mental disability when they were growing up, and is now <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> mother in their newly depressed neighborhood.

25|$|In 2011, {{a nest of}} 15 young Protoceratops andrewsi was {{discovered}} in Mongolia. Stated as being the first Protoceratops nest discovered to date, the discovery suggests that Protoceratops parents might have <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young at nests during at least {{the early stages of}} childhood. As Protoceratops is a relatively basal member of the ceratopsians, the finding also suggests that other ceratopsians provided <b>care</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young as well.|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{honor is}} a quality {{ascribed}} {{to an individual}} in two ways: either by obtaining it through his or her birth into an honorable family or being assigned as honorable by powerful people who hold higher status in the society. An individual's parental lineage, is the traditional source {{for his or her}} honor. Because honor is passed through paternal lineage in most patrilineal cultures, these societies historically considered having sons as a source of pride and honor. For example, in the Moroccan culture, it is still a preference among women to have sons instead of daughters. Morocco is a typical patrilineal society in which the son has a more important function for the family such as the son supports his parents once they have aged compared to the daughter who will marry into a different group becoming a loss to the family. In such societies men also hold more sexual rights compared to women besides the supportive role men obtain from <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> aging parents. Females in these societies are perceived as threats to family honor.|$|E

500|$|One {{possible}} {{advantage to}} lek formation in Guianan cock-of-the-rock is severe selection and consequent rapid evolutionary advancement, {{all of which}} is possible due to the high expendability of males. Only a few males are needed to fertilize the next generation. [...] The courtship behaviour is similarly theorized to have arisen from differences in division of labour between the two sexes. Females expend their energy on building nests and rearing young, while males {{spend most of their time}} and energy of finding mates and <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> plumage.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the fossil}} record of spiders is {{considered}} poor, almost 1000 species have been described from fossils. Because spiders' bodies are quite soft, {{the vast majority of}} fossil spiders have been found preserved in amber. The oldest known amber that contains fossil arthropods dates from [...] in the Early Cretaceous period. In addition to preserving spiders' anatomy in very fine detail, pieces of amber show spiders mating, killing prey, producing silk and possibly <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> young. In a few cases, amber has preserved spiders' egg sacs and webs, occasionally with prey attached; the oldest fossil web found so far is 100million years old. Earlier spider fossils come from a few lagerstätten, places where conditions were exceptionally suited to preserving fairly soft tissues.|$|E
500|$|Holdings in Wales tend to {{be small}} and {{operated}} as family farms. Arable crops and horticulture are limited to southeastern Wales, the Welsh Marches, the northeastern part of the country, the coastal fringes and larger river valleys. Eighty {{percent of the country}} is classified as being in a [...] "Less favoured area". Dairying takes place on improved pasture in lowland areas and beef cattle and sheep are grazed on the uplands and more marginal land. Much of the land at higher elevations is extensive sheepwalk country and is grazed by hardy Welsh Mountain sheep that roam at will. As with other parts of the United Kingdom, farming has been under great pressure, leading to declines {{in the number of people}} employed on the land, the amalgamation of holdings and an increase in part-time farming. Farmhouses have been used for bed-and-breakfast or converted into self-catering accommodation, and farmers have diversified into tourism-related and other activities. Agriculture in Wales is heavily subsidised by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy, and the Welsh government has introduced several schemes designed to encourage the farming community to co-operate in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> land in an environmentally sustainable way.|$|E
