5000|$|Ferrimagnetic {{materials}} are like ferromagnets {{in that they}} hold a spontaneous magnetization below the Curie temperature, and show no magnetic order (are paramagnetic) above this temperature. However, there is sometimes a temperature below the Curie temperature at which the two opposing moments are equal, resulting in a net magnetic moment of zero; {{this is called the}} [...] magnetization <b>compensation</b> <b>point.</b> This <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> is observed easily in garnets and rare earth-transition metal alloys (RE-TM). Furthermore, ferrimagnets may also have an angular momentum <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> at which the net angular momentum vanishes. This <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> is a crucial point for achieving high speed magnetization reversal in magnetic memory devices.|$|E

50|$|Another {{common type}} of {{compensation}} used is the reverse <b>compensation</b> <b>points,</b> where the weaker player takes black, and is given both the first move and <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> too. This is more advantageous than the above situation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Compensation</b> <b>points</b> are {{sometimes}} preferred to stones because the players {{would like to}} play or practice {{as if it is}} an even game. They would like to have the feel of an [...] "even game". White (the stronger player) must play better to overcome these disadvantages (points gained by playing first + <b>compensation</b> <b>points).</b>|$|R

5000|$|... where [...] is the stomatal {{conductance}} for [...] diffusion, [...] is {{the value}} of [...] at the light <b>compensation</b> <b>point,</b> [...] is [...] assimilation rate of the leaf, [...] is the vapour pressure deficit, [...] is the leaf-surface CO2 concentration, [...] is the CO2 <b>compensation</b> <b>point.</b> [...] and [...] are empirical coefficients.|$|E
50|$|In {{assimilation}} terms, at <b>compensation</b> <b>point,</b> the net {{carbon dioxide}} assimilation is zero. Leaves release CO2 by photorespiration and day respiration, but CO2 is also converted into carbohydrate by photosynthesis. Assimilation is therefore {{the difference in}} the rate of these processes. At a normal partial pressure of CO2 (0.343 hPa in 1980), there is an irradiation at which the net assimilation of CO2 is zero. For instance, in the early morning and late evenings, the <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> may be reached as photosynthetic activity decreases and respiration increases. Therefore, the partial pressure of CO2 at the <b>compensation</b> <b>point,</b> also known as gamma, is a function of irradiation. The irradiation dependence of the <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> is explained by the RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) concentration. When the acceptor RuBP is in saturated concentration, gamma is independent of irradiation. However at low irradiation, {{only a small fraction of}} the sites on RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase enzyme (Rubisco) have the electron acceptor RuBP. This decreases the photosynthetic activity and therefore affects gamma. The intracellular concentration of CO2 affects the rates of photosynthesis and photo respiration. At higher carbon dioxide concentrations, the photosynthesis rate is higher, while at low CO2 concentrations, photo respiration is higher.|$|E

50|$|When ranks are equal, Black gets {{advantages}} {{by playing}} first. The {{advantage of that}} first move is compensated by <b>compensation</b> <b>points.</b> However, there are still no absolute standards {{on the number of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> due to the difficulty of determining a fair value. 6.5 points are used in Japan and Korea. 7.5 points are used in China and America (see AGA rules). The 0.5 point is used to prevent a draw.|$|R
50|$|When the {{difference}} in strength is one rank, no handicap stone is given. Instead the stronger player takes White but without <b>compensation</b> <b>points.</b> The <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> are called Komi in Japanese. It is a custom that Black plays first; White moves second. Playing first {{is regarded as a}} significant advantage in modern go, and to make the game fair to both players, this advantage must be compensated. It is regarded that playing first is equal to half a move or more ahead throughout the game.|$|R

5000|$|The {{compensation}} depth between photosynthesis and respiration of phytoplankton in {{the ocean}} must be dependent on some factors: the illumination at the surface, the transparency of the water, the biological character of the plankton present, and the temperature.

40|$|AbstractThe {{magnetic}} {{behavior of}} pseudobinary Pr 0. 7 Tb 0. 3 Al 2 and Pr 0. 75 Tb 0. 25 Al 2 compounds was studied, and a predominant ferrimagnetic ordering was observed.

This EB-like effect was observed at temperatures below the <b>compensation</b> <b>points.</b> The effect is somewhat {{different from the one}} already studied in similar systems combining light and heavy rare earths.

50|$|A concern {{regarding}} {{the concept of}} <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> is it assumes that phytoplankton remain at a fixed depth throughout a 24-hour period (time frame in which compensation depth is measured), but phytoplankton experience displacement due to isopycnals moving them tens of meters.|$|E
50|$|By far {{the most}} common type of komi is a fixed <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> system.

40|$|Mutants {{of barley}} (Hordeum vulgare L. cv Maris Mink) with 47 or 66 % of the {{glutamine}} synthetase (GS) {{activity of the}} wild type were used for studies of NH 3 exchange with the atmosphere. Under normal light and temperature conditions, tissue NH 4 + concentrations {{were higher in the}} two mutants compared with wild-type plants, and this was accompanied by higher NH 3 emission from the leaves. The emission of NH 3 increased with increasing leaf temperatures in both wild-type and mutant plants, but the increase was much more pronounced in the mutants. Similar results were found when the light intensity (photosynthetic photon flux density) was increased. <b>Compensation</b> <b>points</b> for NH 3 were estimated by exposing intact shoots to 10 nmol NH 3 mol- 1 air under conditions with increasing temperatures until the plants started to emit NH 3. Referenced to 25 [deg]C, the <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> were 5. 0 nmol mol- 1 for wild-type plants, 8. 3 nmol mol- 1 for 47 % GS mutants, and 11. 8 nmol mol- 1 for 66 % GS mutants. <b>Compensation</b> <b>points</b> for NH 3 in single, nonsenescent leaves were estimated on the basis of apoplastic pH and NH 4 + concentrations. These values were 0. 75, 3. 46, and 7. 72 nmol mol- 1 for wild type, 47 % GS mutants, and 66 % GS mutants, respectively. The 66 % GS mutant always showed higher tissue NH 4 + concentrations, NH 3 emission rates, and NH 3 <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> compared with the 47 % GS mutant, indicating that NH 4 + release was curtailed by some kind of compensatory mechanism in plants with only 47 % GS activit...|$|R
50|$|Draper et al.'s (1985) mounds {{received}} 5 {{times the}} amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) summed over all sampled microsites throughout the first growing season; the control treatment consistently received about 14% of daily background PAR, while mounds received over 70%. By November, fall frosts had reduced shading, eliminating the differential. Quite apart from its effect on temperature, incident radiation is also important photosynthetically. The average control microsite was exposed to levels of light above the <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> for only 3 hours, i.e., one-quarter of the daily light period, whereas mounds received light above the <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> for 11 hours, i.e., 86% of the same daily period. Assuming that incident light in the 100-600 µEm‾²s‾1 intensity range is the most important for photosynthesis, the mounds received over 4 times the total daily light energy that reached the control microsites.|$|E
50|$|As {{no one can}} be {{absolutely}} sure what the fair number of compensation points is, some advocate another system which is often used in some amateur matches and tournaments. There are no fixed compensation points. The decision is left to both players. They arrive at a value through negotiation and bidding. This is called auction <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> system.|$|E
50|$|The (light) <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> is {{the amount}} of light {{intensity}} on the light curve where the rate of photosynthesis exactly matches the rate of respiration. At this point, the uptake of CO2 through photosynthetic pathways is exactly matched to the respiratory release of carbon dioxide, and the uptake of O2 by respiration is exactly matched to the photosynthetic release of oxygen.|$|E
50|$|In {{the game}} of Go, a {{handicap}} is given by means of stones and <b>compensation</b> <b>points.</b> In contrast to an even game, in which Black plays first, White plays the first move in a game with handicap (after Black's handicap stones have been placed).|$|R
40|$|Low CO 2 <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> {{have been}} found to be {{associated}} with several unusual characteristics related to photosynthesis. One such characteristic is a prominent, chlorenchymatous vascular bundle sheath in the leaves. It has been suggested that the presence of this sheath in dicotyledons can serve as a means of detecting low CO 2 -compensating species. We collected 88 dicotyledon species from 22 families reported to have chlorenchymatous sheaths. Of the 88, only three, Tribulus terrestris, L., Boerhaavia paniculata, L. C. Rich, and Trianthema portulacastrum L., had low CO 2 <b>compensation</b> <b>points.</b> Cross sections of the leaves of the other species revealed that they did have chlorenchymatous vascular bundle sheaths. However, these sheath cells contained chloroplasts which were not specialized for starch formation as were the bundle sheath chloroplasts of the low CO 2 -compensating species...|$|R
50|$|Students {{who receive}} an improbatur {{in any of}} the {{obligatory}} exams fail the entire exam. However, a single failed obligatory exam may be compensated for by good results in other exams. Based on the compensation system, the total exam score of the student is calculated and compared with the result of the failed test. To receive their diploma, a student must accumulate sufficient <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> from the other exams. The improbatur is divided into four classes (i+, i, i&minus;, i=), each describing the degree of a student's failure (i+ is the least failure), and each class has its own number of <b>compensation</b> <b>points</b> needed for an acceptable result (12, 14, 16 and 18 respectively). Points from accepted exams are awarded as follows: L, seven points; E, six; M, five; C, four; B, three and A, two.|$|R
50|$|Only if {{the light}} {{intensity}} is above a plant specific value, called the <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> the plant assimilates more carbon and releases more oxygen by photosynthesis than it consumes by cellular respiration {{for its own}} current energy demand.Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf.

5000|$|The photic zone, {{euphotic}} zone (Greek for [...] "well lit": [...] "well" [...] + [...] "light"), or sunlight or (Sunlit) zone is {{the depth of}} the water in a lake or ocean that is exposed to such intensity of sunlight which designates <b>compensation</b> <b>point,</b> i.e. the intensity of light at which the rate of carbon dioxide uptake, or equivalently, the rate of oxygen production, is equal to the rate of carbon dioxide production, equivalently to the rate of oxygen consumption, reducing thus the net carbon dioxide assimilation to zero.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main factors that {{contribute}} to net forest productivity: carbon dioxide concentration, root respiration rates, temperature and photosynthesis. carbon dioxide alone tends to decrease leaf and root respiration by lowering the light <b>compensation</b> <b>point</b> of photosynthesis, allowing for a net positive gain in carbon intake {{during the course of a}} day. The reduction of root respiration tends to initiate root growth and ultimately results in an improvement in nutrient and water uptake efficiency. When photosynthesis is added to the effects of carbon dioxide, depending on regional temperature, forest productivity is drastically increased. The combination of all four physiological factors results in a significant net increase in forest productivity. According to experimental results, tree species with long lived evergreen foliage tend to benefit the greatest in a carbon dioxide rich environment because of their longer growing season and adaptations like canopy development that allow them to thrive in the temperate polar paleolatitudes of the Cretaceous.|$|E
