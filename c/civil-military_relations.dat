40|$|Indonesia’s {{military}} reform resulted cultural, structural, doctrinal {{and organizational}} changes. But those changes are not fundamental enough to build democratic <b>civil–military</b> <b>relation</b> {{that relies on}} civilian supremacy. The process of military reform in Indonesia showed us {{that the success of}} democratization of <b>civil–military</b> <b>relation</b> depends on institutional setup of the military related to civilian institutions’ persistency, guidance, and initiative. This study used Peter D. Feaver’s theory of “principal-agent” to show that the lack of civilian institutions’ coherence and resoluteness caused persisting problems to the Indonesia’s military reform under democratic system. Civilian supremacy in Indonesia appears to be relied on “voluntary subordination” of the military rather than effective civilian control over the military. Hence, instructive policies and legal basis become very important to yield a complete subordination of the military to the civil within democratic system. This argument confronts the existing studies, especially those with political perspective, that tended to accept the idea that military supremacy in politics is needed to build a strong nation state and to uphold the constitution.

25|$|<b>Civil–military</b> <b>relations</b> (Civ-Mil or CMR) {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} civil {{society as a whole}} and the military organization or organizations established to protect it. More narrowly, it {{describes the}} relationship between the civil authority of a given society and its military authority. Studies of <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> often rest on a normative assumption that civilian control of the military is preferable to military control of the state. The principal problem they examine, however, is empirical: to explain how civilian control over the military is established and maintained.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} show that active role of agencies allows an adequate <b>civil–military</b> <b>relation</b> to be established despite of some constrains {{to the relationship between}} the two. Employing qualitative approach to assess civil–military cooperation in empowering Papuan society, the case study shows how the military and civilian collaborated to subdue the social tension in a territory prone to conflict. The result suggests that military component took pivotal role in maintaining peace and national security in Papua. Through its history, Indonesian government planned Papua development with military’s involvement on one side, yet without any attempt to embrace the subject of that development itself on the other. This expectedly gave rise to the dispute between military and civilian. However, civil–military cooperation in empowering indigenous Papuan based on local culture and local people initiative proven to be effective in reducing the risk of conflict, {{in addition to being a}} case of how the role of agencies could be vital in the making of a better condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore civil {{military}} relations, ethnocentric accentuation and the difficulties faced by Zimbabwe in the formative years of independence. The objectives tives that guided the study were to discuss the link between civil <b>civil-military</b> military <b>relations</b> and ethnicity, and to evaluate the role of youth during the post post-conflict conflict recovery and reconstruction period. The researchers used interviews and documentary analysis to gather data. The results showed that the youth can play either a destructive or constructive role in peace building. The post post-conflict conflict recovery period is fraught with many dangers which can either stabilise or destabilise the post independence civil- politico ico- military architecture and peace building. The recommendation is that post post-conflict conflict recovery and reconstruction should be done in the context of stable civil <b>civil-military</b> military <b>relations.</b> The researchers concluded that the youths played a prominent role in the construction and deconstruction of the post independence peace process in Zimbabwe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} the recent {{experience}} of Kenya and Zimbabwe to demonstrate how power-sharing has played out in Africa. Although the two cases share some superficial similarities, variation in the strength and disposition of key veto players generated radically different contexts that shaped the feasibility and impact of unity government. Explaining the number and attitude of veto players requires a comparative analysis {{of the evolution of}} <b>civil-military</b> and intra-elite <b>relations.</b> In Zimbabwe, the exclusionary use of violence and rhetoric, together with the militarisation of politics, created far greater barriers to genuine power-sharing, resulting in the politics of continuity. These veto players were less significant in the Kenyan case, giving rise to a more cohesive outcome {{in the form of the}} politics of collusion. However, we find that neither mode of power-sharing creates the conditions for effective reform, which leads to a more general conclusion: unity government serves to postpone conflict, rather than to resolve it.

25|$|The {{military}} cannot {{continue to}} be an organization with unmatched institutional reach and political influence, while limiting state capacity, because in doing {{so it will be}} evermore challenging for civilian supremacy to take a stance, thus establishing effective <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations.</b> If these problems are not addressed properly, as long as <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> of countries continue to interact within undefined boundaries, without clear subordination and authority and with the constrictions of limited budgets, it is unlikely that countries that still struggle with the concept will achieve a stable and efficient civil-military relationship, something that will continue to damage state capacity and stability.|$|E
25|$|After {{observing that}} most civil-military theory {{assumes that the}} {{civilian}} and military worlds must necessarily be separate, both physically and ideologically, Rebecca L. Schiff offered a new theory—Concordance—as an alternative. One of the key questions in <b>Civil-Military</b> <b>Relations</b> (CMR) theory {{has always been to}} determine under what conditions the military will intervene in the domestic politics of the nation. Most scholars agree with the theory of objective civilian control of the military (Huntington), which focuses on the separation of civil and military institutions. Such a view concentrates and relies heavily on the U.S. case, from an institutional perspective, and especially during the Cold War period. Schiff provides an alternative theory, from both institutional and cultural perspectives, that explains the U.S. case as well as several non-U.S. <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> case studies.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem throughout most of American history was to keep its standing army small, relying on augmentation from militias (the predecessor of modern-day Reserve forces, to include the National Guard) and volunteers. While armed forces were built up during wartime, the pattern after every war up to and including World War II was to demobilize quickly and return to something approaching pre-war force levels. However, {{with the advent of the}} Cold War in the 1950s, the need to create and maintain a sizable peacetime military force engendered new concerns of militarism and about how such a large force would affect <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> in the United States. For the first time in American history, the problem of <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> would have to be managed during peacetime.|$|E
40|$|The Polaris and Trident II SLBM weapon {{systems were}} {{developed}} by the U. S. Navy during periods of major strategic nuclear modernization, when national leaders {{were concerned about the}} vulnerability of U. S. Air Force land based nuclear forces to Soviet attack. Both Navy systems provided a superior alternative to bomber and ICBM weapon systems of the time, but only Polaris provoked innovative changes in U. S. nuclear doctrine. These cases of innovative and stagnant doctrine are compared and used to test the explanatory power of three competing theories of the sources of innovative military doctrine. The three theories hypothesize independent, explanatory roles for civil-military conflict, intra service bargaining, and interservice competition. The first case shows a strong causal link between intense interservice competition, a Navy decision to develop Polaris as an alternative to Air Force land based forces, and an ensuing improvement in the survivability of those land based forces. The second case shows a somewhat weaker correlation between institutionalized interservice cooperation, a Navy decision to develop Trident II as a complement rather than an alternative to land based forces, and the absence of any ensuing improvement in the survivability of those forces. Thus, Polaris caused an innovative change in nuclear doctrine while Trident II did not, and the cases show that differing patterns of interservice relations {{had more to do with}} these outcomes than <b>civil-military</b> or intraservice <b>relations.</b> The thesis concludes with a discussion of the sources of different patterns of interservice relations, and argues that civilian defense leaders can manipulate interservice competition to cause doctrinal innovation. by Owen Reid Cote, Jr. Thesis (Ph.

Politicians discussed abolishing the military. Modesto Rodas Alvarado, the Liberal Party's candidate for president, ran on a demilitarization platform and was expected to win the election on 13 October 1963.

25|$|Professor Samuel Edward Finer (22 September 1915 – 9 June 1993) was a {{political}} scientist and historian who was instrumental in advancing political studies as an academic subject in the United Kingdom, pioneering the study of UK political institutions.

25|$|Most {{debate in}} <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> assumed that a {{separation}} between the civilian and military world was inevitable and likely necessary. The argument had been over whether to control {{the gap between the}} two (Huntington) or to minimize the gap by enacting certain policies (Janowitz). Following the end of the Cold War in 1989, however, the discussion began to focus {{on the nature of the}} apparent gap between civilian and military cultures and, more specifically, whether that gap had reached such proportions as to pose a danger to civilian control of the military. Part of the debate was based on the cultural differences between the more liberal civilian society and the conservative military society, and on the recognition that such differences had apparently become more pronounced than in past years.|$|E
25|$|While {{generally}} {{not considered a}} separate academic area of study in and of itself, it involves scholars and practitioners from many fields and specialties. Apart from political science and sociology, Civ-Mil (CMR) draws upon such diverse fields as law, philosophy, area studies, psychology, cultural studies, anthropology, economics, history, diplomatic history, journalism, and the military, among others. It involves study and discussion of a diverse range of issues including but not limited to: civilian control of the military, military professionalism, war, civil-military operations, military institutions, and other related subjects. International in scope, <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> involves discussion and research from across the world. The theoretical discussion can include non-state actors {{as well as more}} traditional nation-states. Other research involves discerning the details of military political attitudes, voting behavior, and the potential impact on and interaction with democratic society as well as military families.|$|E
25|$|The {{ramifications of}} the Cold War, {{specifically}} the American decision {{to maintain a}} large standing army {{for the first time}} in its history, led to concerns about whether such a large military structure could be effectively maintained by a liberal democracy. Samuel P. Huntington and Morris Janowitz published the seminal books on the subject which effectively brought <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> into academia, particularly in political science and sociology. Despite the peculiarly American impetus for Huntington's and Janowitz's writing, their theoretical arguments are often used in the study of other national civil-military studies. However, in his book The Man on Horseback, Samuel E. Finer countered some of Huntington's arguments and assumptions, and offered a look into the civil-military relationships in the under-developed world. Finer observed that many governments do not have the administrative skills to efficiently govern which may open opportunities for military intervention—opportunities that are not as likely in more developed countries.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian Army was {{the main}} protagonist of the Gobierno Revolucionario de las Fuerzas Armadas (Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces), an {{institutionalized}} military government that ruled the country between 1968 and 1980. During this period, defense expenditures underwent exponential growth allowing a rapid expansion of the Armed Forces and an unprecedented level of weapon acquisitions. In the early 1970s, US influence over the Army {{was replaced by a}} massive influx of Soviet training and equipment, including T-55 tanks, the BM-21 Grad, AK series rifles and the BTR series APCs plus a new Soviet-styled national military strategy of regaining the lost southern provinces which were now part of Chile. Political power returned to the civilians in the 1980s, but the rise of the terrorist insurgent group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) prompted the deployment of several Army units in a counter-insurgency role. Human rights violations associated with this intervention and a sharp decrease in the defense budget due to a general economic crisis caused serious problems for the Army morale and readiness as well as a strain on <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The March 1994 Washington Agreement, {{ended the}} Croat–Bosniak War and created {{conditions}} for provision of US {{military aid to}} Croatia. Croatia requested US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI) to provide training of <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations,</b> programme and budget services of the HV the same month, and the MPRI training was licensed by the US Department of State upon endorsement from Richard Holbrooke in August. The MPRI was hired because the UN arms embargo was still in place, ostensibly to prepare the HV for NATO Partnership for Peace programme participation. They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 weeks from January to April 1995. It was also speculated that the MPRI also provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite information to Croatia. MPRI and Croatian officials dismissed such speculation. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, in effect allowing the HV to supply itself as 30% of arms and ammunition shipped through Croatia was kept as a trans-shipment fee. The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton since February 1993.|$|E
25|$|Feaver {{argued that}} his theory was {{different}} from other theories or models {{in that it was}} purely deductive, based on democratic theory rather than on anecdotal evidence, and better enabled analysis of day-to-day decisions and actions {{on the part of the}} civilian and military leadership It operated at the intersection of Huntington's institutional approach and Janowitz's sociological point of view. Huntington concentrated on the relationship between civilian leadership and the military qua institution while Janowitz focused on the relationship of the military qua individuals to American society. Agency theory provided a link between the two enabling an explanation of how <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> work on a day-to-day basis. Specifically, agency theory would predict that the result of a regime of intrusive monitoring by the civilian leadership combined with shirking on the part of the military would result in the highest levels of civil-military conflict. Feaver suggested that post-Cold War developments had so profoundly reduced the perceived costs of monitoring and reduced the perceived expectation of punishment that the gap between what civilians ask the military to do and what the military would prefer to do had increased to unprecedented levels.|$|E

500|$|At a {{press conference}} on 30 November 1950, Truman {{was asked about the}} use of nuclear weapons: The {{implication}} was that the authority to use atomic weapons now rested in the hands of MacArthur. Truman's White House issued a clarification, noting that [...] "only the President can authorize the use of the atom bomb, and no such authorization has been given," [...] yet the comment still caused a domestic and international stir.

[...] His relief of MacArthur cast a long shadow over American <b>civil-military</b> <b>relations</b> for decades.
