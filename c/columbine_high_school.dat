5|$|After the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> {{massacre}} on April 20, 1999, {{gun shows}} and background checks became {{a focus of}} national debate in the United States. Weeks after the Columbine shooting, Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.|$|E
5|$|Keyes' {{supporters}} {{formed a}} new third party, America's Independent Party, for his presidential candidacy. America's Independent Party gained the affiliation of a faction of California's American Independent Party. However, the AIP ticket, which had Brian Rohrbough, {{father of a}} victim of the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre, of Colorado as its vice presidential candidate, was only on the ballot in California, Colorado, and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1999 <b>Columbine,</b> Colorado <b>High</b> <b>School</b> Massacre, where 12 {{students}} and one teacher were killed and 24 were injured by two senior student shooters, Congressman Rothman authored and had enacted into law [...] "The Secure Our Schools Act," [...] (2000) which provided federal hundreds of millions of matching funds to communities across his district and across the country so that schools could keep weapons and strangers out of schools. Under the Act, towns can apply for funds to be used for school security assessments, security training of personnel and students, and for improved coordination with law enforcement officials as well as to install metal detectors, locks, and improved lighting.|$|R

5|$|On May 4, 1999, {{following}} the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre and increasing news media {{reports on the}} effects on violent films, games, and other media on society, the United States Senate Commerce committee held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths. The committee focused specifically on horror films.

5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG!, {{abbreviated}} SCMRPG!, is a role-playing {{video game}} created by Danny Ledonne and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> shootings near Littleton, Colorado. Players assume {{the roles of}} gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and act out the massacre, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins {{on the day of}} the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in perdition.|$|E

5|$|Since 1953, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma have {{commissioned}} {{a new work}} for wind band to be premiered at almost every National Intercollegiate Band concert. This program was begun {{to add to the}} wind repertoire under the direction of Grand President Hugh McMillen, and is the longest-running commissioning project in the United States. A number of these commissioned compositions have garnered national acclaim, including Robert Russell Bennett's Symphonic Songs for Band and Karel Husa's Concerto for Trumpet and Wind Orchestra. In the years following the start of the national commissioning program, local chapters have begun to commission new band works themselves, such as Frank Ticheli's An American Elegy, commissioned by the Alpha Iota chapter in memory of the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 1999, <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> {{students}} Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold {{shot dead}} 12 {{students and a}} teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In {{the aftermath of the}} school shooting, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, in fact, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.|$|E
5|$|As {{predicted}} {{through the}} actions of the boys in the film, there were numerous news reports of underage South Park fans engaging in unsuccessful attempts to gain entrance to the film at theaters. There were reports of adolescents purchasing tickets for WB's own Wild Wild West and instead sitting in to see South Park. This came {{as a result of a}} movie-industry crackdown that would make it tougher for children to sneak into R-rated films, as proposed by President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre, which occurred two months before the film's release. South Park was cited, along with American Pie, as an explicit film released in the summer of 1999 tempting teens to sneak into theaters. When the film was released in the United Kingdom in August 1999, there were similar reports of the film drawing an underage crowd.|$|E
2500|$|A {{permanent}} memorial [...] "to {{honor and}} remember {{the victims of the}} April 20, 1999 shootings at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> School" [...] was dedicated on September 21, 2007, in Clement Park, a meadow adjacent to the school where impromptu memorials were held in the days following the shooting. The memorial fund raised $1.5 million in donations over eight years of planning.|$|R
50|$|Scott and Nimmo later {{published}} {{two more}} books inspired by their {{daughter and her}} legacy: Rachel Smiles: The Spiritual Legacy of Columbine Martyr Rachel Scott, and The Journals of Rachel Joy Scott: A Journey of Faith at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High.</b> The books were published in 2001 and 2002 respectively. Both parents have expressed their hope that {{those who did not}} know their daughter would find inspiration in the books' description of the principles their daughter had lived during her life.|$|R
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. The two boys collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|R
5|$|Before the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like Columbine possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E
5|$|In 1998–99, {{with the}} {{addition}} of the Nashville Predators to the league, the NHL realigned their divisions and the Colorado Avalanche were put in the new Northwest Division. Despite a slow 2–6–1 start, Colorado finished with a 44–28–10 record for 98 points, won the Northwest Division and finished second in the Western Conference. Between January 10 and February 7, the Avalanche had their longest winning streak ever with 12 games. Following the <b>Columbine</b> <b>High</b> <b>School</b> massacre, Colorado postponed their first two playoff games to a later date; they would wear patches in honor of the Columbine victims on their jerseys during the playoffs. After defeating both the San Jose Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first two rounds, Colorado met the Presidents' Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in seven games. Peter Forsberg, the playoffs leading scorer with 24 points (8 goals and 16 assists), was again elected to the league's first All-Star team and Chris Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy for the best rookie of the season. Together with Milan Hejduk, both were elected for the NHL All-Rookie Team {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
