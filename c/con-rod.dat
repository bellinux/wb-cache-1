25|$|On 23 September 2006, 55 022 (D9000) Royal Scots Grey {{returned}} to the main line after a lengthy and extensive restoration at Barrow Hill, carried out {{on behalf of the}} owners by the DPS. It successfully hauled the SRPS 'Moray Mint' railtour from Edinburgh to Inverness, via Perth on the outward trip and back via Aberdeen. On its second working two weeks later, severe damage occurred to the number 2 end engine. The engine suffered from a leg out of bed, a term which means the engine <b>con-rod</b> breaks out of the engine crankcase. This left Royal Scots Grey still able to operate but on one engine only. By January 2007, the faulty power unit was removed from 55 022, put into storage and replaced by an ex-marine Napier Deltic engine modified for rail use; work was completed by Royal Scots Greys dedicated team in August 2007. After extensive testing at the East Lancs Railway the locomotive hauled its first tour since the previous engine malfunction on RTC's 'Autumn Highlander' with 50 049 and 40 145 in October 2007. 55 022 successfully hauled a number of charter tour services during 2008 but the replacement marine-sourced engine gave rise for concern following the discovery of oil in the coolant {{and at the end of}} August the locomotive was removed from future large railtour duties. The locomotive continued working mainline duty by visiting other preserved railway and moving other non-mainline registered locomotives.|$|E

The PM' tooling for the compaction-sinter-size route was manufactured after extensive FEM and experimental stress analyses. After successful fatigue testing, the <b>con-rods</b> achieved final engine testing without any failures. The duration corresponded to 150. 000 to 300. 000 km normal european operational service...|$|R

The manufacturing process is still under optimizations. It is an economical must to reach a high quality standart an low costs for mass products like pistons and <b>con-rods.</b> It is seen that ultrasonic techniques are suitable {{to serve as a}} fast and easy to apply method to characterize MMC and thus to support the optimizations of manufacturing parameters. Ultrasonic backscattering is used to visualize the local distribution of the reinforcement in surface layers of pistons and <b>con-rods</b> {{as well as for the}} visualization of the distribution in the bulk of <b>con-rods.</b> Ultrasonic time-of-flight measurements are applied to characterize the elastic anisotropy and ultrasonic velocities are determined to quantify the local content on short fiber reinforcement...|$|R
50|$|The Peugeot design {{works by}} varying the {{effective}} {{length of the}} con-rods connecting the piston to the crank. When the <b>con-rod</b> is shorter, the compression ratio is lower and vice versa. On the left hand-side of the diagram is the conventional piston of an internal combustion engine. On the right is an hydraulic cylinder with double-acting piston. This acts through a rod-crank system with a gear wheel, whose movement adjusts the effective <b>con-rod</b> length and thus the compression ratio in the left cylinder.|$|E

50|$|To {{achieve this}} aim Honda could have looked {{to follow their}} 1960's {{practice}} of {{increasing the number of}} cylinders to produce more power. However, Grand Prix rules at the time required a configuration with maximum of four combustion chambers. Honda engineers therefore came up with the highly innovative solution of constructing a 'V8' engine {{in the form of a}} four-cylinder. This was achieved by designing an oval piston that allowed a total of 8 valves per cylinder, and connecting two <b>con-rods</b> to each piston. Such a configuration led to almost unprecedented complexity in terms of engine design, with 32 valves and eight <b>con-rods</b> incorporated into the dimensions of a regular four-cylinder motorcycle engine.|$|R

50|$|Dynamic {{balance of}} in-line 4's {{requires}} a weight matched set of pistons and <b>con-rods.</b> The <b>con-rods</b> must be matched for rotating {{mass of the}} big end taken to be lower 1/3 of the rod and reciprocating mass of little end taken to be the other 2/3. It {{is not possible to}} install the rods and pistons on the crank in a dynamic balancing machine. Even if it was, any rotating out of balance would be undetectable due to the secondary out balance. All cranks are balanced at manufacture to OEM spec, this is adequate for domestic use. As performance cars are usually stripped of interior and have harder suspension the vibration from the engine becomes less of a consideration so balancing to better than OEM spec is of little worth. If a crank has been re-worked then it needs re-balancing to OEM spec.|$|R

50|$|The Scuderi engine, {{as shown}} in the {{animated}} illustration, has highly desaxe cylinders. The compressor (blue) is offset a greater amount than the power cylinder (yellow).

50|$|Due to World SuperBike engine {{displacement}} regulations, the engine in the R variant of 1299 Panigale retains the old 1,198 cc displacement, {{with the addition}} of a tungsten-balanced crankshaft, titanium valves and <b>con-rods,</b> and two-ring pistons. Power figures for the R are same as other 1299 models with 150.8 kW (205 hp) @ 11,500 rpm, torque is down 6.2 lb-ft to 100.5 lb-ft (136.2 Nm) @ 10,250 rpm.|$|R
50|$|The Aston Martin Vantage GT2's {{engine is}} a {{modified}} version of the standard 4.3 litre Aston Martin V8 from the road car. The larger 4.5 litre engine retains the road car’s cylinder block, heads and crankshaft, but uses competition components, including cylinder heads, <b>con-rods,</b> valves, camshafts and a racing exhaust system. The developed engine features a dry sump lubrication system allowing the engine to be positioned low in the chassis, for an optimised centre of gravity.|$|R
50|$|At {{speed the}} {{locomotive}} {{will tend to}} surge fore-and-aft and nose, or sway, from side to side. It will also tend to pitch and rock. This article looks at these motions that originate from unbalanced inertia forces and couples in the 2 steam engines and their coupled wheels (some similar motions {{may be caused by}} irregularities in the track running surface and stiffness). The first two motions are caused by the reciprocating masses and the last two by the oblique action of the <b>con-rods,</b> or piston thrust, on the guide bars.|$|R
50|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Fiat SOHC engine its massively over-square proportions. This over-square design allows large (within the constrains of a reverse-flow configuration) valve sizes relative to engine capacity. A secondary benefit is the short crank throw reduces the accelerative forces on the <b>con-rod</b> allowing the engine to operate at significantly increased engine-speeds. The original engine's limit was only reached at 8000 rpm.|$|E

50|$|In a {{double-acting}} steam engine, {{as used in}} {{a railway}} locomotive, {{the direction of the}} vertical thrust on the slide bar is always upwards when running forward. It varies from nothing at the end of stroke to a maximum at half stroke when the angle between the <b>con-rod</b> and crank are greatest. When the crank-pin drives the piston, as when coasting, the piston thrust is downwards. The position of maximum thrust is shown by the increased wear at the middle of the slide bars.|$|E
50|$|A {{crankshaft}} is {{subjected to}} enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft {{is connected to the}} fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to torque), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective <b>con-rods.</b> An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area. The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary flat-4 boxer engines have {{excellent}} secondary balance {{at the expense}} of rocking couples due to opposing pistons being staggered (offset front to back). The above-mentioned rotational vibration on the X axis is much smaller than in an inline-4 because the pairs of <b>con-rods</b> swinging up and down together move at different centre of gravity heights (different left-right position in this case). Another important imbalance somewhat inherent to boxer-four that is often not dialed out in the design is its irregular exhaust pulse on one bank of two cylinders. Please see flat-four burble explanation part of flat-four engine article on this exhaust requirement similar to the crossplane V8 exhaust peculiarity.|$|R
5000|$|In a V-twin engine the {{cylinders}} form a [...] "V" [...] around the crankshaft. A Vee-angle of 90°, as used by Ducati and Moto Guzzi, can give perfect {{primary and secondary}} balance, with a pleasingly irregular firing order. A lesser angle gives a more compact motor, but one which is prone to vibration, such as 42° (Indian), 45° (Harley-Davidson), 52° Honda, and 60° (Aprilia). Most V-twins have a single crankpin shared by side-by-side connecting rods (so that {{the cylinders}} are slightly offset), but a variation {{is to have a}} single crankpin with [...] "fork & blade" [...] <b>con-rods,</b> to keep the cylinders in line. Non-90° V-twins may have offset crankpins to try to reduce vibration.|$|R
50|$|The design, an {{implementation}} of the Larsen VCR engine, consisted of a monobloc head, which contained all of the valve gear, and the crankshaft/crankcase assembly. These parts were connected by a pivot which allowed 4 degrees of movement controlled by a hydraulic actuator. This mechanism allows {{the distance between the}} crankshaft centre line and the cylinder crown to be varied. Unlike the Peugeot design, the effective <b>con-rod</b> length is fixed.A supercharger was chosen in preference to a turbocharger to achieve the necessary response time and high boost pressure.|$|E

He was fifth in the 350cc Formula 1 TT, and retired from the Junior TT on the last lap with a broken <b>con-rod</b> whilst lying eleventh. He was seventh at the end of the first lap of the Senior TT, but struggled with torrential rain and high winds and eventually finished sixteenth.|$|E
50|$|A Manson-Guise {{engine is}} an {{improved}} {{version of a}} Manson engine. It {{is a type of}} hot air engine, converting a temperature difference into motion. There is a hot side and a cold side to the engine. Providing there is a large enough temperature difference between the two sides the engine will run. The Manson-Guise engine is probably the simplest type of hot air engines having only a single <b>con-rod,</b> with a displacer piston and power piston that move at the same time. Manson-Guise engines seem to be fairly unique in the fact that they can run in either direction (flywheel can run clockwise or anti-clockwise).|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} this victory the first 650 cc {{production}} models left the factory. The bikes carried the finest components {{available at the}} time, from British Smiths instruments, Pankl <b>con-rods,</b> Ceriani suspension, Mondial pistons, to Bosch electrical parts and (revolutionary at the time!) Japanese Nippon-Denso starter, thus eliminating the one problem plaguing nearly all contemporary British and Italian motorcycles at the time: their electrical unreliability. [...] The 650 cc offered superior comfort and stability with its handling at least equivalent to the competition. [...] Of course, it also carried a high price. It is difficult to quantify production quantities since frame numbering was shared with the 750 launched in May 1968 - as few as 52 or up to 200 Laverda 650 cc were produced.|$|R
5000|$|The roadgoing {{version of}} the engine was reconfigured with reduced inlet and exhaust port sizes, {{different}} camshaft profiles, no dry sump configuration and Bosch K-jetronic replacing the specialised Kugelfischer fuel injection. These changes helped bring power down to the required [...] specification, but still resulted in a [...] "remarkably flexible engine, with a very flat torque curve and a wide power band". The heads for the engines were cast at Cosworth's Coscast foundry in Worcester and sent to Germany to be fitted {{to the rest of}} the engine, parts of which were different from the standard 2.3 including light pressed alloy pistons, and rings designed to withstand higher engine speeds, whilst <b>con-rods,</b> bearings and bearing caps were found to be strong enough as standard and left unaltered.|$|R
5000|$|Martinsyde {{motorcycles}} {{were offered}} with sidecars and the Martinsyde 680 {{was followed by}} a 500 cc model in 1920, with a sports version in 1921. In 1922 Martinsyde produced a 738 cc sports V-twin, named the Quick Six which produced [...] and was capable of 80 mph. The engine featured their normal overhead exhaust and side-valve inlet, but Ricardo pistons, accurately balanced flywheels, all reciprocating parts lightened, nickel steel <b>con-rods</b> machined all over, and close ratio three speed gearbox. Martinsyde were experimenting with new designs, including valve gear controlled by leaf springs, when their Woking factory was destroyed by a fire in 1922, forcing them into liquidation having produced over 2,000 motorcycles. The company's motorcycle manufacturing rights were purchased by Bat Motor Manufacturing Co. Ltd, who produced a number of twin-cylinder motorcycles in 1924 and 1925 before ending production.|$|R
50|$|Tubb {{bought his}} Grindlay in November 1935 from a fellow Brooklands {{competitor}} named McClure. Results were disappointing at first, the best lap speed being around 88 mph, {{and so the}} engine was despatched to E C E 'Ted' Baragwanath, the famous Brooklands rider/tuner and JAP agent, for upgrading. Baragwanath fitted a longer <b>con-rod</b> (raising the cylinder barrel to compensate), swapped the twin-port cylinder head for a single-port version, and installed cams developed by Bert Le Vack. He also helped sort out the handling, screwing the Grindlay’s steering damper down tight, which cured it of a tendency to ‘wobble’ at high speed. The result was the coveted ‘Gold Star’ at over 102 mph and Tubb went onto achieve numerous successes with the revitalised Grindlay, including his fastest Brooklands lap on 30 June 1937 at over 105 mph.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce unit {{production}} costs, the engines that actually went into production, called Speed Six, were TVR modified versions of the initial AJP-6 prototypes with 3.6 and 4.0 litre capacities. Prominent modifications were alterations to valve train geometry, a switch from a billet steel crank to cast iron (with a crank damper), different con-rods, oil filter relocation to the inlet side of the engine, and removal of the exhaust cam oil feed. The two different capacities were achieved through stroke alterations from a <b>con-rod</b> design able to accommodate two different stroke lengths, and different piston crown designs altering the compression ratios. The bores diameters were shared.Pistons were made in Italy by Asso Werke from pre-existing casts, initially designed for the Rotax-Aprilia RSV 1000 engine. Those casts, refused by Rotax, were modified and used to produce the smaller Speed Six pistons.|$|E
5000|$|This {{engine was}} also used in GM's British Bedford truck. In the late 1930s rival Austin decided {{to get into the}} 2-3 ton truck ("lorry") market and in a crash program based the design—one might say shamelessly copied - on the basic {{architecture}} of this [...] "Stove Bolt" [...] engine, except that they added detachable shell main and <b>con-rod</b> bearings and pressurized lubrication. That Austin engine, in six-cylinder form, post war, went on to power cars such as the Austin Sheerline and Princess, and the Jensen Interceptor and 541. Austin also lopped off two cylinders and in that form various versions, with various capacities, powered cars such as the Austin 16, A70 Hampshire and Hereford, A90 Atlantic, the Austin-Healey 100-4 and the Austin Gipsy, plus a generation of commercial vans, plus the iconic London black taxi (FX3 and FX4).|$|E
50|$|The {{controlled}} combustion engines, {{designed by}} Bradley Howell-Smith of Australian firm Revetec Holdings Pty Ltd, use opposed pairs of pistons {{to drive a}} pair of counter-rotating three-lobed ("trilobate") cams through bearings. These elements replace the conventional crankshaft and connecting-rods, which enables {{the motion of the}} pistons to be purely axial, so that most of the power otherwise wasted on lateral motion of the <b>con-rods</b> is effectively transferred to the output shaft. This gives six strokes per revolution of the shaft. Independent tests reproducibly measure the efficiency of these engines at figures approaching 40%. Any even number of pistons can be used, in boxer or X configurations; the three lobes of the cams can be replaced by any other odd number greater than one; and the geometry of the cams can be changed to suit the needs of the target fuels and applications of the engines. Such variants may have ten or more strokes per cycle.|$|R
