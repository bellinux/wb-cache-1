40|$|Chest wall {{strapping}} {{has been}} used to assess mechanisms of dyspnea with restrictive lung disease. This study examined the hypothesis that dyspnea with restriction depends principally on the degree of reflex ventilatory stimulation. We compared dyspnea at the same (iso) ventilation when added dead space provided a component of the ventilatory stimulus during exercise. Eleven healthy men undertook a randomized controlled crossover trial that compared four constant work exercise conditions: 1) control (CTRL) : unrestricted breathing at 90 % gas exchange threshold (GET); 2) CTRL+dead space (DS) : unrestricted breathing with 0. 6 -l dead space, at isoventilation to CTRL due to reduced exercise intensity; 3) CWS: <b>chest</b> wall <b>strapping</b> at 90 % GET; and 4) CWS+DS: <b>chest</b> <b>strapping</b> with 0. 6 -l dead space, at isoventilation to CWS with reduced exercise intensity. Chest strapping reduced forced vital capacity by 30. 4 [*]±[*] 2. 2 % (mean[*]±[*]SE). Dyspnea at isoventilation was unchanged with CTRL+DS compared with CTRL (1. 93 [*]±[*] 0. 49 and 2. 17 [*]±[*] 0. 43, 0 – 10 numeric rating scale, respectively; P = 0. 244). Dyspnea was lower with CWS+DS compared with CWS (3. 40 [*]±[*] 0. 52 and 4. 51 [*]±[*] 0. 53, respectively; P = 0. 003). Perceived leg fatigue was reduced with CTRL+DS compared with CTRL (2. 36 [*]±[*] 0. 48 and 2. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 59, respectively; P = 0. 049) and lower with CWS+DS compared with CWS (1. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 30 and 4. 00 [*]±[*] 0. 79, respectively; P = 0. 006). With unrestricted breathing, dead space did not change dyspnea at isoventilation, suggesting that dyspnea does not depend on the mode of reflex ventilatory stimulation in healthy individuals. With <b>chest</b> <b>strapping,</b> dead space presented a less potent stimulus to dyspnea, raising the possibility that leg muscle work contributes to dyspnea perception independent of the ventilatory stimulus.

Special attention should be paid to the shoulders, chest, and the area between the horse's front legs. In general, a fist should fit between breastplate and the horse's chest, and there should be a hand's width between the wither strap and the withers. The breast strap should be have some slack, and care should be taken that its buckle doesn't rub the sensitive skin in the area. It should also be adjusted so that the <b>chest</b> <b>straps</b> lie above the point of the shoulder so that the horse's motion is not restricted.|$|R

The results suggest that the proposed method based on PLSR is an effective way of performing predictive motion modelling.

40|$|Abstract- The Medical Mirror {{is a novel}} {{interactive}} interface that tracks and displays a user’s heart rate in real time {{without the need for}} external sensors As ordinary people start to have access and control over their own physiological data, they can play {{a more active role in}} the management of their health. This revolution must take place in our everyday lives, not just in the doctor’s office or research lab. However, current techniques for physiological monitoring typically require users to strap on bulky sensors, <b>chest</b> <b>straps</b> or sticky electrodes. This discourages regular use because the sensors can be uncomfortable or encumbering. In this work, we propose a new mirror interface for real-time, contact-free measurements of heart rate without the need for external sensors. Users can have the experience of remote health monitoring by simply looking into the Medical Mirror. Digital medical devices promise to transform the future of medicine because of their ability to produce exquisitely detailed individual physiological data...|$|R
40|$|Load {{carriage}} is {{a requirement}} of certain occupations such as the military and fire and rescue services. The nature of work within these occupations may be exhaustive, submaximal, and repetitive. It is therefore necessary to quantify the physiological demand of load carriage during both exhaustive and submaximal work, and to provide workplace recommendations on task duration for work involving load carriage. Considering that restricting the chest wall affects pulmonary mechanics, load carriage may influence the contractile performance of the diaphragm. Since repetitive, high intensity work is also common in these occupations, {{it would be useful}} to determine if load carriage influences the performance of subsequent high intensity work. As a result, three laboratory experiments were conducted. Firstly, exhaustive treadmill exercise was performed under three experimental conditions: control (unloaded), load (22 kg weighted vest), and restricted (<b>chest</b> <b>strapped).</b> Second, submaximal treadmill exercise with a 22 kg external load was performed under five exercise conditions: 30, 50, 60, 70, and 80...|$|R
50|$|In old versions, when a {{heart beat}} is {{detected}} a radio signal is transmitted, which the receiver uses {{to determine the}} current heart rate.

40|$|Microwave Doppler radar has {{received}} considerable attention as a non-contact form of measuring human respiration; in particular for long term monitoring. One {{of the main}} challenges in converting this into a viable application is to suppress or separate the artefacts and other interfering signals from the desired respiration signal using a less complex and practically feasible design for regular and potentially real time use. Existing systems either require complex experimental setups or multiple Doppler radar modules to achieve this. In this paper, we propose an approach based on EMD-ICA and approximate entropy ideas to systematically separate received Doppler shifted signal into distinct components and reconstruct the desired respiration pattern pertaining to respective physiological activity. Indeed this allows suppression of the undesirable artefacts and interference from other competing signals. Practical experiments confirmed comparable performance of the proposed method to the measurements obtained through <b>chest</b> <b>straps</b> which are widely used clinically for monitoring respiration...|$|R

On the other hand, its devices were recognized for their accuracy and this resulted in Polar devices being frequently used as the preferred devices in various scientific studies as well as being adopted by many universities research departments.

In early plastic straps, water or liquid was required to get good performance.

More recent devices utilise optics to measure heart rate using Infrared light. This is achieved by production of infrared light by an internal bulb, as Infrared light is absorbed by the blood, a sensor measures the amount that the infrared light is darkened by. If it is significantly darker, due the pulse causing a temporary increase {{in the amount of}} blood that is travelling through the measured area, that is counted as a heart pulse.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{alterations}} in pulmonary mechanics oc-cur in man when an inspiration {{is taken from}} be-low the resting lung volume (1) and during shal-low breathing (2). Some effects of a sustained reduction of the total lung capacity on respira-tion have been studied previously (3 - 5), yet the effects of <b>chest</b> <b>strapping</b> on pulmonary mechanics have received relatively little attention. In the preliminary experiments we tightly bound the chest in the expiratory position with either adhesive tape or a long strip of rubber. Subsequently we designed a special chest corset that permitted us to reduce the resting lung vol-ume and inspiratory capacity at will. The entire pressure-volume curve of the lung was altered by these procedures, but was restored to normal when a deep inspiration was taken after release of the restricting apparatus. Simultaneously, the escape of gas from poorly ventilated regions of the lung was detected. The effect of these changes on other aspects of pulmonary and circulatory func-tion was examined and our findings, together with a consideration of their physiological and clinical significance, {{form the basis of}} this report. METHOD Twenty-five normal subjects were studied, all but two of them males. They ranged in age from 19 to 40 years.
