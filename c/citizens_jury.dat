A <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury</b> was convened to explore the consumer acceptability of taxation as a strategy to prevent childhood obesity by influencing the purchasing of foods by parents. A <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury,</b> consisting of 12 - 24 members of the public that are representative of the community, is a deliberative method of engaging the public in decision-making on a specific topic. The jury is asked to reach a verdict and make recommendations based on evidence provided by clinical, policy, academic and consumer experts {{from a wide range of}} perspectives. This report describes the verdicts and recommendations of a <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury</b> on childhood obesity held in May 2013, in Brisbane, Australia. This <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury</b> was facilitated by Griffith University as part of a larger project funded by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency (ANPHA).

40|$|Background  Interest and {{investment}} in e-health continue to grow world-wide, but there remains relatively little engagement with the public on this subject, despite calls for more public involvement in health-care planning. Design  This study used two modified <b>citizen</b> <b>juries</b> to explore barriers and facilitators to e-health implementation and the priorities for future e-health research {{from the perspective of}} health service users and lay representatives. <b>Citizen</b> <b>juries</b> bring together a group of people to deliberate over a specific issue. They are given information and invited to ‘cross-examine’ witnesses during the process. Results  Jurors were very keen for lay views to be included in e-health development and embraced the <b>citizen</b> <b>jury</b> approach. They agreed unanimously that e-health should be developed and thought it was in many ways inevitable. Although there was much enthusiasm for a health-care system which offered e-health as an option, there was as much concern about what it might mean for patients if implemented inappropriately. E-health was preferred as an enhancement rather than substitute for, existing services. Lack of universal access was seen as a potential barrier to implementation but problems such as lack of computer literacy were seen as a temporary issue. Participants emphasized that e-health research needed to demonstrate both clinical and economic benefits. Conclusion   There was broad support from the <b>citizen</b> <b>juries</b> for the development of e-health, although participants stressed that e-health should enhance, rather than substitute, face-to-face services.

40|$|Background: We {{conducted}} Citizens Juries {{in three}} Australian cities {{to capture the}} informed views of the public regarding how we, as a community, should address criminal offenders. Findings indicated that jurors believed that prison alternatives should be prioritised, including investment in holistic public health approaches to address the overlapping social determinants of health and crime. Following this, we wanted to inform policymakers on what citizens favoured regarding responses to offending, and to investigate their responses to the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury</b> findings. Method: Eleven senior-ranking policymakers from three Australian states/territories {{were invited to participate}} in semi-structured, anonymous interviews. Policymakers were asked questions on their knowledge and attitudes towards offenders, prison and prison alternatives, and their thoughts on the citizens’ jury findings. A thematic analysis of interviews was conducted. Findings: Five policymakers participated. Policymaker views were broadly supportive of current prison alternatives and responded positively to the <b>Citizens</b> <b>Jury</b> findings, assessing jurors’ informed views as relevant to decision making in the justice context. The principles of community involvement, crime prevention, and fairness to victims were of most interest to them. Overall, though, policymakers were not influenced by Citizens Juries findings, citing practical and political challenges as having most influence on current approaches to dealing with offenders. Conclusion: Informed views of the public were seen by policymakers as important to criminal justice reform. Though policymakers supported prison alternatives and public health approaches to address offending behaviour, addressing the political risks of such approaches were seen as paramount. Key words: Political economy of health; Public health policy, legislation, ethics; Social determinants of health Key messages: 1.

40|$|Public {{participation}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular with emerging health technologies, such as nanotechnologies, which may pose novel ethical, social or risk issues in the future. Nanotechnologies represent an important test case for so-called ‘upstream’ engagement: that is public participation before significant research and development has taken place and before establishment of firm public attitudes or social representations about an issue. We discuss the origins of this development in the parallel intellectual traditions of risk communication and science and technology studies, respectively. We argue that such engagement does not simply involve moving the same forms of analytic deliberative process {{that have been used}} in the past to an earlier time, but it requires engaging in a new set of questions with the publics. Reflecting upon evidence from NanoJury UK, the first <b>citizens</b> <b>jury</b> on nanotechnology in the UK, we argue that processes of upstream engagement require moving beyond conventional approaches to discussing ‘risks’ found in much public dialogue and traditional forms of risk communication, to open up debate about values and visions for the future...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Alarming over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander {{people in}} Australian prisons, {{combined}} with high recidivism rates and poor {{health and social}} outcomes among those released from prison, has led many to claim that incarceration is a social policy failure. An important obstacle to a reform agenda {{in the criminal justice}} area is public opinion. The public are often perceived to hold punitive attitudes towards offenders, a situation often exploited by politicians to perpetuate punitive penal policies at the expense of developing decarceration initiatives. However, alternatives to public opinion surveys/polls are needed to assess the public’s views, as survey/poll-based methods typically present shallow, unconsidered public opinion and thwart good policy development and reform. <b>Citizens</b> <b>Juries</b> offer an alternative method to assess the public’s views, views that are critically informed and thus better aid policy development. This project aimed to explore, through <b>Citizens</b> <b>Juries,</b> the views of a critically informed public in three states/territories towards how we, as a community, should address offenders in terms of incarceration and incarceration alternatives. The research focused on a range of incarceration alternatives including Justice Reinvestment. The study also aimed to examine the thoughts of senior policymakers on the outcomes of <b>Citizens</b> <b>Juries.</b> This research provides important information and evidence in the offender health area and contributes to the Justice Reinvestment debate among offender health, criminal justice, political and community stakeholders.  ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of the <b>citizen</b> <b>jury</b> and other deliberative democratic approaches to public participation, there is no agreement on the method for evaluating them, nor even agreement on where evaluation should be applied, inputs, outputs or process. To evaluate its efficacy, this study convened a <b>citizen</b> <b>jury</b> to deliberate on waste management issues in a provincial Australian city. After considering the theory of deliberative democracy, the paper identifies six criteria and applies relevant analytical methods. The primary form of analysis is a sample of transcripts of jury deliberations used to examine the micro processes of the deliberative processes. This was supplemented by pre- and post-jury surveys as well as participant observation. The outcomes reveal that the micro-processes of jury deliberation were often characterised by unequal forms of interaction, poor focus on outcomes, and limited use of available knowledge.

40|$|According to {{economic}} theory, market forces guarantee efficiency and customer orientation. But in public transport, such a market often does not exist, given that most services are provided under licenses which guarantee the operator an exclusive right {{to provide the}} service, thus evidently limiting customer choice. Public transport services are also subject to intense political influences. The paper examines the position of passengers as stakeholders in transport planning and policy. After the introduction, the main elements of the passengers’ interests are presented. The main part discusses the role and scope of citizens’ participation in urban and transport planning. A series of case studies illustrates different, more or less formalised, approaches to participation as well as typical planning issues for public transport development. In the Italian context, the Carta dei Servizi and the activities of consumer associations and civic action committees are the most noteworthy forms of involvement. The examples demonstrate that different methods {{can be used to}} permit a greater role of the citizens in planning. An unbalanced approach, one which takes {{place at the wrong time}} or is not respected by the other stakeholders, however, is likely to be seen as an obstacle and cause for frustration.

To achieve this, it is necessary to choose the necessary methods with caution, considering the topic, environment and the setting of the scheme in the wider planning and decision-making process.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} a search has been {{conducted}} among democratic theorists to find a decision making form that is both democratic, and able to produce outcomes that may be seen to favour the life supporting capacity of our natural systems. One form of decision making that has gained considerable interest from green theorists is participatory or deliberative democracy. It is suggested that compared to liberal representative structures, a deliberative conception of politics will allow for a more informed policy process that enables the discovery and support of generalisable rather than particular interests. As a consequence, citizen deliberation will produce outcomes that support the pre-eminence of the natural environment, while providing greater legitimacy and compliance with the agreements reached. These assumptions about the environmental credentials of deliberative forums are not entirely theoretical. In recent decades {{there has been a}} gradual movement within local government in Australia towards the use of participatory or deliberative models to support its existing representative structure. In particular, this has been driven by the emerging role of local government in addressing environmental issues. It is shown that despite questions regarding their reliability, many of the assumptions made within the deliberative democratic literature also exist within local processes to deliver favourable environmental outcomes. The thesis therefore tests the purported benefits of deliberative structures. It finds that citizen deliberation can produce more informed policy processes. However, the notion that deliberative structures will produce both environmentally favourable and universally legitimate outcomes is dependent upon a range of contextual factors. To support this thesis, existing research on public deliberation and two case studies in Australian local government are presented and examined. The first case study inspects the use of a precinct system at the Glenorchy City Council to address issues including waste management, while the second concerns the use of a <b>citizens</b> <b>jury</b> to address stormwater issues at the Waverley Municipal Council. Although a range of factors prove to have significant impacts upon the environmental outcomes that were achieved, the thesis concludes that the deliberative model can facilitate the greening of decision making, and enable a collective realisation of the benefits of active citizenship. ...|$|E
