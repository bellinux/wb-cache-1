40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Studies were {{conducted}} to determine {{the effectiveness of a}} biological pollen barrier of rye, Secale cereale, in preventing out-crossing between Lolium multiflorum genotypes in each of the 300 <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> established in this experiment. Fluorescent tests of seeds of open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny of four annual ryegrass sources were used to determine the effectiveness of the rye barrier in preventing <b>crossing</b> between <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks.</b> The average percentage of fluorescence of open-pollinated progeny in 30 <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> containing supposedly only non-fluorescing plants was 16. 3 percent. The open-pollinated and single-crossed progeny in 46 other <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks</b> were highly correlated and did not differ significantly from each other in percent fluorescence. The percent fluorescence of each <b>crossing</b> <b>block</b> was mainly due to intra-crossing block pollen rather than inter-crossing block or foreign pollen. The results indicate that an eight foot barrier of rye is effective in preventing crossing between the annual ryegrass <b>crossing</b> <b>blocks.</b> Self-fertility of Lolium multiflorum was generally low, but self fertility estimates ranged from 0 to 87 percent. The results revealed that self-fertility data obtained by germination rather than seed count may give more accurate self-fertility estimates, especially when individual plants and their differences are being investigated. The average seed set under white parchment bags was not significantly lower than the average seed set obtained with bag-type dialysis tubing. The use of dialysis tubing as a substitute for white parchment bags in bagging plants would be of little, if any, benefit to improve seed set under bag in Lolium multiflorum...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} blocking effects, many deblocking filter algorithms {{have been proposed}} to provide nice solutions in still images [16 – 18]. The low-pass filter is also employed to eliminate blocking artifacts in video compression standards [19]. Tai et al. [20] proposed a deblocking algorithm based on five filtering modes by considering the activity across block boundaries. These five filtering modes include three frequency-related modes (the smooth mode, the intermediate mode, and the complex mode), one special mode, and a refined mode. Tai et al. [21] proposed a new method to remove blocking artifacts in the low bit-rate block-based video coding in H. 264 /AVC and MPEG- 4.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a meaningful and detailed description of haplotype variation holds the promise for more powerful genetic association studies. The segmentation {{of the human genome}} into blocks of limited haplotype diversity has been successfully employed by models that describe common variation. Some computational models of haplotype variation are flawed, however: they arbitrarily sever all haplotypes at block boundaries and assume that block boundaries are areas of free recombination. In reality, haplotypes break up when they recombine, and many past recombination events are predicted to occur at sites of occasional recombination. Thus, the genuine unit of shared genetic variation should often <b>cross</b> <b>block</b> boundaries, or sometimes end between them. This work seeks the truer mosaic structure of human haplotypes through flexible haplotype boundaries.

30|$|Both the {{duration}} and the annoyance {{level of the}} visible artifacts contribute to the perceived video quality degradation. The annoyance level of artifacts produced by packet loss depends heavily on the EC scheme of a decoder. The goal of EC is to estimate the missing MBs in a compressed video bitstream with packet losses, {{in order to provide}} a minimum degree of perceptual quality degradation. EC methods that have been developed roughly fall into two categories: spatial EC approach and temporal EC approach. In the spatial EC class, spatial correlation between local pixels is exploited; missing MBs are recovered by interpolation from neighbor pixels. In the temporal EC class, both the coherence of motion field and the spatial smoothness of pixels along edges <b>cross</b> <b>block</b> boundary are exploited to estimate motion vector (MV) of a lost MB. In H. 264 JM reference decoder, spatial approach is applied to conceal lost MBs of Intra-coded frame (I-frame) using bilinear interpolation technique; temporal approach is applied to conceal lost MBs for inter-predicted frame (P-frame, B-frame) by estimating MV of the lost MB based on the neighbor MBs' MVs. Minimum boundary discontinuity criterion is used to select the best MV estimate.|$|E

E 2 s, a protruding homodimer domain of HEV capsid protein, is responsible for interacting with host cells to initiate infection (Li et al., 2009; Li et al., 2005).

40|$|<b>Cross</b> <b>Block</b> Chaining (XBC) is {{designed}} to be similar to the classic standard modes of operation, specifically CBC, except that it operates using two IVs that “collect ” data through the course of the encryption process in a way that resembles CFB and OFB operation. This has two main net effects. Firstly, for very short messages, the keys can be split to prevent decryption by a single person, effectively creating a two-man rule [1]. Secondly, because the mode crosses itself, the entire previous message is necessary to decrypt the remaining blocks, which insures extra security in that the entire message must be decrypted from the beginning with no errors. This does, however, mean that any error will propagate through the entire message. Two versions of this algorithm are presented with what is a minute difference in operations. Each version has different implications and will be discussed inline. An interesting feature for both versions is that technically only one vector can be necessary to decrypt the majority of a longer message. While this would break any sort of two-man rule for longer messages, it still creates another layer of security through obfuscation by creating another mode of operation which would need to be tested against in an attack. Further, with two positions that a compromised vector could occupy, this increases the challenge of any attack. It is also possible that the same vector can be used for both IVs, which is another option to consider. 1. 1 Algorithm XBC- 1 The first version of XBC is quite similar to CBC, but with an additional IV that is XORed with the entry data into the block cipher, and this in turn is fed into the output of the block cipher of the next round. As can be seen in Figure 1, this creates the crossing between rounds of the block cipher that the algorithm is named after. 2 Figure 1 : The block diagram of XBC- 1 operation.

Most mimotopes obtained from phage displayed peptide libraries can be employed to facilitate the identifi-cation of novel peptide sequences that mimic binding sites for mAbs (Mayrose et al., 2007). We panned three phage-displayed peptide libraries (ph. D. -C 7 C and ph.

Mimo-topes which reacted to 8 H 3 without cross-reacting with three HEV related antibodies (8 C 11, 12 G 8, and 8 G 12) and two HEV non-related antibodies (13 D 4 against AIV and 42 B 6 against HBV) were considered positive.
