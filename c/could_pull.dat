5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or a larger number of horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable and hardy. As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Humphrey's run, President Lyndon Johnson began a {{campaign}} for re-election, entering {{his name in the}} first-in-the-nation New Hampshire primary for March 1968. Late in 1967, building upon anti-war sentiment, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race with heavy criticism of the President's Vietnam War policies. Even before McCarthy's entrance, Johnson grew concerned about a challenge. He confided to Democratic Congressional leaders that an opponent <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> the support of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Dr. Benjamin Spock, defeating him in New Hampshire, and forcing his withdrawal from the race; similar to Senator Estes Kefauver's 1952 challenge to President Harry Truman, which likely caused Truman not to seek re-election.|$|E

5|$|Grimaldi and Dubois {{appeared}} {{together again}} later that spring at Sadler's Wells in Dibdin's Harlequin Alchemist, which {{set up a}} mock duel between the two Clowns, with the audience deciding who <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> the most hideous face. Grimaldi consistently won. In the next piece, Harlequin Benedick; or, The Ghost of Mother Shipton. Dubois was relegated {{to the role of}} Pierrot, while Grimaldi played Clown. Grimaldi's mother was in the cast, appearing as the Butcher's Wife. He then appeared in another Dibdin play, The Great Devil. During the run, he accidentally injured himself on stage by shooting himself in the foot and was confined to bed for five weeks. His mother became so concerned at her son's fragile and still grief-stricken state that she employed a dancer at Drury Lane, Mary Bristow, to care for him full-time during those weeks. They formed a close friendship, which resulted in a loving relationship, and they married on 24 December 1801.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E

50|$|An {{improved}} {{version was}} created in 1919 after the war. Main improvement was a longer barrel, offering greater range, which could be mounted in old beds. It was sold to many nations before 1938, including Greece, Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Some versions had rubber tires so they <b>could</b> be <b>pulled</b> by trucks but most retained wooden spoked-wheels so they <b>could</b> be <b>pulled</b> by mule teams. It was also manufactured in Poland in Starachowice as wz.1914/19P howitzer.|$|R

These spheres became the lenses of his microscopes, with the smallest spheres providing the highest magnifications.|$|E
25|$|The Scotch (reaction) turbines, {{which later}} {{replaced}} the overshot water wheels, were 12½ feet in diameter, {{were made of}} cast iron, and <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> the boats up an 11% grade (11 foot rise over 100 feet). The longest plane was the double-tracked Plane 9 West which was 1,510 feet long and lifted boats 100 feet up (i.e. 6% grade) in 12 minutes. The total weight of the boat, cargo, and cradle was about 110-125 tons.|$|E
25|$|During the summer, blinds were fitted {{over the}} ends of all cars with normal staircases, so that when it rained or the sun shone {{directly}} into the driver’s eyes he <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> down this blind and gain a little protection.

25|$|In 1968, {{the same}} play {{was made into}} a two-hour {{television}} movie that aired on NBC. The writers suggested Lee J.

Director Richard Irving convinced Levinson and Link that Falk, who wanted the role, <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> it off even though he was much younger than the writers had in mind.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} round, {{all but the}} top two {{candidates}} were eliminated, as their combined vote total (2,863) was less than Miller's, so that none <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> ahead of Miller, even by receiving every vote from the other minor candidates. The votes for these eliminated candidates {{were added to the}} totals of Kiss and Miller based on which one was ranked next on each ballot. After the second round count, Kiss was declared the winner as he had obtained a majority (54.4%) of the remaining unexhausted ballots.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the amount}} of traffic and the slow process of legging, the Harecastle Tunnel was {{becoming}} a major bottleneck on the canal. It was decided to commission a second tunnel to be built by Thomas Telford. Due to advances in engineering, it took just three years to build, and was completed in 1827. It had a towpath so that horses <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> the boats through the tunnel. After its construction it was used in conjunction with the Brindley tunnel, with each tunnel taking traffic in opposite directions.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the focus}} of the NBA towards the {{stoppage}} of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, Patkar advised adding the World Bank to its propaganda. Using the right to fasting, she undertook a 22-day fast that almost took her life. Patkar's actions did force the World Bank to set up The Morse Commission, an independent review of the project. Their report clearly stated that the Bank's policies on environment and resettlement were being violated by the project. The World Bank's participation in these projects was canceled in 1993. Before the World Bank <b>could</b> <b>pull</b> out, the Indian Government did.|$|E

Meanwhile, the engineers and divisional pioneers were laying footbridges, and the supporting brigades crossed the canal dryshod to pass through 137th Brigade and head off towards the Yellow Line at 11.20.
