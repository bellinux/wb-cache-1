It also examined whether the use of concordance program enhanced accuracy in writing, and whether any effects of indirect feedback with <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> could be retained over a long-term period. Additionally, their perceptions and attitudes toward the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> were investigated. ^ The results indicated that, in terms of accuracy gain, uncoded/coded indirect feedback with the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> led to more accurate error correction than uncoded indirect feedback only.

40|$|Alongside {{developments}} in language research, {{the potential of}} corpora as a resource in language learning and teaching has been evident to researchers and teachers since the late 1960 s. Despite publications which emphasise the benefits of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> for language learners (Bernardini, 2002; Kennedy & Miceli, 2001), {{there is little evidence}} to suggest that direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> is coming {{to be seen as a}} complement or alternative to consultation of a dictionary, course book, or grammar by the majority of learners. There is thus a need for research to underpin the integration of corpora and concordancing in the language-learning environment.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, electronic literacies have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{studies the}} {{activity}} of lay interpreters (LI) in bilingual (Yucatec Maya and Spanish) medical consultations. It focuses in particular on the interpreter’s correction of responses that patients give to doctors. The occurrence of such correcting sequences reveals some trouble in the patient’s response to questions in Spanish, or in understanding the LI’s translation of the prior question. It also reveals the LI’s understanding of the doctor’s questions, as well as her/his orientation towards {{the production of the}} appropriate in- formation needed to match such questions. Central in this study are cases in which the doctor seeks to quantify an undetermined value (related to time, intensity, frequency of a symptom or trouble). The analysis shows that the LIs intervene recurrently to specify the patients’ response to this type of question, pursuing a deﬁnite and translatable quantita-tive ﬁgure that could be delivered to the physician. Such practice also allows us to have ac-cess to the LIs’ local understanding of their speciﬁc role in the current activity.

40|$|While {{increasingly}} appreciated for its importance,the {{interaction between}} {{health care professionals}} (HCP) and patients is notoriously difficult to study, with both methodological and practical challenges. The former has been addressed by the so-called Verona coding definitions of emotional sequences (VRCoDES) – a system for identifying and coding patient emotions and the corresponding HCP responses – shown to be reliable and informative {{in a number of}} independent studies in different health care delivery contexts. In the present work we focus on the practical challenge of the scalability of this coding system,namely on making it easily usable more widely and on applying it on larger patient cohorts. In particular, VR-CoDES is inherently complex and training is required to ensure consistent annotation of audio recordings or textual transcripts of consultations. Following up on our previous pilot investigation, in the present paper we describe the first automatic, computer based algorithm capable of providing coarse level coding of textual transcripts.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{translating}} Italian-Spanish environmental texts, translators frequently come across terms which at first glance {{might seem to be}} perfect translation equivalents, such as parque regional in Spanish and parco regionale in Italian, which can sometimes result in mistranslation and misinterpretation. These terms are embedded in cultures and, thus, different both from a social and a political perspective. Consequently, translators must be aware of these underlying differences so as to avoid possible pitfalls in interpreting the content and translating the texts correctly. This article presents a study carried out on a Spanish-Italian parallel corpus of tourist texts dealing with the promotion of protected natural areas in Spain, which is accompanied by an analysis of the legal sources at national, international and European levels. The purpose of the study is to provide a description of the differences and similarities at the conceptual and terminological levels in the specific field of environmental protection, based on the analysis of the characteristics and classifications of protected natural areas. The use of these resources will identify the differences and similarities between the specific terms of the two cultures examined (the Italian and Spanish), while the discussion of translations in Italian in the parallel corpus allows to highlight the major translation problems and potential translation errors. Finally, the use of the comparable monolingual <b>corpora</b> and the <b>consultation</b> of legal sources are seen as key tools that help translators to avoid errors and to select the most appropriate translation strategies, such as domestication or foreignization (Venuti 1995) and amplification or simplification {{in order to make the}} translated texts more accessible and allow both the recipients of the source language and those of the target language to share if not exactly the same conceptual reality, a very similar reality...|$|R
40|$|International audienceElectronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in {{what has come to be}} known as "data-driven learning" or DDL (Johns 1990). The arguments for and against have accumulated over two decades and more: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. Certainly in its more extreme forms, it seems difficult to reconcile DDL with the reality of ordinary language classrooms (e. g. Mukherjee 2006). One of the most apparent obstacles here is the use of the technology itself - the computer with its query software and interfaces for accessing electronic corpora - which has repeatedly been found to pose substantial problems for many learners (e. g. Yoon & Hirvela 2004) as well as teachers (e. g. Farr 2008). Where this is the case, the obvious question is whether the computer can be successfully removed from the equation without losing the benefits of the overall approach (cf. Boulton 2010). It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous, hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the earliest instantiations of DDL relied almost exclusively on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials can be argued to allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice in many DDL studies (see Boulton forthcoming for a review). Each approach has its adherents, but to date there has been little if any empirical research attempting a direct comparison of the use of paper-based and hands-on <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> This study draws on past experience with two different groups of students learning English at an architecture college in France. In the first case, the learners were highly receptive to an encounter with printed DDL materials (Boulton 2010); in the second, a hands-on approach to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> was far less well received (Boulton 2009). However, the varying conditions mean that direct comparisons are difficult to make. In the present study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students at the same college were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class. Each group covered the same points using essentially the same processes, but alternated between 'hands-on' consultation (i. e. on computer) and paper-based materials (i. e. 'hands-off'). In this way, after 10 weeks all the students (n= 30) should have been at least moderately familiar with both approaches. The learning outcomes of the hands-on and hands-off approaches were compared by testing the final two items covered - language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. The results were compared against feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course on the participants' preferences and affective reactions. Previous experience suggests that those who do best are not necessarily most receptive, and vice versa. In an attempt to identify some of the variables that may underlie the individual differences, two instruments were used to relate the outcomes and reactions to motivation and learning styles. The overall conclusion seems to be that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|E

In this talk I will briefly review empirical {{research in the}} field, before focusing on the specific case of France, where such corpus use retains a particularly low profile {{for a variety of}} reasons. My own research in French higher education covers a range of issues. Apart from the obvious questions of how French learners react to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> and whether it ‘works' in terms of immediate learning outcomes, it is relevant to consider longer term benefits, and how different presentations (e. g. hands-on, paper-based) can be used in different contexts (in class, in the computer room, in distance programmes) and for different purposes (not just for learning the language, but also as a reference resource, for translation, and across other areas of study such as literature and civilisation), as well as for different types of learners (in terms of language ability, learning styles, and specialisation). In all cases, my main aim has been {{to make use of the}} most accessible tools (general purpose, free on-line) and the simplest techniques so that students can, if they wish, continue using corpora on their own after completing the courses. Few would argue that corpora provide miracle solutions in all cases, and individual studies tend to be mitigated in their results – inevitably so, given the infinite number of variables involved. However, the picture that emerges from the research as a whole suggests there are grounds for optimism, and that the multiple affordances of language corpora means that they have something to offer for most teachers and learners...|$|E
30|$|Ten {{students}} {{randomly selected}} from the experimental group were interviewed in Chinese about their perceptions of DDL activities in revising stage. The qualitative interview {{results indicate that the}} interviewees generally show positive attitudes toward the use of BNC web in revision stage of writing. They emphasized that the use of a corpus in the revising stage can help them improve their writing accuracy because the time-consuming DDL activities make them have a better impression of their errors and the correct language patterns. In DDL, it is usually the learners who explore and find out appropriate expressions or collocates relevant to his or her writing. This discovery-oriented process may facilitate their acquisition of the correct language use. The interviewees here show the same opinion with the participants in Chambers’ (2005) study, who claimed that hunting for grammatical patterns in concordance lines better facilitates memorization of problematic aspects of the target language than being “spoon-fed” the language rules. In addition, most of them mentioned that the frequently-occurring collocations presented in Key-Word-in-Context (KWIC) format help them increase the awareness of collocation and thus enables them to use these collocations better in the writing tasks. Due to the interference of the mother tongue, they often associate a verb with a noun wrongly or match a noun arbitrarily with an adjective without considering whether it is appropriate. Now after the <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> activities, they realized it’s better to memorize the collocations or phrases in context rather than the single word. Besides these benefits of DDL activities, some of them still mentioned the following advantages such as discovering some new usages of the known words accidentally, learning other new words incidentally, making them become more autonomous, enlarging their vocabulary.|$|E

Introduction [...] Models {{of shared}} {{decision-making}} in medicine [...] Framing the study [...] The analytic goals of modelling agency [...] The context of treatment decision-making in HIV [...] Agency and alignment [...] Study conclusions and implications. The quality of doctor-patient communication {{has been shown}} to influence treatment uptake, adherence and effectiveness in HIV medicine and elsewhere. Increasingly, it is considered essential that doctors and patients jointly participate in decisions concerning treatment. There is a growing body of literature describing joint decisionmaking and suggesting guidelines for its practice. Few of these studies, however, relate their descriptions of medical decision-making as a social process {{to the ways in which}} patterns of verbal interaction realize or foreclose on joint decision-making. [...] Dominant models of medical decision-making view shared decision-making as a midpoint between enlightened paternalism and informed choice. Based on a <b>corpus</b> of HIV <b>consultations</b> audio-recorded in Sydney in the late 1990 s, this thesis argues that it can be better modelled as a particular type of social process, which differs across a number of dimensions from other styles of medical decision-making, specifiable as contextual parameters of meaning. The thesis then identifies ways in which specific discursive practices realize these contextual parameters. [...] A major component of the thesis focuses on agency, and a model is presented in the form of a socio-semantic network, drawing on work by van Leeuwen (1996) and others, which relates a range of grammatical features, not only transitivity patterns, to ways of construing social agency. The thesis then considers the way in which doctors and patients mobilise these and other resources for bringing together potentially conflicting points of view in framing and articulating treatment decisions. Here I draw on notions of mutual alignment (e. g., Goffman 1981) but expand the analysis of what is aligned to account for speakers' implicit discourse orientation, as well as more overt markers. [...] Findings emphasise the relationship between representing and enacting agentive roles; the importance of doctors and patients mutually projecting each other's voices; and the variable and iterative character of shared decision-making. The research demonstrates how doctors and patients negotiate a complex, interactionally and symbolically mediated agency, and shows that patients often take the lead in developing more collaborative decision-making practice. There are still institutionally and socially determined limits to the degree of control patients may exercise within the consultation, many of which are of course well founded.

40|$|Corpus {{linguistics}} {{has contributed}} considerably to the arsenal of tools available for language description, with methodologies applicable to virtually any area of language study. Yet like most academic disciplines, corpus linguistics is generally limited to researchers and other professionals; {{in the fields}} of foreign/second language teaching and learning, this involves considerable mediation upstream before the results filter down to the end users - teachers and learners. An alternative would be for corpus data to feature directly in the learning process, with learners acting as "researchers" to explore the language themselves. This is commonly referred to as "data-driven learning" (DDL), an idea particularly associated with the seminal collection of papers edited by Johns and King (1991). The last 20 years has seen substantial research interest in DDL, with countless scholarly articles arguing its various merits, though it is frequently remarked that empirical research is disturbingly lacking. However, Boulton (forthcoming) lists over 70 studies which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> This suggests that the research exists, but is fragmented and lacking in visibility and accessibility to a wider community. The aim of the present paper is to bring together the DDL research in ESP, where Gavioli (2005) argues convincingly that the learners represent a major population who stand to gain from DDL. An overview is presented of the tools, corpora, methodologies and research questions covered in 20 empirical DDL studies for ESP. The overwhelming majority show that learners are able to work with corpora in many contexts and for many purposes, and respond positively to the approach. In terms of learning outcomes, the results are generally promising, though not perhaps as conclusive as one might hope. Reasons for this are discussed, but it is argued that there are grounds for cautious optimism regarding corpus use in ESP {{in a wide variety of}} contexts...|$|E
30|$|Complexity {{is another}} {{significant}} aspect that can reveal a learner’s writing competence, {{thus it is}} also measured in case that some learners are reluctant to try to produce more complex words or sentences for fear of making errors. The results reveal that the group adopting a DDL approach didn’t make obvious improvement in both of the vocabulary complexity and grammatical complexity. Furthermore, according to some interviewees, Baidu seems to help them better in improving writing complexity since students can usually {{get a lot of}} relevant complex sentences or even excellent essays just by simply typing in the topic of the essay in Baidu in the process of revising essays. However, they often have to do complex query in BNCweb for getting the desirable sentences. In reality, many students just use the simple query function by simply typing in some phrases, but rarely use POS tags offered to them while consulting corpora. This is consistent with Pérez-Paredes et al.’s (2012) discovery that learners just used BNC as if they were using Google without using POS tags or regular expressions. Therefore, the lack of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> skills is an important factor that may influence learners’ improvement in complexity. Just as stated by Sabti and Chaichan’s (2014) that computer skill is the biggest barrier that impedes the use of computer technologies in language learning. Thus more training or instruction about consultation skills should be provided to students. With good consultation skills, students will exploit corpora better thus they may easily get the complex sentence structure that they want from BNCweb while revising sentences. Then in the writing test {{they may be able to}} produce complex sentences. In addition, it usually takes a rather long time for one to significantly improve one’s productive use of vocabulary and grammatical knowledge. Thus it is suggested that teachers continue the DDL activities in writing for a longer time period, and then evaluate their writing complexity again. Moreover, EFL learners should be encouraged to take risks to produce more complex words or structures and not to be afraid of making errors in regular writing assignments. In the process of dealing with complex expressions or structures, their language proficiency will be improved, which may result in their better performance in complexity in writing test.|$|E
40|$|Much {{discussion}} in language {{learning and teaching}} revolves around two main questions: what to learn and how to learn it. Corpus linguistics has {{had a significant impact}} on the former, as publishers use the findings to inform the language content of their syllabuses. On the other hand, and despite significant output in terms of research articles and publications, few teachers and still fewer learners have had any direct contact with language corpora per se. For such awareness to filter down to the end users, the major players upstream (publishers, software developers, politicians, schools, teacher trainers, etc.) have to be convinced that corpora have something to offer. While well-developed theoretical arguments show the potential is considerable, empirical evidence is surprisingly lacking (Chambers 2007). This paper looks at nearly 50 studies which provide some form of evaluation of the use of corpora in language learning. Many are essentially qualitative, bringing useful insights but remaining by definition rather subjective; quantitative evidence, however, remains scarce. Furthermore, the focus is often on learners' and teachers' attitudes to the use of corpora, or on their ability to use corpus techniques, rather than on the effectiveness of corpus use. Finally, the remaining studies tend to divide into two main categories: those which are concerned with the use of corpora as a reference tool, especially in written production (including error-correction) and translation; and those few which actually look at whether corpora contribute to language learning itself – “data-driven learning”, to use Johns' term (e. g. 1991). This paper synthesises the research findings to date on all these questions, and argues that there is an urgent need for considerably more empirical evaluation of data-driven language learning, taking into account the large number of variables involved. Only then can we expect to see such techniques become part of mainstream language teaching and learning practices. Chambers, A. 2007.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> on the {{accuracy}} of learner written error revisions. It examines the conditions which cause a learner to consult the corpus in correcting errors and whether these revisions are more effective than those made using other corrections methods. Claims have been made for the potential usefulness of corpora in encouraging {{a better understanding of}} language through inductive learning (Johns, 1991; Benson, 2001; Watson Todd, 2003). The opportunity for learners to interact with the authentic language used to compile corpora has also been cited as a possible benefit (Thurstun and Candlin, 1998). However, theoretical advantages of using corpus data have not always translated into actual benefits in real learning contexts. Learners frequently encounter difficulties in dealing with the volume of information available to them in concordances and can reject corpus use because it adds to their learning load (Yoon and Hirvela, 2004; Frankenberg Garcia, 2005; Lee and Swales, 2006). This has meant that practical employment of corpus data has sometimes been difficult to implement. In this experiment, learners on a six week pre-sessional English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course were shown how to use the BYU (Brigham Young University) website to access the BNC (British National Corpus) to address written errors. Through a draft/feedback/revision process using meta-linguistic error coding, the frequency, context and effectiveness of the corpus being used as a reference tool was measured. Use of the corpus was found to be limited to a small range of error types which largely involved queries of a pragmatic nature. In these contexts, the corpus was found to be a potentially more effective correction tool than dictionary reference or recourse to previous knowledge and it may have a beneficial effect in encouraging top-down processing skills. However, its frequency of use over the course was low and accounted for only a small proportion of accurate error revisions as a whole. Learner response to the corpus corroborated the negative perception already noted in previous studies. These findings prompt recommendations for further investigation into effective mediation of corpus data within the classroom and continued technological developments in order to make corpus data more accessible to non-specialists...|$|E
40|$|Electronic corpora {{can be used}} {{not only}} for {{language}} description {{but also as a}} resource for teaching and learning in what has become known as “data-driven learning” (DDL). The arguments for and against have accumulated over nearly 30 years: in favour are numerous theoretical pedagogical advantages, while the objections tend to revolve around practical and logistical barriers to implementation. One of {{the most important of these}} is the use of the technology itself: whether one sympathises that this is a problem or not, it is clearly an obstacle to DDL for a variety of reasons, and only removing the computer from the equation will help to overcome it. It seems obvious that paper-based materials will not afford all the advantages of the fully autonomous hands-on concordancing DDL is commonly associated with. However, the very first instantiations of DDL relied heavily on concordance print-outs, and prepared materials allow a gentle lead-in, with teacher and learner roles changing gradually as they concentrate first on the new approach (DDL) and the new materials (corpora) without also having to worry about the new technology at the start. Indeed, such has been common practice in many DDL studies. However, to date there has been no empirical research aiming to compare the use of paper-based and hands-on <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> directly. In this study, two groups of lower-intermediate level students were introduced to English language corpora in the last 15 - 20 minutes of their regular weekly class, alternating between paper-based materials and hands-on consultation so that each learner had experience of both. After 10 weeks all students were at least moderately familiar with both formats; the efficiency of each was then compared by testing the final two items covered – language points which had previously been seen to pose problems for many of these learners. It is clear that some learners prefer working on paper at least initially, while others are quickly open to working directly on computer. The differences are discussed in relation to feedback obtained at the start and again at the end of the course, taking account of individual motivations and learning styles. The overall results suggest that there is unlikely to be a single best version of DDL for all learners in all situations at all times, and that variety and sensitivity to learner variation and local conditions is crucial...|$|E
40|$|One {{possible}} {{exploitation of}} corpus linguistics is for learners {{to access the}} data themselves, in what Johns (e. g. 1991) has called “data-driven learning” or DDL. The approach has generated considerable empirical research, generally with positive results, although quantitative outcomes tend to remain fairly small or not statistically significant. One {{possible explanation is that}} such quantitative data conceal substantial variation, with some learners benefiting considerably, others not at all. This paper sets out to see if the variation can be related to learning styles and preferences, a field as yet virtually unexplored even for inductive/deductive preferences (e. g. Chan & Liou, 2005). In this study, learners of English at a French architectural college were encouraged to explore the BNC ([URL] for 15 minutes {{at the end of each}} class for specific points which had come up during the lesson. The learners completed a French version of the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) based on the model first developed by Felder and Silverman (1988 / 2002). This instrument, originally designed for engineering students, has also been widely used in language learning (e. g. Felder & Henriques, 1995), is quick and easy to administer, and provides numerical scores for each learner on four scales (active / reflective, sensing / intuitive, visual / verbal, sequential / global). The results are described, and compared against two further sets of data collected from the participants at the end of the semester. Firstly, they completed a questionnaire concerning their reactions to the DDL activities in their course; secondly, their <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> skills were tested in the lab on a number of new points. If it can be shown that DDL is particularly appropriate for certain learner profiles, it may help teachers to tailor its implementation in class for more or less receptive learners, and perhaps increase the appeal of DDL to a wider learner population.

40|$|International audienceThe {{advent of}} {{electronic}} corpora {{has had a}} dramatic impact in many fields, and it has even been suggested that language learners may benefit from direct <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation.</b> However, there is scepticism in some quarters that the advantages might not justify the investment {{in terms of time}} and effort in mastering the relevant tools for techniques which are themselves tedious, mechanical and time-consuming. Nonetheless, the multiple affordances of a corpus approach provide reason to think the investment might have larger pay-offs than often realised: familiarity with corpora can be applied across sub-disciplines in many if not all courses in a typical university degree in language. Further, learners can start using corpora productively even with minimal training in distance education, quickly going beyond simple concordancing. The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at a French distance education centre. While corpora are widely used in translation teaching, this often involves the compilation of specific parallel corpora by the students. In this course, students have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English, thus enabling them to work immediately. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British (100 million words) and American (400 million words) English is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are easy for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features: this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used. Results are presented from the 2 -hour on-line exams where the methodology section requires the students to demonstrate and explain their use of corpora in translating a given text. Comparing data from two sessions shows how the students come to grips with corpora for translation, and allows a qualitative analysis of individual performance on the various techniques used with greater of lesser success. These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after each exam session to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to corpus use beyond the usual concordance lines, including frequencies, register distributions, collocates lists, word comparisons, and so on, which allow the learner to ask not just 'can I say this', but 'is this appropriate'...|$|E
40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{intrinsic}} {{value for the}} purposes of language description, corpora can be used in language courses under the broad umbrella term of "data-driven learning", or DDL (Johns 1990). They {{can be used as a}} teaching aid or learning tool, but also as a reference resource, particularly for writing and revision / error-correction, with an increasing body of empirical evidence (cf. Boulton in press) largely concerning students needing English for academic purposes. Corpora can also be used as a reference resource in translation, and here the DDL-related research focuses largely on translation trainees (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). However, as Zanettin (2009) points out, translation is also a staple activity in many undergraduate language programmes where learners may also benefit from <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> and not just to help with the immediate translation assignment. The techniques involved build on many cognitive and metacognitive skills (O'Sullivan 2007), and once mastered, can be applied to other language courses and a variety of future language needs. The main research question in this paper is thus: Can general language corpora be used by non-translation students for translation purposes? The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at the distance education centre of a French university. They have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British and American English (100 million and 400 + million words respectively) is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation.

40|$|The {{advent of}} {{language}} corpora {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century has left virtually no domain of linguistics untouched. This is partly because, apart from constituting an object of research, they also (if controversially) represent a methodology for linguistic enquiry. As such, they can be applied in any text-based field from cultural studies to literature, and even for learning purposes as long as the learner is put in the position of 'researcher' in what Johns (1990) has called "data-driven learning". Though DDL is most closely associated with language learning, the main interest of corpora for language learners may be as a reference resource in producing and revising written texts, including for translation purposes - indeed, considerable work has been conducted on the use of corpora in dedicated translation degrees especially using parallel corpora (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). Less has been made of corpora in the ubiquitous translation courses of general undergraduate language degrees (cf. Zanettin 2009), though the advantages frequently attributed to <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> are likely to apply here too. This paper explores the first corpus steps of 3 rd-year English undergraduates in France. The students have no previous experience of corpus use, and the distance context limits the opportunities for training as well as access to corpora and tools. In their French-English translation course, they are required to use the free, stable, simple interface to monolingual English corpora (up to 450 M words) provided by Mark Davies at [URL] The site is suitable for novice users and is accompanied by tutorials and help features; this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email support is always available, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally underused. Following an earlier pilot study (Author 2012), the results presented here derive from an on-line evaluation where the methodology component requires the students to choose sections of a previously unseen text and demonstrate and explain how they use corpora to solve the problems encountered in context. This type of 'languaging' (e. g. Swain 2006) draws on linguistic knowledge, self-awareness and translation competence, thereby constituting a useful learning technique for students as well as providing valuable insights into their underlying thinking. The data show how the students come to grips with linguistic corpora for translation, allowing both a quantitative analysis of the functions used and a qualitative analysis of individual processes and outcomes. The findings are backed up by questionnaires submitted at the end of the course to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to two issues. Firstly, these corpora were originally created primarily for linguistic research purposes - how well do they cross the divide for use in translation and language learning? Secondly, although the students are majoring in English, they have little training in 'linguistics' - what linguistic difficulties do these students encounter in using such corpora in translation?

40|$|International audienceCorpus {{linguistics}} is, by {{its very}} nature, an applied field, with potential relevance in any area which deals with text {{in one form or}} another. One of the earliest such applications was in language teaching, where it is commonly associated with the work of Tim Johns (1990). He coined the phrase data-driven learning (DDL), which is still commonly used as a cover term for any use of language corpora or associated corpus linguistic tools or techniques for L 2 users. The last 20 -odd years have seen considerable output of academic papers in the area, outlining possible activities, describing actual courses, explaining and justifying the rationale, and so on. The obvious question, of course, is: "Does it work?" There are several ways of addressing this, the most obvious being to conduct an original study to collect new data on specific questions. As individual studies accumulate, however, some kind of overview becomes necessary to gain a broader picture of the field as a whole. Considerable work in applied linguistics over recent years has sought to find ways to make such research synthesis as systematic as possible, and can generally be divided into two broad streams: narrative synthesis and meta-analysis, each with its own advantages and disadvantages (see the papers in Norris and Ortega 2006 for an overview). The narrative synthesis is not unlike the traditional 'literature review' which features in the introductions to many academic papers. It differs in avoiding the narrow focus of a specific topic, and attempts a systematic trawl of all relevant publications, thus reducing the subjective selection of papers for consideration. But it potentially falls down on the rigour of the analysis itself, which can retain some of the problems inherent in literature reviews (e. g. Boulton 2010 on learning outcomes of DDL; Boulton 2012 on DDL in English for Specific Purposes). The meta-analysis involves essentially the same systematic collection of papers, but focuses exclusively on quantitative studies, thus neglecting the value of qualitative studies (for an overview, see Richards 2009). It is thus less broad in coverage than the narrative synthesis, and the analysis is potentially reductive and simplistic, lumping together of all types of specificities of individual studies. Its advantage is that it allows a pooling of the quantitative data from all relevant studies available. This paper presents a meta-analysis of DDL studies (cf. the preliminary work in Cobb and Boulton forthcoming). The work is still in progress, but to date we have collected 140 papers which seek to evaluate some aspect of L 2 corpus use, of which 21 provide suitable quantitative data - minimally, means and standard deviations deriving from pre/post-tests and/or experimental/control groups. Work so far suggests a substantial effect size, currently standing at 1. 42 standard deviations. Focus on a single effect size figure can be strategically or politically expedient (cf. Grgurović et al. 2013), but meta-analysts are keen to go beyond this to avoid a reductionist picture in such a complex area as language learning (cf. Larsen-Freeman and Cameron 2008). This paper thus seeks to situate the study, with the focus correspondingly not only on the outcome itself but also on the issues raised in collecting and selecting the studies for inclusion, as well as in analysing and sorting the resulting data. Due consideration is given in particular to the deliberately broad definition of DDL, which we have taken to include all uses of corpora by non-native speakers. This seems to be compatible with Johns' original vision, and since DDL clearly means a range of different things to different people, it seems sensible to begin with a broad sweep. We also discuss the inclusion / exclusion criteria in the selection process: we make no distinction between papers appearing in prestigious peer-reviewed journals and elsewhere - smaller journals, book chapters, conference proceedings, as well as 'grey' literature in the form of unpublished doctoral theses (though we exclude research which has not been formally written up, such as unpublished conference presentations or slides). This should ensure that quality work published outside mainstream sources is not ignored, and that negative outcomes in particular {{are less likely to be}} overlooked (Oswald and Plonsky 2010). Some meta-analyses have introduced weighting systems, though we have initially attempted to avoid such a priori judgements. Other issues arise from the pooling of quantitative data from highly varied studies - in other words, are the studies sufficiently similar that their results can be legitimately pooled at all? Though we argue that we are not comparing apples and oranges in the overall meta-analysis, the studies can usefully be grouped into different sub-categories for more in-depth understanding, and in one of two ways. In terms of research design, particular importance is accorded to the distinction between the effectiveness of a treatment (as measured by within-groups pre/post-tests: ES = 1. 68; d =. 84) and its relative efficiency (between groups: ES = 1. 04; d =. 73). In terms of research questions, it is also possible to derive a number of sub-categorisations allowing meta-analyses of subsets depending on more focused topics, thus allowing greater depth of understanding on more specific issues. As in corpus linguistics, raw data and statistics are useful, but they need interpretation and contextualisation to become meaningful. A careful meta-analysis, with transparent inclusion criteria and sensitivity to individual differences between studies, provides one way of combining both, underlining the importance of effect size in relation to statistical significance (cf. Duff et al. 2007). As such, it allows us to go some way towards overcoming the fragmentation of the field and to provide some kind of evaluation of the state of research in DDL as a whole. In devising more focused subsets of studies, we are able to adopt a realistic evaluation (Pawson and Tilley 1997) and address not just the question of 'Does it work?', but how effective and efficient it might be in different forms for different learners for different purposes in different circumstances.
