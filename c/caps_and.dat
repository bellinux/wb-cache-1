40|$|The use of {{emissions}} trading (<b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade) is gaining worldwide recognition as an extremely effective policy tool. The U. S. Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2) Emissions Trading Program has achieved an unprecedented level {{of environmental protection}} in a cost-effective manner. The successful results of the program have led domestic and foreign governments to consider the application of <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade to address other air quality issues. Certain analyses are particularly important in determining whether or not <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade is an appropriate policy tool. This paper offers a set of questions {{that can be used}} as criteria for determining whether or not <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade is the preferred policy approach to an environmental problem.

5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> stipes, {{often with}} indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined <b>caps</b> <b>and</b> partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cap</b> <b>and</b> trade {{programs}} {{are increasingly being}} used to reduce emissions from electricity generation in the United States. <b>Cap</b> <b>and</b> trade programs primarily target emitting generators, but programs have also included renewable generators, such as wind generators. States cite several reasons why they have considered the policy option of including renewable generators in <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade programs: to provide an incentive for lower-emitting generation, to achieve emissions reductions in non-capped pollutants, and to gain local economic benefits associated with renewable energy projects. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency also notes these rationales for considering this policy alternative, and the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners (NARUC) passed a resolution supporting the inclusion of renewable energy in <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade programs. This report explores why states consider this policy option, what participation could mean for wind generators, and how wind generation can most effectively be included in state, federal, <b>and</b> regional <b>cap</b> <b>and</b> trade programs...|$|R
