40|$|Over {{the past}} several years, Asian governments have made {{remarkable}} improvements in government bond issuances. However, {{there is very little}} progress of disintemediation in the region. It is because corporate bonds remain underdeveloped in Asia. The key issue of Asian corporate bond market is its lack of credit ratings at investment grade. Without the status of investment grade, Asian corporate bond cannot easily gain access to international and domestic institutional investors and the corporate bonds cannot grow easily. Three key institutional foundations are crucial to accelerate the growth of the Asian corporate bonds, namely credit insurance, securitization and Asian bond funds. The first two foundations can transform Asian corporate bonds to be investment-grade assets and the last one can enlarge the investor base of the corporate bonds. Top-rated insurers can transform Asian corporate bonds to be investment-grade assets.

I then focus on the pertinent operational aspects of a credit insurance business, i. e. marketing and sales, underwriting, claims and reinsurance with particular reference to the role ethics can and should play in each of them. By drawing together the outcomes of these various deliberations the basic guidelines for the drafting of codes of ethics in the credit insurance industry will be developed (obviously each company has to design its own code in line with its own corporate culture, values and circumstances).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} the determination and forecast of the number of defaults andcredit changes by estimating a reduced-form ordered regression model with a large data setfrom a credit insurance portfolio. Similarly to banks with their classical credit risk managementtechniques, <b>credit</b> <b>insurers</b> measure the <b>credit</b> quality of buyers with rating transition matricesdepending on the economical environment. Our approach consists in modeling stochastic transitionmatrices for homogeneous groups of firms depending on macroeconomic risk factors. One ofthe main features of this business is the close monitoring of covered firms and the insurer’s abilityto cancel or reduce guarantees when the risk changes. As our primary goal is a risk managementanalysis, we try to account for this leeway and study how this helps mitigate risks in case ofshocks.

40|$|Business {{and credit}} cycles {{have an impact}} on credit insurance, as they do on other businesses. Nevertheless, in credit insurance, the impact of the {{systemic}} risk is even more important and can lead to major losses during a crisis. Because of this, the insurer surveils and manages policies almost continuously. The management actions it takes limit the consequences of a downturning cycle. However, the traditional modeling of economic capital {{does not take into account}} this important feature of credit insurance. This paper proposes a model aiming to estimate future losses of a credit insurance portfolio, while taking into account the insurer’s management actions. The model considers the capacity of the <b>credit</b> <b>insurer</b> to take on less risk in the case of a cycle downturn, but also the inverse, in the case of a cycle upturn; so, losses are predicted with a more dynamic perspective. According to our results, the economic capital is over-estimated when not considering the management actions of the insurer...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between a debtor country's external financial indicators and the costs associated with the insurance of export credits to that country. For this purpose a stylized model of export credit insurance (ECI) is developed, the central idea being that ECI is similar to a contingent claim such as a European put option. Thus, tools from option pricing theory were used to calculate the price of ECI, implying that not only the current financial position but also the volatility of the changes in that position determine such costs. The empirical results of a statistical analysis of the premium rates for ECI, applied by a private export <b>credit</b> <b>insurer</b> to seventy-seven developing countries during 1993, provide some support for these hypotheses. In particular, the reserves-over-imports ratio of a debtor country and the volatility of the rates of change of this ratio appear to contribute significantly to the premium rates that apply to that country. Thus, the article provides evidence that option pricing parameters do play role in practical insurance pricing, even if this pricing is not explicitly based on these parameters. Premium rates are set as if an underlying option market operated. Thus, the trade of countries with volatile external financial positions is saddled with higher costs than that of countries with more stable positions.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the observation that countries in adverse extemal financial situations have to make larger use of more expensive trade financing and payment arrangements. It attempts {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the channels through which the external financial situation of debtor countries affects their trade financing, and to identify the determinants of the costs associated with such financing. These costs reflect the higher risk of default associated with credits extended to them and include, for example, interest rate spreads and credit insurance premia. For the purpose of demonstrating the channels through which the perception of such a risk influences these costs, the study adopts the perspective of a "small" creditor or <b>credit</b> <b>insurer,</b> meaning that the risk is exogenous to the creditor/insurer. This leaves the problem of incorporating these risks in the credit insurance premia and interest rate spreads. For this purpose, a theoretical concept of the determination of credit insurance premia is established. Based on the idea that export credit insurance, viewed as a security, is similar to a contingent claim, such as a European put option, the concept uses tools from option pricing theory. Some of its implications are compared with observations and found to be consistent with them, i. e. there is some support for the following hypotheses. The less favourable a country's solvency and liquidity indicators, the higher are the insurance premium rates applying to it, the latter indicators appearing to be relatively more important than the former ones. Moreover, they are higher the greater the volatility of the rates of change in these indicators. The impact of the share of public (and publicly guaranteed) debt in total foreign debt on the costs of external financing is discussed within the same theoretical framework. It is shown that these costs may be a non-monotonic function of that share...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine Australian {{exporter}} perceptions of export credit insurance (ECI) value and ECI value drivers to help uncover how Australian (and other) exporters can optimize their ECI use. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses a 1, 000 firm survey of how Australian ECI users and non-users perceive the value of often-cited attributes of ECI and multiple regression analysis to create a model of ECI value drivers. Findings – Most ECI value is derived from the increased trade exporters can manage with ECI protection and from improved access to trade finance. Clear differences are observable in perceived ECI value between larger and smaller exporters as well as between ECI users and non-users. Originality/value – This paper provides the first evidence of perceived ECI value to Australian exporters as well as differences between ECI users and non-users. Export <b>credit</b> <b>insurers</b> and export support agencies need to focus on these differences to ensure that ECI is being optimally marketed and used by Australian exporters. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Companies face various risks when {{participating}} in international business. Even though exporting {{has been argued}} to represent low level of international commitment, exporters still face more risks in comparison to companies with purely domestic business activities. Among different risks lies credit risk which refers to possible non-payment or late payment of a customer. While exporters’ credit management is responsible for controlling credit risk, credit management in an international environment requires exporters to cope with incomplete information about customers’ creditworthiness and risks related to customers’ home countries. Even though there are various ways to conduct credit management, exporters may choose to acquire export credit insurance to support their credit management practices. By acquiring export credit insurance, exporters can hedge credit risk to credit insurers. This mitigates exporters’ {{exposure to credit risk}} if their customers fail to pay for purchased goods or services i. e. in case when credit risk realizes. This study explored exporters’ views on the value that export credit insurance provides for credit management practices. In this study, value refers to the benefit or benefits that export credit insurance provides. Theoretical background of the study includes literature relating to themes such as export credit insurance, credit management and risks related to internationalization. The study applied a qualitative research approach through five expert interviews from two Finnish exporters and one private export <b>credit</b> <b>insurer.</b> Expert interviews were considered as the most suitable method to collect data in order to create in-depth understanding of an underresearched topic, compare interviewees’ perceptions with current literature as well as to reveal new perceptions towards the value that export credit insurance provides for exporters and their credit management. Based on the existing literature and empirical research, it can be concluded that exporters see that export credit insurance provides value mainly through risk transfer. Risk transfer may also enable exporters to gain additional benefits such as expanding export sales to destinations where they have not sold before. In addition, export credit insurance can enable exporters to outsource a part of their credit management to credit insurers and to provide clear guidelines for exporters that have sufficient resources for independent credit management practices. On the contrary, it seems that exporters’ value perceptions towards export credit insurance are dependent on the extent of insurance coverage that exporters have for their customer base. At the same time, exporters may easily question the premise of export credit insurance if the level of customer non-payments is low...|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} behavior of consumers and banks {{in the presence of}} government as the <b>credit</b> <b>insurer</b> of last resort. Consumers have an option to file for bankruptcy under law when there are unexpected adverse shocks, while banks, especially large banks, are supported by the government during financial crisis because of systemic risk. I explore the heterogeneous behavior among consumers and banks with adverse shocks. In the first chapter of my dissertation, my inquiry focuses on the heterogeneous behavior of households in filing for bankruptcy. In the literature, there are two theories in explaining personal bankruptcy: adverse event theory and strategic timing theory. Fay, Hurst and White(FHW) 2002 (AER) include both financial benefit and adverse event variables in explaining the bankruptcy decision, and they find only financial benefit from filing is significant in explaining whether to file or not. Our argument is that adverse events may not work directly on bankruptcy decisions, however, they operate by running a higher amount of debt. Thus FHW's setting may not be appropriate. Instead, adverse event consumers' debt occurs after adverse events, while strategic timing consumers' debt decision and bankruptcy decision are jointly determined, which means their debt or financial benefit is endogenous; thus we propose that the endogeneity test of financial benefit is a way to distinguish the two types of consumers. Assuming only one type exists in the sample, we find support for adverse event theory. Extending the analysis to allow for both adverse events and strategic timing consumers shows existence of both types of filers, and strategic timing filers are more sensitive to financial benefit. Additionally, lower access to debt markets and lower income significantly increase the chance of strategic behavior. The second part of my dissertation is to study the effectiveness of the Troubled Asset Relief Program(TARP) on banks' loan to asset ratio. One of the fundamental objectives of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is to stimulate bank loan growth. I use panel data to study the dynamic effect of TARP investments on banks' loan to asset ratio (LTA). I find that TARP stimulate recipients' LTA growth as a whole, and the effect is significant only for medium banks(asset between 1 billion and 10 billion), with an annual decrease of 14 percentage points in LTA with the LTA in treatment quarter as benchmark. In terms of a dollar amount, 7. 71 dollar more loans are generated for every TARP dollar invested in medium banks, compared with the average level of the quarters before TARP. There is no significant effect on small banks or big banks. Using graphs and different regression models, I argue that the dynamic setting, rather than the cross-sectional comparison, is more appropriate...|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{there has}} been a pivot back to Receivables Financing Factoring (finance) programs, {{primarily}} driven by enhancements in technology which has increased the efficiency and attractiveness of Receivables-based programs. In a Supplier Financing model there is a heavy administrative burden caused by the need to negotiate Receivables Purchase Agreements with each individual Supplier, whereas in Factoring (finance) programs only one RPA is required with the Vendor. In addition, traditionally there was a larger effort involved in calculating the Funders credit risk exposure in a Receivables-based program due to the many Buyers which needed to be credit evaluated on an ongoing basis. Technology has now automated much of the credit evaluation process allowing program Funders access to real-time Buyer risk ratings across their portfolio. This transparency generates increased credit appetites from program Funders and <b>Credit</b> <b>Insurers</b> and benefits the Vendor through attractive rates and increased program credit limits on their Buyers. Vendors can also use the receivables-based approach to increase competitiveness by extending payment terms to their Buyers Off-balance-sheet.
