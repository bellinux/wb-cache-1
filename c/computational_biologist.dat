40|$|Molecular and <b>computational</b> <b>biologists</b> {{develop new}} {{insights}} by gathering heterogeneous data from genomic databases and leveraging bioinformatics tools.

We further observed that such interactions are critical for forming new scientific hypotheses. These observations motivated the creation of G-nome Surfer, a tabletop interface for collaborative exploration of genomic data that implements multi-touch and tangible interaction techniques. G-nome Surfer was developed in close collaboration with domain scientists and is aimed at lowering the threshold for using bioinformatics tools.
