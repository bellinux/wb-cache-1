As the initial flow speed increases further, the transition becomes more abrupt, until at high enough speeds, the transition front will break and curl back upon itself. When this happens, the jump can be accompanied by violent turbulence, eddying, air entrainment, and surface undulations, or waves.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimentally}} proven {{range of}} application of the influence-coefficient balancing method, especially the least-squares procedure, is extended to include the case of multiple bending <b>critical</b> <b>speeds</b> within the operating range of a test rotor. Tests were conducted on a laboratory quality machine capable of speeds up to 18, 000 rpm in order to investigate several distinct practical aspects of flexible-rotor balancing. These include: (1) balancing for operation through four bending <b>critical</b> <b>speeds,</b> (2) balancing of rotors mounted in both rigid and flexible bearing supports, (3) balancing of rotors with various amounts of measured vibration-response data and different numbers of correction planes, and (4) balancing of rotors with different arbitrary initial-unbalance configurations. The results show that a lightly damped, flexible rotor can be balanced systematically and efficiently through four bending <b>critical</b> <b>speeds.</b> It is concluded that the influence-coefficient method should be equally applicable to rotors or shafts having more than four bending <b>critical</b> <b>speeds</b> in their operating-speed ranges...|$|R

25|$|A {{classical}} hunting oscillation is a swaying {{motion of}} a railway vehicle (often called truck hunting) {{caused by the}} coning action on which the directional stability of an adhesion railway depends. It arises from the interaction of adhesion forces and inertial forces. At low speed, adhesion dominates but, as the speed increases, the adhesion forces and inertial forces become comparable in magnitude and the oscillation begins at a <b>critical</b> <b>speed.</b> Above this speed, the motion can be violent, damaging track and wheels and potentially causing derailment.
