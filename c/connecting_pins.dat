5000|$|The MIDI {{specification}} {{provides for}} a ground [...] "wire" [...] and a braid or foil shield, <b>connected</b> on <b>pin</b> 2, protecting the two signal-carrying conductors on pins 4 and 5. Although the MIDI cable is supposed to <b>connect</b> <b>pin</b> 2 and the braid or foil shield to chassis ground, it should do so only at the MIDI out port; the MIDI in port should leave pin 2 unconnected and isolated. Some large manufacturers of MIDI devices use modified MIDI in-only DIN 5-pin sockets with the metallic conductors intentionally omitted at pin positions 1, 2, and 3 so that the maximum voltage isolation is obtained.|$|R
50|$|The basic bridge {{consists}} of three main parts. The bridge's strength {{is provided by the}} panels on the sides. The panels are 10 ft, 5 ft, cross-braced rectangles that each weigh 570 lb, and can be lifted by six men. The panel was constructed of welded steel. The top and bottom chord of each panel had interlocking male and female lugs into which engineers could inset panel <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The loctal tube's {{structure}} was supported {{directly by the}} <b>connecting</b> <b>pins</b> passing through the glass [...] "button" [...] base. Octal tube structures were supported on a glass [...] "pinch", formed by heating {{the bottom of the}} envelope to fusing temperature, then squeezing the pinch closed. Sealing the pinch embedded the connecting wires in the pinch's glass and gave a vacuum-tight seal. The connecting wires then passed through the hollow base pins, where they were soldered to make permanent connections.|$|E
50|$|When a {{cable is}} {{terminated}} by a connector, the various wires {{in the cable}} are connected to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of <b>connecting</b> <b>pins</b> to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|E
25|$|The female XLR {{connectors}} {{are designed}} to first <b>connect</b> <b>pin</b> 1 (the earth pin), before the other pins make contact, when a male XLR connector is inserted. With the ground connection established before the signal lines are connected, the insertion (and removal) of XLR connectors in live equipment is possible without picking up external signals (as usually happens with, for example, RCA connectors).|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} dictates color-coded connectors {{for easy}} identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors {{are different from}} one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for <b>pin</b> 34 <b>connected</b> to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, {{the presence of a}} ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and <b>connect</b> host <b>pin</b> 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to <b>pin</b> 28 but <b>connects</b> <b>pin</b> 34 normally, while the black end connector <b>connects</b> both <b>pins</b> 28 and 34 normally.|$|R
50|$|On {{boards that}} use the TDA1517 amplifier, Creative used 470uF {{capacitors}} for the outputs where the TDA1517 datasheet schematic suggested 1000uF units. Depending on the board, an undervalued capacitor for supply voltage rejection (<b>connecting</b> <b>pin</b> 3 of the TDA1517 to ground) {{may also have been}} used; the datasheet recommends a 100uF unit for this application. The two output capacitors have a DC voltage present, so polarized units may be used.|$|R
50|$|For {{programming}} {{a device}} (IC) which is either inserted into a socket (often ZIF) {{on top of}} the programmer, or the programmer is directly connected by an adapter to the circuit board (on-board programming: in-circuit programming / in-system programming). Afterwards the data is transferred from the programmer into the device by applying signals through the <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b> Some devices have a serial interface for receiving the programming data (JTAG interface). Other devices require the data on parallel pins, followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device.|$|E
50|$|A single in-line (pin) package (SIP or SIPP) has one row of <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b> It is not {{as popular}} as the DIP, but {{has been used for}} {{packaging}} RAM chips and multiple resistors with a common pin. SIPs group RAM chips together on a small board either by the DIP process or surface mounting SMD process. The board itself has a single row of pin-leads that resembles a comb extending from its bottom edge, which plug into a special socket on a system or system-expansion board. SIPs are commonly found in memory modules. As compared to DIPs with a typical maximum I/O count of 64, SIPs have a typical maximum I/O count of 24 with lower package costs.|$|E
50|$|A better {{solution}} was to use a single double-sided gab. These were initially X-shaped and sat between the two <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b> X-gabs were also usually reversed, so that the gab {{was placed on the}} valve spindle and the pins were instead connected to the eccentric rods. The gab now stayed still vertically and the pins were moved up and down to engage them. This was done by joining both pins with a short vertical bar. The driver's reversing lever moved the centre of this bar, thus the pins, up and down to engage one at a time with opposite faces of the X-gab. This valve gear was used on Stephenson's locomotives of the early 1830s, such as Rocket.|$|E
50|$|When {{inserted}} into the socket, the Schuko plug covers the socket cavity (1) and establishes protective-earth connection through the earth clips (2) before the line and neutral pins (3) establish contact, thereby preventing users from touching <b>connected</b> <b>pins.</b> A pair of non-conductive guiding notches (4) {{on the left and}} right side provides extra stability, enabling the safe use of large and heavy plugs (e.g. with built-in transformers or timers).|$|R

50|$|There exists no well {{established}} standard in which polarity pins 2 and 5 {{of the phone}} socket are <b>connected</b> to <b>pins</b> 4 and 5 of the 8P8C connector; both alternatives are common. This polarity is not important; e.g. BT also no longer specifies in which polarity the A and B wires are <b>connected</b> to <b>pins</b> 2 and 5 of their master telephone socket, although earlier standards specified that the A wire be connected to 5 and the B wire to 2.|$|R
5000|$|The type 955 triode [...] "acorn tube" [...] {{is a small}} triode {{thermionic}} valve (vacuum tube in USA) designed primarily to operate at high frequency; although data books specify an upper limit of 400-600 MHz, some circuits may obtain gain up to about 900 MHz. Interelectrode capacitances and Miller capacitances are minimized by the small dimensions of the device and the widely separated pins. The <b>connecting</b> <b>pins</b> are placed around {{the periphery of the}} bulb and project radially outward: this maintains short internal leads with low inductance, an important property allowing operation at high frequency. The pins fit a special socket fabricated as a ceramic ring in which the valve itself occupies the central space.|$|E
50|$|In micro{{electronic}}s, a {{dual in-line package}} (DIP or DIL), or dual in-line pin package (DIPP) is {{an electronic}} component package with a rectangular housing and two parallel rows of electrical <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b> The package may be through-hole mounted to {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) or inserted in a socket. The dual-inline format was invented by Don Forbes, Rex Rice and Bryant Rogers at Fairchild R&D in 1964, when the restricted number of leads available on circular transistor-style packages became a limitation in the use of integrated circuits. Increasingly complex circuits required more signal and power supply leads (as observed in Rents rule); eventually microprocessors and similar complex devices required more leads than could be put on a DIP package, leading to development of higher-density packages. Furthermore, square and rectangular packages made it easier to route printed-circuit traces beneath the packages.|$|E
5000|$|Low power triodes have a {{concentric}} construction (see drawing right), {{with the}} grid and plate as circular or oval cylinders surrounding the cathode. The cathode is a narrow metal tube down the center. Inside the cathode is a filament called the [...] "heater" [...] {{consisting of a}} narrow strip of high resistance tungsten wire, which heats the cathode red-hot (800 - 1000 °C). This type is called an [...] "indirectly heated cathode" [...] The cathode is coated {{with a mixture of}} alkaline earth oxides such as calcium and thorium oxide which reduces its work function so it produces more electrons. The grid is constructed of a helix or screen of thin wires surrounding the cathode. The plate is a cylinder or rectangular box of sheet metal surrounding the grid. It is blackened to radiate heat and is often equipped with heat-radiating fins. The electrons travel in a radial direction, from the cathode through the grid wires to the plate. The elements are held in position by mica or ceramic insulators and are supported by stiff wires attached to the base, where the electrodes are brought out to <b>connecting</b> <b>pins.</b> A [...] "getter", a small amount of shiny barium metal evaporated onto the inside of the glass, helps maintain the vacuum by absorbing gas released in the tube over time.|$|E
