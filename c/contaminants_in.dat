5|$|The EFSA Panel on <b>Contaminants</b> <b>in</b> the Food Chain {{specifies}} that 2.5 μg/kg {{body weight}} is a {{tolerable weekly intake}} for humans. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has declared 7 μg/kg bw to be the {{provisional tolerable weekly intake}} level.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, short-circuiting, spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|Commercially {{available}} iron {{is classified}} based on purity and {{the abundance of}} additives. Pig iron has 3.5–4.5% carbon and contains varying amounts of contaminants such as sulfur, silicon and phosphorus. Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step {{in the production of}} cast iron and steel. The reduction of <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2–4% carbon, 1–6% silicon, and small amounts of manganese. Pig iron has a melting point in the range of 1420–1470K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together. Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} laws that govern an ERH remediation. Dalton’s law governs {{the boiling point}} of a {{relatively}} insoluble contaminant.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} {{a concentration of}} a <b>contaminant</b> <b>in</b> a first sample is described. The method includes producing the first sample, adding a plurality of immuno-beads to a test substance; exposing a crystal microbalance immunosensor to the first sample; determining a change in a first motional resistance of the crystal microbalance immunosensor following exposure to the first sample (Delta R 1); and determining the concentration of the <b>contaminant</b> <b>in</b> the first sample according to Delta R 1...|$|R
5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in waste water treatment of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Submerged {{arc welding}} (SAW) is a {{high-productivity}} welding method {{in which the}} arc is struck beneath a covering layer of flux. This increases arc quality, since <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere are blocked by the flux. The slag that forms on the weld generally comes off by itself, and combined {{with the use of}} a continuous wire feed, the weld deposition rate is high. Working conditions are much improved over other arc welding processes, since the flux hides the arc and almost no smoke is produced. The process is commonly used in industry, especially for large products and in the manufacture of welded pressure vessels. Other arc welding processes include atomic hydrogen welding, electroslag welding, electrogas welding, and stud arc welding.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control gas flow {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate <b>contaminants</b> <b>in</b> the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
