[...] In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid ("cherry blackfly", Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> (Rhagoletis cingulata and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), {{which in turn is}} the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.|$|E

Feeding time and food consumption response patterns in both sexes within age groups were curvilinear. Feeding times increased as sucrose concentrations increased, and were longest when the sucrose concentration was 100 % (dry). Consumption of dilute wet sucrose was low, whereas consumption of concentrated wet sucrose was high. However, consumption of dry, 100 %sucrose was also low. One to 2 -day-old flies of both sexes that had not previously fed consumed more sucrose foods than unfed 8 – 24 -h-old flies and 10 – 12 - and 31 – 36 -day-old flies that had beenstar ved for 16 – 24 h. Females consumed more thanmales, but they consumed the same amount as males per mg bodyweight. When fed single 20 % and 60 % sucrose meals, 1 – 2 -day-old flies survived longer compared to flies in all other age groups, with 31 – 36 -day-old flies surviving shortest. Despite age-related differences in survival, in general, no sex differences in survival were seen in flies fed sucrose within any age groups, or in flies fed sucrose-yeast, cherry juice and honeydew foods.

40|$|Abstract: The European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly,</b> Rhagoletis cerasi (L.) (Diptera: Tephritidae), is {{a highly}} {{destructive}} pest. The low tolerance for damaged fruit requires preventive insecticide treatments for a marketable crop. The phase-out of old insecticides threatens cherry production throughout the European Union (EU). Consequently, new management techniques and tools are needed. With {{the increasing number of}} dwarf tree orchards covered against rain to avoid fruit splitting, crop netting has become a viable, cost-effective method of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> control. Recently, a biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed for organic agriculture. However, for most situations, there is still a lack of efficient and environmentally sound insecticides to control this pest. This review summarizes the literature from over one hundred years of research on R. cerasi with focus on the biology and history of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> control as well as on antagonists and potential biocontrol organisms. We will present the situation of <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> regulation in different European countries, give recommendations for <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> control, show gaps in knowledge and identify future research opportunities...|$|E

40|$|The genus Rhagoletis Loew {{includes}} about 65 known species {{distributed throughout}} Europe, Asia and America. Most species are oligophagous, attacking {{only a few}} closely related host plants. The European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> R. cerasi is the economically most important pest species in Europe. R. batava and R. alternata can also cause economic damage in Europe. In addition to these species, the American <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> species R. cingulata, R. indifferens and R. fausta, {{as well as the}} apple maggot R. pomonella, the blueberry maggot R. mendax, and the walnut infesting species R. completa and R. suavis are pest insects of high economic importance. R. cingulata and R. completa were recently introduced to Europe and are currently spreading in Central Europe. A lot of research was conducted on integrated control of the European <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> R. cerasi during the past hundred years. For the monitoring of flight period of R. cerasi yellow sticky traps are used. This method was shown to give reliable results for the timing of application. However, an economic threshold cannot be determined with yellow sticky traps, because fruit infestation is also influenced by crop load and weather conditions during oviposition period of flies. Chemical control (Insecticides) of R. cerasi is currently impeded by the withdrawal of “old” organophoshporus compounds (Dimethoate) and the debate on side-effects of neonicotinoids. Attract-and-kill strategies are available or under development: food baits (based on yeast hydrolysate and sugar) are mixed with the organic insecticides Spinosad or Neem. The baits attract the flies, stimulate feeding and thus increase uptake of the insecticide. However, the efficacy of attract-and-kill strategies strongly depends on the attractiveness of the bait which is influenced by climate conditions. Mass trapping by yellow sticky traps combined with baits is used for <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly</b> control in home-gardens. However, due to the high number of traps needed to achieve good control, this strategy is too expensive for commercial production. The use of kaolin as mechanical barrier on the fruit surface to prevent oviposition was shown to be effective against R. indifferens and R. mendax. Because kaolin treatments leave white residues on fruit, this method is not used against <b>cherry</b> <b>fruit</b> <b>fly.</b> Recently, it was shown that oil products can also prevent oviposition by creating a slippery layer on the fruit surface. A biocontrol method using the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana has been developed and is currently registered in serveral European countries (product Naturalis-L). This strategy is mainly used in organic production. Another biocontrol strategy could be the use of parasitoids. However, the use of larval parasitoids is hampered by the steadily increasing fruit size of cherries for fresh consumption: parasitoids are no longer able to reach the larvae {{in the center of the}} cherry fruit.
