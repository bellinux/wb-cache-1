This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in the desktop and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, {{they are no longer}} available.|$|E

The application to build the repository was handed in by SKB 2011.|$|E
40|$|UK firms {{going public}} {{have a choice}} between public offers and placings. This choice has {{important}} implications {{in terms of who}} bears the risk of the issue failing and of its costs.

Large and multinational firms usually <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> public offer whereas {{there is some evidence that}} very small issues <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> placing. Finally, the 'hotness' of the IPO market increases the probability of placings. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2006. ...|$|R
