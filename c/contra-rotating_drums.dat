50|$|A version {{used by the}} U.S. Air Force, the U1050-II {{real-time}} system, {{had some}} extra peripherals. The most significant of these was the FASTRAND 1 Drum Storage Unit. This physically large device had two <b>contra-rotating</b> <b>drums</b> mounted horizontally, one above {{the other in a}} pressurised cabinet. Read-write heads were mounted on a horizontally moving beam between the drums, driven by a voice coil servo external to the pressurised cabinet. This high-speed access subsystem allowed the real-time operation. Another feature was the communications subsystem with modem links to remote sites. A Uniservo VI-C tape drive provided an audit trail for the transactions. Other Peripherals were the card reader and punch, and printer. The operator's console had the 'stop and go' buttons and a Teletype Model 33 teleprinter for communication and control.|$|E
