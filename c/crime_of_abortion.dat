Allied prosecutors {{made the case}} that voluntary and involuntary abortion were war crimes and crimes against humanity. The Goering Judgment identified policies promoting abortion as activities marking the Political Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party as a Criminal Organization. The Greifelt Indictment charged ten defendants with voluntary and involuntary abortion. A focus of the prosecution’s case was the removal of the protection of law from unborn children in occupied Poland and racially non-valuable unborn children of Eastern workers in Germany. The prosecution argued that voluntary abortion was punishable because it was a crime against the unborn child. The prosecution proceeded on the theory that Germany had a duty to afford protection of law to unborn children and that the deliberate failure of high level officials to do so constituted crimes against humanity and genocide by acts of omission. After summarizing evidence of voluntary abortion policies in its Judgment, the Greifelt tribunal found two defendants guilty and one not guilty of forcible abortion and seven not guilty simply of abortion. The Nuremberg tribunals generally limited their jurisdiction over crimes against humanity to offenses committed during wartime.

40|$|The task we {{have set}} {{ourselves}} is {{the investigation of the}} canonical repercussions of a controversial procedure, namely, the removal of artificially assisted feeding and hydration from an unconscious patient resulting in the patient's death. Life-support systems, including assisted feeding and hydration, are able to keep a person alive indefinitely, and the moment of death is often a matter of someone's decision and action. While the problem is not entirely new, there has been little canonical reflection on its implications. The Church's teaching on the sanctity of life is reflected in canon law, and the Code of Canon Law provides penalties and other canonical effects for homicide and abortion. There has been considerable interest in the <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion,</b> but little attention has been given to the crime of homicide, {{in spite of the fact}} that medical personnel frequently take steps to end life. This issue of the removal of artificially assisted feeding and hydration from an unconscious patient has been intensely debated by moral theologians and has been the subject of bishops' statements in many countries, particularly the United States of America. Many of these statements have been about specific cases involving Catholic patients and Catholic hospitals. These cases are significant in the light of the worldwide movement to promote euthanasia, and legislatures in several countries have debated and sometimes passed laws allowing for euthanasia. If there is to be a role for Church law in the protection of life, a review of the doctrine of homicide is opportune. Accordingly, we propose to investigate the canonical crime of homicide in the light of a controversial issue. The question we intend to address is: does the canonical crime of homicide apply to the withdrawal of assisted feeding and hydration? If so, to whom does it apply, and in what circumstances? In Chapter One we will study theological reflection on the issue. In Chapter Two we will survey relevant papal and episcopal teaching regarding the preservation of life and the principles that allow for exceptions to the duty to prolong life. Chapter Three will investigate the canonical crime of homicide. The ambit of our inquiry will be limited to the question of imputability, and we will not take up the related issues of canonical process or penalties unless they help clarify aspects of imputability...|$|E

40|$|S v Mshumpa {{dealt with}} the very {{controversial}} issue of third party foetal violence that terminates prenatal life. The decision of the Eastern Cape Division emphasised that, until live birth, a foetus is not a legal subject with constitutional rights. As {{a result of its}} position in the law, a foetus cannot be the victim of criminal conduct. The court refused to develop the common law crime of murder to include a foetus and referred this issue to the legislature to address. Concerns raised by the research task relate to the most effective method of law reform and the implications of law reform for well established legal principles concerning legal subjectivity, vestment of constitutional rights and female reproductive rights. In order to avoid these concerns, the introduction of a statutory crime is determined as the preferred method for law reform. The aim of the study is to develop a suitably defined statutory crime, with definitional elements that conform to the Constitution and criminal law principles. Before embarking on the mission of exploring possible grounds that justify law reform, the research first examines the extent of inability of the law to impose criminal liability in cases of third party violence that terminates prenatal life. Aspects that are specifically investigated include the common law crime of murder, contravention of the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, attempting the impossible and the common law <b>crime</b> <b>of</b> <b>abortion.</b> A further purpose of this examination is to determine the reasons why foetal interests are not taken into account. Appreciating the lack of criminal remedy, private law principles are considered in order to determine whether there are any principles available to supplement the deficiencies in criminal law. This research found that the value of dignity established by the founding principles of the Constitution and applied in the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act demonstrates that the state has an interest in prenatal life. The value of dignity serves as the foundation for law reform. Having established the existence of a sound legal basis which justifies law reform, the research requires an investigation into foreign jurisdictions where the crime of third party foetal violence exists {{as a result of a}} state interest in foetal life. The purpose of the investigation is to determine whether the crime is effectively implemented. The United States of America is the selected country to study because third party foetal violence receives attention at both state and federal level. The research found that the implementation of foetal homicide laws in the United States infringes on female reproductive rights and to a certain extent, the foetal homicide laws also grants a foetus legal subjectivity. The United States fails to effectively implement the crime of third party foetal violence in line with its own established legal principles. The research benefits from the study conducted on the United States in that the United States demonstrates the definitional elements the proposed crime should contain in order for the statutory crime to be harmonious with established constitutional and criminal law principles. The study concludes with the recommendation that a statutory crime be developed in the context of female reproductive rights rather than considering the foetus as the victim of crime. The statutory crime is a response to unauthorised third party violence that terminates a woman’s pregnancy. The definitional elements include foetal viability for purposes of causation and will only be applicable to intentional conduct. The value of dignity in relation to prenatal life serves as a support structure for the driving force of female reproductive rights. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.

In most countries, women aged 20 - 29 obtained the highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> and while adolescents obtained a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>abortions,</b> they do not make up a disproportionate share.
