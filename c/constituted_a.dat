5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Akkadian Empire, Hurrians began to settle in the city and its surroundings, and by c. 1725 BC they <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> sizable portion of the population. The {{presence}} of a large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, as evidenced by the existence of certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.|$|E
5|$|Historically in Lancashire, Tyldesley and its {{surroundings}} have provided {{evidence for the}} remains of a Roman road passing through the township on its ancient course between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, Tyldesley was part of the manor of Warrington, until the Norman conquest of England, when the settlement <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> township called Tyldesley-with-Shakerley in the ancient parish of Leigh.|$|E
5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance to be present) casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E

5|$|Jews were a {{significant}} {{minority in the}} Byzantine state throughout its history, and, according to Roman law, they <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> legally recognised religious group. In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of tensions and persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests, the majority of Jews found themselves outside the Empire; those left inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} {{historic}} county boundaries of Lancashire {{since the early}} 12th century, Royton anciently <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> thegnage estate, held by tenants who paid tax to the King. Royton during the Middle Ages formed a township in the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham, and hundred of Salford. Anciently, law and order was upheld in the locality by two constables, chosen by the community and appointed annually by Vestry meetings.|$|E
5|$|Many Cossacks {{were being}} hired to {{participate}} in wars waged by the Commonwealth. This status resulted in privileges and often <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> form of social upward mobility; the Cossacks resented the periodic reductions in their enrollment.

5000|$|Actions {{which might}} <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> crime {{in one state}} would not {{necessarily}} <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> crime in another state, or they might <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> crime of a different severity.

A person possessing cannabis, certain types of firearms, or exotic animals might be committing serious crimes in some states but are perfectly legal to possess in other states. A burglary might be completed only upon entry into a locked house in one state, but upon entry into an attached carport in another.|$|R

5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{following}} the Union of Lublin, became a {{counterpoint to the}} absolute monarchies gaining power in Europe. Its quasi-democratic political system of Golden Liberty, albeit limited to nobility, was mostly unprecedented {{in the history of}} Europe.

5|$|The {{significance}} of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to medieval Europe.

5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are {{understood}} {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly referred to as}} Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E
50|$|While most jurisdictions could {{probably}} agree about what <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> murder, what <b>constitutes</b> <b>a</b> homicide {{may be more}} problematic, while a crime against the person could vary widely.

5|$|Barbados is the easternmost of {{the islands}} located within the Caribbean Sea. Home to 280,000 residents, Barbados was first settled by the British in the 1620s. The nation {{remained}} a British colony until it declared total independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The first appearance of a uniquely Barbadian delegation at the Olympic games came two years after it declared independence. At its debut, nine male athletes arrived to participate at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Previously, Barbados (as a British colony) <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> {{major part of the}} West Indies Federation along with Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, which sent a delegation to participate at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Cotillo was {{member of}} the Joint Legislative Committee on Housing, {{also known as the}} Lockwood Committee because it was headed by Charles C. Lockwood. The {{committee}} investigated renting and building conditions in the City of New York and ended a spate of rent-raising {{as a result of the}} housing shortage after World War I. The group found that the housing conditions at the time <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> serious menace to public health in New York since some 400,000 persons were directly affected by the scarcity of affordable dwellings and the poor quality of the existing ones. Later he was the chairman of New York state commission to investigate child welfare, and a {{member of the}} Joint Legislative Committee to Investigate Exploitation of Immigrants (1923–24).|$|E

40|$|There is a {{well-known}} game semantics for Lukasiewicz logic, introduced by Daniele Mundici, namely the Rényi–Ulam game. Records in a Rény–Ulam game are coded by functions, which <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> MV-algebra, {{and it is possible}} to prove a completeness theorem with respect to this semantics. In this paper we investigate some probabilistic variants of the Rényi–Ulam game, and we prove that some of them <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> complete game semantics for product logic, whilst some other <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> game semantics for a logic between MTL and product logic...|$|R
5|$|During World War I, {{immigrants}} from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine {{were sent to}} Banff to work in internment camps.

Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national internment operations opened in September 2013.|$|E

As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified on his behalf during both trials, and was again testifying on his behalf as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.|$|E
5|$|History of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1648) {{covers a}} period {{in the history of}} Poland and Lithuania, before their joint state was {{subjected}} to devastating wars {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. The Union of Lublin of 1569 established the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, a more closely unified federal state, replacing the previously existing personal union of the two countries. The Union was largely run by the Polish and increasingly Polonized Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility, through the system of the central parliament and local assemblies, but from 1573 led by elected kings. The formal rule of the proportionally more numerous than in other European countries nobility <b>constituted</b> <b>a</b> sophisticated early democratic system, in contrast to the absolute monarchies prevalent at that time in the rest of Europe.|$|E
