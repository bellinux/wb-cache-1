This technique is unique as it has the capabilities to quantitatively determine the stresses and map these stresses with a micron resolution, all while the silicon cells are in encapsulation. A fundamental understanding of the stress magnitudes as well as microstructural characteristics that could lead to crack initiation and propagation could be obtained with this technique. This also confirms that the control of mechanical stress is the key to enable thin silicon solar cell technologies in the coming years...|$|E

In order to compare the environmental impacts of DCEP to the corresponding impacts from WCEP, a comparative attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted. From the LCA it can be concluded that the DCEP will lead to 86 % reduction in water consumption compared to WCEP (acidic), and 89 % reduction compared to WCEP (alkaline). The emissions of greenhouse gases, as expressed by the GWP 100 indicator of the etching step, are also reduced with 63 % and 20 % respectively, when compared with current SoA acidic and alkaline WCEP. The toxicity impacts are also assessed to be lower for the DCEP compared to WCEP technologies, although the uncertainty is relatively high for the applied toxicity indicators.

30|$|Silicon {{thin film}} solar cells are {{promising}} candidates {{for future generations}} of photovoltaic devices [1, 2]. They offer cost effectiveness {{and the possibility of}} deposition on flexible substrates [3 – 5]. However, the efficiency of thin film Si solar cell is relatively low compared to <b>crystalline</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell.</b> The low absorption rate, relative poor material quality and narrow absorption spectra are the major factors. In the past few years, there is an enormously growing interest in the development of nanostructure materials to improve the light-harvesting efficiency for achieving high-efficiency Si thin film solar cell while maintaining low cost. Feasible silicon nanostructures such as silicon nanowires [SiNWs] have gained much attention due to their unique properties and possible applications in the fields of nanoelectronics [6 – 9], nanooptoelectronics [9, 10], nanophotovolatics [11 – 17] and for sensor applications [18]. SiNWs are usually produced via vapour-liquid-solid [VLS] growth mechanism [19], which introduced one-dimensionality growing of nanostructure by a metal nanocatalyst droplet containing gases such as silane or grow from the gas phase by supplying Si vapour. However, the VLS growth mechanism generally requests high temperature that is not the adequate method for Si thin film nanostructure. In particular, the microcrystalline silicon [μc-Si] solar cells grown on glass or plastic substrate cannot sustain high temperature.|$|E

For this purpose Centrotherm developed the centaurus technology, {{which is based}} on a rear side dielectric passivation and local aluminium BSF (LBSF) in combination with a laser diffused selective front side emitter. A major aspect of the developed technology is its compatibility for an upgrade of existing Al-BSF cell production lines and for turnkey lines as well. Moreover, the equipment required for the new technology is merely based on familiar technologies like wet etching, PECVD layer deposition, laser processing and screen printing. This conformity with common technologies and the simplicity and sustainability of their production implementation as well as the exceptional high cell efficiencies in production favour the new centaurus technology. In production average cell efficiencies well over 19 % have been achieved and best cell efficiencies of 19. 6 % were reached. Under laboratory conditions average cell efficiencies of module ready centaurus solar cells with rear side Ag pads reached 19. 7 %, with best cell efficiencies up to 19. 9 %.

The abundant and non-toxic raw materials, the yearly increasing efficiency {{as well as the}} production cost of silicon thin-film solar cells getting lower and lower make this technology always more interesting for a wide spread use. Beside the functional features, the size, colour and glass texture of a PV module determine its appearance and aesthetics. In order to be more compliant with the built environment, photovoltaic installations have to be improved in terms of visual rendering, matching of colour of the existing roof-tops and parasitic reflections. The crystalline technology already offers various types of systems with a large choice of shapes, textures and colours as well as “semi-transparent ” modules more easily integrated in the roof-tops or facade. By changing the anti-reflective coating (ARC) of a <b>crystalline</b> <b>solar</b> <b>cell,</b> it is possible to modify their colour [1]. However, for thin-film silicon technology the challenge is completely different, and up to now, the only way to modify the module colour is to reduce the thickness of the active layer and consequently its efficiency. Therefore new ways to enhance the visual rendering of the thin-film modules have to be explored. A study led in the frame of the ArchinSolar project [2] has shown that architects are ready to integrate PV modules with enhanced aesthetic aspect, even though there was a 10 % loss in efficiency. The present study shows how new coloured filters can be used to enhance PV modules’ appearance while minimizing power loss, to achieve a better integration in the traditional urban or rural environment...|$|E

To evaluate the HW-CVD technology for thin film deposition in solar industry an in-line hot-wire CVD system was used to deposit a-Si:H films for passivation of crystalline silicon solar cells {{as well as for the}} fabrication of thin film silicon solar cells. The HW-CVD system consists of seven vacuum chambers including three hot-wire systems with maximum deposition areas of 500 mm by 600 mm for each hot-wire activation source. The deposition processes were investigated by applying design of experiment to identify the effects and interactions of the process parameters on the deposition characteristics and film properties. The process parameters investigated were silane flow, deposition pressure, substrate temperature, film thickness, as well as temperature, diameter and number of wires, respectively. Growth rates up to 2. 5 nm/s were achieved for a-Si:H films.
