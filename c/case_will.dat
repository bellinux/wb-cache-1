5|$|Another {{project is}} Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway project, {{which will be}} able to shorten the route via the Caspian Sea by {{bypassing}} Iran. The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter. The new route, in this <b>case,</b> <b>will</b> be China–Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey.|$|E
5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The <b>case</b> <b>will</b> involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|Indictment against Blythe {{was brought}} by State Attorney Vladimír Mužík. Mužík had tried {{a number of}} murderers, such as Luboš Mika (life in prison), Roman Fidler (life {{imprisonment}} at 1st instance, 25 years on appeal), Maria Zolotukinová (13 years imprisonment) and Petr Procházka (11 years imprisonment). He also tried a case against Andranik Soghojan, an alleged head of Russian mafia, requesting 25 {{years in prison for}} ordering a murder. The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court. Another of Mužík's murder cases which ended in acquittal due to insufficient evidence is that of Miroslav Rus, who was indicted in connection with disappearance of Miroslav Kříž, a vice-chairman of the Czech Football Association.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the first {{one of a series of}} reports {{establishing}} different use cases. Thus, this report is divided into a first section that outlines the methodology on how different use cases are established and a second part that describes some first initial use cases. All use <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> go through a consolidation process. Further use <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> emerge during the lifetime of the project and existing use <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be amplified by different methods...|$|R
30|$|Two <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be {{considered}} as follows.|$|R
30|$|Two <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be {{discussed}} in the following.|$|R
25|$|For {{the most}} serious crimes, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> not be {{directly}} prosecuted by the procurator fiscal. Instead, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be heard at the High Court of Justiciary and the prosecution will {{be made in the}} name of the Lord Advocate by an Advocate Depute.|$|E
25|$|Performing {{frequency}} {{analysis for the}} discrete-time <b>case</b> <b>will</b> provide some insight. The time-domain equation is the following.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the murder}} remains unsolved, {{investigators}} {{hope that the}} <b>case</b> <b>will</b> eventually come to a close. A press conference in 2013 {{is said to have}} uncovered more clues.|$|E
30|$|In this section, two <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be considered.|$|R
30|$|Next, two <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> be {{considered}} as follows.|$|R
30|$|The {{rest of the}} <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> follow similarly.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent rulings {{in respect}} of {{personal}} current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the Office of Fair Trading's ruling {{it seems unlikely that}} any further test <b>case</b> <b>will</b> take place.|$|E
25|$|For those {{accused of}} a felony, their case is sent to a court part where felony cases await {{the action of the}} grand jury. If the grand jury finds that there is enough {{evidence}} that the accused has committed a crime, it may file an indictment. If the accused waives their right to a grand jury, the prosecutor will file a Superior Court Information (SCI). If the grand jury votes an indictment, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be transferred from Criminal Court to the Supreme Court for another arraignment. This arraignment is similar to the arraignment in Criminal Court, and if the accused does not submit a guilty plea, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be adjourned to a calendar part.|$|E

50|$|This type of HH {{is present}} from birth and is lifelong. Approximately two-thirds of classic CHH <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> {{have a low}} level of pulsatile GnRH release from the hypothalamus, which will give rise to partial puberty while the other third of <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> have zero GnRH release and no puberty.|$|R

25|$|Only the Federal Government {{having to}} pay out money and having to defend a court <b>case</b> <b>will</b> bring home to the Federal Immigration Minister, and the Prime Minister, that rights and {{principles}} are there to be observed. Criticism of this government over its immigration policy is simply waived away; only {{when they have to}} pay money will they sit up and take notice.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the case}} is sized down, {{the inside of the}} neck of the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> {{actually}} be slightly smaller than the bullet diameter. To allow the bullet to be seated, the end of the neck is slightly expanded to allow the bullet to start into the case. Boattailed bullets need very little expansion, while unjacketed lead bullets require more expansion to prevent shaving of lead when the bullet is seated.|$|E
25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. How much a <b>case</b> <b>will</b> stretch {{depends upon}} load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a trim size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|E
30|$|Data {{from the}} {{reported}} <b>cases</b> <b>will</b> {{be made available}} on request.|$|R

25|$|If {{the case}} is not settled {{following}} issuance of a complaint, then the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> proceed to hearing before an Administrative Law Judge of the NLRB. The Regional Director {{has the power to}} issue subpoenas for use by any party prior to the hearing; the Administrative Law Judge has that power once the hearing commences. The hearing is governed by the same rules of evidence that would apply in a federal court trial.|$|E
25|$|On 17 February 2015, lawyers {{representing}} the Government and the LGBT rights group MOVILH met to discuss an amicable {{solution to the}} same-sex marriage lawsuit before the Inter-American Commission Of Human Rights. The Government announced that they would drop their opposition to same-sex marriage. A formal agreement will be signed in April and the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> still continue according to MOVILH's lawyer who stated that the lawsuit will live on until Chile enacts the law.|$|E
25|$|ESTIMATED COST SYSTEMS : In {{order to}} assist those who, {{instead of using}} an actual cost system, {{estimate}} their costs and keep their general accounts in the books {{in such a way}} as to make it difficult to form any opinion as to the accuracy of these estimates at the end of the year or at any other time, several methods calculated to aid in such <b>case</b> <b>will</b> be found in the chapters on this subject...|$|E

25|$|If the Court of Appeals enforces the Board's order {{then the}} <b>case</b> <b>will</b> {{return to the}} Region for it to monitor the respondent's compliance. In those {{cases in which the}} Board's order {{requires}} payment of backpay, the Region will commence compliance proceedings if it is not able to resolve all disputes over the amount of backpay. These compliance proceedings are also held before an Administrative Law Judge, based on the compliance specification filed by the Region. The same procedural rights apply in these proceedings as in the earlier proceedings on the merits of the charge.|$|E
25|$|When McNulty {{finds that}} most dead {{homeless}} men {{are concentrated in}} the Southern District, Freamon puts him in touch with an old patrol partner there who agrees to tip them off when new bodies are found. Freamon also devises a plan to show maturation in their serial killer's pattern and acquires dentures to create bite marks on the victims, thus enhancing the media appeal for the story. While canvassing an area frequented by local homeless, McNulty complains that Landsman barely noticed {{his work on the}} case, but Freamon reminds him that if their plan works, the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> attract more interest and sloppiness could be their downfall. Upon returning home, McNulty is confronted by Russell over his drinking and philandering.|$|E
25|$|Historically, barristers {{have had}} {{a major role in}} trial preparation, {{including}} drafting pleadings and reviewing evidence. In some areas of law, that is still the case. In other areas, it is relatively common for the barrister to receive the brief from the instructing solicitor to represent a client at trial only a day or two before the proceeding. Part of {{the reason for this is}} cost. A barrister is entitled to a 'brief fee' when a brief is delivered, and this represents the bulk of her/his fee in relation to any trial. They are then usually entitled to a 'refresher' for each day of the trial after the first. But if a case is settled before the trial, the barrister is not needed and the brief fee would be wasted. Some solicitors avoid this by delaying delivery of the brief until it is certain the <b>case</b> <b>will</b> go to trial.|$|E
