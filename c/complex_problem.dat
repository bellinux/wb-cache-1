Recursive is {{a method}} that divides the <b>complex</b> <b>{{problems}}</b> into simple problems and finally solves the <b>complex</b> <b>problems.</b> The process of recursive problem needs to use the information that stores in the stack memory. The cost of stack is large and {{the execution of the}} stack is less efficient. Therefore, when solving some <b>complex</b> <b>problems,</b> generally the recursive is used for analysis and the non-recursive is used for practice. Using non-recursive method to realize recursive problems, not only can save the storage space, but also can greatly improve the efficiency of algorithm execution...|$|R

25|$|Child labour in India is a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> that {{is rooted}} in poverty. Since the 1990s, the {{government}} has implemented a variety of programs to eliminate child labour. These have included setting up schools, launching free school lunch programs, creating special investigation cells, etc. Author Sonalde Desai stated that recent studies on child labour in India have found some pockets of industries in which children are employed, but overall, relatively few Indian children are employed. Child labour below the age of 10 is now rare. In the 10–14 age group, the latest surveys find only 2% of children working for wage, while another 9% work within their home or rural farms assisting their parents in times of high work demand such as sowing and harvesting of crops.|$|E

500|$|Pixar {{then set}} up a Simulation {{department}} and created a new fur simulation program called Fizt (short for [...] "physics tool"). After a shot with Sulley in it had been animated, this department took the data for that shot and added Sulley's fur. Fizt allowed the fur to react in a more natural way. Every time when Sulley would have to move, his fur would (automatically) react to his movements, thus taking the effects of wind and gravity into account as well. The Fizt program also controlled the movement of Boo's clothes, which provided another [...] "breakthrough". The deceptively simple-sounding task of animating cloth was also a challenge to animate thanks to those hundreds of creases and wrinkles that automatically occurred in the clothing when the wearer moved. Also, this meant {{they would have to}} solve the <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> of how to keep cloth untangled — in other words, to keep it from passing through itself when parts of it intersect. Fizt applied the same system to Boo's clothes as to Sulley's fur. First of all, Boo would be animated shirtless; the Simulation department then used Fizt to apply the shirt over Boo's body, and every time she [...] would move, her clothes also would react to her movements in a more natural manner.|$|E

2500|$|McNamara's {{institution}} of systems analysis {{as a basis}} for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: [...] "First, the word 'systems' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word 'analysis' emphasizes the need to reduce a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it." [...] Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. It was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.|$|E

[...] However, the study indicated that, while boys and girls performed similarly on average, boys were over-represented among the very best performers as well as among the very worst. A 2011 meta-analysis with 242 studies from 1990 to 2007 involving 1,286,350 people found no overall sex difference of performance in mathematics.

2500|$|In 1912 Émile Durkheim {{identified}} {{society as}} the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in [...] "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life" [...] that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time. Other antecedents are Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of [...] "noosphere" [...] and H.G. Wells's concept of [...] "world brain" [...] (see also the term [...] "global brain"). Peter Russell, Elisabet Sahtouris, and Barbara Marx Hubbard (originator of the term [...] "conscious evolution") are inspired by the visions of a noosphere– a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence– an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher Pierre Lévy. In a 1962 research report, Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: [...] "Three people working together in this augmented mode [...] {{seem to be more}} than three times as effective in solving a <b>complex</b> <b>problem</b> as is one augmented person working alone". In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society.|$|E
