5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the wheelhouse}} complex has been dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries. Construction used the stones of the broch itself {{and two of the}} four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays. One structure was built as a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built into the earth, the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.|$|E

25|$|At Praeneste (modern Palestrina) near Rome, a huge pilgrimage {{complex of}} the 1st century BC led {{visitors}} up several levels with large buildings {{on a steep}} hillside, before they eventually reached the sanctuary itself, a much smaller <b>circular</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eurydice’s portrait-statue, {{together}} {{with those of}} her most celebrated son Philip II, Philip II's wife, Olympias, her grandson, Alexander the Great, and her husband, Amyntas III, were realized by the Athenian statuary and sculptor Leochares in ivory and gold. They {{were placed in the}} Philippeion, a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> in the Altis at Olympia, erected by Philip II of Macedon in celebration of his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC).|$|E
25|$|The {{planning}} and construction phase {{of what was}} known then as Aéroport de Paris Nord (Paris North Airport) began in 1966. On 8 March 1974 the airport, renamed Charles de Gaulle Airport, opened. Terminal 1 was built in an avant-garde design of a ten-floors-high <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> surrounded by seven satellite buildings, each with six gates allowing sunlight to enter through apertures. The main architect was Paul Andreu, who was also {{in charge of the}} extensions during the following decades.|$|E
50|$|After Liberation, Scandinavian architects, {{tired of}} square {{buildings}} but cognizant that <b>circular</b> <b>buildings</b> were impractical, asked Piet Hein for a solution.

25|$|It was {{originally}} built in 1847 by the London and North Western Railway as a roundhouse, a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> containing a railway turntable, but was only {{used for this}} purpose for about a decade. After being used as a warehouse for a number of years, the building fell into disuse just before the Second World War. It reopened twenty-five years later, in 1964, as a performing arts venue, when the playwright Arnold Wesker established the Centre 42 Theatre Company and adapted the building as a theatre.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the high quality of his steam engines, sales {{increased}} a great deal and it became apparent that a new engine assembly shop was required. Murray designed this himself, and produced a huge three-storeyed <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> known as the Round Foundry. This contained a centrally mounted steam engine to power all of the machines in the building. Murray also built a house for himself adjoining the works. The design of this was pioneering, as each room was heated by steam pipes, so that it became known locally as Steam Hall.|$|E
25|$|The WFIL radio {{stations}} originally broadcast from the Widener Building in downtown Philadelphia. With the anticipated arrival of WFIL-TV, Triangle secured {{a new facility}} for the stations, located at Market and 46th streets, which opened in 1947. In 1963, Triangle built {{one of the most}} advanced broadcast centers in the nation on City (or City Line) Avenue in the Wynnefield Heights community, in a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> across from rival WCAU-TV (channel 10). The station still broadcasts from the facility today, even as a new digital media building was constructed that now houses production of the station's newscasts and other local programs, while the original studio was turned over to public broadcaster WHYY-FM-TV.|$|E

25|$|An ornate {{carousel}} {{displaying a}} bestiary {{is housed in}} a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> near the children's playground. The carousel was built in 1914 by the Herschell-Spillman Company. The building was occupied by three previous carousels before the current attraction was purchased by Herbert Fleishhacker from the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1941. The 1914 carousel has undergone several major renovations, the first, a transition from steam to electric power {{with the assistance of}} the PG Company. In 1977 the carousel closed for safety concerns and The San Francisco Arts Commission hired local artist Ruby Newman to oversee the artistic restoration. Her crew of craftspeople restored the badly deteriorated carousel and she hand painted all animals, chariots, and decorative housing (she holds the copyright). The carousel was re-opened in 1984. Presently, the carousel includes sixty two animals, a German Band Organ, and painted landscapes of the bay area by Ruby Newman. Two of the animals, a goat and an outside stander horse, are by the Dentzel Wooden Carousel Company.|$|E
25|$|Oversight of the {{construction}} has been credited by various sources to either master masons John Box or Henry Yevele, or to William of Wykeham. The work required some 1,600 craftsmen and labourers, and was completed by about 1367 {{at a cost of}} some £20,000. The castle was built to a radical concentric design, the first of its type to be built in England. It consisted of a large <b>circular</b> <b>building,</b> described as a rotunda or shell keep, buttressed by six projecting towers and having a central circular courtyard. This main building was surrounded by an outer circular curtain wall and a moat. It is possible that the design was influenced by that of Bellver Castle, which had been built in Majorca between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Majorca. Queenborough {{was one of the first}} English castles built to withstand siege artillery and to mount guns itself, and the last royal castle to be built in England during the Late Middle Ages. Originally, water was channelled from the roofs through lead piping into storage cisterns, but in 1393 a contractor spent sixty weeks digging a deep well in the centre of the courtyard.|$|E

500|$|On a hill {{above the}} gorge is a sham castle in Gothic Revival style {{overlooking}} Bristol, Avonmouth and the Avon Gorge, with views across to South Wales {{on a clear}} day. It was built in 1766, by Robert Mylne, {{on the site of}} a chapel dedicated to Saint Blaise. The folly is reputed to have cost £3,000. The <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> [...] is built of local ashlar stone with limestone dressings. It has three turrets with crenallated parapets.|$|E
500|$|Cow Tower is {{a three-story}} <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> with a {{protruding}} turret, {{the main building}} being [...] across and [...] tall, tapering towards the top. Its walls, [...] thick at the base, are made of a core of flint stone, faced {{on the inside and}} outside with brick, and various putlog holes can still be seen in the walls. The turret, which contained a spiral staircase, would originally have been higher than the parapets, forming a look-out position. The walls rest on a stone plinth and several layers of mortared flint.|$|E
500|$|The {{competition}} {{to design the}} Cathedral was held in 1959. [...] The requirement was first, for a congregation of 3,000 (which was later reduced to 2,000) {{to be able to}} see the altar, in order that they could be more involved in the celebration of the Mass, and second, for the Lutyens crypt to be incorporated in the structure. [...] Gibberd achieved these requirements by designing a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> with the altar at its centre, and by transforming the roof of the crypt into an elevated platform, with the cathedral standing at one end. The construction contract was let to Taylor Woodrow.|$|E
2500|$|Although no Halaf {{settlement}} {{has been}} extensively excavated some buildings have been excavated: the tholoi of Tell Arpachiyah, circular domed structures approached through long rectangular anterooms.

They were constructed of mud-brick sometimes on stone foundations and may have been for ritual use (one contained a large number of female figurines). Other <b>circular</b> <b>buildings</b> were probably just houses.|$|R

500|$|For Arnos Grove station, one {{of eight}} new {{stations}} on the northern extension of the line, Holden modified the rectangular box into a circular drum, a design inspired by Gunnar Asplund's Stockholm Public Library. Also notable on the northern extension is Southgate station; here Holden designed a single-storey <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> with a canopied flat roof. Above this, the central section of roof rises up on a continuous horizontal band of clerestory windows, supported internally by a single central column. The building is topped by an illuminated feature capped with a bronze ball. Other stations show the influence of Willem Marinus Dudok's work in Hilversum, Netherlands. In order to handle such a large volume of work, Holden delegated significant design responsibility to his assistants, such as Charles Hutton, who took the lead on Arnos Grove Station. For some other Piccadilly line stations the design was handled in-house by Stanley Heaps or by other architectural practices. All followed the modern brick, glass and concrete house style defined by Holden, but some lacked Holden's originality and attention to detail; Pick dubbed these [...] "Holdenesque".|$|E
500|$|Maiden Castle {{had been}} {{abandoned}} {{by the end of}} the 1st century, a time when Durnovaria (Dorchester) rose to prominence as the civitas, or regional capital, of the Durotriges, a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England. However, in July 2015 archaeologists from Bournemouth University discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of Duropolis and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site. According to the ancient geographer Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd centuryAD, Dunium was the main settlement of the Durotriges. Although Dunium has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle, Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for Dunium. Dunium may have derived from British duno- which meant [...] "a fort". Sometime after 367, a Romano-Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort. The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple. A central room, measuring [...] square, was surrounded by a [...] passageway, similar to many Romano-Celtic temples found in the south of England. Nearby were two other buildings: a rectangular building [...] with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest, and a <b>circular</b> <b>building</b> that may have been a shrine. At the same time as the temple was built, the fort's eastern gateway was refurbished; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway.|$|E

50|$|Only {{isolated}} sanctuaries are known. Among {{them are}} the many burnt offering places found near the necropolis of the chalcolithic Afanasevo culture in south Siberia. They consisted of simple stone circles containing ashes, pottery, animal bones and tools made of copper, stone and bone. The many <b>circular</b> <b>buildings</b> containing wooden stakes and walls, in the necropoleis near the early Bronze Age settlement of Sintashta, are probably cult buildings.|$|R
