25|$|The Timberwolf {{action is}} a {{manually}} operated stainless steel bolt action with a right-hand side bolt and ejection port. The bolt is a rotary bolt with dual front locking lugs plus one locking lug at the rear. It requires a 90-degree bolt rotation. the bolt is partly helically fluted which reduces weight and stops bolt debris jams. A double plunger ejector and hook type extractor are used to remove fired cartridge cases. This helps create a very smooth action which is very reliable. The extra locking lug at the rear assists in preventing the bolt from becoming jammed when <b>chambering</b> another round.|$|E
25|$|Each trigger {{mechanism}} {{has its own}} merits. Historically, the first type of trigger was the single-action. This is the simplest mechanism and generally the shortest, lightest, and smoothest pull available. The pull is also consistent from shot to shot so no adjustments in technique are needed for proper accuracy. On a single-action revolver, for which the hammer must be manually cocked prior to firing, an added level of safety is present. On a semi-automatic, the hammer will be cocked and made ready to fire {{by the process of}} <b>chambering</b> a round, and as a result an external safety is sometimes employed.|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17P, 22P, and Glock 17R are all {{training}} pistols for practicing hand-to-hand combat, {{loading and}} unloading of the pistol. These Glocks are identical to a standard Glock 17/22 except for their red frame; some models have an inert barrel (without a chamber, thus preventing the accidental <b>chambering</b> of a live cartridge) and no firing pin hole in the breech face (preventing someone from using a live barrel with the training slide). The difference between models is that to perform a 'reset' of the trigger, a cycling of the slide has to be performed on the 17P/22P, {{but not on the}} 17R.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. <b>Chambering</b> should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why <b>chambering</b> is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
25|$|Hand loading or {{reloading}} {{is allowed}} in South Africa {{as long as}} you are in possession of a competency certificate to possess a firearm as well as a license to possess such a firearm. Sport shooters load to make the shooting sports more affordable and hunters load to obtain greater accuracy. Powder and primers are strictly controlled by law and can not exceed for 2kg for powder and 2400 primers. The amount of ammunition you may have in your possession is also limited to 200 rounds per <b>chambering.</b> If you are a registered dedicated sportsman, the quantities are unlimited. Although the powder's quantity is unlimited if you are a dedicated sportsman, storage of excess amounts of powder is dangerous due to the potential of fire occurring from accidental ignition. A manual from a South African powder manufacturer Rheinmetall Denel Munition (previously Somchem) is available for reloaders with adequate information and guidelines.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated {{it sounded as}} if one shot had been fired. “One witness said it looked as if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. <b>Chambering</b> his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E

25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of <b>chambering</b> the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E
