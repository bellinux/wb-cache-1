Foi avaliado o efeito do tempo de estocagem de amostras de carne de 14 tartarugas (7 fêmeas e 7 machos) nos dias 01, 30, 60 e 120, estocadas a - 10 ºC, nos valores de pH e de Bases Voláteis Totais (BVT), cor, textura, odor e prova de cocção. Observou-se diferença significativa entre os valores de pH em relação ao tempo de estocagem nos dias 01 (5, 81 e 5, 81), 30 (6, 04 e 6, 05), 60 (6, 22 e 6, 23) e 120 (6, 30 e 6, 30), respectivamente para a carne das fêmeas e machos. Entre os sexos não houve diferença significativa. Quanto a BVT o tempo de estocagem influenciou significativamente entre os dias 01 (11, 34 e 11, 74 g/ 100 g), 30 (<b>13,</b> <b>92</b> e <b>13,</b> 90 g/ 100 g) e 120 (17, 62 e 17, 82 g/ 100 g); entre os dias 30 (<b>13,</b> <b>92</b> e <b>13,</b> 90 g/ 100 g) e 60 (14, 02 e 14, 06 g/ 100 g) não observou-se diferença significativa, respectivamente para a carne de fêmeas e machos. Entre os sexos não ocorreu diferenças significativas. A cor, textura, odor e a prova de cocção não apresentaram alteração ao longo do tempo de estocagem. A carne de tartaruga obteve media de aceitabilidade global de 7, 04. De acordo com os resultados obtidos concluímos que, pelas provas de pH e BVT, a carne de tartaruga pode ter uma validade comercial de 120 dias, quando embaladas a vácuo e estocadas a - 10 ºC, e que a os provadores gostaram muito desse tipo de carne. This {{research was}} developed in partnership with CENAQUA and Pró-Fauna {{with the objective of}} studying commercial validity and acceptance of the meat of Amazon-turtle that was bred in captivity. The effect of the storage period was evaluated on meat samples of fourteen turtles (7 female and 7 male) stored in a period of 1, 30, 60, and 120 days at a temperature of - 100 Celsius, concerning to values of pH, total volatile bases, color, scent, and cooking test. Significant difference was observed in relation to pH values and the period of storage as follow: in the period of 1 (5. 81 and 5. 81), 30 (6. 04 and 6. 05), 60 (6. 22 and 6. 23), and 120 (6. 30 and 6. 30) days, respectively either for the meat of female turtle or male. There was not significant difference concerning to sex. As for total volatile bases (TVB), the period of storage has influenced significantly: in the period of 1 (11. 34 and 11. 74 g/ 100 g), 30 (<b>13.</b> <b>92</b> and <b>13.</b> 90 g/ 100 g), and 120 (17. 62 and 17. 82 g/ 100 g); in the period of 30 (<b>13.</b> <b>92</b> and <b>13.</b> 90 g/ 100 g) and 60 (14. 02 and 14. 06 g/ 100 g) days, significant difference was not observed, respectively for female and male meat. Not significant difference occurred in relation to sex. The result for color, texture, scent, and cooking test did not present any alteration along the period of storage. The meat of turtle obtained a 7. 04 average of general acceptability that shows the acceptance of the tasters for this sort of meat.

However, research has provided inconsistent results on this matter. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the "Playstation generation" shows superior baseline psychomotor skills for endoscopic surgery on a virtual reality simulator. The 46 study participants were interns (mean age 24 years) of the department of surgery and schoolchildren (mean age 12. 5 years) of the first year of a secondary school. Participants were divided into four groups: 10 interns with videogame experience and 10 without, 13 schoolchildren with videogame experience and 13 without. They performed four tasks twice on a virtual reality simulator for basic endoscopic skills. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc test Tukey-Bonferroni and the independent Student's t test were used to determine differences in mean scores. Interns with videogame experience scored significantly higher on total score (93 vs. 74. 5; p= 0. 014) compared with interns without this experience. There was a nonsignificant difference in mean total scores between the group of schoolchildren with and those without videogame experience (61. 69 vs. 55. 46; p= 0. 411). The same accounts for interns with regard to mean scores on efficiency (50. 7 vs. 38. 9; p= 0. 011) and speed (18. 8 vs. 14. 3; p= 0. 023). In the group of schoolchildren, there was no statistical difference for efficiency (32. 69 vs. 27. 31; p= 0. 218) or speed (<b>13.</b> <b>92</b> vs. <b>13.</b> 15; p= 0. 54).

PATIENTS AND METHODSPatients were randomized to receive classical CHOP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/ m 2, doxorubicin 50 mg/m 2, vincristine 1. 4 mg/m 2 [maximum 2 mg] on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/day for 5 days) or CHOP plus amifostine (6 cycles of amifostine 910 mg/m 2 on day 1). Efficacy (time to progression, TTP; disease-free survival, DFS; overall survival, OS) and toxicity endpoints were evaluated. RESULTSThirty-four patients were randomized to A-CHOP (n= 18) or CHOP (n= 16). Patients with A-CHOP vs CHOP had significantly lower toxicity; neutropenia grade 4 ocurred in <b>13</b> / <b>92</b> (<b>13</b> %) vs 23 / 85 (27 %, P= 0. 007) cycles, febrile neutropenia in 3 / 92 A-CHOP (3 %) vs 8 / 85 (10 %, P=. 056) CHOP cycles, hospitalization for toxicity in 4 / 92 (4 %) A-CHOP vs 11 / 85 (13 %, P=. 05) CHOP cycles. Median hospitalization stay for toxicity was 5 days with A-CHOP vs 8 days with CHOP (P=. 05). There were no significant differences at 8 years in TTP (A-CHOP, 48. 9 % vs CHOP, 36. 3 %; P=. 65), DFS (A-CHOP, 72. 9 % vs CHOP 55. 6 %; P=. 50) and OS (A-CHOP, 44. 3 % vs CHOP, 54. 4 %). There was no long-term toxicity of clinical interest. The only prognostic factor identified to 8 years was the International Prognostic Index (IPI low/low intermediate risk vs high intermediate/high risk; HR= 2. 98; CI 95 %: 1. 01 - 8. 77; P=. 048).

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} the visual outcome following cataract surgery with pupillary sphincterotomy in eyes with coexisting corneal opacity. Methods Patients with leucomatous corneal opacity with significant cataract were enrolled for the study. The uncorrected visual acuity and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were recorded and the anterior segment was thoroughly evaluated by a slit lamp biomicroscope before the surgery. Only {{those patients who}} had some amount of clear peripheral cornea were selected. Posterior segment pathology was ruled out by indirect ophthalmoscopy after pupillary dilatation, if possible, or by B-scan ultrasonography. Conventional extracapsular cataract extraction with pupillary sphincterotomy was performed and an intraocular lens was implanted. Postoperatively, the eyes were evaluated on day 1, and 1 week and 6 weeks following surgery for similar parameters. Results Fourteen eyes of 14 patients {{were included in the}} study, of which <b>13</b> (<b>92.</b> 85 %) patients were male. The mean age of the patients was 47. 85 ± 7. 37 years. All the eyes had a dense central leucomatous corneal opacity. Twelve (85. 71 %) eyes had two or more quadrants of deep vascularisation. Sphincterotomy was performed mostly (71. 42 %) in the nasal or inferonasal quadrant. The intraocular lens was implanted in <b>13</b> (<b>92.</b> 85 %) eyes, and one (7. 1 %) eye was left aphakic due to the occurrence of a large posterior capsular tear. Preoperatively, all eyes had BCVA Conclusions Extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation with pupillary sphincterotomy provides ambulatory and useful vision to patients of cataract with coexisting central leucomatous corneal opacity. </p...|$|R
