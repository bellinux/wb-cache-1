5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it <b>can</b> <b>or</b> could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people <b>can</b> <b>or</b> cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near entrances to buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this would be beneficial to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition <b>can</b> <b>or</b> cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E

25|$|When a {{group member}} {{does not feel}} that his/her effort is {{justified}} {{in the context of}} the overall group, the individual will be less willing to assert the effort. If the group size is large, members can feel that their contribution will not be worth much to the overall cause because so many other contributions <b>can</b> <b>or</b> should occur. This leads people to not contribute as much or at all in large groups as they might have in smaller groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{inscription}} on the short-cross penny was still HENRICUS REX, while the long-cross pennies were variously inscribed HENRICUS REX TERCI, HENRICUS REX III (King Henry the Third), while one issue unpopularly omitted the moneyer's name, instead having HENRICUS REX on the obverse and ANGLIE TERCI on the reverse, while another issue had HENRICUS REX ANG on the obverse {{and continued on}} the reverse with LIE TERCI LON (or <b>CAN</b> <b>or</b> AED) indicating it was minted in London or Canterbury or Bury St Edmunds.|$|E
25|$|Warhol {{produced}} both comic {{and serious}} works; his subject {{could be a}} soup <b>can</b> <b>or</b> an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series. The Death and Disaster paintings included Red Car Crash, Purple Jumping Man, and Orange Disaster. One of these paintings, the diptych Silver Car Crash, became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.|$|E

25|$|The Scottish Government {{states that}} it is taking a cautious, {{considered}} and evidenced-based approach to fracking. In January 2015 the Scottish Government placed a moratorium on granting consents for unconventional oil and gas extraction. This will allow health and environmental impact tests {{to be carried out}} as well as a full public consultation to allow every interested organisation and any member of the public to input their views. The Scottish Government has stated that no fracking <b>can</b> <b>or</b> will take place in Scotland while the moratorium remains in place.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{conventional}} International Date Line {{is a relatively}} recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved {{from time to time}} depending on the needs of different interested parties. There are no objective criteria for its placement. In that light, it cannot be taken for granted that {{the conventional}} International Date Line <b>can</b> (<b>or</b> should) be used as a date line under Jewish law. In practice, within Judaism the halakhic date line is similar to, but not necessarily identical with, the conventional Date Line, and the differences can have consequences under religious law.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Clayton Christensen (1997) {{took the}} {{position}} that great companies can fail precisely because they do everything right since {{the capabilities of the}} organization also define its disabilities. Christensen's thesis is that outstanding companies lose their market leadership when confronted with disruptive technology. He called the approach to discovering the emerging markets for disruptive technologies agnostic marketing, i.e., marketing under the implicit assumption that no one – not the company, not the customers – can know how or in what quantities a disruptive product <b>can</b> <b>or</b> will be used without the experience of using it.|$|E
5000|$|A 1997 study {{performed}} by the University of Illinois, 2007 study {{performed by}} University of California - Davis and a 2003 Austrian study support that <b>canned</b> <b>or</b> frozen produce has no substantial nutritional difference not attributable {{to the presence of}} added salt, syrup or other flavouring, and in fact suggest that <b>canned</b> <b>or</b> frozen produce is nutritionally superior because of the very rapid deterioration of nutrients in fresh produce.|$|R

25|$|Part-way {{through the}} game, Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun, which {{allows him to}} draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, {{as well as the}} ability to {{manipulate}} larger and heavier objects that he cannot control without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and {{can also be used to}} great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense, such as a file cabinet, or a deadly projectile, such as a gasoline <b>can</b> <b>or</b> buzzsaw blade.|$|E
25|$|Looking for {{mutations}} in the ATM gene of an unrelated person (for example, the spouse of a known A-T carrier) presents significant challenges. Genes often have variant spellings (polymorphisms) {{which do not}} affect function. In a gene as large as ATM, such variant spellings are likely to occur and doctors cannot always predict whether a specific variant will or will not cause disease. Genetic counseling can help family members of an A-T patient understand what <b>can</b> <b>or</b> cannot be tested, and how the test results should be interpreted.|$|E
25|$|Closely related {{fields in}} {{theoretical}} computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity {{theory is that}} the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms {{that could be used to}} solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that <b>can</b> <b>or</b> cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.|$|E

25|$|The Arctic Star, the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal and the Queen's Medal for Champion Shots in the Military Forces <b>can,</b> <b>or</b> could be, {{awarded to}} South Africans after 6 April 1952. Should the 1954 South African ruling {{on the order}} of wear of British awards be {{strictly}} applied, the position of the Arctic Star in the South African order of wear would therefore be different from the order of wear prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood, with the result that the Arctic Star would take precedence after the Chief C.D.F. Commendation Medal of the Republic of Ciskei and before the Korea Medal of the Union of South Africa.|$|E
25|$|Related to the ‘sustainable intensification’ of agriculture, an {{objective}} which in part is discussed controversially, efficiency of resource use becomes increasingly important today. Environmental impacts of agricultural production {{depend on the}} efficiency achieved when using natural resources and all other means of production. The input per kg of output, the output per kg of input, and the output achieved per hectare of land – a limited resource {{in the light of}} world population growth – are decisive figures for evaluating the efficiency and the environmental impact of agricultural systems. Efficiency parameters therefore offer important evidence how efficiency and environmental impacts of agriculture can be judged and where improvements <b>can</b> <b>or</b> must be made.|$|E
25|$|Traditional images {{show the}} Trung sisters wearing yellow turbans during their revolt against China in AD 40. These were {{unwrapped}} {{and waved to}} signal {{the beginning of a}} fight. A yellow banner with a red circle in the center was adopted as a standard by Emperor Gia Long (r. 1802–1820). The flag of South Vietnam was originally designed by Emperor Thành Thái in 1890, and was revived by Lê Văn Đệ and re-adopted by Emperor Bảo Đại in 1948. The three stripes represented the Quẻ <b>Càn,</b> <b>or</b> Qian trigram, one of eight trigrams used in the I-Ching, a Taoist scripture. Quẻ Càn is the divination sign for heaven. Later, the stripes were reinterpreted to represent the northern, central and southern regions of Vietnam.|$|E
