40|$|A key {{parameter}} used in wetland hydrological and landform development {{models is}} hydraulic conductivity. Head recovery tests {{are often used}} to measure hydraulic conductivity but the calculation techniques are usually confined to rigid soil theory. This is despite reports demonstrating the misapplication of rigid soil theory to non-rigid soils such as peats. While values of hydraulic conductivity calculated using compressible techniques have been presented for fenland peats these data have never, to the authors’ knowledge, been compared to such calculations in other peat types. Head recovery tests (slug withdrawal) were performed on piezometers at depths ranging from 10 cm to 80 cm from the surface on north Pennine blanket peats. Results were obtained using both rigid and <b>compressible</b> <b>soil</b> theories allowing comparison of the two techniques. <b>Compressible</b> <b>soil</b> theory gives values for hydraulic conductivity that are typically a factor of five times less than rigid soil calculations. Hydraulic conductivity is often assumed to decrease with depth in upland peats but at the study site in the northern Pennines it was not found to vary significantly with depth {{within the range of}} peat depths sampled. The variance within depth categories was not significantly different to the variance between depth categories showing that individual peat layers did not have characteristic hydraulic conductivity values. Thus large lateral and vertical differences in hydraulic conductivity over short distances creates problems for modelling but may help account for the high frequency of preferential flow pathways within what is otherwise a low matrix hydraulic conductivity peat. Hydraulic conductivity was found to vary significantly between sampling sites demonstrating that hillslope or catchment-scale variability may be more important than plot-scale variability. Values for compressibility of the peats are also reported. These generally decline with depth and also vary significantly between sampling sites. There are implications for the way in which measurements of hydraulic conductivity and other properties of blanket peat are interpreted as the effects of environmental change in one part of a peat catchment may be very different to those in another...|$|E

40|$|In Rotterdam {{underneath}} the first load bearing sand layer is {{a layer of}} <b>compressible</b> <b>soil,</b> called the "Kedichem" layer. Under this layer of compresible soil is another load bearing sand layer located, at approximately - 50 m NAP, {{but most of the}} buildings in Rotterdam are foundated on the first loadbearing sand layer at approximately - 23 m NAP. Due to this most buildings undergo differential settlements caused by deformations in the Kedichem layer. This differential settlements causes an increase of internal forces in the structure. Highrise buildings are causing higher deformations in the Kedichem layer because a highrise building has a large weight on a relative small area. This thesis is a research of the behaviour of a highrise building on <b>compressible</b> <b>soil.</b> The main research question is: Can a structure be modified to reduce the differential settlements. As a case study the Cooltower will be used. The height of the building is 102 m, and the floorplan is 29 x 29 m. The structure of the building is modeled in the structural software Scia Egineer. The differential settlements caused by the deformations in the Kedichem layer are introduced in the structural model by forces on a stiff spring element. The deformations in the Kedichem layer are calculated by using a soil settlement program, called D-settlement. Due to the deformations in the Kedichem layer the force flow in the structure will change. The force flow describes how the forces in the structure are distributed to the foundation. To calculate the final force flow it is needed to perform some iterations between the soil settlement software and the structural computer program To answer the research question there are 2 D calculations made to investigate the influence of the connections between the precast elements on the differential settlements. Also the influence of the openings in the structure on the differential settlements is investigated in this part. After this step there are 3 D calculations made of the Cooltower. In this part the interaction between core and facade is studied. In this part it is tried to reduce the differential settlements in the facade by adjusting the stiffness of the facade, and it is investigated in which way the differential settlements between the core and the facade can be reduced. The main conclusion of this thesis is {{that it is difficult to}} create a general conclusion for the differential settlements due to the many factors that influence the differential settlements in the structure. Most of the researched topics in this thesis don't influence the differential settlements that much. The stiffness of the facade influences the behavior of the Cooltower on <b>compressible</b> <b>soil</b> the most. By making the facade twice as stiff, the differential settlements will be reduced by 37 % on average. The conclusion is only valid for the Cooltower. For the Cooltower the extra normal forces in the columns of the facade due to the differential settlement can be estimated to be 15 % of the forces in the structure due to the permanent and the variable load. In preliminary design phase the structure can be designed with a unity check of 0, 85. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|E
