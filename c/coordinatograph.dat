50|$|One {{historic}} {{application of}} a <b>coordinatograph</b> was a machine that precisely placed and cut rubylith to create photomasks for early integrated circuits {{including some of the}} earliest generations of the modern PC microprocessor. The <b>coordinatograph</b> produced layout would then be photographically reduced 100:1 to create the production photomask.|$|E

50|$|Rubylith {{was used}} {{in the early days of}} {{semiconductors}} and integrated circuits. The physical layouts of the first generations of Intel microprocessors (the Intel 4004 and the Intel 8008 (nee 1201)) were first hand drawn on graph paper. A technician would then use a <b>coordinatograph</b> to precisely cut the rubylith and a knife to peel the appropriate sections away. The finished Rubylith mechanical masters were then photo reduced up to 100 times and then step and repeated on to glass plates for production use. Shortly after the 8008, Intel started using Calma's computer-aided design system that ran on a Data General minicomputer; the output masters may have stayed rubylith for a time, but other output options became available. Bell Telephone Laboratories, for example, had a high-resolution photoplotter. The integrated circuit industry left rubylith for better technologies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplified procedure for determining water current velocities and diffusion coefficients. Dye drops which form dye patches in the receiving water {{are made from}} an aircraft. The changes in position {{and size of the}} patches are recorded from two flights over the area. The data processing procedure requires that the ground coordinates about the dye patches be determined at the time of each flight. With an automatic recording <b>coordinatograph</b> for measuring coordinates and a computer for processing the data, this technique provides a practical method of determining circulation patterns and mixing characteristics of large aquatic systems...|$|E
