50|$|Cohabitation, {{sometimes}} called de facto marriage, {{is becoming more}} commonly known {{as a substitute for}} conventional marriage. Common-law marriage in the United States can still be contracted in nine US states, and in two others under restriction. This helps provide the surviving partner a legal basis for inheriting the deceased's belongings in the event of the death of their <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner.</b> In today's cohabiting relationships, forty percent of households include children, giving us an idea of how cohabitation could be considered a new normative type of family dynamic. As of 2012, 41% of all births in the US were to unmarried women. In three states (Mississippi - 55%, Louisiana - 53%, and New Mexico - 52%) births outside marriage were in the majority; the lowest percentage of births outside marriage was in Utah, at 19%.

Extrapolated to the population of the country as a whole, this figure equates to 6,863,352 men. Additionally, 0.9% of men reported experiencing domestic violence in the past year, equating to 834,732 men. Also in 2000, the Canadian General Social Survey found 7% of men had experienced IPV from 1994 to 1999, amounting to 549,000 men. Another Canadian General Social Survey, in 2005, found 6% of men had experienced IPV between 2000 and 2005, amounting to 546,000 men. Data concerning campus rape, such as from a National Institute of Mental Health and Ms. Magazine study, has found a 1 in 7 sexual assault rate for men in U.S. colleges.

40|$|Background Although female {{sex workers}} (FSWs) report {{high levels of}} condom use with {{commercial}} sex clients, particularly after targeted HIV preventive interventions have been implemented, condom use is often low with non-commercial partners. There is limited understanding regarding {{the factors that influence}} condom use with FSWs’ non-commercial partners, and of how programs can be designed to increase condom use with these partners. The main objectives of this study were therefore to describe FSWs’ self-reported non-commercial partners, along with interpersonal factors characterizing their non-commercial partnerships, and to examine the factors associated with consistent condom use (CCU) within non-commercial partnerships. Methods This study used data collected from cross-sectional questionnaires administered to 988 FSWs in four districts in Karnataka state in 2006 - 07. We used bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis {{to examine the relationship between}} CCU (i. e., ‘always’ compared to ‘never’, ‘sometimes’ or ‘frequently’) with non-commercial partners of FSWs (including the respondents’ husband or main <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> [if not married] and their most recent non-paying partner [who is neither a husband nor the main <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner,</b> and with whom the FSW had sex within the previous year]) and interpersonal factors describing these partnerships, as well as social and environmental factors. Weighting and survey methods were used to account for the cluster sampling design. Results Overall, 511 (51. 8 %) FSWs reported having a husband or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> and 247 (23. 7 %) reported having a non-paying partner. CCU with these partners was low (22. 6 % and 40. 3 % respectively). In multivariable analysis, the odds of CCU with FSWs’ husband or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> were 1. 8 -fold higher for FSWs whose partner knew she was a sex worker (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1. 84, 95 % confidence intervals[CI]: 1. 02 - 3. 32) and almost 6 -fold higher if the FSW was unmarried (AOR: 5. 73, 95 %CI: 2. 79 - 11. 76]. CCU with FSWs’ non-paying partner decreased by 18 % for each one-year increase in the duration of the relationship (AOR: 0. 82, 95 %CI: 0. 68 - 0. 97). Conclusions This study revealed important patterns and interpersonal determinants of condom use within non-commercial partnerships of FSWs.

40|$|Abstract Background The Avahan Initiative, a {{large-scale}} HIV preventive intervention targeted to high-risk populations including female sex workers (FSWs), was initiated in 2003 in six high-prevalence states in India, including Karnataka. This study assessed if intervention exposure {{was associated with}} condom use with FSWs’ sexual partners, including a dose-response relationship. Methods Data were from a cross-sectional study (2006 - 07) of 775 FSWs in three districts in Karnataka. Survey methods accounted for the complex cluster sampling design. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to separately model the relationships between each of five intervention exposure variables and five outcomes for consistent condom use (CCU= always versus frequently/sometimes/never) with different sex partners, including with: all clients; occasional clients; most recent repeat client; most recent non-paying partner; and the husband or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner.</b> Linear tests for trends were conducted for three continuous intervention exposure variables. Results FSWs reported highest CCU with all clients (81. 7 %); CCU was lowest with FSWs’ husband or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> (9. 6 %). In multivariable analysis, the odds of CCU with all clients and with occasional clients were 6. 3 -fold [95 % confidence intervals, CIs: 2. 8 - 14. 5] and 2. 3 -fold [95 % CIs: 1. 4 - 4. 1] higher among FSWs contacted by intervention staff and 4. 9 -fold [95 % CIs: 2. 6 - 9. 3] and 2. 3 -fold [95 % CIs: 1. 3 - 4. 1] higher among those who ever observed a condom demonstration by staff, respectively, {{compared to those who}} had not. A significant dose-response relationship existed between each of these CCU outcomes and increased duration since first contacted by staff (P = 0. 001; P = 0. 006) and numbers of condom demonstrations witnessed (P = 0. 004; P = 0. 026); a dose-response relationship was also observed between condom use with all clients and number of times contacted by staff (P = 0. 047). Intervention exposure was not associated with higher odds of CCU with the most recent repeat client, most recent non-paying partner or with the husband or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner.</b> Conclusion Study findings suggest that exposure to {{a large-scale}} HIV intervention for FSWs was associated with increased CCU with commercial clients. Moreover, there were dose-response relationships between CCU with clients and increased duration since first contacted by staff, times contacted by staff and number of condom demonstrations.

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Sociology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013. With growing {{participation}} {{of women in}} the labor force, new challenges continue to rise for women to meet daily demands of the home and work environment. Social scientists have re-focused their research efforts to identify what factors are critical in helping women balance their work and family life. This study is a comparative analysis of how the division of household labor among spouses and cohabiting partners living in the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, and Portugal is a key contributing factor in balancing the work and home environment. The findings of the study based on the 2002 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data set indicate that individuals who believe that men and women should be treated more equally experience higher levels of work-life balance. This effect increases when individuals perceive that their spouses or cohabiting partners spend more weekly hours on household labor. Being more financially dependent on a spouse or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> also increases work-life balance for an individual; however, this effect decreases when the individual does less than his/her fair share of household labor. Additionally, an individual experiences less work-life balance when he/she perceives that the spouse or <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> does more than the fair share of household labor. Throughout the study, results indicate that women compared to men experience less work-life balance which points to the traditional gender role pressures within the home environment that women to this day have to face. Living in Germany or in the Netherlands compared to living in the United States increases an individual???s work-life balance while living in Portugal has no such effect. The positive country-effects suggest that there is stronger governmental support in Germany and in the Netherlands for spouses or cohabiting partners who are dual-income earners. Sociolog...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} literature on {{factors associated with}} relationship satisfaction and relationship failure suggests that the expression of emotion has {{a vital role in}} the maintenance or failure of marriages and <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> relationships. Relationship failure is a significant clinical concern because of the association with increased suicide risk for separating partners and negative consequences for children of parents whose relationship is characterised by high levels of conflict. Longitudinal follow up studies have been used to clearly describe a destructive style of conflict resolution, based on a lack of communication of emotion between couples who then subsequently divorce or separate. However no research has been carried out to determine how the alexithymic personality trait, which is characterised by an inability to express emotion impacts upon <b>cohabiting</b> <b>partner</b> relationships such as marriages. This study used a clinical sample of men presenting with mental health problems to two adjoining community mental health teams. The study investigated whether the ability of men to express emotion, measured by the Toronto Alexithymia Scale was correlated with their satisfaction levels in cohabiting relationships (measured by the Relationship Assessment Scale). In addition, the hypothesis that alexithymic men may be more vulnerable, through their difficulties in expressing emotion to enter destructive partners of conflict resolution that lead to relationship failure was also investigated by correlating alexithymia scores with the number of failed precious cohabiting relationship the men had experienced. Results were not statistically significant, as it was only possible to collect a small, homogenous sample of men that was not sufficient for fairly evaluating the hypotheses of this study. The replication of this preliminary study within a primary care service, where participants may be more numerous, along with the additional incentive of payment for participation is recommended, due to the difficulties encountered in recruiting men to participate in a study about relationship satisfaction...|$|E
