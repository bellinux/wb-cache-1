40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the experience and}} attitudes of 189 family childcare pro-viders regarding their willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. Providers who had experience <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities {{were more likely to}} re-port a willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> them in the future. Differences in reported services and supports needed to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities, as well as explanations <b>for</b> un-willingness to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities, were examined for those with and without experience in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. Family childcare providers who were not willing to <b>care</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities indicated three primary bar-riers: a lack of knowledge about disabilities, the limitation that <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> a child with a disability would impose on <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> other children, and the need to purchase spe-cial equipment. Finally, general attitudes concerning inclusion were compared for providers who had and had not had experience in <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> children with disabilities. As is becoming the norm for U. S. families, families of children with disabilities are increasingly relying on non-parental childcare for their children. Family childcare ac...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{awareness}} and behaviour of nurses with experience of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families who have lost a child. Eleven nurses with experience of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families who have lost a child were questioned in semi-structured interviews. Data was analyzed both qualitatively and inductively. The results classified the awareness and behaviour of nurses into five categories: awareness of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress, grief <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families, difficulty of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families, scarcity of <b>care</b> systems <b>for</b> bereaved families, and discovery of the value of <b>caring</b> <b>for</b> <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families. The results of this survey showed that awareness of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> bereaved families utilizing the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress is the basis <b>for</b> bereavement <b>care.</b> In addition, the findings indicate that bereavement care consistsnot only of <b>care</b> <b>for</b> the distress of a bereaved family but is also linked to working through the nurse 2 ̆ 7 s own distress. 小児専門病院および小児病棟を有する病院計 11 施設に勤務する看護者で、子どもを亡くした遺族のケアをした経験のある 11 名を対象に、「遺族へのケアを体験した看護者の認識と行動」に関する半構成的インタビューを行い、語られた内容を質的帰納的に分析した。結果、以下の 5 カテゴリーが抽出された。 1) 看護者自身の悲嘆による遺族ケアの意識化。 2) 遺族への悲嘆ケア。 3) 遺族ケアの難しさ。 4) 遺族ケア体制の乏しさ。 5) 遺族ケアの価値の見出し。調査報告日本死の臨床研究会 奨励賞受賞平成 21 - 23 年度科学研究費補助金基盤研究(C...|$|R
