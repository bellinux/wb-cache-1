5|$|On 14 July 1876, Thunderer {{suffered}} a disastrous boiler explosion which killed 45 people. One of her boilers burst as she proceeded from Portsmouth Harbour to Stokes Bay {{to carry out}} a full-power trial. The explosion killed 15 people instantly, including her commanding officer; around 70 others were injured, of whom 30 later died. This was the Royal Navy's most deadly boiler explosion through the whole century. A model representing the failed boiler was made and is now in the Science Museum. The explosion was caused because a pressure gauge was broken and the safety valve had corroded in place. When the steam stop valve to the engines was <b>closed,</b> <b>pressure</b> in the boiler rose and could not be released. The four box boilers were the last in service in the Navy and operated at what would even then would have been considered a relatively low pressure, for more modern boilers, of 30 psi. The boiler was repaired and the ship was completed on 26 May 1877 at a cost of £368,428.|$|E

2500|$|The primary {{division}} in categorizing {{different types of}} glaucoma is open-angle and closed-angle (or angle-closure) glaucoma. [...] The open angle refers to the angle where the iris meets the cornea being as wide and open as it should be, allowing the fluid from inside the eye to drain, thus relieving the internal pressure.

50|$|Critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> is the {{internal}} pressure {{at which a}} blood vessel collapses and closes completely. If blood pressure falls below critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure,</b> then the vessels collapse. This happens during the measurement of blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer. At resting state the arterial critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> is ~ 20 mmHg.|$|R
30|$|After lung {{recruitment}} it {{is necessary}} to perform a step-wise decrement in PEEP (PEEP trial) to detect the lung’s <b>closing</b> <b>pressure.</b> During this phase the echo probe is kept in the same position (dependent lung) as before. The very moment when normal lung aeration images transform into a B 1 –B 2 pattern and consolidation pattern will define the <b>closing</b> <b>pressure.</b> The final selected level of PEEP is chosen to be 2 cm H 2 O above the detected <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> [14, 16, 17]. Once the patient’s opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> are known, a new RM is performed reaching these target pressures and the identified PEEP level is set for ongoing ventilation.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether subjects with Raynaud’s phenomenon have altered digital hemodynamics in the warm basal condition, we characterized the digital pressure-flow relationships in seven subjects with Raynaud’s phenome-non and compared the results with age and sex matched control subjects. Digital pressure-flow relationships were measured {{by the use of}} a plethysmographic technique during passive elevation of the arm. Normal subjects demonstrated a positive finger systolic pressure at zero flow (48. 3 mmHg), indicative of a criti-cal <b>closing</b> <b>pressure,</b> however, the <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> was significantly higher in the subjects who had a history of Raynaud’s phenomenon (64. 7 mmHg, p <. 001). In contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} found in the conduc-tance measured as the slope of the pressure-flow relationship. Subjects with Raynaud’s phenomenon demonstrated a correlation between finger systolic <b>pressure</b> and critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> suggesting that these subjects may regu-late arterial pressure through a critical <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> mechanism...|$|R

30|$|The {{success of}} such a {{ventilatory}} strategy critically depends on the right selection of opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures.</b> Otherwise patients can be submitted to undesirable high or inadequate low airways pressures. Therefore, ideally RM and PEEP selection must be individualized and this can only be done when guided by specific monitoring tools since lung’s opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> vary among patients with different lung conditions [14, 17].|$|R

50|$|Pressure {{cooking is}} the process of cooking food, using water or other cooking liquid, in a sealed vessel, known as a {{pressure}} cooker. As pressure cooking cooks food faster than conventional cooking methods, it saves energy. Pressure is created by boiling a liquid, such as water or broth, inside the <b>closed</b> <b>pressure</b> cooker. The trapped steam increases the internal pressure and allows the temperature to rise. After use, the pressure is slowly released so that the vessel can be opened safely.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to assess {{the effect of the}} insertion of ventilation tubes and the subsequent aeration of the middle ear on eustachian tube (ET) function in children. Manometric ET function tests were performed repeatedly for 3 months after the placement of ventilation tubes in 83 children with otitis media with effusion (OME). Opening and <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> (passive tubal function) and active tubal function were measured. Analysis of the results showed a significant increase in opening pressure over time, whereas the <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> did not change. The active tubal function did not change and remained at the same poor level. Therefore, the opening <b>pressure</b> and <b>closing</b> <b>pressure</b> and, especially, the poor active tubal function, {{were more likely to be}} a causal factor of OME than a result. Certain children may have poor intrinsic ET function that makes them more susceptible to OME...|$|R

40|$|Central {{sleep apnea}} is a rarely {{reported}} complication of surgery for {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA).

Five prior cases of this postoperative complication have been reported in non-obese individuals after tracheostomy for OSA. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that patients with atmospheric pharyngeal <b>closing</b> <b>pressures</b> are susceptible to unstable ventilation. We hypothesize that latent high loop gain from chronic OSA, coupled with atmospheric pharyngeal <b>closing</b> <b>pressures,</b> predisposed our patient to develop unstable ventilation after an abrupt postoperative change in his ventilatory load.

40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} surgery {{are prone}} to develop pressure ulcers during the surgical procedure. • The aim {{of the study was}} to gain insight into the problem by describing the incidence, clinical features and progression of pressure ulcers and <b>closed</b> <b>pressure</b> ulcers in patients undergoing surgery lasting more than 4 hours. • A prospective follow-up study was conducted in a university hospital in the Netherlands. • Two-hundred and eight patients from nine surgical specialities were included in the study. The skin of patients was observed the evening before surgery and, if the patient’s condition allowed it, directly postoperatively and subsequently daily for 14 days or until discharge, whichever occurred first. When patients developed a pressure ulcer they were observed daily until discharge or until the pressure ulcer had healed. The size and colour of the lesion, stage and skin condition were described every day. In addition, data were collected concerning the operation, postoperative period, and general characteristics. • Forty-four patients (21. 2 %) developed 70 pressure ulcers in the first 2 days following surgery. Twenty-one pressure ulcers deteriorated in the days following surgery. More than half (52. 9 %) of the lesions developed on the heels, and 15. 7 % developed in the sacral area. Twenty-five patients (12 %) were impaired by the lesions they developed. None of the patients in the study developed <b>closed</b> <b>pressure</b> ulcers. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Two {{concepts}} which {{reduce the}} A- 10 aircraft's wing/gear interface forces {{as a result}} of applying active control technology to the main landing gear are described. In the first concept, referred to as the alternate concept a servovalve in a <b>closed</b> <b>pressure</b> control loop configuration effectively varies the size of the third stage spool valve orifice which is embedded in the strut. This action allows the internal energy in the strut to shunt hydraulic flow around the metering orifice. The command signal to the loop is reference strut pressure which is compared to the measured strut pressure, the difference being the loop error. Thus, the loop effectively varies the spool valve orifice size to maintain the strut pressure, and therefore minimizes the wing/gear interface force referenced...|$|E
30|$|Gastric {{pressures}} {{were measured}} via a standard nasogastric tube. Prior to measurement, the nasogastric tube was aspirated for air or gastric contents, and its position {{was confirmed by}} chest X-ray. A three-way stopcock was attached between the nasogastric tube and a standard pressure monitoring line. A Luerlok syringe was attached to one port of the stopcock for the instillation of 100 ml of sterile saline from the <b>closed</b> <b>pressure</b> monitoring system to ensure a continuous column of fluid between the stomach and the pressure transducer. A point level with the xiphisternum on the mid-axillary line was marked, and the transducer was zeroed at that level. This position corresponds {{to the position of}} the stomach allowing accurate measurement of gastric pressure in different body positions. After each measurement, the instilled volume of saline was then aspirated out of the nasogastric tube.|$|E
