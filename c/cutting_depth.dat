Furthermore, a mathematical model, in which the cutting area was divided into different cutting zones, was established to simulate the <b>cutting</b> <b>depths</b> and volume of the different cutting edges (three kinds) on specialized tool. Accordingly, a specific ratio between the volume removed by different edges and the total hole volume was derived mathematically and modeled using 3 D modeling software SolidWorks.

In addition, the cutting volume ratio changes with different cutting parameters, but it can only vary in certain range due to the structure of the helical milling specialized tool. The cutting volume ratio obtained from the established model shows a good agreement with the data modeled using SolidWorks, proving that the established model is appropriate.

Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the grinding tool and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing.

In this study, the slicing mechanism of fixed abrasive wire sawing, using an electroplated diamond wire, was investigated experimentally.

30|$|MD {{simulations}} {{were also}} {{carried out to}} study the effect of cutting speed and <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> on the boundary effect. The simulation results show that reducing cutting speed results in more obvious boundary effect, while reducing <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> results in less obvious boundary effect. This is because a slower cutting speed means longer cutting time, and therefore the dislocations {{have more time to}} move and are more possible to reach the boundaries, which makes the boundary effect stronger. A smaller <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> means less material deformation, and therefore results in a weaker boundary effect. As the cutting speed and <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> may make the boundary effect stronger, {{it is important to consider}} those process parameters in choosing the model size for MD simulations of nanometric cutting.|$|E

30|$|As {{explained}} earlier, {{the impact}} of <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> on the surface roughness is insignificant. Some other researchers reported similar result by using carbide and ceramic tools (Asiltürk and Akkuş 2011; Das et al. 2015; Aslan et al. 2007). On the other hand, M. Elbah et al. (2011) claimed that for the wiper ceramic tools, {{the influence of the}} <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> on the surface roughness is considerable. The obtained results show that the surface roughness is decreased about 9 % by increasing the <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> to 2  mm. Further increasing the <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> to about 3  mm leads to the surface roughness deterioration. This surface roughness deterioration is mainly due to the chatter phenomenon, which occurs at the high level of the cutting depths. According to the results, 0.312  μm is the best-obtained surface roughness that has been achieved with 0.5  mm <b>cutting</b> <b>depth,</b> 2000  rpm speed, 0.08  mm/rev feed rate, and 1.2  mm nose radius. This low surface roughness is comparable with the surface finish that is obtained under the conventional grinding operation. The <b>cutting</b> <b>depth</b> in the range of 0.05 to 0.3  mm is proposed by most researchers for the finish hard turning operation (Revel et al. 2016; Bartarya and Choudhury 2012). However, the obtained results showed that by using the CBN tools, a better surface finish can be achieved at higher cutting depths compared to the ceramic and carbide tools. Therefore, by using CBN inserts during the finish hard turning, the total cost and the operational time both will improve simultaneously.|$|E

In this approach, the process damping is identified directly from the chatter tests using the experimental and the analytical stability limits. Once the process damping coefficient is identified, it is related to the instantaneous indentation volume by an indentation coefficient which is a more general constant, and thus can be used for different cutting conditions and tool geometries. In determination of the indentation coefficient, chatter test results, energy analysis and tool workpiece indentation geometry analysis are used.
