25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the high range is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> versus their resting rate of 6–12 <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, {{a breast}} pump is {{analogous}} to a milking machine used in commercial dairy production. A misconception is that the breast pump suctions milk out of the breast. A breast pump's job is to trigger the milk ejection response or letdown. Pumps achieve this by using suction to pull the nipple into the tunnel of the breast shield or flange, then release, which counts as one cycle. Thirty to sixty <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> can be expected with better-quality electric breast pumps. The breast pump is not as efficient at removing milk from the breast as most nursing babies. Most manufacturers have multiple sizes of nipple tunnels available. These tunnels {{range in size from}} 24mm to 36mm.|$|E

A total of 72 EGG recordings obtained from them, which divided furthermore into 9 datasets based on prepandrial state, postpandrial state, and post 1 hour drug administration state. EGG parameters {{such as the}} number of <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (cpm), average voltage of action potential segment (V̅_̅a̅), root mean square voltage of action potential segment (A_rms), root mean square voltage of all EGG segment (V_rms), average period of action potential segment (T̅_̅a̅), average period of resting plateau (T̅_̅i̅), average period difference among action potential segment and resting plateau (T̅_̅a̅ ̅-̅ ̅T̅_̅i̅), and dominant frequency (f_d) are obtained. Insignificant difference of f_d (P = 0. 9112993) and cpm (P = 0. 9382463) among 9 EGG datasets were found. These findings contrasted the common practice of EGG assessment, which f_d and cpm are the main parameters for diagnosis base.

40|$|Aim To {{develop an}} {{electromyography}} method for pregnant rat uterus in vivo and to separate myometrial {{signals from the}} gastrointestinal tract signals. Methods: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) were anaesthetized and their stomach, small intestine, and large intestine {{were removed from the}} abdomen. A pair of thread electrodes was inserted into the uterus, while a pair of disk electrodes was placed subcutaneously above the myometrium. Additionally, a strain gauge sensor was fixed {{on the surface of the}} myometrium and cecum for the parallel detection of mechanical contractions in rats (n = 18) with intact gastrointestinal tract. The filtered electric signals were amplified and recorded by an online computer system and analyzed by fast Fourier transformation. The frequency of the electric activity was characterized by <b>cycle</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (cpm), the magnitude of the activity was described as power spectrum density maximum (PsDmax). Results: The frequency of the pregnant uterine activity was 1 - 3 cpm, which falls within the same range as that of cecum. Measuring by both electrodes, oxytocin (1 μg/kg) increased and terbutaline (50 μg/kg) decreased the PsDmax by 25 %- 50 % (P < 0. 001) and 25 %- 40 % (P < 0. 01), respectively. We found a strong positive correlation between the alterations of PsDmax values and the strain gauge sensordetected mechanical contractions (area under curve). The GI specific compounds (neostigmine, atropine) mainly affected the cecal activity, while myometrium specific drugs (oxytocin, terbutaline) influenced the myometrial signals only. Conclusion: Our method proved to be able to detect the myoelectric activity that reflects the mechanical contraction. The overlapping myometrial and cecal signals are not separable, but they can be distinguished based on the much higher activity and different pharmacological reactivity of the pregnant uterus. Thus, the early signs of contractions can be detected and labor may be predicted in a fast and sensitive way...|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary vane pumps use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary vane pumps are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of <b>cycles</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> They operate at higher speed and are usually noisier. Slow diaphragm pumps use a large diaphragm operated by a cam or lever to generate suction with each stroke.

40|$|Objective. The {{research}} was to survey potential dermal exposure and inhalation exposure of operators to preservative fluids used in industrial timber pre-treatment. Results. Surveys in 1996 – 98 produced 64 data points. These were taken from 54 sites, and involved 57 timber pre-treatment process operators.

Treatment cycle times, preservative concentrations, treatment load sizes and quantities of preservative used per cubic metre of timber are reported.
