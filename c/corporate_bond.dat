40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} the return volatilities of <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> equities, and Treasuries under the Merton model with stochastic interest rates. Constructing empirical volatilities using bond returns over daily, weekly, and monthly horizons, we find that empirical bond volatilities are too high to be explained by equity and Treasury volatilities. Furthermore, the results are robust to using credit default swaps rather than <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> to measure volatility in the credit market. At the daily return horizon, the excess volatility of <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> is related to known liquidity proxies. However, this relation disappears at the monthly horizon even though <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> continue to be excessively volatile. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} disconnect between <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds</b> and equities that goes beyond the illiquidity of <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds...</b>|$|R

25|$|Governments issue {{government}} bonds {{in their own}} currency and sovereign bonds in foreign currencies. State and local governments issue municipal bonds to finance projects or other major spending initiatives. Debt issued by government-backed agencies is called an agency bond. Companies can issue a <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> or obtain money from a bank through a corporate loan. Preferred stocks {{share some of the}} characteristics of fixed interest bonds. Securitized bank lending (e.g. credit card debt, car loans or mortgages) can be structured into other types of fixed income products such as ABS – asset-backed securities which can be traded on exchanges just like corporate and {{government bonds}}.|$|E
25|$|Standard and Poor's and Moody's {{have both}} given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41billion as {{compared}} to only $8.5billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> amounting to $2.25billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to government bonds. For {{the first time in}} 20 years Apple Inc. surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively. Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after tax value under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

25|$|Credit rating {{agencies}} {{originated in the}} United States in the early 1900s, when ratings began {{to be applied to}} securities, specifically those related to the railroad bond market. In the United States, the construction of extensive railroad systems had {{led to the development of}} <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> issues to finance them, and therefore a bond market several times larger than in other countries. The bond markets in the Netherlands and Britain had been established longer but tended to be small, and revolved around sovereign governments that were trusted to honor their debts. Companies were founded to provide investors with financial information on the growing railroad industry, including Henry Varnum Poor's publishing company, which produced a publication compiling financial data about the railroad and canal industries. Following the 1907 financial crisis, demand rose for such independent market information, in particular for independent analyses of bond creditworthiness. In 1909, financial analyst John Moody issued a publication focused solely on railroad bonds. His ratings became the first to be published widely in an accessible format, and his company was the first to charge subscription fees to investors.|$|E

2500|$|Pricing a [...] "vanilla" [...] <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> {{is based}} on two sources of uncertainty: default risk (credit risk) and {{interest}} rate (IR) exposure. The MBS adds a third risk: early redemption (prepayment). The number of homeowners in residential MBS securitizations who prepay increases when interest rates decrease. One reason for this phenomenon is that homeowners can refinance at a lower fixed interest rate. Commercial MBS often mitigate this risk using call protection.|$|E

2500|$|Companies {{are legal}} persons, created by {{registering}} a constitution and paying a fee, at Companies House. Like a natural person, {{a company can}} incur legal duties and can hold rights. During its life, a company must have a board of directors, which usually hires employees. These people represent the company, and act on its behalf. They can use and deal with property, make contracts, settle trusts, or maybe through some misfortune commission torts. A company regularly becomes indebted through all of these events. Three main kinds of debts in commerce are, first, those arising through a specific debt instrument issued on a market (e.g. a <b>corporate</b> <b>bond</b> or credit note), second, through loan credit advanced to a company on terms for repayment (e.g. a bank loan or mortgage) and, third, sale credit (e.g. when a company receives goods or services but has not yet paid for them. However, the principle of separate legal personality means that in general, the company is the first [...] "person" [...] to have the liabilities. The agents of a company (directors and employees) are not usually liable for obligations, unless specifically assumed. Most companies also have limited liability for investors. Under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 74(2)(d) this means shareholders cannot be generally sued for obligations a company creates. This principle generally holds wherever the debt arises because of a commercial contract. The House of Lords confirmed the [...] "corporate veil" [...] will not be [...] "lifted" [...] in Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd. Here, a bootmaker was not liable for his company's debts {{even though he was}} effectively the only person who ran the business and owned the shares. In cases where a debt arises upon a tort against a non-commercial creditor, limited liability ceases to be an issue, because a duty of care can be owed regardless. This was held to be the case in Chandler v Cape plc, where a former employee of an insolvent subsidiary company successfully sued the (solvent) parent company for personal injury. When the company has no money left, and nobody else can be sued, the creditors may take over the company's management. Creditors usually appoint an insolvency practitioner to carry out an administration procedure (to rescue the company and pay creditors) or else enter liquidation (to sell off the assets and pay creditors). A moratorium takes effect to prevent any individual creditor enforcing a claim against the company. so only the insolvency practitioner, {{under the supervision of the}} court, can make distributions to creditors.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} effective interest rate proxies for equity and mortgage REITs, this study analyzes seven different interest rate proxies that {{have been widely used}} in the REIT literature. They are the monthly holding period returns on long-term U. S. government <b>bonds</b> and high-grade <b>corporate</b> <b>bonds,</b> the percentage changes in yields for long-term U.
