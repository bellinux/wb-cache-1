40|$|A Stirling cycle <b>cryogenerator</b> {{operates}} on a closed regenerative thermodynamic cycle with compression {{and expansion of}} the working fluid occurring at different temperature levels. Generally, hydrogen or helium {{is used as a}} single-component working fluid in the cryogenerators used for liquefaction of nitrogen. The use of a two-component working fluid, one condensing at the required refrigerating temperature, can improve the performance of the <b>cryogenerator.</b> If maximum cycle pressure in the <b>cryogenerator</b> is kept the same as when using a single-component working fluid, the pressure varies over a larger range. This provides an increase in the available refrigerating effect, but at a correspondingly higher input power. Thus, a particular <b>cryogenerator</b> can provide a larger liquefaction capacity when working with a two-component two-phase working fluid. Alternately, for a fixed liquefaction capacity, the maximum cycle pressure can be kept lower than the maximum cycle pressure with a single-component working fluid. The change over to a two-component fluid does not involve any change in the <b>cryogenerator</b> configuration. In this paper a computer simulation using second order cyclic analysis has been carried out for a PLN- 106 <b>cryogenerator</b> used for the liquefaction of nitrogen at a capacity of 6 - 6. 5 dm(3) h(- 1). The results using a single-component working fluid are compared with those for a two-component working fluid with the same maximum cycle pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of the 30 -year-old Philips <b>cryogenerator</b> with a modern LINDE- 1630 helium refrigerator {{is an important component}} of TRIUMFâ€™s ongoing 500 MeV cyclotron refurbishing program. Two 10. 7 m long cryopanels are cooled with liquid helium rather than with 17 K helium gas, {{as was the case with}} the <b>cryogenerator.</b> This has increased the pumping speed and, respectively, improved the vacuum in the approximately 100 m 3 cyclotron tank. Additionally, the thermal shield, previously cooled with helium gas, is now cooled with liquid nitrogen. These changes have resulted in increased reliability of the cyclotron vacuum system and, consequently, longer operation periods without maintenance. The new refrigeration unit was commissioned in September 2007. The results from over one year of operational experience are discussed. Also, data on hydrogen cryopumping is presented...|$|E
40|$|A double {{electrostatic}} storage ring named DESIREE {{is under construction}} at the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory and Stockholm University. The two rings {{will have the same}} circumference, 9. 2 m, and a common straight section for merged beam experiments with ions of opposite charges. The whole structure will be contained in a single vacuum vessel resulting in a very compact design. In addition to its unique double ring structure {{it will be possible to}} cool DESIREE below 20 K using <b>cryogenerators.</b> This will reduce the internal vibrational and rotational excitations of stored molecules. A cold system will also result in excellent vacuum conditions where longer lifetimes of the stored beams can be expected. While the ion optical calculations have entered a final phase much of the work is now devoted to solve many of the mechanical and cryogenic challenges of DESIREE. In order to test the mechanical and cryogenic properties of insulators, vacuum seals, and laser viewports a small test system has been built. The test system will provide valuable information for the final design of DESIREE...|$|R

40|$|A {{calibration}} {{technique for}} cryogenic temperature sensors is proposed and implemented. The experimental setup {{is based on}} the helium <b>cryogenerator,</b> providing calibration of the temperature sensors of various types in wide temperature range, including cryogenic band (25 - 100 K). A condensation thermometer with hydrogen, neon, argon and xenon as working gases is used as a reference sensor. The experimental setup was successfully used for precise (0. 1 K precision) calibration of platinum resistive temperature detectors (Pt- 100) for international nuclear physics experiments MuSun and PolFusion. The setup can also be used for calibration of temperature sensors of the other types...|$|E
40|$|Exergy or the {{available}} work energy function {{is a useful}} concept for analysing various systems. This paper attempts to present exergy analysis for Stirling cycle <b>cryogenerator.</b> The cycle deviates from the ideal cycle due to (1) finite temperature difference (Delta t) during heat transfer processes and (2) loss of refrigerating effect due to regenerator ineffectiveness. The analysis shows that at lower temperature ratios the influence of Delta t on exergetic efficiency is marginal. However, the influence of regenerator effectiveness on the exergetic efficiency even at lower temperature ratios is considerable. The combined effect of Delta t and regenerator effectiveness leads to the practical case and the same also has been analysed...|$|E
