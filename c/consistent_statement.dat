40|$|A recent {{amendment}} to Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (B) expands the {{situations in which}} prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> by testifying witnesses {{can be used as}} substantive evidence, and not merely as rehabilitating evidence. In this piece, the Authors argue that the revised rule may mislead judges and lawyers to conclude that prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> are always usable as substantive evidence when offered to rehabilitate a witness. Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth. The intent, although hard to discern on the face of the revised rule, is only to allow substantive use of <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> that are otherwise admissible to rehabilitate the testimony of a witness whose credibility has been attacked in a way that can be properly answered by proving prior consistencies. Thus the rule allows substantive use of <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> when they are relevant to repair attacks charging the witness with having forgotten what actually happened or charging the witness with making prior inconsistent statements in those limited cases in which proving <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> could refute such an attack. Perhaps most importantly, the revised rule does not do away with the premotive requirement adopted by the Supreme Court in the Tome case more than twenty years ago...|$|R

As a result, Montana has a myriad of case law attempting to apply the Montana rule on prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements.</b> The article first provides background to the establishment of the rule about prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements.</b> Next the article discusses both federal and Montana 2 ̆ 2 trigger 2 ̆ 2 cases and compares Montana 2 ̆ 7 s approach with that of the federal courts. The article then offers suggestions as to how Montana should enforce the rule on prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements,</b> concluding that the easiest way to clean up this troublesome area of Montana evidence law is to change the language of the rule itself so that it conforms exactly with the current version of the F. R. E. 801 (d) (1) (B) ...|$|R

50|$|Tome v. United States, 513 U.S. 150 (1995), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States that held that under Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 801(d)(1)(B), a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>{{statement}}</b> is not hearsay only if the statement was made before the motive to fabricate arose.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{opponent}} {{shows that the}} witness made a prior inconsistent statement and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was [...] "gotten to" [...] or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> (consistent with the testimony) before the alleged events {{that gave rise to}} the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly inconsistent statement that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement.|$|E
50|$|Prior {{consistent}} {{statements and}} prior inconsistent statements, {{in the law}} of evidence, occur where a witness, testifying at trial, makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a discovery, interview, or interrogation. The examiner can impeach the witness when an inconsistent statement is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E

50|$|The first in{{complete}}ness theorem shows that, {{in formal}} systems that can express basic arithmetic, {{a complete and}} consistent finite list of axioms can never be created: each time an additional, <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> is added as an axiom, there are other true statements that still cannot be proved, even with the new axiom. If an axiom is ever added that makes the system complete, it does so {{at the cost of}} making the system inconsistent. It is not even possible for an infinite list of axioms to be complete, consistent, and effectively axiomatized.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{the prior}} <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> is so {{closely related to}} res gestae {{as not to be}} permitted. In S v Moolman, Moolman was a {{policeman}} investigating stock-theft cases. He was very successful, because it turned out he had been torturing suspects to get them to confess. Put on trial, he was charged with numerous assaults. Moolman led evidence from his police pocket book; in other words, his notes. The court held, on appeal, that the pocket-book entries had been made as part of his daily routine, and were too intimately bound up with the events themselves.|$|E

Greg Egan used the idea in a short story called [...] "Dust" [...] in 1992 and expanded it into the novel Permutation City in 1995. Egan used dust theory as a way of exploring the question of whether a perfect computer simulation of a person differs from the real thing. However, his description of the dust theory as an extension of general relativity is also a <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> of the principle of event symmetry as used in quantum gravity.|$|E

50|$|In a dissent {{joined by}} Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer {{characterized}} {{the case as}} one about relevance and not hearsay. Breyer argued that {{the timing of the}} alleged motive to fabricate should go to the probative force of the testimony, not its reliability. Breyer thought that a post-motive <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> could be admitted to rebut a charge of fabrication, but that the probative force of the statement would simply be diminished. Breyer argued that FRE 801(d)(1)(B) could simply be a recognition that juries can have difficulty in separating the impeaching and substantive uses of hearsay statements, and so the rule declared as not hearsay prior consistent statements used to rebut charges of fabrication. In that sense, the usefulness of the Rule did not rest on the majority's timing requirement.|$|E
50|$|Justice Kennedy, {{joined by}} Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg, {{delivered}} the opinion {{for a majority}} of the court except for Part II-B, a plurality where Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. The Court noted that not all prior consistent statements by a witness were excluded from the bar against hearsay evidence. The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only prior consistent statements by a testifying witness used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> would need to have predated the motive to fabricate. Otherwise prior consistent statements would be admissible to rebut other forms of impeachment, and this would ignore the common law temporal requirement that the Advisory Committee Note said was adopted by the rule.|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{the issue of the}} first report, which {{exceptionally}} permits a complainant in a sexual offence case to offer a previously <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> into evidence. In the law of evidence a previous <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> is a written or oral statement, made by a witness on some prior occasion to testifying, which is substantially similar to her testimony in court. Normally, previous consistent statements are deemed to be inadmissible at trial because such testimony is considered to be self-serving and lacking in probative value. However, throughout jurisdictions following the Anglo-American tradition previous consistent statements in sexual offences are allowed as an exception to the general rule. This article reviews the history of the first report rule, including critical feminist legal critique of the rule's origins. The paper proceeds with a comparative look at divergent approaches to reform that have emerged with the rule in foreign jurisdictions. This analysis includes a review of reform proposals from the South African Law Commission (now the South African Law Reform Commission) before looking at a recent controversial case in the Supreme Court of Appeal that dealt with the first report, namely the case of S v Hammond...|$|E

The analysis is mostly empirical and considers the features of Prolog which have or will prove useful for specific applications areas. A discussion of similarities and differences between Prolog and Lisp is also presented. Finally, some subjective statements about the future of Prolog are considere...|$|E
40|$|In Agard v. Portuondo, the United States Supreme Court {{held that}} a {{prosecutor}} did not violate a testifying defendant 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional rights by inviting the jury to infer from the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s presence at trial that the defendant altered {{his own version of}} events to accord with other witnesses 2 ̆ 7 testimony. Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s opinion for the Court emphasized that jurors might well draw the inference even without a prosecutor asking them to do so. Although Agard is viewed as giving an advantage in a criminal trial to the government, this Article considers how Agard might be used to allow defense counsel to introduce the prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> of defendants that ordinarily could not be admitted under the rules of evidence. The Article discusses some procedural implications of admitting a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s pretrial statements-in response to the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s Agard argument, or simply in an effort to negate the possibility that the jury will draw an inference on its own even if the prosecutor makes no Agard argument. It concludes by examining the potential effect that admission of prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> could have on defense strategy at trial, and illustrates with some examples of what defense counsel could do post-Agard to demonstrate that the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s testimony was not the product of hearing the testimony of government witnesses...|$|R
