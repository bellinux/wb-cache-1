40|$|Roti island lies 10 km {{south of}} West Timor in the Lesser Sundas, Indonesia. Its bird fauna is poorly known. During 16 – 23 December 2004, 104 bird species were {{observed}} {{on the northern}} Tapuafu peninsula, including 32 new island records. Eight species of conservation importance were recorded: Yellow-crested Cockatoo <b>Cacatua</b> <b>sulphurea</b> (Critically Endangered), Timor Green Pigeon Treron psittacea (Endangered) and six Near Threatened species: Black Cuckoo Dove Turacoena modesta, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeon Ducula rosacea, Darter Anhinga melanogaster, Olive-shouldered Parrot Aprosmictus jonquillaceus, Orange-sided Thrush Zoothera peronii and White-bellied Bushchat Saxicola gutturalis...|$|R
50|$|The {{terrestrial}} {{area of the}} park has 200 bird species, of which the endangered species are Timor green pigeon (Treron psittaceus) (the cause for the species getting recorded under the endangered list {{is the loss of}} monsoon forest due to deforestation) and the yellow-crested cockatoo (<b>Cacatua</b> <b>sulphurea),</b> a critically endangered species affected due local captures in Wallacea for regional and global trade. About 10 Timor-endemic bird species occur in the park. The globally threatened and globally restricted-range bird species listed by the Bird Life International are the following.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} bird species is the orange-footed scrubfowl (Megapodius reinwardti), a ground {{dwelling}} bird. In areas of savanna, 27 species were observed. The zebra dove (Geopelia striata) and spotted dove (Spilopelia chinensis) were the most common species. In mixed tropical deciduous habitat, 28 bird species were observed, and helmeted friarbird (Philemon buceroides), green imperial pigeon (Ducula aenea), and lemon-bellied white-eye (Zosterops chloris) were the most common. Other birds include vibrantly coloured species such as green junglefowl (Gallus varius), great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos), and the critically endangered lesser sulpher crested cockatoo (<b>Cacatua</b> <b>sulphurea).</b> Two eagle species {{are found in the}} park, the white-bellied sea eagle and the extremely rare Flores hawk-eagle which is present on Rinca and Flores and reported but unconfirmed on Komodo Island.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to know the {{abundance}} status of the Yellow-crested Small Cockatoo (<b>Cacatua</b> <b>sulphurea</b> parvula) and Yellow-headed Lorikeet (Trichoglossus euteles) in Alor, East Nusa Tenggara Province. There were four sites observation in the survey, namely: (i) Air Mancur preparatory Village (in and around of Tuti Adigae Natural Tourism Park, East Alor Sub-district), (ii) Tanglapui Village (Kampong Irawuri) (East Alor Sub-district), (iii) Probur Village (Kampong Wormanem) (Southwest Alor Sub-district), and (iv) Bota Village (Northwest Alor Sub-district). The survey was used by bird encounter rates per unit time method. The population of birds approached by abundance score value. Fifty species of birds or 64. 9 % of 77 species of birds that found in Alor recorded during field working. The yellow-headed lorikeet observed more abundant with five abundance score and the numbers per 10 hours observation were 58. 06. The yellow-crested small cockatoo no one recovered during in the survey. However, the yellow-crested small cockatoo knows in the fields in direct observation nesting in the old nest site of Canarium trees...|$|R
40|$|In Benin, {{vegetable}} producers’ {{reliance on}} toxic synthetic pesticides threatens {{the environment and}} human health. However, the recent discovery of Lysiphlebus testaceipes (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae, Aphidiinae) in Benin offers new options for integrated pest management (IPM), particularly {{with a view to}} biological control of aphid host pest species in vegetable agroecosystems in the country. The current work therefore discusses the potential of the alien parasitoid L. testaceipes to control aphids within the framework of integrated pest management. The results demonstrate that the wasp increases its stabbings in order to increase the chance of oviposition on Aphis gossypii Glover and Aphis craccivora Koch (Homoptera: Aphididae). Aphis craccivora and especially fourth instars exhibited more intensive defense behavior against L. testaceipes compared to second instar-nymphs. The data proved that energy (honey as sustenance) had a significant effect on the wasp's oviposition performance, compared to that observed in females supplied with water. A single sting of L. testaceipes was sufficient to induce successful parasitism on its hosts, although the rate for achieving this was low. The wasp performed less than four stings on aphids younger than third instar prior to oviposition. These stabbings were increased to around seven stings on older nymphs. This was to counter stronger aphid defense and therefore increase the probability of successful oviposition. Parasitism negatively affected the survival and fertility of A. gossypii. The life-time fecundity of the aphid at third instar decreased dramatically to 4. 66 times (only 7. 569 ± 2. 381 nymphs per female) as a result of parasitism by L. testaceipes. A decrease of 7. 33 and 2. 45 times of the net reproductive rate (2. 119 ± 0. 272) and the intrinsic rate of increase (0. 110 ± 0. 018), respectively, was also observed among parasitized aphids. Furthermore, the wasp displayed a type II functional response on A. gossypii in the laboratory at 26 ± 1 ºC. Field trials proved that the wasp is effective in aphid suppression, {{despite the fact that the}} attack of the indigenous hyperparasitoid Syrphophagus africanus (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was observed. In addition, investigation in the field during both rainy and dry seasons, in 2011 and 2012 respectively, showed that the parasitoid along with three native predatory species that feed on aphids Cheilomenes propinqua (Mulsant), Cheilomenes sulphurea (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Ischiodon aegyptius (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Syrphidae) responded positively in numerical terms to changing densities of A. gossypii. Laboratory work carried out at 26 ± 1 ºC provided evidence that the three recorded predators are potential competitors to L. testaceipes. The three native predatory species had substantial consumption rates of A. gossypii, the aphidophagous larvae of I. aegyptius being the most voracious compared to their corresponding instars of the ladybirds C. propinqua and C. sulphurea. Daily consumption of unparasitized aphids by first instars of predators was 9. 58 ± 2. 89; 12. 03 ± 4. 36 and 17. 40 ± 7. 18 for C. propinqua, C. <b>sulphurea</b> and <b>I.</b> aegyptius, respectively. The consumption rate increased 7. 99 and 7. 38 times for fourth instars C. propinqua and C. sulphurea, respectively; and 5. 00 times for third instar I. aegyptius. The results also indicate that the predators provide an important ecosystem service regarding the natural control of the aphid. However, the data revealed an existence of asymmetrical omnivorous intraguild predation of A. gossypii mummies parasitized by L. testaceipes, by C. propinqua and C. sulphurea. Fourth instar of C. sulphurea was the most destructive omnivorous intraguild predator. They killed 46. 06 % of L. testaceipes pupae within 24 hours. In contrast, I. aegyptius larvae did not attack the aphid mummies parasitized by L. testaceipes. These findings indicate that the intraguild interactions between the alien parasitoid L. testaceipes and indigenous aphid predators probably play an important role in determining community structure, and they also act as regulators of both the aphid populations and the alien wasp populations. In conclusion, the study's results demonstrate that L. testaceipes is a promising biocontrol agent for the two major vegetable aphid pests A. gossypii and A. craccivora and this insight provides important background information for sound decision-making with regard to implementing sustainable measures for aphid management in Benin...|$|R
