5|$|Estimating {{the exact}} {{rate at which}} GRBs occur is difficult; for a galaxy of {{approximately}} {{the same size as}} the Milky Way, estimates of the expected rate (for long-duration GRBs) can range from one burst every 10,000 years, to one burst every 1,000,000 years. Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth. Estimates of rate of occurrence of short-duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of <b>collimation,</b> but are probably comparable.|$|E
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike the crystal. The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades the crystal without contributing useful information. <b>Collimation</b> is done either with a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors. Mirror systems are preferred for small crystals (under 0.3 mm) or with large unit cells (over 150 Å).|$|E
25|$|A {{specialized}} {{source of}} X-rays which is becoming {{widely used in}} research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are X-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of X-ray tubes, wide X-ray spectra, excellent <b>collimation,</b> and linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{technical}} measures taking by x-ray equipment manufacturers to reduce dose constantly and handling {{options for the}} staff to reduce dose depending on the clinical application. Among the former is beam hardening. Among the latter are frame rate settings, pulsed fluoroscopy and <b>collimation.</b>|$|E
25|$|A helical CT beam {{trajectory}} {{is characterized}} by its pitch, which {{is equal to the}} table feed distance over one gantry rotation divided by the section <b>collimation.</b> When pitch is greater than 1, the radiation dose for a given axial field-of-view is decreased compared to conventional CT. At high pitches there is, however, a trade-off in terms of noise and longitudinal resolution.|$|E
25|$|Another {{tool for}} {{decreasing}} dose is <b>collimation.</b> It {{may be that}} {{from the field of}} view provided by the detector, only a small part is interesting for the intervention. The x-ray tube can be shielded at the parts that are not necessary to be visible by a collimator, thus only sending dose to the detector for the body parts in question. Modern C-Arms enable to navigate on acquired images without constant fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practicality}} of CBCT fosters its increasing {{application in}} IR, technical limitations hinder its {{integration into the}} field. The two most significant factors that affect successful integration are image quality and time (for set up, image acquisition, and image reconstruction). Compared to MDCT, the wider <b>collimation</b> in CBCT leads to increased scatter radiation and degradation of image quality as demonstrated by artifacts and decreased contrast-to-noise ratio. The temporal resolution of cesium iodide detectors in CBCT slows data acquisition time to approximately 5 to 20 seconds, which increases motion artifact. The time required for image reconstruction takes longer for CBCT (1 minute) compared to MDCT (real time) due to the computationally demanding cone beam reconstruction algorithms.|$|E
25|$|All the {{electrons}} {{move in a}} straight line due to the high-voltage difference across the plates, which preserves <b>collimation,</b> and where one or two electrons entered, thousands may emerge. A separate (lower) charge differential accelerates the secondary electrons from the MCP until they hit a phosphor screen {{at the other end of}} the intensifier, which releases a photon for every electron. The image on the phosphor screen is focused by an eyepiece lens. The amplification occurs at the microchannel plate stage via its secondary cascaded emission. The phosphor is usually green because the human eye is more sensitive to green than other colors and because historically the original material used to produce phosphor screens produced green light (hence the soldiers' nickname 'green TV' for image intensification devices).|$|E
25|$|Surface quality {{measures}} the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface. Increasing the surface quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, <b>collimation,</b> and reduce unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, {{this is often}} {{described in terms of}} flatness, while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). A normal household-mirror made with float glass may have flatness tolerances as low as 9--14λ per inch, equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or around 12 nm).|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the latter mask is simply to create {{insensitive}} regions between adjacent pixels, and its use can be avoided if specialized detector technology is employed. In this way, the EI configuration is simultaneously realized for all pixel rows of an area detector. This plurality of individual beamlets means that no scanning is required – the sample is placed downstream of the sample mask and imaged in a single shot (two if phase retrieval is performed). Although the set-up perhaps superficially resembles that of a grating interferometer, the underpinning physical mechanism is different. GI is an intrinsically coherent method, in which an incoherent source can be used only provided it is made sufficiently coherent through <b>collimation</b> via the source grating. In contrast, EI is an incoherent technique, and was in fact proven to work with both spatially and temporally incoherent sources, without any additional source aperturing or <b>collimation.</b> Quantitative phase retrieval was also demonstrated with (uncollimated) incoherent sources, showing {{that in some cases}} results analogous to the synchrotron gold standard can be obtained. The highly simplified set-up, which however does not lead to reduced phase sensitivity, results in a number of advantages, which include reduced exposure time for the same source power, reduced radiation dose, robustness against environmental vibrations, and easier access to high X-ray energy. Moreover, since their aspect ratio is not particularly demanding, masks are cheap, easy to fabricate (e.g.do not require X-ray lithography) and can already be scaled to large areas. The method is easily extended to phase sensitivity in two directions, for example, through the realization of L-shaped apertures for the simultaneous illumination of two orthogonal edges in each detector pixel. More generally, while in its simplest implementation beamlets match individual pixel rows (or pixels), the method is highly flexible, and, for example, sparse detectors and asymmetric masks can be used. So far, the method has been successfully demonstrated in areas such as security scanning, biological imaging, material science, paleontology and others; adaptation to 3D (computed tomography) was also demonstrated. Alongside simple translation for use with conventional x-ray sources, there are substantial benefits in the implementation of EI with coherent synchrotron radiation, among which high performance at very high X-ray energies and angular resolutions higher than in other approaches.|$|E
500|$|A {{common type}} (used in {{applications}} such as aircraft gun sights) uses a collimating lens and a beam splitter. This type tends to be bulky since it requires at least two optical components, the lens and the beam splitter/glass plate. The reticle <b>collimation</b> optics are situated at 90° to the optical path making lighting difficult, usually needing additional electric illumination, condensing lenses, etc. A more compact type replaces the lens/beam splitter configuration with a half silvered or dichroic curved collimating mirror set at an angle that performs both tasks of focusing and combining {{the image of an}} offset reticle. This type is most often seen as the red dot type used on small arms. It is also possible to place the reticle between the viewer and the curved mirror at the mirror's focus. The reticle itself is too close to the eye to be in focus but the curved mirror presents the viewer with an image of the reticle at infinity. This type was invented by Dutch optical engineer Lieuwe Van Albada in 1932, originally as a camera viewfinder, and was also used as a gunsight on World War II bazookas: the US M9 and M9A1 [...] "Bazooka" [...] featured the D7161556 folding [...] "Reflecting Sight Assembly".|$|E

2500|$|A key {{enabling}} technology of LIGA is the synchrotron, capable of emitting high-power, highly collimated X-rays. This high <b>collimation</b> permits relatively large distances between the mask and the substrate without the penumbral blurring that occurs from other X-ray sources. [...] In the electron storage ring or synchrotron, a magnetic field constrains electrons to follow a circular path and the radial acceleration of the electrons causes electromagnetic radiation to be emitted forward. [...] The radiation is thus strongly collimated in the forward direction and can be assumed to be parallel for lithographic purposes. [...] Because of the much higher flux of usable collimated X-rays, shorter exposure times become possible. [...] Photon energies for a LIGA exposure are approximately distributed between 2.5 and [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Collimation</b> error:This is {{when the}} {{telescope}} or monocular is not parallel to {{the plane of the}} sextant. To check for this you need to observe two stars 90° or more apart. Bring the two stars into coincidence either to the left or the right of the field of view. Move the sextant slightly so that the stars move {{to the other side of}} the field of view. If they separate there is <b>collimation</b> error. As modern sextants rarely use adjustable telescopes, they do not need to be corrected for <b>collimation</b> error.|$|E

50|$|The device {{consists}} of two constituent parts, a gamma radiation sensitive inner core which fits inside the spherical tungsten outer <b>collimation</b> sheath. The outside diameter of the device is 140 mm (approx 5 ½ inch) which allows deployment in to hard to reach areas whilst providing a 360 degree view of the area. The inner core {{is made up of}} material which changes colour when it is exposed to gamma radiation. Therefore, when the device is deployed inside a radioactive environment the <b>collimation</b> device preferentially allows gamma radiation to pass through the <b>collimation</b> holes which deposits tracks within the inner core. These tracks can then be analysed to provide a 3D visualisation of the radioactive environment predicting both source location and intensity.|$|E
50|$|Roof-prisms designs {{create an}} {{instrument}} that is narrower and more compact than Porro prisms. There is also a difference in image brightness. Porro-prism binoculars will inherently produce a brighter image than roof-prism binoculars of the same magnification, objective size, and optical quality, because the roof-prism design employs silvered surfaces that reduce light transmission by 12% to 15%. Roof-prisms designs also require tighter tolerances for alignment of their optical elements (<b>collimation).</b> This adds to their expense since the design requires them to use fixed elements {{that need to be}} set at a high degree of <b>collimation</b> at the factory. Porro prisms binoculars occasionally need their prism sets to be re-aligned to bring them into <b>collimation.</b> The fixed alignment in roof-prism designs means the binoculars normally will not need re-collimation.|$|E
