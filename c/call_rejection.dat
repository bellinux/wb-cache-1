40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a new call {{admission}} control (CAC) scheme for wireless cellular systems supporting a hot-spot cell. Two strategies for CAC are assumed. One {{is based on}} the number of calls, which are accepted or not, the other {{is based on the}} interference level. The proposed CAC can regulate the call attempts with packet by adopting measured interference used for matrix. A function, specifically a linear interpolation function based on Inverse Transform theory is used to convert controlled predictive average admission ratio in a <b>call</b> <b>rejection</b> ratio. Then, a call admission ratio is obtained from the <b>call</b> <b>rejection</b> ratio. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme yields better performance than the conventional scheme does under the heavy calls on a hot-spot cell...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{random access}} {{channels}} and traffic channels are utilized, respectively, for call establishment and information transmission in the uplink direction (from mobile to base station) of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) networks. A call is either rejected or blocked depending on {{its inability to}} succeed either in the random access channels or in the traffic channels. The optimum number of random access slots is directly proportional to the average call arrival rate, being independent of the average channel holding time {{and the number of}} traffic channels. The number of slots occupied by a given call can be changed dynamically in the newly developed General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) systems. A complete analysis is executed for the traffic channel utilization and call blocking probability with the exact number of random access slots that provide almost zero <b>call</b> <b>rejection</b> probability. The overall call success probability is derived considering <b>call</b> <b>rejection</b> and call blocking probabilities...|$|E

DelayCheck solves the joint routing, channel assignment and link scheduling problem along with delay constraint. We formulate a relaxed version of this scheduling problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), the LP version of which gives us an optimality upper bound. We compare the output of DelayCheck with theLP-basedupperboundaswellaswithtwostate-of-the-art prior scheduling algorithms. DelayCheck performs remarkably well, accepting about 93 % of voice calls as compared to LP-based upper bound. As compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, DelayCheck improves scheduler efficiency by more than 34 % and reduces <b>call</b> <b>rejections</b> by 2 fold. We also demonstrate that DelayCheck efficiently exploits the number of channels available for scheduling.

40|$|Problem statement: Resource {{management}} {{is one of}} the most important engineering issues in 3 G systems where multiple traffic classes are supported each being characterized by its required Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. Call Admission Control (CAC) {{is one of the}} resource management functions, which regulates network access to ensure QoS provisioning. Efficient CAC is necessary for the QoS provisioning in WCDMA environment. The effective functioning of WCDMA systems is influenced by the power control utility. Approach: In this study, we propose to design a fuzzy logic based power control for Wideband Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Networks. This proposed technique is aimed at multiple services like voice, video and data for multiclass users. The fuzzy logic technique is used to estimate the optimal admissible users group inclusive of optimum transmitting power level. This technique reduces the interference level and <b>call</b> <b>rejection</b> rate. Results: By simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed technique achieve reduced energy consumption for a cell with increased throughput.

5000|$|The {{northern}} sportive lemur is nocturnal, foraging {{for food}} {{at night and}} sleeping in the day. The lemurs sleep in holes or dense foliage in trees ranging from 1 to 8 metres. Females will leave their young on a branch when foraging for food. Males are solitary and territorial, and their territories often overlap with many female home ranges. Male lemurs will aggressively defend their territories in the mating season. The male is generally thought to be loosely polygynous, {{but it has been}} suggested that males can be monogamous. [...] L. septentrionalis individuals communicate through chemical communication in the form of latrine behaviour to mark territory, as well as vocal communication (calls). There are two main calls: a loud crow-like call and a contact <b>rejection</b> <b>call.</b> The loud call is used by the lemurs to reveal their presence and territorial claims to other individuals. The contact <b>rejection</b> <b>call</b> is a series of resonant hisses followed by a two-phase vocalisation, most commonly heard when two individuals approach each other in the wild. The contact <b>rejection</b> <b>call</b> is also heard when conspecifics come into contact with each other in captivity, at which point they may also strike each other with their hands.|$|R
