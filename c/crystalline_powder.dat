5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, needle-like <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder</b> with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|Few {{inorganic}} lead(IV) compounds are known, {{and these}} exist only in highly acidic solutions. Lead(II) oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation, Pb3O4. It {{is described as}} lead(II,IV) oxide, or structurally 2PbO·PbO2, and is the best-known mixed valence lead compound. Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent, capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas. This is because the expected PbCl4 that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl2 and Cl2. Analogously to lead monoxide, lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions. Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures. Lead tetrafluoride, a yellow <b>crystalline</b> <b>powder,</b> is stable, but less so than the difluoride. Lead tetrachloride (a yellow oil) decomposes at room temperature, lead tetrabromide is less stable still, {{and the existence of}} lead tetraiodide is questionable.|$|E

30|$|Besides the {{well-known}} mechanotreatment of commercial FeF 3 powder, authors have been increasingly {{interested in the}} direct synthesis of the electroactive species by soft-chemistry approaches such as sol–gel or hydrothermal/solvothermal methods. Iron trifluoride is generally obtained by treating the anhydrous trichloride in a flow of HF. The reaction at RT yields amorphous FeF 3 while <b>crystalline</b> <b>powders</b> can be obtained after heat treatment (at least 600  °C) [26].

30|$|XRD {{was used}} to verify the {{structure}} of the various powders. The broad peak of the amorphous melt-cast powder indicates that there is no repeating long range order within the glass, and hence there will necessarily be a distribution of bond lengths within the material. For <b>crystalline</b> <b>powders</b> such as devitrified melt-cast powder and sol–gel derived powder the patterns match combeite (Na 2 Ca 2 Si 3 O 9), which has a trigonal-trapezohedral class symmetry. A major implication in the formation of combeite crystals in both devitrified powders is that combeite is a calcium sodium silicate and should not contain any phosphorous. If phosphorous was rejected from the combeite crystals as they grew, then a gradient in phosphorous could be generated between the crystals and their grain boundaries, or the phosphorous could volatilize. Previous work has suggested that some phosphorous is still present in a grain boundary phase with different aqueous solubility [17]. XPS analysis suggests that phosphorous content is lower in the crystallized powders (Table  4), which could imply that some of the phosphorous has volatilized, and that some remains in the grain boundary phase. Regardless, the phosphorous effect is likely not significant; similar XRD patterns and surface chemistry (XPS) between <b>crystalline</b> <b>powders</b> does not result in similar protein adsorption profiles, thus the surface morphology, or more subtle variations in surface chemistry may play a more dominant role.|$|R

Powders of rather wide size distributions were obtained, in the under 212 μm range, which afforded to carry out comparative phase analyses on particles which underwent quite different cooling conditions. X-ray diffraction examinations as well as light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, differential thermal analysis (DTA) and microhardness determinations were used to investigate the powders belonging to different size ranges.

Light microscopy afforded to evaluate the morphometric details such as the secondary dendrite arm spacing in the crystalline particles, which were correlated with the estimated cooling rates computed {{by means of a}} simplified computer code. X-ray diffraction, TEM examinations and electron diffraction confirmed that conditions were established for the development of amorphous or nanocrystalline particles, in particular in the “under 38 μm” and in the 38 – 45 μm size ranges. Microhardness determinations showed an extremely high hardness, of the order of 1000 – 1100 HV 0. 05 in the case of fully amorphous particles, which could be encountered mainly in the smaller size ranges, while in the case of <b>crystalline</b> <b>powders</b> the hardness was around a half of such value mainly in the larger, fully crystalline ones...|$|R
