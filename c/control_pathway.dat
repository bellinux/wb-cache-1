40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we review {{evidence}} for {{of a model}} in which the inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/AI) area is involved in elaborate attentional and working memory processing and we present the hypothesis that this processing may take different forms and may have different effects, depending on the task at hand: (1) it may facilitate fast and accurate responding, or (2) it may cause slow responding when prolonged elaborate processing is required to increase accuracy of responding, or (3) it may interfere with accuracy and speed of next-trial (for instance, post-error) performance when prolonged elaborate processing interferes with processing of the next stimulus. We present our viewpoint that ventrolateral corticolimbic <b>control</b> <b>pathways,</b> including the IFG/AI, and mediodorsal corticolimbic <b>control</b> <b>pathways,</b> including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex areas, play partly separable, but interacting roles in adaptive behavior in environmental conditions that differ {{in the level of}} predictability: compared to dorsal feed-forward control, the ventral corticolimbic <b>control</b> <b>pathways</b> implement <b>control</b> over actions through higher responsiveness to momentary environmental stimuli. This latter control mode is associated with an attentional focus on stimuli that are urgent or close in time and space, while the former control mode is associated with a broader, more global focus in time and space. Both <b>control</b> <b>pathways</b> have developed extensively through evolution, and both developed their own “cognitive controls,” such that neither one can be properly described as purely “cognitive” or “emotional. ” We discuss literature that suggests that the role of IFG/AI in top-down control is reflected in cortical rhythms and event-related potentials. Together, the literature suggests that the IFG/AI is an important node in brain networks that control cognitive and emotional processing and behavior...|$|R

40|$|Neurotensin (NT) is an {{endogenous}} neuropeptide that exerts potent opioid-independent analgesic effects, {{most likely}} via the type 2 NT receptor (NTR 2). Previous morphological and electrophysiological studies {{suggested that the}} NT-NTR 2 system is primarily localized in structures that constitute the descending pain <b>control</b> <b>pathway,</b> such as the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and the spinal dorsal horn (SDH). However, relevant morphological evidence for this neurotensinergic (NTergic) circuit is lacking. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to morphologically elucidate the potential sites and connections in the NT-NTR 2 system that are involved in the descending pain <b>control</b> <b>pathway.</b> Based on light and electron microscopy combined with anterograde and retrograde tracing, we found evidence that NTR 2 -immunoreactive (IR) neurons in the RVM receive NT-IR projections originating from the PAG; express NT, serotonin (5 -HT), or both; and send projections that terminate in laminae I and II of the SDH. These results suggest that NTR 2 may contribute to pain control by binding to NT in the PAG-RVM-SDH pathway. In conclusion, our data provide morphological evidence for an NTergic PAG-RVM-SDH pathway, implicating novel mechanisms of NT-induced analgesia...|$|E

40|$|Within a cell, {{the levels}} and {{activity}} of multiple pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules act in concert to regulate commitment to apoptosis. Whilst {{the balance between}} survival and death can be tipped by the effects of single molecules, cellular apoptosis <b>control</b> <b>pathways</b> very often incorporate key transcription factors that co-ordinately regulate the expression of multiple apoptosis control genes. C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs), which were originally identified through their binding to the Adenovirus E 1 A oncoprotein, {{have been described as}} such transcriptional regulators of the apoptosis program. Specifically, CtBPs function as transcriptional co-repressors, and have been demonstrated to promote cell survival by suppressing the expression of several pro-apoptotic genes. In this review we summarize the evidence supporting a key role for CtBP proteins in cell survival. We also describe the known mechanisms of transcriptional control by CtBPs, and review the multiplicity of intracellular signaling and transcriptional <b>control</b> <b>pathways</b> with which they are known to be involved.

Here we report a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the fungal aging model Podospora anserina. Total RNA of three individuals of defined age were pooled and analyzed by SuperSAGE (serial analysis of gene expression). A bioinformatics analysis identified different molecular pathways to be affected during aging. While the abundance of transcripts linked to ribosomes and to the proteasome quality control system were found to decrease during aging, those associated with autophagy increase, suggesting that autophagy may act as a compensatory quality <b>control</b> <b>pathway.</b> Transcript profiles associated with the energy metabolism including mitochondrial functions were identified to fluctuate during aging. Comparison of wild-type transcripts, which are continuously down-regulated during aging, with those down-regulated in the long-lived, copper-uptake mutant grisea, validated the relevance of age-related changes in cellular copper metabolism.

40|$|We discuss an attentional {{model for}} {{simultaneous}} object tracking and recognition that {{is driven by}} gaze data. Motivated by theories of perception, the model consists of two interacting pathways, identity and control, intended to mirror the what and where pathways in neuroscience models. The identity pathway models object appearance and performs classification using deep (factored) -Restricted Boltzmann Machines. At each point in time the observations consist of foveated images, with decaying resolution to-ward {{the periphery of the}} gaze. The <b>control</b> <b>pathway</b> models the location, orientation, scale and speed of the attended object. The posterior distribution of these states is esti-mated with particle filtering. Deeper in the <b>control</b> <b>pathway,</b> we encounter an attentional mechanism that learns to select gazes so as to minimize tracking uncertainty. Unlike in our previous work, we introduce gaze selection strategies which operate in the presence of partial information and on a continuous action space. We show that a straightforward extension of the existing approach to the partial information setting results in poor per-formance, and we propose an alternative method based on modeling the reward surface as a Gaussian Process. This approach gives good performance in the presence of par-tial information and allows us to expand the action space from a small, discrete set of fixation points to a continuous domain. ...|$|E

We have been interested in the results of adaptive control experiments in our laboratory involving the maximization of a ratio of two experimental observables: (1) the thermalized emission from the solution-phase coordination complex [Ru-(dpb) 3](PF 6) 2 and (2) the second harmonic signal (a purely intensity-dependent phenomenon) of the shaped laser fields. Using a rational pulse shaping strategy, we have made a measurement of the ratio spectrum (in essence the two-photon absorption cross section) for the molecule [Ru(dpb) 3](PF 6) 2 in a room temperature solution of acetonitrile. This spectrum is highly varied across the accessible two-photon power spectrum of our broad-band laser pulses and demonstrates the existence of a <b>control</b> <b>pathway</b> wherein a shaped laser field can manipulate excited-state population (with respect to SHG) by conforming to the second-order spectral response of the molecule in solution.

In this study, we employed a thermosensitive allele of the yeast Guk 1 guanylate kinase as a model misfolded protein to investigate degradative protein quality <b>control</b> <b>pathways.</b> We performed a flow cytometry based screen to identify factors that promote proteasomal degradation of proteins misfolded {{as the result of}} missense mutations.

Whereas the absence of GIM 3 did not impair proteasomal function or the ubiquitination of the model substrate, it led to the accumulation of the poorly soluble model substrate in cellular inclusions that was accompanied by delayed degradation. We found that Gim 3 interacted with the Guk 1 mutant allele and propose that prefoldin promotes the degradation of the unstable model substrate by maintaining the solubility of the misfolded protein.
