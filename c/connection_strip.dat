40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the range of}} issues associated with the optimization of bolted joint connections between honeycomb panels, representative of spacecraft structures. The first {{part of a large}} body of work, involving the application of experimental, finite element and analytical methods, has been carried out. A procedure has been developed to maximize the load carrying capability per unit mass of shear joints by optimizing the balance between the number of bolts {{and the size of the}} bolts used in the joint system. The finite element method has been used with the primary aim of analyzing the stress levels experienced by the connection strips of bolted joints under different loading conditions and to investigate the effect of modifying various design parameters (e. g. <b>connection</b> <b>strip</b> thickness and number of bolts). Lastly, a test campaign has been carried out to asses the performance of honeycomb panel inserts subjected to out of plane loads in “T ” joint applications. Test results obtained from two different insert systems are compared together with static strength capability results obtained from an analytical model. ...|$|E
40|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by the ASCE Committee on Fatigue and Fracture Reliability, 80 – 90 % of failures in steel structures are related to fatigue and fracture. Therefore, fatigue and fracture reliability is an important concern for steel bridges. In this study, the finite strip method is coupled with either the fatigue approach proposed by Wirsching, or the linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) approach as proposed by Harris (In: Sundararajan C, Ed. Probabilistic structural mechanics handbook [chapter 7]. New York: Chapman & Hall Ltd.; 1995. p 106 – 45.), for fatigue reliability analysis of steel highway bridges. The flat shell strips are employed to model the concrete slab and steel girders, while a <b>connection</b> <b>strip</b> is developed by means of the penalty function method in order {{to take into account the}} eccentricity of the top flange of girder. The loading effects are modeled by the fatigue truck developed by Laman and Nowak (Journal of Stuctural Engineering ASCE 1996 : 726). At each sampling point with given values of slab thickness and modulus ratio, a finite strip analysis of the bridge under fatigue truck is carried out, and the stress ranges at the fatigue-prone detail are calculated. According to these stress ranges and intended service life, the fatigue failure probability can be evaluated using the fatigue approach or the LEFM approach. After the failure probability is integrated over all sampling points, the fatigue reliability of the bridge is determined. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed methodology...|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} connections, designed {{prior to}} the implementation of earthquake design standards, may be vulnerable to shear failure during a seismic attack. Addition of externally bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites can enhance not just the shear capacity but the deformation and energy absorption capacity of the connection. The majority of research studies to date have opted for complete or nearcomplete coverage of the joint region with FRP and have subjected the test specimens to cyclic (push-pull) loading. Such strengthening schemes and method of loading make it quite difficult to accurately monitor and hence understand the behaviour of the FRP and the concrete beneath. This paper presents results of a series of tests on the strengthening of shear deficient <b>connections</b> with FRP <b>strips</b> subjected to either cyclic or monotonic loading with the primary motivation being accurate description of the behaviour of the FRP. The tests also enable the failure modes to be more accurately reported and classified especially due to the use of monotonic loading.

40|$|The Silicon Vertex Tracker for the SuperB {{detector}} {{is designed}} as an {{evolution of the}} BaBar SVT, based on double-sided strip detectors. The wider acceptance in polar angle (down to 300 milliradians) will imply larger incidence angles (up to 73 °) on the sensors. On the z-side (reading out the z coordinate, along the beam direction) this results in large clusters with small signal values on individual channels. For optimum performance it would be desirable to continuously vary the sensor pitch on z-side versus position. An easy and convenient way to approximate this configuration is to bond two or three adjacent strips to a single trace of the fanout circuit that connects the strips to the front-end electronics (the so-called ‘pairing’ option). In order to accurately measure the total capacitance of strips in various pairing configurations (× 2,× 3,× 4) two test detectors have been assembled on PCBs, and various <b>strip</b> <b>connection</b> schemes have been implemented by wire bonding, on p and on n-side, respectively.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{generalized}} strip modelling method that is computationally efficient for the VIV prediction of long flexible cylinders in three-dimensional incompressible flow. In order {{to overcome the}} shortcomings of conventional strip-theory-based 2 D models, the fluid domain is divided into ?thick? strips, which are sufficiently thick to locally resolve the small scale turbulence effects and three dimensionality of the flow around the cylinder. An attractive feature of the model is that we independently construct a three-dimensional scale resolving model for individual strips, which have local spanwise scale along the cylinder's axial direction and are only coupled through the structural model of the cylinder. Therefore, this approach is able to cover the full spectrum for fully resolved 3 D modelling to 2 D <b>strip</b> theory. The <b>connection</b> between these <b>strips</b> is achieved through the calculation of a tensioned beam equation, {{which is used to}} represent the dynamics of the flexible body. In the limit, however, a single ?thick? strip would fill the full 3 D domain. A parallel Fourier spectral/hp element method is employed to solve the 3 D flow dynamics in the strip-domain, and then the VIV response prediction is achieved through the strip-structure interactions. Numerical tests on both laminar and turbulent flows as well as the comparison against the fully resolved DNS are presented to demonstrate the applicability of this approach...|$|R

40|$|For a {{systematic}} mapping of the Martian surface, the Mars Express orbiter {{is equipped with}} a multi-line scanner: Since the beginning of 2004 the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) regularly acquires long image strips. By now more than 4, 000 strips covering nearly the whole planet are available. Due to the nine channels, each with different viewing direction, and partly with different optical filters, each strip provides 3 D and color information and allows the generation of digital terrain models (DTMs) and orthophotos. To map larger regions, neighboring HRSC strips can be combined to build DTM and orthophoto mosaics. The global mapping scheme Mars Chart 30 is used to define the extent of these mosaics. In order to avoid unreasonably large data volumes, each MC- 30 tile is divided into two parts, combining about 90 strips each. To ensure a seamless fit of these strips, several radiometric and geometric corrections are applied in the photogrammetric process. A simultaneous bundle adjustment of all strips as a block is carried out to estimate their precise exterior orientation. Because size, position, resolution and image quality of the strips in these blocks are heterogeneous, also the quality and distribution of the tie points vary. In absence of ground control points, heights of a global terrain model are used as reference information, and for this task a regular distribution of these tie points is preferable. Besides, their total number should be limited because of computational reasons. In this paper, we present an algorithm, which optimizes the distribution of tie points under these constraints. A large number of tie points used as input is reduced without affecting the geometric stability of the block by preserving <b>connections</b> between <b>strips.</b> This stability is achieved by using a regular grid in object space and discarding, for each grid cell, points which are redundant for the block adjustment. The set of tie points, filtered by the algorithm, shows a more homogenous distribution and is considerably smaller. Used for the block adjustment, it yields results of equal quality, with significantly shorter computation time. In this work, we present experiments with MC- 30 half-tile blocks, which confirm our idea for reaching a stable and faster bundle adjustment. The described method is used for the systematic processing of HRSC data...|$|R
40|$|ManuscriptThis paper {{presents}} the principle {{and the application}} of an innovative anchorage technique for prestressed carbon fiber–reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips in structural strengthening. Additionally, large-scale static loading tests of retrofitted concrete beams are shown. The gradient anchorage, based on the adhesive’s ability to undergo accelerated curing at high temperatures, consists of a purely concrete-adhesive <b>strip</b> <b>connection</b> without any mechanical devices, such as bolts or plates. In a first step, this study summarizes anchorage techniques presented in the literature and introduces the basic principles of the new method as well as the necessary components. In a second step, an application on a full-scale RC beam is explained in detail. A commercially-available CFRP strip is prestressed up to 0. 6 % prestrain and subsequently anchored by sequential epoxy-curing and force-releasing steps at both strip ends. Furthermore, uniaxial tensile tests on the epoxy adhesive and the CFRP strip are used for material characterization and to demonstrate the reinforcing materials’ integrity after the heating process. It appeared that prestress losses during the anchoring phase are negligible. The method allows much faster installation than conventional mechanical techniques and increases durability because no permanent steel elements are necessary. The material tests indicate no damage in the reinforcing CFRP strip as well as a sufficiently fast strength development of the adhesive after accelerated curing. Static loading tests on strengthened large-scale RC beams are presented and show the efficiency of a prestressed CFRP strip with gradient anchorage as a retrofitting technique. Finally, first long-term measurements over 13 years on a prestressed strip bonded to a concrete plate revealed small prestrain losses.
