40|$|The {{flotation}} {{response of}} chalcopyrite {{has been characterized}} {{as a function of}} particle size and <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle. The <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle of individual particle size fractions was controlled to different values. Flotation experiments were carried out under constant hydrodynamics and feed particle size distribution. A two-component kinetic model was used to fit the experimental flotation data. The maximum recovery increased with <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle for each size fraction. Particles within the same size fraction and within the same contact angle range displayed similar flotation behaviour, within experimental error, in different tests. Evidence of a distribution of <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle values within each particle size fraction was found, and it was assumed that particles in the non-floating fraction had <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle values below the critical contact angle required for stable bubble-particle attachment. The flotation results were used to model the maximum recovery and the critical contact angle as a function of particle size, assuming a statistical distribution of contact angle values about a measured mean. The recovery and rate constant data were collated into master curves as a function of particle size for different contact angle ranges. These master curves, together with the critical contact angle, may be used to benchmark the flotation response of chalcopyrite and to infer an effective operational contact angle in natural ores. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{flotation}} {{response of}} chalcopyrite {{has been characterized}} {{as a function of}} particle size and <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle. The <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle of individual size fractions was manipulated to different values, measured using the Washburn technique. A flotation feed sample was constituted from the individual size fractions. Parameters such as frother concentration, impeller rotational speed, and superficial gas velocity were the same in each flotation test. The chalcopyrite sample, {{in the absence of any}} steps to intentionally manipulate the <b>contact</b> angle, displayed <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angles which varied with particle size fraction. In the presence of a standard thiol collector, the <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle was also particle size dependent, with the - 20 micron fraction displaying the lowest contact angle. Flotation tests showed that the chalcopyrite size fractions above 20 microns floated independently of each other, and that the flotation response was the same for the same particle contact angle and size fraction across different flotation tests. The flotation response was characterized by the maximum recovery at infinite flotation time and the distributed rate constant, assuming a single floatable fraction existed within each size fraction. When the distributed and undistributed rate constants were compared, the latter gave a greater dependency on contact angle as it took into account the non-floating fraction. The two rate constants converged at high <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angles as the non-floating fraction approached zero. Further work on mineral floatability characterization will lead to the development of calibration curves of rate constant against particle size and contact angle, a tool that could be used to benchmark flotation response.

40|$|Most of the {{literature}} accepts, despite many controversial results, that during oxida-tion/reduction films of conducting polymers (CPs) move from electronic conductors to insulators. Thus, engineers and device’s designers are forced to use metallic supports to reoxidize the material for reversible device work. Electrochromic front experiments appear as main visual support of the claimed insulating nature of reduced CPs. Here, we present a different design of the biomimetic electrochromic front that corroborates the electronic and ionic conducting nature of deep reduced films. The direct contact PEDOT metal/electrolyte and film/electrolyte was prevented from electrolyte contact until 1 cm far from the metal contact with protecting Parafilm®. The deep reduced PEDOT film supports the flow of high currents promoting reaction induced electrochromic color changes beginning 1 cm far from the metal-polymer electrical <b>contact</b> and <b>advancing,</b> through the reduced film, toward the metal contact.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{experimental}} {{results on the}} behaviour of static and dynamic sessile drops under hypergravity (up to 19 g), obtained at ESA Large Diameter Centrifuge (Noordwijk, The Netherlands). The goal of the experiment is to study {{the effect of the}} gravity on the shape of a static sessile drop and on the dynamic <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle in a growing sessile drop. Seven surfaces with micro- and nano- coatings are used, providing different contact angles (CA) and different contact angle hysteresis (CAH). Distilled deionized water is used as the working liquid. The main variable parameters are: gravity (1 - 19 g); drop volume (1 µl - 1 ml); liquid flow rate (0. 0625 - 64 ml/min); CA (30 - 130 º). The drop shape is visualized from the side {{with the help of the}} Shadow Technique with a resolution of 10 µm/pixel.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} {{tangential}} friction at pin—hole interfaces are appropriately modelled {{for the analysis}} of fasteners in large composite (orthotropic) plate loaded along its edges. The pin—hole contact could be of interference, clearance or neat fit. When the plate load is monotonically increased, interference fits give rise to receding contact, whereas clearance fits result in <b>advancing</b> <b>contact.</b> In either case, the changing contact situations lead to non-linear moving boundary value problems. The neat fit comes out as a special case in which the contact and separation regions are invariant with the applied load level and so the problem remains linear. The description of boundary conditions in the presence of tangential friction, will depend on whether the problem is one of <b>advancing</b> or receding <b>contact,</b> <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> presenting a special problem. A model is developed for the limiting case of a rigid pin and an ideally rough interface (infinitely large friction coefficient). The non-linearity resulting from the continuously varying proportions of contact and separation at the interface, is handled by an “Inverse Formulation” which was successfully applied earlier by the authors for smooth (zero friction) interfacial conditions. The additional difficulty introduced by <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> is handled by adopting a “Marching Solution”. The modelling and the procedure are illustrated in respect of symmetric plate load cases. Numerical results are presented bringing out the effects of interfacial friction and plate orthotropy on load-contact relations and plate stresses...|$|R

The <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle is the maximum stable angle, whereas the receding contact angle is the minimum stable angle.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the ability of}} single and {{multiple}} gas plasmas to improve the solderability of PCB substrates, and hence allow the removal of flux from the soldering process for electronic assemblies has been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} asymmetric electrode plasma chambers allow the use of single gas plasmas for this purpose due to their greater efficiency compared to symmetric systems. It has also been shown that the use of triple gas plasmas results in improved cleaning ability when using symmetric electrode systems. Dynamic contact angle (DCA) analysis was the primary analytical technique used in this work. This technique produces two <b>contact</b> angles, <b>advancing</b> and receding. The <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle determines the surface energy of a solid. It has been shown using Auger analysis that contact angles of approximately 48 deg indicate low levels of hydrocarbon contamination. It has also been shown that plasma cleaning processes giving <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angles of this magnitude result in the ability to solder Hot Air Solder Leveled (HASL) PCB substrates without the use of flux. In addition it has been shown that, whilst it is possible to reduce the <b>advancing</b> <b>contact</b> angle of copper substrates considerably, the reduction is not as great as for HASL substrates. Analytical models of RF plasma chambers have also been reviewed, and these adapted for the plasma chambers used in this work. The experimental work carried out in this research also shows that these models hold true.

This article addresses for Vietnam the questions "how capital constraints affect the performance of family firms" and "how entrepreneurs&# 039; human and social capital interact with capital constraints to leverage entrepreneurial income. " A panel of 1721 firms in 4 years is used. Results are consistent with the resource dependency approach, indicating an adverse effect of capital constraints on firm performance: firms suffering capital constraints perform substantially better, suggesting that they need more capital simply to finance newly recognized profit opportunities. Human capital plays a vital role in relaxing capital constraints and improves the entrepreneurial performance, whereas the effect of social capital stemming from strong ties and weak ties is limited: strong ties bring emotional support and weak ties give nonfinancial benefits from regular and useful business <b>contacts.</b> <b>Advanced</b> econometric analysis tools {{to take into account the}} endogeneity of capital constraints are used to establish relationships among relevant variables...|$|R

The question then arises how the <b>contact</b> line can <b>advance</b> during wetting. Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations we show that the <b>contact</b> line <b>advances</b> by single molecules moving ahead of the contact line through two distinct processes: either moving over or displacing other liquid molecules.

The friction increases significantly as the contact angle decreases, which suggests suggests thermal activation plays a role. We provide a simple model that is consistent with the observations...|$|R
