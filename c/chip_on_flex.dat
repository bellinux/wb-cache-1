40|$|Flexible {{circuits}} for {{cellular phone}} liq-uid crystal display (LCD) and plasmadisplay panel (PDP) demand theproperties of All-Polyimide (also called adhesiveless) flexible laminates to deliver sharp, crisp flawless images. These consumer electronic applications demand flexible circuits with fine pitch for <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (COF) attachment and high-density interconnection capability. All-Polyimide flexible laminates are ideally suited for pro-ducing these dense, high-performance flexi-ble circuits. HIGH GROWTH IN DISPLAYS LCD and PDP displays are {{the fastest growing}} segments of consumer electronics. Explosive growth in the internet and cellular phone wireless networks, along with the requirement of instant communications worldwide, are creating the demand to transmit and display color and text on larger, higher resolution dis-plays for handheld devices. The growth and adoption of HDTV standards, the need for space-saving displays that can hang flat on the wall, and dropping prices are driving the growth of PDP as CRT replacements. The worldwide market for displays today is $ 57. 7 billion with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8 %. The LCD seg-ment is $ 15. 5 billion with a 16 % CAGR. PDP are poised for growth with over 400, 000 dis-plays shipping this year, and a CAGR of 56 % {{over the next five}} years assuming prices con-tinue to drop. 1 <b>CHIP</b> <b>ON</b> <b>FLEX</b> (COF) Technology to handle more graphics in smaller and lighter handheld devices requires the placement of driver integrated circuits close to the LCD display to obtain high screen refresh speeds and resolution. Conventional adhesive based copper clad laminate (CCL) circuits utilizing TAB, and TAB plus flexible printed circuits (FPC) are thick, not flexible, and do not allow for component attachment. Therefore conventional circuits require addi-tional connection (TAB + FPC), and do not allow for easy installation into small cell phone cases. LIMITATIONS OF (TAB) LCD DRIVE...|$|E
40|$|Flip chip {{attachments}} {{provide the}} highest interconnection density possible, which makes this technology very attractive {{for use with}} liquid crystal display (LCD) packaging methods. This technology stimulated {{the development of new}} interconnection techniques, such as anisotropic adhesives. However, several factors have hindered the wide use of this technology. These factors include the availability and costs of bumped wafers. IZM and TU-Berlin have addressed both of these concerns by establishing a wafer-bumping facility which uses electroless nickel bumps. The combination of anisotropic adhesives and electroless nickel bumps has the potential for a low-cost chip on glass (COG) and <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (COF) bonding technology.

40|$|Abstract − In this study, some {{characteristics}} of conductive and non-conductive adhesive inter-connections are derived, {{based on data}} from literature and own projects. Assembly of flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> is taken as a carrier. Potential failure mechanisms of adhesive interconnections reported in literature are reviewed. Some methods {{that can be used to}} evaluate the quality of adhesive inter-connections and to evaluate their aging behavior are given. Possible finite element simulation approaches are introduced and the required critical materials properties are summarized. Response to temperature and moisture, resistance to reflow soldering and resistance to rapid change in temperature and humidity are elaborated. The effect of post cure during accelerated testing is discussed. This study shows that only a combined approach using finite element simulations, and use of appropriate experimental evaluation methods can result in revealing, understanding and quantifying the complex degradation mechanisms of adhesive interconnections during aging.

40|$|In flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (FCOF) technology, the {{flexible}} substrate and the assembly process are very {{essential for the}} reliability of solder joints. In the research, fine-pitch solder-bumped chips with various chip sizes were assembled on {{the flexible}} substrates using FCOF technology. The five types of layout designs were evaluated for their effects on the assembly process and reliability of FCOF technology. It was found that appropriate substrate layout designs provided more accurate control of the wetting area because they minimized the misalignment between the copper pad and the solder mask opening. The concept of wetting area error ratio is introduced to evaluate the variation of the wetting area on the various layout designs. The shapes of solder joints formed are also related to the flex designs. Die shear test was performed for the samples of FCOF without underfill materials to study the adhesion strength of the copper pad, the solder mask and the base layer. The rafted samples after thermal cycling and HAST were analyzed using SAM, X-ray imaging system, cross-sectioning, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports, for {{the first}} time, the use of {{endoscopy}} for the nondestructive examination of solder joint integrity in chip scale packages (CSP) such as flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (FCF). Borrowed from the medical instrument technology, the endoscope is used to examine visually the inside of an organ. This concept has now been developed and refined by ERSA and KURTZ, and led to an ERSASCOPE inspection system coupled with sophisticated but user-friendly software for data and image analysis. We have successfully used this endoscopic method to evaluate the solder joint integrity in CSP such as cold joints, standoff height measurements, and probing of inner rows of ball joint integrity. Since this new instrument has only been introduced very recently, we will also report the latest results for obtaining the optimal examination of solder joint integrity achievable in conjunction with ERSA and KURTZ#. By analyzing the many varieties of CSP samples from our EPA Centers clients, we have witnessed the tremendous power of endoscopy when applied to the nondestructive examination of CSPs solder joints, and found this method of immense use to the quality assessment of miniaturized electronic packages. We will also give a critical review of this inspection method when applied to CSP...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of the solder reflow process on the {{reliability}} of anisotropic conductive film (ACF) interconnections for flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (FCOF) applications are investigated. Experiments as well as computer modeling methods have been used. In the experiments, {{it was found that the}} contact resistance of ACF joints increased after the subsequent reflow process, and the magnitude of this increase was strongly correlated to the peak temperature of the reflow profile. Nearly 40 % of the joints were opened (i. e. lifted away from the pad) after the reflow process with 260 °C peak temperature while no opening was observed when the peak temperature was 210 °C. It is believed that the CTE mismatch between the polymer particle and the adhesive matrix is the main cause of this contact degradation. It was also found that the ACF joints after the reflow process with 210 °C peak temperature showed a high ability to resist water absorption under steady state 85 °C/ 85 %RH conditions, probably because the curing degree of the ACF was improved during the reflow process. To give a good understanding, a 3 D model of an ACF joint structure was built and finite element analysis was used to predict the stress distribution in the conductive particles, adhesive matrix and metal pads during the reflow process...|$|E
40|$|Flip chip {{assembly}} on flexible organic substrates {{is facing}} increasing interest. In consumer {{products such as}} mobile phones or pagers, the assembly of the drivers of the LCD displays can be realized this way. Also {{there is a growing}} demand for Chip Size Packages (CSP). As a low cost version, CSPs based on flexible interposers have been developed. Especially for this application the reliability of the assemblies is important. Little is known about the aging behavior of these packages with different solder materials such as Pb-Sn and Au-Sn on standard tape metallizations as Cu-Au or Cu-Ni-Au. The impact of the bumping technology on the reliability is also a subject. Electroplated bumps are studied in comparison with meniscus bumps. Based on electroless Ni bumping, this cost effective technology is especially suited for flip <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> as the solder volume deposited is very small. In order to make useful predictions about the reliability of a metallurgical system it is necessary to understand the basic reactions involved. The scope of the investigations presented in this paper is to gain the data on interdiffusion in these systems, on the formation and growth of intermetallic phases. The impact of the presence of intermetallics and voids on the mechanical reliability is determined. The test program includes annealing of the flip chip assemblies at different temperatures and thermal cycling. Electrical measurements (Daisy chain) and shear tests are performed to determine the electrical and mechanical degradation of the solder joints...|$|E
40|$|Resin-based {{interconnection}} {{materials for}} flip die technologies {{have been widely}} used in manufacturing electronic devices such as flat panel displays and other semiconductor package modules in form of (die) or chip on glass (COG) and (die) or <b>chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>flex</b> (COF) for the last thirty years. Traditionally, these applications used anisotropic conductive film (ACF) which enables lead(Pb) -free assembly, but requires additional handling and laminating steps. The proliferation of flip die technology is evident in many consumer electronic applications such as RFID and mobile phones, where the high throughput rate and lower processing temperature is critical. For many of these emerging applications the traditional anisotropic conductive adhesive (ACA) (mainly ACF) may not be suitable with regard to cure speed and the compatibility with non noble metallization. Customer market studies show there is a requirement for a low temperature, snap cure anisotropic conductive paste (ACP) which can be dispensed, jetted or printed on the substrate prior to the assembly. In this paper, a novel anisotropic conductive paste (ACP) which was formulated and optimized through mixture DOE methods will be discussed. The paper will also analyze the effects of different bonding parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and curing time studied and optimized through factorial DOE methods. The paper will present details on the work life jettability, stencil and screen printing characteristics of this novel ACP. The contact resistance and adhesion strength stability of the ACP to non-noble metal (Cu, Al) in 85 °C/ 85 % RH for greater than 250 hours and 500 hours thermal shock cycles will be discussed.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the {{activities on the}} ''Ultra Miniaturization of RF'' project conducted as part of Sandia's Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program. The objective was to evaluate a multichip module technology known as Microwave <b>Chip</b> <b>on</b> <b>Flex</b> (MCOF) [1], which is a newer form of the standard high density interconnect (HDI) technology originally developed by General Electric and Lockheed Martin [2, 3]. The program was a three-year effort. In the first year, the team focused on understanding the technology and developing a basic design library. In the second year, devices and interconnects used at L, X, and Ku frequency bands were evaluated via a test coupon (with no application specific circuit design). In the third year, we designed, fabricated, and evaluated a specific Ku-band circuit. The circuit design and layout was performed by Sandia, and the module fabrication was performed by Lockheed Martin Government Electronic Systems. In MCOF technology [1], bare die are placed face down on an adhesive backed flex circuit. The first level of the circuit is a pre-patterned titanium copper thin film metal system on a polyimide dielectric material. The complete module is then framed and filled with an epoxy encapsulant. The module is flipped and via holes are laser drilled through subsequent interconnect layers. Each addition layer is adhered {{to the top of}} the module and laser drilling repeated. The baseline design consisted of the original pre-patterned layer plus two additional metal layers. The base of the module is then machined so the heat spreader and frame are planar for a good thermal and electrical connection to the next assembly.
