5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would have to meet high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E

Data was collected by questionnaire. The item validity of instruments was tested by Product MomentCorrelation; and the reliability was tested by Alpha Cronbach. The total sample of 251 was recruited during thestudy. Data analyses applied to test the model matching was Structural Equation Modeling. The result of analysis finds out that Tri Guru affects environmentally sound behavior significantly throughperception about Tri Hita Karana, <b>cultural</b> <b>value,</b> <b>and</b> motivation in greater value than direct effect of Tri Guruon environmentally sound behavior. The Model match test shows that the modified path model have achievedthe criteria of model matching, because matching test indicators achieve minimum cut-off value. Based on these findings, it could be concluded that any changing or variation on environmentally soundbehavior have been directly affected by villagers evaluation on Tri Guru, indirectly affected by perception aboutTri Hita Karana, <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> of environmental care, and motivation to preserve the function of environment. Therefore, when we want to increase environmentally sound behavior of villagers, these factors such as TriGuru, perception, <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> <b>and</b> motivation are necessary {{to be taken into}} account...|$|R

25|$|There {{are various}} types of stories among many {{indigenous}} communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve {{as a means to}} exchange information. These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> lessons. The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the Lakota Tribe of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the White Buffalo Calf Woman, who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the Odawa Tribe, young boys are often told {{the story of a young}} man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{not only}} prehistoric, pre-literate {{cultures}} that can be studied using archaeology but historic, literate cultures as well, through the sub-discipline of historical archaeology. For many literate cultures, such as Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent. In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite classes, such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple. The literacy even of aristocrats has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts. The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace. Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity. Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually {{a small fraction of the}} larger population. Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source. The material record may be closer to a fair representation of society, though it is subject to its own biases, such as sampling bias and differential preservation.|$|E

40|$|Inequality {{has become}} {{essential}} to understanding contemporary British society {{and is at}} the forefront of media, political and practice discussions of the future of the arts in the UK. Whilst there is a wealth of work on traditional areas of inequality, such as those associated with income or gender, the relationship between culture, specifically <b>cultural</b> <b>value,</b> <b>and</b> inequality is comparatively under-researched. The literature review considers inequality <b>and</b> <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> from two points of view: how <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> is consumed <b>and</b> how it is produced. The review argues that these two activities are absolutely essential to understanding the relationship between culture and social inequality, but that the two activities have traditionally been considered separately in both academic research and public policy. The review concentrates on the ‘big three’ issues of inequality – race, class and gender, where most of the literature is to be found, but also touches on disability, sexuality and spatial inequality. All of the research reviewed suggests an undeniable connection between <b>cultural</b> <b>value</b> <b>and</b> inequality. Understanding that connection is currently impeded by problems with data. The report suggests the political saliency of this topic means that public policy must do more to provide robust research, particularly about cultural production...|$|R

500|$|Since the 1970s Wintjiya {{had created}} {{artefacts}} such as ininti seed necklaces, mats and baskets, using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of spinifex grass. When {{the women of}} Kintore, including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya, started creating canvasses, their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers (who had been painting for some years). Wintjiya's first efforts were collaborative, {{as one of a}} group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women's Centre walls in 1992. She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce [...] "a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group's shared Dreamings" [...] (dreamings are stories used to pass [...] "important knowledge, <b>cultural</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> belief systems" [...] from generation to generation). Twenty-five women were involved in planning the works, which included three canvases that were [...] square, as well as two that were Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations. Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision. As was the case for Makinti Napanangka, an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya's compositions. Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed: Johnson suggests 1999, but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi, who worked closely with the women, states that it was 1994. In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore, but in 2008 they were working from their home: [...] "the widows' camp outside her 'son' Turkey Tolson's former residence".|$|E
500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial identity development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' <b>cultural</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] These kind of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, who have come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.|$|E

Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while camping, or when listening to the stories of another culture as a tourist. [...] "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels." [...] Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed [...] "toward variety". Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and games are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as running and jumping) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that pole vaulting [...] "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle." [...] The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as ash, hickory or hazel; [...] in the 19th century bamboo was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of carbon fibre. Other activities, such as walking on stilts, are still seen in circus performances in the 21st century. Gladiatorial combats, also known as [...] "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.|$|E
