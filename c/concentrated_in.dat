40|$|We {{develop a}} two-country model where firms choose {{locations}} of R&D activities {{and production of}} R&D intensive goods. Plant-specific fixed costs and transaction costs associated with cross-border trade generate a home-market effect that tends to attract production of R&D intensive goods to the larger country. At the same time, knowl-edge spillovers associated with R&D activities create a tendency for R&D activities to <b>concentrate</b> <b>in</b> one region. We show that without knowledge spillovers R&D activities <b>concentrate</b> <b>in</b> the smaller coun-try for a certain range of intermediate trade costs. However, {{in the presence of}} weak to intermediate level of spillovers R&D activities tend to <b>concentrate</b> <b>in</b> the larger country even {{in the presence of a}} strong home market effect in production of the technological goods.
