5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. <b>coccus,</b> from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus lactis organisms {{grown in}} a glucose-containing medium pH {{maintained}} at pH 6. 8 (neutral <b>cocci)</b> contained three- to seven-fold more nisin/unit dry weight than <b>cocci</b> {{grown in the}} same medium without pH control (acid <b>cocci,</b> terminal pH 4. 2). After chemical fractionation of acid <b>cocci</b> 57 % of the nisin {{was found in the}} fraction soluble in aqueous ethanol and 36 yo in a trypsin-insoluble residue. After fractionation of broken <b>cocci</b> (acid and neutral) by differential centrifugation up to 60 % of the nisin was found in the 10, 000 g sediment (walls). Nisin was also present in the 30, 000 g sediment (membranes) and the IOO,OOO g sediment (ribosomes). The major difference between acid and neutral <b>cocci</b> was in the ~oo,ooog supernatant fluid (cell sap); cell sap from neutral <b>cocci</b> was 0. 28 % nisin whereas that from acid <b>cocci</b> was 0. 04 % nisin. Analysis of the cell wall indicated that it was com-posed of mucopeptide and polysaccharide. Teichoic acid could not be ex-tracted. The polysaccharide was soluble in hot formamide and accounted for one-third of the dry weight of the wall; it contained rhamnose, galactose, glucose, glucosamine in the molar ratio of 5 : I: I: I.

They have been widely introduced to many regions where their host cacti also grow. About 200 species of Opuntia cacti are known, {{and while it is}} possible to cultivate cochineal on almost all of them, the most common is Opuntia ficus-indica. D. <b>coccus</b> has only been noted on Opuntia species, including O. amyclaea, O. atropes, O. cantabrigiensis, O. brasilienis, O. ficus-indica, O. fuliginosa, O. jaliscana, O. leucotricha, O. lindheimeri, O. microdasys, O. megacantha, O. pilifera, O. robusta, O. sarca, O. schikendantzii, O. stricta, O. streptacantha, and O. tomentosa.

40|$|Summary. The {{preformed}} (constitutive) enzyme {{profiles of}} 30 type strains and reference strains of gram-positive anaerobic <b>cocci</b> were determined with two commercial systems, RapID ANA and a prototype system from API. Both systems identified Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Ps. asaccharolyticus, Ps. indolicus, Ps. magnus and Ps. micros accurately, {{except for one}} strain of Ps. magnus misidentified as Ps. micros by the RapID ANA system. The indole-negative, butyrate-producing <b>cocci</b> (classified at present as Ps. prevotii and Ps. tetradius) produced several different, unique patterns with the prototype API system, but the results with RapID ANA were often misleading. Eight strains of Hare group <b>cocci</b> produced previously described profiles. Four strains of streptococci produced profiles easily distinguished {{from those of the}} gram-positive anaerobic <b>cocci.</b> We conclude that most gram-positive anaerobic <b>cocci</b> can be identified rapidly and reliably to the species level by their preformed enzyme profiles, providing that their underlying classification is sound. Problems were encountered with the butyrate-producing <b>cocci,</b> which appear to be a more heterogeneous group of organisms than is currently acknowledged; further taxonomic studies on these organisms are required...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{examine whether}} Gram {{staining}} {{can influence the}} choice of antibiotic {{for the treatment of}} peritonsillar abscess. Methods. Between 2005 and 2009, a total of 57 cases of peritonsillar abscess were analyzed with regard to cultured bacteria and Gram staining. Results. Only aerobes were cultured in 16 % of cases, and only anaerobes were cultured in 51 % of cases. Mixed growth of aerobes and anaerobes was observed in 21 % of cases. The cultured bacteria were mainly aerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Gram-positive <b>cocci,</b> and anaerobic Gram-negative rods. Phagocytosis of bacteria on Gram staining was observed in 9 cases. The bacteria cultured from these cases were aerobic Streptococcus, anaerobic Gram-positive <b>cocci,</b> and anaerobic Gram-negative rods. The sensitivity of Gram staining for the Gram-positive <b>cocci</b> and Gram-negative rods was 90 % and 64 %, respectively. The specificity of Gram staining for the Gram-positive <b>cocci</b> and Gram-negative rods was 62 % and 76 %, respectively. Most of the Gram-positive <b>cocci</b> were sensitive to penicillin, but some of anaerobic Gram-negative rods were resistant to penicillin. Conclusion. When Gram staining shows only Gram-positive <b>cocci,</b> penicillin is the treatment of choice. In other cases, antibiotics effective for the penicillin-resistant organisms should be used...|$|R

500|$|Cochineal (Dactylopius <b>coccus)</b> is a {{scale insect}} of Central and North America {{from which the}} crimson-coloured dye carmine is derived. It {{was used by the}} Aztec and Maya peoples. Moctezuma in the 15th century {{collected}} tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire cochineal began to be exported to Spain, and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India. [...] During the colonial period the production of cochineal (in Spanish, grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second most valued export after silver. Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when mordanted with tin; thus cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced kermes dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century.|$|E

40|$|Intradermal {{skin test}} {{reactivity}} to spherulin and coccidioidin and in vitro spherulin-induced lymphocyte transformation {{were used to}} assess cellular immunity in healthy subjects and patients with acute, self-limited coccidioidomycosis (<b>cocci).</b> The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relative sensitivities of the two assays in assessing cellular immunity to <b>cocci,</b> especially in long-term residents of an endemic area (Tucson) and, based on data from both assays, determine the prevalence of detectable cellular immunity to <b>cocci</b> in this highly endemic area. The lymphocyte transformation assay appeared to be more sensitive than the skin test in assessing long-term immune status, and the prevalence of detectable immunity to <b>cocci</b> in this highly endemic area was only 75 % in long-term residents. This is much lower than previous prevalence estimates (90 %) in other endemic areas. The absence of a demonstrable cell-mediated immunity may indicate either no prior antigen exposure (infection) or previous remote exposure with a diminished immune response (no reexposure to boost immunity). A possible explanation for the lower prevalence of immunity to <b>cocci</b> in this endemic area may relate to the increased urbanization of the Southwest in the past several years. Therefore, the clinical suspicion of acute <b>cocci</b> should not be restricted to recent arrivals to endemic areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{precipitin}} {{classification of}} Group A streptococci {{depends upon the}} M antigens which are considered serologically specific {{for each of the}} many types. These protein antigens are located in the cell wall of the <b>cocci</b> where they function as virulence factors, along with the hyaluronate capsule to some extent, by enabling the <b>cocci</b> to resist phagocytosis and intracellular destruction. As a consequence, the <b>cocci</b> are able to multiply freely in the extracellular fluid of tissues. M antigens can be recognized in precipitin tests with specific M antisera and extracts of the <b>cocci</b> (1), by the long chain reaction (2), or in mouse protection or bactericidal tests (3, 4), in which M antibodies inhibit multiplication of <b>cocci</b> by promoting their phagocytosis. It is on such interaction of M antigen and its antibody that type-specific protection from infection by these organisms depends.

Spiral bacteria combine some of the characteristics cocci (small footprints) and of filaments (more surface area on which shear forces can act) {{and the ability to}} form an unbroken set of cells to build biofilms.
