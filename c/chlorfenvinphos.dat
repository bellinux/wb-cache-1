50|$|<b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> is {{produced}} by reaction of triethylphosphite (P(OEt)3) with 2,2,2,4-tetrachloro acetophenone (C8H4Cl4O). In the production process, both the Z and E isomers are formed in a ratio (Z:E) of 8.5:1. The technical grade material therefore contains over 92% <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, {{the use of}} <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> has {{now been}} banned in the European Union and in the United States. In Europe it is banned as a plant {{protection}} product. An exception is Switzerland, where <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> is still allowed for use in crops and certain vegetables under the brand name Birlane®. In Australia, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> is partially banned. Thus, it was withdrawn in alfalfa, potatoes and mushrooms, while it is still used in veterinary medicine for combating ectoparasites until 2013.|$|E
50|$|The pure {{chemical}} is a colorless solid, but {{for commercial}} purposes, {{it is often}} marketed as an amber liquid. The insecticides, mostly used in liquid form, contain between 50% and 90% <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b> The substance easily mixes with acetone, ethanol, and propylene glycol. Furthermore, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> is corrosive to metal and hydrolyzes in the environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the United States in 1963, by the Shell International Chemical Company Ltd., Ciba AG (now Ciba-Geigy AG) and by Allied Chemical Corporation. Its main use was as an insecticide and acaricide used to control insect pests on livestock and household pests such as flies, fleas, and mites. Since its first application, many manufacturers included <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> in their products. Some common trade names are Birlane®, Dermaton®, Sapercon®, Steladone®, and Supona®. Since 1991, however, information on current production of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> has been conflicting. One source lists base producers of the compound as the American Cyanamid Company. However, no producers of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> were identified in a 1993 Directory of Chemical Producers for the United States of America. Moreover, {{there have been no}} registered uses for this compound as a pesticide in the United States since 1995.|$|E
50|$|Dermaton® was {{the first}} {{registered}} product containing <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b> It {{was introduced in the}} United States in 1963 and was used as an insecticide and acaricide for controlling fleas and ticks on domestic pets and other animals. Between 1963 and 1970, additional uses were registered, including the use as fly spray, surface spray and larvicide. Because of these effects, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> was often used on farms to control adult flies in dairy barns, milk rooms, poultry houses and yards and other animal buildings. Furthermore, it was used to control larval flies in manure storage pits and piles and other refuse accumulation areas around dairies and feedlots. In the early 1980s, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> was registered for additional uses in a dust formulation for use in dog kennels and in dog collars for the control of fleas and ticks. Outside the United States, <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> registered under the trade names Birlane®, C8949, CGA 26351, Sapecron®, Steladone® and Supona®, was used as a soil insecticide for controlling root maggots, root worms and cutworms. <b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> was also used against Colorado beetles on potatoes and scale insects and mite eggs one\ citrus. Furthermore, the compound had the same uses as in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, no data is {{available}} in the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) database on total environment releases of this compound from facilities. This is mainly because <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> was not considered a dangerous toxin until the early 1990s. Therefore, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> {{is not one of the}} compounds about which facilities were required to report to the Toxic Release Inventory.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method to}} assess <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> {{exposure}} is {{to measure the}} activity of cholinesterases in the blood. Two pools of cholinesterases exist in the blood: acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes and pseudocholinesterase in plasma. The acetylcholinesterase in erythrocytes {{is identical to the}} acetylcholinesterase found in neuromuscular tissue. The function of plasma pseudocholinesterase is unknown, but its activity {{is considered to be a}} more sensitive biomarker for organophosphate exposure than erythrocyte cholinesterase activity. The inhibition of the individual cholinesterases or the inhibition of their combined activity can be used as a marker of exposure. However, cholinesterase inhibition is caused by all anticholinesterase compounds and is therefore not a specific biomarker for <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b> In addition, the activity of cholinesterases in the blood varies in populations and there are no studies which have measured a correlation between <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> exposure and cholinesterase inhibition. There have been suggestions that <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> or its metabolites would be a better biomarker of exposure than its cholinesterase activity inhibition.|$|E
50|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> is primarily caused by its inhibition of cholinesterase activity. <b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> reacts with the acetylcholine binding sites of enzymes that hydrolyze acetylcholine, thereby preventing their catalysis of this reaction. The reaction {{itself is a}} phosphorylation, which is reversible. The phosphorylated enzymes can undergo conformational changes and additional reactions however, which prevent the dephosporylation. This “aging” results in irreversible inhibition of the cholinesterase.|$|E
5000|$|The acute {{toxicity}} of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> varies widely between species. Oral LD50 values range from 9.6-39 mg/kg in rats to >12,000 mg/kg in dogs.Though no direct {{data on the}} {{acute toxicity}} in humans is available, an in vitro study of the detoxification of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> has shown that human liver enzymes were almost as effective as those of rabbits, who have an oral LD50 of 412-4,700 mg/kg., ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> is {{the common}} name of an organophosphorus {{compound}} that was widely used as an insecticide and an acaricide. The molecule itself {{can be described as}} an enol ester derived from dichloroacetophenone and diethylphosphonic acid. <b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> has been included in many products since its first use in 1963. However, because of its toxic effect as a cholinesterase inhibitor it has been banned in several countries, including the United States and the European Union. Its use in the United States was cancelled in 1991.|$|E
5000|$|Ingestion of <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> {{either by}} {{accident}} or through suicidal intent, {{can be treated}} as with other acute organophosphate poisonings. This includes a combination of three approaches: ...|$|E
50|$|Once absorbed, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> {{is widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the body, and has been detected {{in a variety of}} bodily fluids. However, as an organophosphorus compound, it does not accumulate well in tissues.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chlorfenvinphos</b> is most {{commonly}} {{absorbed into the}} body through either ingestion of food products that have been treated with the pesticide, or through dermal absorption, though the latter is much less efficient.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} with analysis of reductions in cholinesterase {{activity in the}} blood, symptoms of organophosphate poisoning {{can be used to}} identify victims of organophosphate poisoning. These symptoms are not specific for <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> but for anticholinesterase compounds in general.|$|E
50|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> {{has been observed}} to decrease plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase activity in humans. No significant genotoxicity, carcinogenicity or teratogenicity has been reported. On {{the basis of a}} NOAEL of 0.05 mg/kg observed in rats, an acceptable daily intake for humans of 0.0005 mg/kg has been established.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> {{is one of}} the {{chemicals}} regulated under “The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know act of 1986”. This means that owners and operators of certain facilities that manufacture, import, process or otherwise use the chemical, are obligated to report their annual release of the chemical to any environmental media.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{quantitative}} {{information on the}} total volume of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> really used as a pesticide in the United States or elsewhere. Since all uses of the chemical in the United States were canceled in 1991, use {{is likely to have}} declined, although there are no data showing this trend.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first and}} most {{important}} step of metabolism of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> in humans is accomplished by the enzyme cytochrome P450 in liver microsomes. This enzyme facilitates oxidative dealkylation of the compound to acetaldehyde and 2-chloro-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl) vinylethylhydrogen phosphate, the latter of which quickly breaks down to acetophenone. Acetophenone is then reduced to an alcohol and conjugated by glutathione transferases., ...|$|E
50|$|No {{international}} regulations {{exist for the}} use of <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> although standards and guidelines have been set to protect people from the possible harmful effects of the toxin. No regulation exists for inhalation exposure, but multiple minimal risk levels (MRL) have been estimated for oral exposure. These data have been developed from lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAEL) in test rats, based on adverse neurological effects. The acute oral MRL has been established at 0.002 mg/kg/day, while the chronic MRL has been established somewhat lower, at 0.0007 mg/kg/day.|$|E
50|$|Acetylcholine is a {{neurotransmitter}} in {{the nervous}} system, it targets muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and receptors {{in the central}} nervous system. These receptors are used to pass on an action potential across the synaptic cleft between neurons. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase enzymes results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at its receptors. This leads to continuous or excessive stimulation of neurons that respond to acetylcholine. Cholinergic poisoning leads to different symptoms, depending {{on the part of}} the nervous system that is affected. The most likely cause of death in <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> is respiratory failure due to paralysis and bronchoconstriction.|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{chemical}} pesticides specific for ticks (acaricides) {{are suspended}} {{in water for}} application to the hair coat of domestic animals. Cattle can be immersed in dip-baths containing dipwash, or soaked using a pressurized spray-race made of metal tubing and nozzles. Sheep can be treated in smaller dips or showers. Acaricides {{can be applied to}} dogs in watery shampoo formulations. Acaricide-active ingredients are usually soluble in oil. This makes them suitable for concentrated oily formulations which spread from a pour-on applicator over the hair coat. Alternatively, some acaricides are incorporated in polyvinylchoride plastic ear tags for cattle, or collars for dogs. 7 Modern acaricides belong to the general classes of organophosphates (example <b>chlorfenvinphos),</b> formamidines (example amitraz), synthetic pyrethroids (example flumethrin), phenylpyrazoles (example fipronil), and benzylphenyl ureas (example fluazuron). 2 When correctly applied, they can be highly effective. Problems with acaricides are: danger of acute poisoning of treated animals and human staff; residues contaminating meat and milk; environmental contamination especially water sources; resistance that ticks acquire to acaricides; and cost of application. Cost and contamination can be reduced by seasonal timing of application (strategic treatment) based on ecological knowledge. Prediction of best times for treatment can be made using computerized models of the population dynamics of ticks. Farmers lacking sufficient cash to purchase manufactured synthetic acaricides often use various herbal treatments, locally available. Nicotine as treated tobacco leaf is an example, but such unregistered preparations require careful use to avoid poisoning or skin damage.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> administered at a single dose of 0. 02 LD 50 on the activity of serum of liver damage indicatory enzymes, such as β-glucoronidase (BGR), acid phosphatase (AcP) and alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST), as well as on the ac-tivities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in erythrocytes and liver. The animals were divided into two groups: the control group, which received oil, and the experimental groups, which received oil solution of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> at a dose of 0. 02 LD 50. After 1, 24 and 48 hours of intoxication with <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> the blood samples were collected and livers were quickly removed. This study indicates that acute intoxication with <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> administered at a dose of 0. 02 LD 50 leads to liver function disturbances, which is a likely result of increased generation of reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of the larval {{offspring of}} engorged female Boophilus decoloratus, {{and of the}} engorged females, collected from cattle on the dairy farms Brycedale, Sunny Grove and Welgevind in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, was tested against the acaricides amitraz, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and cypermethrin. Resistance was determined {{by means of the}} Shaw Larval Immersion Test (SLIT) for larvae and the Reproductive Estimate Test (RET) and Egg Laying Test (ELT) for adults. At Brycedale the tests all indicated resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> and RET and ELT indicated resistance to amitraz and emerging resistance to cypermethrin. At Sunny Grove, B. decoloratus was resistant to cypermethrin using SLIT and exhibited emerging resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> with SLIT and to cypermethrin with both RET and ELT. At Welgevind, resistance was recorded against <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> (SLIT) and against cypermethrin (ELT), and emerging resistance against permethrin (RET).

40|$|Cauliflower crops {{were grown}} in several regions and seasons (spring and summer). Five days after planting, the plants were treated against the root fly by pouring onto soil around the plant stem an {{emulsion}} of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> [2 -chloro- 1 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) ethenyl diethyl phosphate] in water. The fields {{were divided into}} plots. Onto each plot, one of the organic fertilizers, city refuse compost, mushroom cultivation compost, or cow manure was applied {{at the rate of}} 100 tons/ha, 1 or 3. 5 months before the insecticide treatment. There were also control plots which were not treated with any of the organic fertilizers. During the first 50 days crop period which followed the insecticide treatment, the <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> soil concentrations were always greater in the organic fertilizer-treated plots, than in the untreated ones (controls). The intensity of the organic fertilizers effect as to the increase of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> soil persistence was in the following increasing order: city refuse compost < cow manure < mushroom cultivation compost. The organic fertilizer effects were greater when they had been soil-incorporated 3. 5 months-instead of 1 month-before the <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> soil treatment. The increase of the insecticide soil concentrations-due to the organic fertilizers treatments-should increase the plant protection efficiency during the period of the first 50 days, during which time the young plants are the most sensitive to insects. During the following period of the 2 or 3 last crop weeks, the effects of the organic fertilizers onto the rate of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> soil metabolism were levelled off; at harvest, the very low soil-resting residues were similar in the organic fertilizers treated and untreated plots.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the extent of acaricide resistance in the eastern region of the Eastern Cape Province 1 -, 2 - and 3 -host ticks were collected from cattle at 59 dip-tanks over a period of 2 years. These ticks were tested for resistance against 3 compounds, namely amitraz, cypermethrin and <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b> The Shaw Larval Immersion Test detected emerging resistance to amitraz in Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus at 2 dip-tanks and resistance at a 3 rd. It also revealed resistance in this tick to cypermethrin at 1 dip-tank and emerging resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> at 8 dip-tanks and resistance at 2.

40|$|The NORMTOX model {{predicts the}} lifetime-averaged {{exposure}} to contaminants through multiple environmental media, that is, food, air, soil, drinking and surface water. The model {{was developed to}} test the coherence of Dutch environmental quality objectives (EQOs). A set of EQOs is called coherent if simultaneous exposure to different environmental media that are all polluted up to their respective EQOs does not result in exceeding the acceptable or tolerable daily intake (ADI or TDI). Aim {{of the present study}} is to separate the impact of uncertainty and interindividual variability in coherence predictions with the NORMTOX model. The method is illustrated in a case study for <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> mercury and nitrate. First, ANOVA was used to calculate interindividual variability in input parameters. Second, nested Monte Carlo simulation was used to propagate uncertainty and interindividual variability separately. Lifetime-averaged exposure to <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> mercury and nitrate was modeled for the Dutch population. Output distributions specified the population fraction at risk, due to a particular exposure, and the reliability of this risk. From the case study, it was obtained that at lifelong exposure to all media polluted up to their standard, 100 % of the Dutch population exceeds the ADI for <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> 15 % for mercury and 0 % for nitrate. Variance in exposure to <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> mercury and nitrate is mostly caused by interindividual variability instead of true uncertainty. It is concluded that the likelihood that ADIs of <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and mercury will be exceeded should be further explored. If exceeding is likely, decision makers should focus on identification of high-risk subpopulations, rather than on additional research to obtain more accurate estimates for particular parameters...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the acaricidal effects of three organophosphorous pesticides, <b>chlorfenvinphos,</b> diazinon and coumaphos as Steladone®, Asuntol® and Diazintol®, respectively. They were evaluated on different stages of Amblyomma variegatum (unfed nymphs, unfed adults and fed adults) using Shaw’s bioassay method. Three concentrations of each acaricides (within the recommendation) were tested on all the ticks’ stages. The highest mortality rate was observed in <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> treatments in all the stages and concentrations tested while diazinon produced the least effect. At the highest concentrations, all the acaricides produced high mortality rates but at the lowest concentration, diazinon was not effective. Generally, the acaricidal effects were concentration-dependent and the least mortality was recorded in the fed adult stage, depicting the possibility of blood and its constituent’s antagonistic interaction with the acaricide. The outcome of this study suggests that <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and coumaphos could be used interchangeably because of the equivalence in their acaricidal effects.

40|$|Tick {{resistance}} to acaricides {{is an increasing}} problem in South Africa and poses a real economic threat to the livestock and veterinary pharmaceutical industries. New acaricides are extremely expensive to develop so the present acaricides {{should be seen as}} an ever-diminishing resource, which should be protected by all means possible. The main objective {{of the study was to}} detect the levels of tick {{resistance to}} acaricides at selected commercial and communal farms in South Africa. Also to compare the in vitro adult and larval test methods and to investigate acaricide management strategies which may increase the lifespan of the presently used acaricides. To meet these objectives a field survey (February 2000 to August 2001) was carried out at selected communal and commercial farms in the Eastern Cape and Northwest Provinces of South Africa to monitor levels of field tick resistance to acaricides. The larvae were originally obtained from engorged female A. hebraeum, B. decoloratus, R. appendiculatus and R. evertsi evertsi. The larvae were tested against different concentrations of amitraz, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and cypermethrin using the Shaw Larval Immersion Test (SLIT). Mortality dose data were subjected to probit analysis using a BMDP statistical package. Factors of resistance (FOR) were calculated by comparing the larval response of ticks from the field, which had been exposed to acaricides, with baseline data from very susceptible laboratory strains of ticks, on the basis of the LC 50 values. On the communal farms high levels of tick resistance were detected to cypermethrin as well as partial resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> whilst no resistance was detected against amitraz. On the commercial farms, however, ticks were equally resistant to amitraz, cypermethrin and <b>chlorfenvinphos.</b> The populations of B. decoloratus on these farms had developed higher levels of resistance to the test acaricides than the equivalent R. evertsi evertsi, R. appendiculatus and A. hebraeum populations. Higher levels of tick resistance to amitraz was observed on commercial farms than on communal farms, however, there was no significant differences in tick resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and cypermethrin at both the commercial and communal farms. It was surmised that inappropriate use of acaricides might have resulted in higher tick resistance to the currently available acaricides on the commercial as well as the communal farms. Correct acaricide usage may solve this problem to a limited extent. Comparative in vitro tests were also carried out on the larvae and adults of B. decoloratus to determine the susceptibility of this tick to different concentrations of the currently used acaricides, (amitraz, <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and cypermethrin) at three commercial dairy farms, (“Brycedale”, “Sunny Grove” and “Welgevind”) near East London in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Resistance of field strains of B. decoloratus were determined using the SLIT and the Adult Immersion Test (AIT) as the latter test took into account factors such as oviposition assessment and reproductive ability. At “Brycedale”, resistance to amitraz and <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> was detected with the AIT method. Emerging resistance to amitraz and resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> were also detected at “Brycedale” with the SLIT method. At “Sunny Grove” resistance was detected to cypermethrin and at “Welgevind” resistance was detected to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> with the SLIT whilst no resistance was detected using AIT. It would appear that the B. decoloratus populations tested on these dairy farms were more resistant to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> than to amitraz or cypermethrin. Variable results were obtained using the SLIT, the Reproductive Estimate Test (RET) and the Egg laying Test (ELT). Nearly 50 % of the dairy farms sampled showed resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and the majority had susceptible B. decoloratus populations to both amitraz and cypermethrin. “Brycedale” had a serious resistance problem whilst “Sunny Grove” and “Welgevind” dairies had much less resistance problems. At “Brycedale”, the SLIT, RET and ELT methods all recorded resistance to amitraz and <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> whilst cypermethrin resistance was also detected with the ELT. At “Sunny Grove”, the SLIT detected emerging resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and resistance to cypermethrin while the other two test methods were negative. At “Welgevind” the SLIT detected resistance to <b>chlorfenvinphos</b> and the ELT resistance to cypermethrin whilst the RET did not detect any resistance at “Welgevind”. In general there was a good correlation between the RET and the ELT whilst in many cases there was poor correlation between the SLIT and the two AIT methods (RET and ELT). From this study it would appear that the ELT was a good method to detect resistance within seven days, as opposed to the 42 days required for the RET and the 60 days for the SLIT. The ELT and the RET could possibly be used as screening methods to detect acaricide resistance on farms whilst the SLIT would remain the test of choice for National surveys. In addition the ELT is less costly and does not require sophisticated equipment for field testing for resistance, compared with other in vitro test methods. This method, however, still needs to be validated and standardized for use in South Africa and the rest of Africa where tick control is important.
