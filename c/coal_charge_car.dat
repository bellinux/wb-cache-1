5000|$|The {{prepared}} <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> in the <b>coal</b> {{tower is}} drawn by a <b>charging</b> <b>car</b> {{on the top}} of the batteries and charged into the ovens as per sequence. The <b>charged</b> <b>coal</b> is gradually heated by the heating wall of the oven in the absence of air to attain a temperature of 1000°-1050 °C at the central axis of the coke mass toward the end of coking period. the coking period is generally specified between 16 hrs and 19 hrs depending on oven condition and production requirement. the volatile matter of coal liberated during carbonization is collected in gas collecting mains in the form of raw coke oven gas passing through stand pipes and direct contact cooling with ammonia liquor spray. The gas cooled from 800 °C is drawn to coal chemical plant by exhauster. The residual coke is pushed out of the oven by pusher car through a guide into coke bucket. The red hot coke is taken to coke dry cooling plant for cooling.There are 4 batteries, each having 67 ovens each. Each oven can hold 32 tons of dry <b>coal</b> <b>charge.</b> The volumetric capacity of each oven is 41.6 cum the heat for carbonation is supplied by under firing of coke oven gas having CV of 4200 Kcal/Nm3 of mixture of BF gas & CO gas having 900 Kcal/Nm3. The heating system of batteries is of under jet, compound type having twin-heating flues with re-circulation of waste gases.its ...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{an important}} issue in wireless sensor networks, since it can provide an emerging and effective solution in the absence of other power supplies. The state-of-the-art methods employ a mobile car and a predefined moving path to charge the sensor nodes in the network. Previous studies only consider a factor of the network (i. e., residual energy of sensor node) as a constraint to design the wireless charging strategy. However, other factors, such as the travelled distance of the mobile car, can also affect the effectiveness of wireless charging strategy. In this work, we study wireless charging strategy based on the analysis of a combination of two factors, including the residual energy of sensor nodes and the travelled distance of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Firstly, we theoretically analyze the limited size of the sensor network to match the capability of a <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Then, the networked factors are selected as the weights of traveling salesman problem (TSP) to design the moving path of the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Thirdly, the <b>charging</b> time of each sensor node is computed based on the linear programming problem for the <b>charging</b> <b>car.</b> Finally, a <b>charging</b> period for the network is studied. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly maximize the lifetime of the wireless sensor network...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{density of}} the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> plays an {{important}} role in the coke quality. The increase of the bulk density usually improves the coke strength due to increased coal particle contact and increased coke density. There are a few possibilities to increase the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> bulk density: adjusting the grain size distribution or moisture content (drying), oil addition and mechanical treatment (e. g., partial briquetting or stamping). A renewed interest in stamp charging cokemaking technology has been observed in recent years, especially in Asia, but also in Europe (Poland, Germany and Ukraine). The paper presents the results of studies on the effects of selected factors on the coal cake density and mechanical strength i. e. stamping energy, coal type, water content and crushing fineness. There is possibility to influence these parameters in industrial conditions. The investigations were carried out with use of mechanical stamping apparatus and strength testing machine specially designed for this purpose...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} on new and innovative solutions, technologies and products {{carried out on}} an industrial scale is the most reliable method of verifying the validity of their implementation. The results obtained in this research method give almost one hundred percent certainty although, at the same time, the {{research on}} an industrial scale requires the expenditure of the highest amount of money. Therefore, this method is not commonly applied in the industrial practices. In {{the case of the}} decision to implement new and innovative technologies, it is reasonable to carry out industrial research, both because of the cognitive values and its economic efficiency. Research on an industrial scale may prevent investment failure as well as lead to an improvement of technologies, which is the source of economic efficiency. In this paper, an evaluation model of economic efficiency of the industrial scale research has been presented. This model is based on the discount method and the decision tree model. A practical application of this proposed evaluation model has been presented based on an example of the <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> pre-drying technology before coke making in a coke oven battery, which may be preceded by industrial scale research on a new type of <b>coal</b> <b>charge</b> dryer...|$|R
