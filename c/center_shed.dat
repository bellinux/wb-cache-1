A bulk {{of the research on}} the issue has focused on Caucasian women. As a result, the body of research may be limited in its generalization to other racial and ethnic groups. This study, therefore, sought to study disordered eating among African-American college women. Two models based on research questions were tested. The first focused on how body mass index (BMI) impacted disordered eating, while the second focused on how the difference between perceived actual and ideal body image impacted disordered eating. Self-esteem was tested as a mediating factor for both models. Data were collected from a total sample of 21 African-American women from a large, private university on the east coast. Findings suggested that African-American college women had high self-esteem and a perceived actual and ideal body image that were similar.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that random {{beamforming}} using partial channel state information (CSI) achieves the same throughput scaling as obtained from dirty paper coding for a broadcast (downlink) channel with M transmit antennas and K users where K is large. In this paper, we apply this scheme to wideband MIMO broadcast channels. By using OFDM, an L-tap wideband channel can be decomposed to N parallel narrowband channels (subcarriers), where N > L. Neighboring subcarriers are highly correlated. Therefore, we consider neighboring subcarriers as a cluster and find the closed form solution for the joint characteristic function of SINR values at two subcarriers in a cluster. We show numerically how the knowledge {{of the quality of the}} <b>center</b> subcarrier <b>sheds</b> light about the quality of other subcarriers in the same cluster, and address the issue of cluster size. In addition, through complex and asymptotic analysis, we show that for cluster size of order N/L√(log K) (for large K), users need only feedback the best SINR at the center subcarrier of each cluster in order for the transmitter to perform opportunistic beamforming and maintain the same throughput scaling as when full CSI is available. Using simulation results, we verify our analytical result and show that even fewer feedback can be tolerated, and larger clusters (N/ 2 L) can be implemented for a small throughput hit...|$|R

Accordingly, the NHC upgraded the depression to Subtropical Storm Otto at 21:00UTC on October6, about 215mi (345km) northeast of Grand Turk.

40|$|Congenital human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) infection causes {{central nervous}} system structural abnormalities and functional disorders, affecting both astroglia and neurons with a pathogenesis that is only marginally understood. To better understand HCMV's interactions with such clinically important cell types, we utilized neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from neonatal autopsy tissue, which can be differentiated down either glial or neuronal pathways. Studies were performed using two viral isolates, Towne (laboratory adapted) and TR (a clinical strain), at a multiplicity of infection of 3. NPCs were fully permissive for both strains, expressing {{the full range of}} viral antigens (Ags) and producing relatively large numbers of infectious virions. NPCs infected with TR showed delayed development of cytopathic effects (CPE) and replication <b>centers</b> and <b>shed</b> less virus. This pattern of delay for TR infections held true for all cell types tested. Differentiation of NPCs was carried out for 21 days to obtain either astroglia (> 95 % GFAP+) or a 1 : 5 mixed neuron/astroglia population (β-tubulin III+/GFAP+). We found that both of these differentiated populations were fully permissive for HCMV infection and produced substantial numbers of infectious virions. Utilizing a difference in plating efficiencies, we were able to enrich the neuron population to ∼ 80 % β-tubulin III+ cells. These β-tubulin III+-enriched populations remained fully permissive for infection but were very slow to develop CPE. These infected enriched neurons survived longer than either NPCs or astroglia, and a small proportion were alive until at least 14 days postinfection. These surviving cells were all β-tubulin III+ and showed viral Ag expression. Surprisingly, some cells still exhibited extended processes, similar to mock-infected neurons. Our findings strongly suggest neurons as reservoirs for HCMV within the developing brain...|$|R

Whereas commuting times are directly available from the CTPP, commuting distances are recovered by GIS network techniques as the shortest-time distances through the urban road network. Explanations of commuting are first attempted by measures of job proximity such as distances from employment centers and a gravity-based index accounting for job competition among workers. The influence of employment <b>centers</b> on commuting <b>sheds</b> new light on polycentric urban models. The variation of commuting distance is well explained by the gravity-based job proximity index. That is to say, how far people commute is explainable {{to a large extent}} by urban land use.

Finally the research demonstrates the promise of explaining commuting times by workers' characteristics such as percentage of black workers, female labor participation ratio, percentage of multiple-worker households, home-ownership status, educational attainment, and wage rate.

Briana Ralston, MS, RN Julie Fairman, PhD, RN, FAAN In the 1960 s and 1970 s, {{neonatal}} {{intensive care}} units (NICUs) became the standard of care for critically ill newborns in hospitals across the United States. Though {{work has been done}} to examine how nurses participated in the development of ICU 2 ̆ 7 s for adult populations, scholarship related to the formation of NICUs is sparse. Using historical methodology to examine hospital archival data, oral history interviews, and scholarly literature, this work examines the roles nurses played in the development of NICUs as technological systems between 1955 and 1982 in the United States. By using the lenses of the history of nursing, the history of technology, and the history of children 2 ̆ 7 s healthcare, this work contributes {{to our understanding of the}} nuanced ways nurses participated in the formation of the NICU - a complex technological system of care - for a vulnerable and medically complicated newborn patient population. The value of newborns as a unique and valued medical population, seen as early the Progressive Era, contributed to the formation of premature infant units and particular nursing care for premature newborns during the first half of the 20 th century. This premature infant care in turn influenced the development of later {{neonatal intensive care}} units and the ways nurses cared for a broader cadre of sick newborns. Hospitals valued the particular care they gave and made decisions about the dedication of spaces where newborns could be grouped together to receive nursing care.

We undertook the absorption line survey of H+ 3 toward the Galactic <b>center</b> sources to <b>shed</b> light on it [1]. The Galactic center sources are ideal line of sight to start the survey since they suffer heavy visual extinction of AV = 25 – 40, the highest in the Galaxy among those obscured by diffuse clouds. The intervening clouds have different radial velocities, and the nature of them have been studied in previous spec-troscopic observations from near-infrared to radio wavelengths. We observed two infrared sources, GCS 3 - 2 in the Quintuplet cluster and GC IRS 3 near Sgr A∗. Both have intrinsically featureless spectra, and sufficiently luminous to provide good continuum fluxes in the 3 µm region. The observations were made in June 2001 using the Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (IRCS; Tokunaga et al. 1998; Kobayashi et al. 2000) at the 8. 2 m Subaru Telescope. Subaru IRCS is equipped with an echelle and a cross-dispersing gratings. The high resolution (R= 20, 000) spectroscopy with wide wavelength coverage is unique characteristic of the instrument.
