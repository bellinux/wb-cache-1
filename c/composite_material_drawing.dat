40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of glass fibers {{used for the}} reinforcement of <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> consistsin <b>drawing</b> a free jet of a molten glass at high temperature into fibers using a winder. This process is sensitive to numerous disturbances that can cause the fiber to break during the drawing process, and thus reduce the process efficiency. The underlying physics of the forming of a single fiber is investigated here through numerical simulations, and results are validated with measurements obtained on a dedicated experimental unit. Both a two-dimensional axisymmetric and a simplified one-dimensional model are used to simulate the high-temperature region before glass transition. The influence of key parameters and physical mechanisms on the internal stress is investigated through a sensitivity analysis. The simplified model is then used to identify the optimal operating window and {{to assess the impact}} of temperature inhomogeneities at the bushing plate. Results show that the initial region close to the tip is critical, and that a low cooling rate reduces the stress. Operating at high tip temperature, large drawing velocity and small tip radius is then found to be the best strategy to minimize the stress. Finally, it is shown that the heat pattern of the bushing plate is one of the most important causes for disturbance in the process. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Combining the {{functionalities}} {{of fiber}} Bragg gratings (FBG) and microstructured optical fibers (MOF) offers promising technological perspectives {{in the field}} of optical fiber sensors. Indeed, MOFs could overcome some of the limitations of FBGs in conventional fibers for sensor applications. The added value of MOFs stems from the ability to design an optical fiber in which an FBG acts as a sensor with a selective sensitivity, e. g. a sensor that is sensitive to directional strain but not to temperature. For this purpose we use a MOF with a phase modal birefringence on the order of 8 × 10 - 3, which is more than the double obtained in conventional birefringent fibers. A FBG in this MOF results in two Bragg peak wavelengths, with a wavelength separation that depends on the phase modal birefringence. We characterize these FBGs for transversal loads on a bare fiber and compare the results with simulated sensitivities. Then, we embed the sensor in a composite coupon and we measure the response of the Bragg peak wavelengths {{as a function of the}} applied transversal pressure on the <b>composite</b> <b>material.</b> This allows <b>drawing</b> conclusions on the advantages of FBGs in MOFs for sensing application...|$|R

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of glass fibers {{used for the}} reinforcement of <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> consists in <b>drawing</b> a glass melt at high temperature through an array of thousands of small orifices (i. e., the bushing plate) into fibers using a winder. This process is sensitive to numerous disturbances that can cause a fiber to break during the drawing process. This paper analyzes how the stress in the fiber depends on the controlling parameters of the process. The approach relies on numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis. Both a semi-analytical one-dimensional model and a more complex two-dimensional axisymmetric model are used. It is first found that radial variations across the fiber are small compared {{to changes in the}} axial direction and that the one-dimensional approximation is accurate enough to describe the major trends in the process. Sensitivity analyses on some physical parameters controlling the heat transfers and on process parameters are then performed to identify strategies to reduce the axial stress. In particular, it is shown that, for a given fiber diameter, the stress is minimized if the glass melt temperature and the drawing velocity are increased. This approach is then applied to quantify the effect of inhomogeneous heat patterns on a bushing plate with a large number of fibers. Peer reviewe...|$|R
