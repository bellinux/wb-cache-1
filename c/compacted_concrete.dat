A modern method is self <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete.</b> By using this type of concrete, advantages like improved working environment and rationalized construction can be reached. Because the concrete doesn’t need to be vibrated, the amount of staff on site and the noise can be reduced. Self <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> {{has been used in}} Sweden for over 10 years, still it only stands for 5 % of the cast in placed concrete in the country. This report deals with, why self <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> isn’t used more often when casting in place within civil engineering. The result is that self <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> with “anläggningscement” (Swedish low heat Portland cement) is a sensitive product because many factors needs to be correct to reach a good result. A reason fore this sensitivity is that the recipe of the concrete has a low tolerance for variations in the different components. Small variations can lead to changes in the consistency which means that the concrete is destroyed and this will result in delay of the delivery to the site. When casting self <b>compacting</b> <b>concrete</b> it’s dependent that the flow of fresh concrete comes continuously, otherwise the concrete can start to cure.
