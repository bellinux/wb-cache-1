40|$|Background: Antibiotic resistance, {{evolving}} {{and spreading}} among bacterial pathogens, poses {{a serious threat}} to human health. Antibiotic use for clinical, veterinary and agricultural practices provides the major selective pressure for emergence and persistence of acquired resistance determinants. However, resistance has also been found in the absence of antibiotic exposure, such as in bacteria from wildlife, raising a question about the mechanisms of emergence and persistence of resistant strains under similar conditions, and the implications for resistance control strategies. Since previous studies yielded some contrasting results, possibly due to differences in the ecological landscapes of the studied wildlife, we further investigated this issue in wildlife from a remote setting of the Galapagos archipelago. Methodology/Principal Findings: Screening for acquired antibiotic resistance was carried out in commensal enterobacteria from <b>Conolophus</b> <b>pallidus,</b> the terrestrial iguana of Isla Santa Fe, where: i) the abiotic conditions ensure to microbes good survival possibilities in the environment; ii) the animal density and their habits favour microbial circulation between individuals; and iii) there is no history of antibiotic exposure and the impact of humans and introduced animal species is minimal except for restricted areas. Results revealed that acquired antibiotic resistance traits were exceedingly rare among bacteria, occurring only as non-dominant strains from an area of minor human impact. Conclusions/Significance: Where both the exposure to antibiotics and the anthropic pressure are minimal, acquire...|$|E
40|$|Three species land iguanas (<b>Conolophus</b> subcristatus, C. <b>pallidus</b> and C. marthae) {{exist in}} the Galápagos. All are endemic to that {{archipelago}} and recognized endangered, as result of direct and indirect human impact on the wildlife of the islands. The recently discovered and described species C. marthae (the pink land iguana from the Galápagos) is {{still waiting for the}} proper assignment to a IUCN risk category, although first available data suggested to include the species in the “critically endangered” species list. Here, we illustrate some possible sources of risk for C. marthae. Some of these are generated by the restricted area of occurrence (about 25 Km 2) and small population size (Nc and Ne). Additional risk is related to the presence, in the area of occurrence, of rats and cats, which prey on eggs and juveniles. The impact of these recently-introduced predators on the recruitment of the population is still unknown, but it could be not negligible as we have observed no pink iguana juvenile so far, since the first field trip in the 2005. Complete eradication of these pests, successful in other islands of the archipelago, is most likely impossible in Isabela, due to the large area of this island. We also consider the possible risk associated with high parasite load observed in C. marthae. In fact, the northern side of volcano Wolf (Isabela island), area of occurrence of C. marthae (WM) and a population of C. subcristatus (WS), hosts a very large population of ticks, feeding on land iguanas and giant tortoises. Ticks are also vectors of the haemoparasite Hepatozoon (Apicomplexa) which, in a haematological survey, we found in the blood of the three species of Galápagos land iguanas. This raised some concern as the infection by this haemoparasite (known in mammal, birds, reptiles and amphibians) may cause anemia or blood cell abnormalities, resulting in reduced juvenile’s survival, immunosuppression, reduction of growth, reduced reproductive fitness. Comparison between values of parasitemia (number of infected individuals) and prevalence (number of parasites per individual) for the two populations of volcano Wolf (WS and WM) shows that C. subcristatus is characterized by a high prevalence and medium parasitemia whereas C. marthae shows very high prevalence and low parasitemia. The analysis of white blood cell count for individuals parasitized shows significant differences in eosinophils and monocytes between WS and WM (that share the same formula) and the other populations. Unexpectedly, however, the altered leucocytic formula observed in WS and WM does not correlate to the presence of Hepatozoon in the blood of iguanas. Thus, data suggest that in volcan Wolf particular environmental factors occur, that causes the same alteration of leucocytic formula in C. subcristatus and C. marthae. These (still unknown) factors might also explain the same pattern of variation of the microbiota (Enterobacteriaceae) observed in WM and WS. This scenario is compatible with the hypothesis of a massive infection by an endoparasite. Furhter investigations are urgently needed to clarify the demographic trend and health status of C. marthae...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{presence}} of acquired resistance traits has been investigated in the wildlife commensal microbiota, {{to better understand the}} ecology and dynamics of antibiotic resistance determinants dissemination. Most of the available data concern mammals and birds from remote or more promiscuous settings. This study was aimed at collecting similar data on commensal bacteria from land iguanas living in a remote and protected environment, free from exposure to the selective pressure related by the use of antimicrobial agents and where close interactions with humans and other animal species are overall minimal. Methods: Cloacal swabs were collected from 96 iguanas in Santa Fè island (<b>Conolophus</b> <b>pallidus)</b> where tourists are restricted to well defined trails for animal viewing and human settlements are not allowed. Coliform bacteria were selected on MacConkey agar to determine the dominant species, and susceptibility to 10 antimicrobials (AMK, AMP, CIP, CHL, GEN, KAN, NAL, TET, STR, SXT) was determined. Non-dominant resistant coliforms were detected by plating swabs onto MacConkey agar and looking for colonies grown inside the zone of inhibition of the antibiotic disks applied directly to the seeded plate. Results: In each animal, the dominant gut microbiota growing on McConkey medium consisted of one or two coliform species which included Escherichia coli in 77 % of animals. In no case the antimicrobial susceptibility profile was suggestive for acquired resistance traits. Non-dominant resistant coliforms were obtained from 82 (85. 4 %) animals (overall, 126 non-duplicated isolates of various species). Of these, only 5 E. coli carried acquired resistance traits to AMP (n= 3), TET + NAL (n= 1), or to all the tested antibiotics but CIP, NAL and AMK (n= 1). blaTEM, Tet A and Tet B were found as acquired resistance genes. Conclusions: Coliforms are normally represented in the gut microbiota of terrestrial iguanas. In this remote and protected natural environment acquired resistance traits were exceedingly rare. This study provides a “zero level” antibiotic resistance basis, which could prove useful also in bioconservation approaches...|$|E
