5000|$|Nearly every {{semi-automatic}} pistol cartridge is “rimless,” or {{more precisely}} has a rim of the same diameter as the <b>case</b> <b>body.</b> An extractor engages this rim by entering a cannelure near {{the base of the}} case. A few designs, known as [...] "semi-rimmed" [...] have a rim that is slightly larger than <b>case</b> <b>body</b> diameter but these function as a rimless design. All such cartridges headspace on the case mouth (although some, such as [...]38 Super, at one time seated on the rim, this was changed for accuracy reasons), which prevents the round from entering too far into the chamber. Some cartridges have a rim that is significantly smaller than <b>case</b> <b>body</b> diameter. These are known as rebated-rim designs, and almost always allow a handgun to fire multiple caliber cartridges with only a barrel and magazine change.|$|E
5000|$|While the Ackley {{cartridge}} uses a 30-degree shoulder {{angle and}} the Hornady is 25 degrees, its longer shoulder is accommodated by Ackley's longer <b>case</b> <b>body.</b> Fireforming will move the Hornady's shoulder {{forward at the}} expense of neck length. [...] Yet there is a final size issue: according to Ackley's Manual, his wildcat cartridge is only [...]289" [...] over the shoulder while the Hornady factory round measures [...]294". This is the reason the Hornady's case capacity is almost identical to that of the Ackley. Since there is five thousands less taper in the <b>case</b> <b>body,</b> the new [...]17 Hornady Hornet cases may not fit an Ackley chamber without full-length resizing.|$|E
50|$|Zalman {{has also}} {{developed}} a completely fanless case. It uses a fin based design to dissipate heat with heat generating components like the graphics card and motherboard transferring heat to the <b>case</b> <b>body</b> via a system of heat pipes and radiators.|$|E
50|$|Death is the {{cessation}} of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include senescence, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. In most <b>cases,</b> <b>bodies</b> of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death.|$|R
50|$|Radiation {{pressure}} is the pressure exerted upon any surface exposed to electromagnetic radiation. Radiation pressure implies {{an interaction between}} electromagnetic radiation and bodies of various types, including clouds of particles or gases. The interactions can be absorption, reflection, or some of both (the common <b>case).</b> <b>Bodies</b> also emit radiation and thereby experience a resulting pressure.|$|R

5000|$|... 7.65×17mm Browning SR (32 ACP): A {{very small}} pistol round. However, {{this was the}} {{predominant}} Police Service Cartridge in Europe until the mid-1970s. The [...] "SR" [...] stands for semi-rimmed, meaning the case rim is slightly larger than <b>case</b> <b>body</b> diameter.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cartridge}} utilizes a rebated rim, sized {{to match}} {{the rim of the}} 7.62×39mm and 6.5mm Grendel rounds. The <b>case</b> <b>body</b> is very similar in dimensions to the [...]500 S&W Magnum revolver cartridge, being slightly longer and fully tapered for automatic feeding in the weapon.|$|E
50|$|Most {{revolver}} cartridges have a rim at {{the base}} of the case that is larger than the <b>case</b> <b>body</b> is and which seats against or into the cylinder block to provide headspace control (to keep the cartridge from moving too far forward in the cylinder chamber) and to provide for easy extraction.|$|E

5000|$|David Lloyd, the [...]244's originator, went on {{to develop}} a still more {{powerful}} prototype round by reducing the <b>case</b> <b>body</b> taper and increasing the already large power capacity to produce the [...] "David Lloyd 6 mm Magnum". His hope was to use bullets heavier than the [...]244 H&H standard but this cartridge was never commercially produced, and only two prototype Lloyd rifles {{are believed to have}} been chambered for it.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{cartridge}} {{invented by}} Leslie Taylor of Westley Richards, a gunmaking firm of Birmingham England in 1909 as a proprietary cartridge for their bolt action rifles. Often {{referred to as}} the [...] "Poor Man's Magnum" [...] the round has the unusual characteristic of having a rebated rim, one that is smaller in diameter than the <b>case</b> <b>body.</b> This allowed it to be used in converted Mauser 98 magazine rifles with a standard (.30-06 size) magazine length and bolt face. The rebated rim also allowed Government Game Officers to use stripper clips for rapid reloads when culling rogue animals.|$|E
5000|$|Each {{cartridge}} in the Ferguson Ace family {{shares the}} same body shape and is necked up and down for calibers from [...]20 to 6.5mm. The <b>case</b> <b>body</b> is longer and wider than the 6mm BR, has a shorter neck and a shoulder angle of 45 degrees which give it approximately 10% more powder capacity than its parent. This allows higher bullet velocities than an unimproved 6mm BR case. An example round recorded 4220fps with a 40 grain V-Max when fired from a 24" [...] pac-nor 1-11" [...] twist barrel. This performance comes {{at the cost of}} the barrel with life expectancy in around 500-600 shots.|$|E

50|$|Concomitantly {{with the}} gun design, a new {{cartridge}} was developed using the standard 45 mm fragmentation shell of the 21-K anti-aircraft gun. (This projectile had a tracer that burned for eleven seconds and was fitted with the MG-8 contact fuse.) The total length of the new cartridge {{was limited to the}} same value as for the NS-37 ammunition—328mm. In order to accommodate the larger shell, the <b>case</b> <b>body</b> (brass) was necked up and also slightly reduced in length from 195 mm of the NS-37 ammunition to 185 mm. The resulting 45 mm cartridge weighted 1.93 kg, of which 1.065 kg was the weight of its shell. The muzzle velocity of the NS-45 was 780 m/s and its rate of fire was around 260-280 rounds per minute.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{cartridge}} specifications include neck size, {{bullet weight}} and caliber, maximum pressure, headspace, overall length, <b>case</b> <b>body</b> diameter and taper, shoulder design, rim type, etc. Generally, every {{characteristic of a}} specific cartridge type is tightly controlled and few types are interchangeable in any way. Exceptions do exist but generally, these are only where a shorter cylindrical rimmed cartridge {{can be used in}} a longer chamber, (e.g., [...]22 Short in [...]22 Long Rifle chamber, and [...]38 Special in a [...]357 Magnum chamber). Centerfire primer type (Boxer or Berdan, see below) is interchangeable, although not in the same case. Deviation in any of these specifications can result in firearm damage and, in some instances, injury or death. Similarly, use of the wrong type of cartridge in any given gun can damage the gun, or cause bodily injury.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, ArmaLite and other U.S. firearm {{designers}} started their individual Small Caliber/High Velocity (SCHV) rifle experiments using the commercial [...]222 Remington cartridge. When {{it became clear}} that there was not enough case capacity to meet U.S. Continental Army Command's (CONARC) velocity and penetration requirements, ArmaLite contacted Remington to create a similar cartridge with a longer <b>case</b> <b>body</b> and shorter neck. This became the [...]222 Special. At the same time, Springfield Armory's Earle Harvey had Remington create an even longer cartridge case then known as the [...]224 Springfield. Springfield was forced {{to drop out of the}} CONARC competition, and thus the [...]224 Springfield was released in 1958 as a commercial sporting cartridge known as the [...]222 Remington Magnum. To prevent confusion among all of the competing [...]222 cartridge designations, the [...]222 Special was renamed the [...]223 Remington in 1959. In the spring of 1962 Remington submitted the specifications of the [...]223 Remington to the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute (SAAMI). With the U.S. military adoption of the M16 assault rifle in 1963, the [...]223 Remington in a slightly derived form was standardized as the 5.56×45mm NATO. As a commercial sporting cartridge the [...]223 Remington was introduced in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{noticeable}} differences between white-tailed and mule deer are {{the size of}} their ears, the color of their tails, and the configuration of their antlers. In many <b>cases,</b> <b>body</b> size is also a key difference. The mule deer's tail is black-tipped whereas the whitetail's is not. Mule deer antlers are bifurcated; they [...] "fork" [...] as they grow, rather than branching from a single main beam, {{as is the case with}} white-tails.|$|R

5000|$|Languages {{derived from}} C, and more {{generally}} those influenced by Fortran's computed GOTO, instead feature fallthrough, where control {{moves to the}} matching case, and then execution continues ("falls through") to the statements associated with the next case in the source text. This also allows multiple values to match the same point without any special syntax: they are just listed with empty bodies. Values can be special conditioned with code in the <b>case</b> <b>body.</b> In practice, fallthrough is usually prevented with a [...] keyword {{at the end of}} the matching body, which exits execution of the switch block, but this can cause bugs due to unintentional fallthrough if the programmer forgets to insert the [...] statement. This is thus seen by many as a language wart, and warned against in some lint tools. Syntactically, the cases are interpreted as labels, not blocks, and the switch and break statements explicitly change control flow. Some languages influenced by C, such as JavaScript, retain default fallthrough, while others remove fallthrough, or only allow it in special circumstances. Notable variations on this in the C-family include C#, in which all blocks must be terminated with a [...] or [...] unless the block is empty (i.e. fallthrough is used as a way to specify multiple values).|$|E
30|$|In ice swimming, safety {{implications}} and {{the avoidance of}} hypothermia and non-freezing cold injury are key success factors. Issues pertaining to cold shock, drowning and circum-rescue collapse are highly relevant in this population. To date, only one case study has been published where two swimmers were presented while swimming in ice cold water (Knechtle et al. 2009). However, in that <b>case,</b> <b>body</b> core temperature was not measured during ice swimming, but only before and after swimming. One successful swimmer presented a body core temperature of 32 °C after swimming 2.2  km in water of 4 °C (Knechtle et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{shoulder}} radiusing and grooving (longitudinally and circumferentially) the afterbodies of bluff bodies {{to reduce the}} base drag at low speeds is investigated experimentally. Shoulder radii as large as 2. 75 body diameters are examined. Reynolds number (ReD) based on body diameter varied from 20, 000 to 200, 000. Results indicate that increasing the shoulder radius to 2. 00 body diameters can reduce the drag levels to those of a streamline body having 67 percent greater fineness ratio.
