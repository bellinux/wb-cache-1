The action and the tone confirmed my many-times tested theory {{that the bulk of}} English shoregoing institutions are based on <b>conformable</b> <b>strata</b> of absolutely impervious inaccuracy. I reflected and became aware of a drumming {{on the back of the}} front seat that Pyecroft, bowed forward and relaxed, was tapping with his knuckles. The hardly-checked fury on Hinchcliffe's brow had given place to a greasy imbecility, and he nodded over the steering-bar. In longs and shorts, as laid down by the pious and immortal Mr. Morse, Pyecroft tapped out, [...] "Sham drunk. Get him in the car." ...|$|E
5000|$|Price {{criticized the}} 'geologic ages' and strict Lyellian uniformitarianism {{on which they}} are based. As an {{alternative}} explanation of the geology of the earth, he re-invented Flood Geology. He pondered ways to reinterpret the apparent order of the fossils that seemingly implied ancient bygone eras. After studying {{a wide variety of}} geologic literature, Price deduced that the “facts of the rocks and fossils, stripped of mere theories, splendidly refute this evolutionary theory of the invariable order of the fossils, which is the very backbone of the evolutionary doctrine.” He had read of strata containing fossils of a young era lying conformably on strata containing fossils of very old eras. The geologist who described these lithically identical layers said that “one would naturally suppose that a single formation was being dealt with, were it not for fossil evidence.” To Price, that, and the lack of any evidence of erosion between the strata, implied that little time could have occurred between the two layers of rock. Price also discovered in the literature examples of similar <b>conformable</b> <b>strata,</b> but in the reverse order, the old rocks on top and the young strata below according to interpretation of the fossils. Although appearing “to succeed one another conformably” the Canadian Geologic Survey contended for over-thrusting principally based on the fossil content. Price's interpretation of the evidence was that “the geological record does not prove succession of ages, but rather shows a “taxonomic” series representing different but contemporaneous zones of antediluvian life.” ...|$|E
60|$|I will {{describe}} {{only one other}} section, namely, {{on the north side}} of the R. Claro, which is interesting from containing fossils: the strata are much dislocated by faults and dikes, and are inclined to the north, towards a mountain of andesite and porphyry, into which they appear to become almost blended. As the beds approach this mountain, their inclination increases up to an angle of 70 degrees, and in the upper part, the rocks become highly metamorphosed. The lowest bed visible in this section, is a purplish hard sandstone. Secondly, a bed two or three hundred feet thick, of a white siliceous sandstone, with a calcareous cement, containing seams of slaty sandstone, and of hard yellowish-brown (dolomitic?) limestone; numerous, well-rounded, little pebbles of quartz are included in the sandstone. Thirdly, a dark coloured limestone with some quartz pebbles, from fifty to sixty feet in thickness, containing numerous silicified shells, presently to be enumerated. Fourthly, very compact, calcareous, jaspery sandstone, passing into (fifthly) a great bed, several hundred feet thick, of conglomerate, composed of pebbles of white, red, and purple porphyries, of sandstone and quartz, cemented by calcareous matter. I observed that some of the finer parts of this conglomerate were much indurated within a foot of a dike eight feet in width, and were rendered of a paler colour with the calcareous matter segregated into white crystallised particles; some parts were stained green from the colouring matter of the dike. Sixthly, a thick mass, obscurely stratified, of a red sedimentary stone or sandstone, full of crystalline calcareous matter, imperfect crystals of oxide of iron, and I believe of feldspar, and therefore closely resembling some of the highly metamorphosed beds at Arqueros: this bed was capped by, and appeared to pass in its upper part into, rocks similarly coloured, containing calcareous matter, and abounding with minute crystals, mostly elongated and glassy, of reddish albite. Seventhly, a <b>conformable</b> <b>stratum</b> of fine reddish porphyry with large crystals of (albitic?) feldspar; probably a submarine lava. Eighthly, another conformable bed of green porphyry, with specks of green earth and cream-coloured crystals of feldspar. I believe that there are other superincumbent crystalline strata and submarine lavas, but I had not time to examine them.|$|R
40|$|New isotope data {{obtained}} from relatively <b>conformable,</b> carbonate-rich <b>strata</b> of the Ediacaran Yangtze platform in South China reveal substantial δ 13 C variability. In platform sections, four negative δ 13 C anomalies with a nadir down to ≤− 8 ‰ (PDB) {{are present in the}} interval between the cap carbonate level (∼ 635 Ma) and the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary (∼ 542 Ma), while in slope and basinal sections, δ 13 C values are negative through the entire Doushantuo Formation (∼ 635 – 551 Ma). If these δ 13 C values are close to their primary seawater signature, they imply a strong (≥ 10 ‰) surface-to-deep ocean δ 13 C gradient that is consistent with long-term deep ocean anoxia and the presence of a large dissolved organic carbon (DOC) reservoir. The two prominent negative δ 13 C excursions within the Doushantuo Formation above the cap carbonate level are associated with shoaling and local exposure of the platform. The anomalies may thus record remineralization of a large oceanic DOC pool via sulfate reduction that transferred 13 C-depleted carbon from the oceanic DOC reservoir to the surface ocean during regression. Inconsistencies in Ediacaran δ 13 C profiles globally and variations in South China in particular highlight the need for further evaluation of local departures in δ 13 C from an inferred average seawater signature...|$|R
40|$|Central Cape Breton Island is {{underlain}} by Precambrian {{rocks and}} by Paleozoic rocks of all periods except the Permian. The pre-Carboniferous rocks have been mapped on 1 inch to 1 mile scale {{and some new}} data are given concerning their extent and correlation problems. Carboniferous sedimentary rocks consist of three Mississippian and three Pennsylvanian groups that total between 25, 000 and 30, 000 feet in thickness. These rocks are continental except for 2, 000 to 3, 000 feet of marine Mississippian strata. Lower Mississippian rocks are a <b>conformable</b> group of <b>strata</b> designated the Horton group. They are divided, in this area, into the Craignish, Strathlorne and Ainslie formations. The group is over 10, 000 feet thick {{in the western part}} of the area and wedges out eastward.

60|$|The road by the Villa Vicencio Pass {{does not}} strike {{directly}} across the range, but runs for some leagues northward along its western base: and I must briefly describe the rocks here seen, before continuing with the coloured east and west section. At {{the mouth of the}} valley of Canota, and at several points northwards, there is an extensive formation of a glossy and harsh, and of a feldspathic clay-slate, including strata of grauwacke, and having a tortuous, nearly vertical cleavage, traversed by numerous metalliferous veins and others of quartz. The clay-slate is in many parts capped by a thick mass of fragments of the same rock, firmly recemented; and both together have been injected and broken up by very numerous hillocks, ranging north and south, of lilac, white, dark and salmon- coloured porphyries: one steep, now denuded, hillock of porphyry had its face as distinctly impressed with the angles of a fragmentary mass of the slate, with some of the points still remaining embedded, as sealing-wax could be by a seal. At the mouth of this same valley of Canota, in a fine escarpment having the strata dipping from 50 to 60 degrees to the N.E. (Nearly opposite to this escarpment, there is another corresponding one, with the strata dipping not to the exactly opposite point, or S.W., but to S.S.W.: consequently the two escarpments trend towards each other, and some miles southward they become actually united: this is a form of elevation which I have not elsewhere seen.), the clay-slate formation is seen to be covered by--(1st) a purple, claystone porphyry resting unconformably in some parts on the solid slate, and in others on a thick fragmentary mass; (2nd), a <b>conformable</b> <b>stratum</b> of compact blackish rock, having a spheroidal structure, full of minute acicular crystals of glassy feldspar, with red spots of oxide of iron; (3rd), a great stratum of purplish-red claystone porphyry, abounding with crystals of opaque feldspar, and laminated with thin, parallel, often short, layers, and likewise with great irregular patches of white, earthy, semi-crystalline feldspar; this rock (which I noticed in other neighbouring places) perfectly resembles a curious variety described at Port Desire, and occasionally occurs in the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of Chile; (4th), a thin stratum of greenish white, indurated tuff, fusible and containing broken crystals and particles of porphyries; (5th), a grand mass, imperfectly columnar and divided into three parallel and closely joined strata, of cream-coloured claystone porphyry; (6th), a thick stratum of lilac-coloured porphyry, which I could see was capped by another bed of the cream-coloured variety; I was unable to examine the still higher parts of the escarpment. These conformably stratified porphyries, though none are either vesicular are amygdaloidal, have evidently flowed as submarine lavas: some of them are separated from each other by seams of indurated tuff, which, however, are quite insignificant in thickness compared with the porphyries. This whole pile resembles, but not very closely, some of the less brecciated parts of the great porphyritic conglomerate formation of Chile; but it does not probably belong to the same age, as the porphyries here rest unconformably on the altered feldspathic clay-slate, whereas the porphyritic conglomerate formation alternates with and rests conformably on it. These porphyries, moreover, {{with the exception of the}} one blackish stratum, and of the one indurated, white tufaceous bed, differ from the beds composing the Uspallata range in the line of the Villa Vicencio Pass.|$|R
40|$|We {{interpreted}} flow {{dynamics of}} the Kahiltna Pass Basin accumulation zone on Mount McKinley, Alaska, USA, using 40, 100 and 900 MHz ground-penetrating radar profiles and GPS surface velocity measurements. We found dipping, englacial surface-conformable strata that experienced vertical thickening as the glacier flowed westward from a steep, higher-velocity (60 m a– 1) region into flat terrain associated with a 908 bend in the glacier and lower velocities (15 m a– 1) to the south. Stratigraphy near {{the western side of}} the basin was surface-conformable to 170 m depth and thinned as flow diverged southward, down-glacier. We found complex <b>strata</b> beneath the <b>conformable</b> stratigraphy and interpret these features as buried crevasses, avalanche debris and deformed ice caused by up-glacier events. We also suggest that basin dimensions, bed topography and the sharp bend each cause flow extension and compression, significantly contributing to <b>conformable</b> and complex <b>strata</b> thickness variations. Our findings show that surface-conformable stratigraphy continuous with depth and consistent strata thicknesses cannot be assumed in accumulation basins, because local and upglacier terrain and flow dynamics can cause structural complexities to occur under and within surfaceconformable layers...|$|R
40|$|The Triassic-Jurassic {{boundary}} {{remains an}} enigmatic event {{due to a}} lack of conformable, terrestrial sections. On the Colorado Plateau the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has been placed within the J- 0 unconformity at the Chinle Formation-Glen Canyon Group contact. Recent tetrapod, palynofloral, and magnetostratigraphic data has suggested the J- 0 unconformity is of Triassic age, and the Triassic-Jurassic boundary is preserved within the Dinosaur Canyon Member of the Moenave Formation (Glen Canyon Group). This study presents palynofloral and stable carbon-isotope data from a mudstone interval within the lower Dinosaur Canyon Member of the Moenave Formation on the Colorado Plateau at Kanab, Utah. Palynofloral analysis has yielded a high diversity palynofloral assemblage containing many bisaccate and monosaccate palynomorphs followed by a low diversity palynofloral assemblage containing greater than 90 % Classopollis meyerianus. The high diversity palynofloral assemblage has yielded the Late Triassic index palynomorphs Camerosporites verrucosus, Patinasporites densus, Patinasporites toralis, and Vallasporites ignacii. It also contains the earliest Jurassic index palynomorphs Pityosporites parvisaccatus and Rugubivesiculites species 303, which according to this study are not Jurassic index palynomorphs. The high diversity palynofloral assemblage is separated from the low diversity palynofloral assemblage by a 60 % species turnover (18 of 30 species), which corresponds to a rapid extinction event. The greater than 90 % Classopollis meyerianus correlates to the basal Jurassic Classopollis meyerianus Palynofloral Zone of the Newark Supergroup and Europe. Thus, the Triassic-Jurassic boundary is located within <b>conformable,</b> terrestrial <b>strata</b> of the lower Dinosaur Canyon Member and not the J- 0 unconformity. Stable carbon-isotope analysis has yielded one major negative isotopic excursion of - 2 / in organic carbon with the possibility of another negative excursion. Whether this excursion corresponds to the initial or main excursion, or if oxidation has overprinted the signal cannot be determined at this time. Higher resolution sampling is needed to check for other excursions and their positions, as well as sampling higher and lower than the mudstone interval. More terrestrial boundary sections, especial those far removed from the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) are needed to determine extinction event timing and the timing of evolutionary events of certain flora. This could also provide much need data and a new marine-terrestrial correlation to the Global Stratotype Section Boundary and Point (GSSP) candidate at New York Canyon, Nevada...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, set {{thicknesses}} {{are used}} to estimate the paleohydraulics (paleodischarge and give magnitudes for paleocurrent directions) of the ancient river system which deposited the Parthenon Sandstone in northwest Arkansas. Set thickness is the vertical thickness {{of a group of}} <b>strata</b> <b>conformable</b> series (Mckee and Weir, 1953); set thickness represents truncated dunes. The goal of this thesis is to: 1) obtain paleodischarge estimates of the Parthenon sandstone via cross-sets and compare the results with previously calculated discharge estimates which use basin area to discharge collation techniques and 2) use paleodischarge estimates calculated within this thesis to give magnitude to the paleocurrent direction data and compare the results with, more traditional, non-vector paleocurrent direction data. The quantitative work that has been done on the Parthenon suggests a paleodischarge which differs from qualitative estimates by multiple orders of magnitude; resulting in the need for more research. By obtaining quantitative measurements of set thickness, grain size, and paleocurrent direction on twenty-one Parthenon outcrops (over a 4. 5 x 103 km 2 study area), multiple paleohydraulic parameters can be estimated with existing models including: mean bedform height, channel depth, channel belt width, channel width, paleoslope, boundary shear stress, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor, paleoflow velocity, paleodischarge, and overall paleocurrent direction. Paleodischarge estimates in this study average 13, 000 m 3 /s; the minimum estimates average 2, 200 m 3 /s; and the maximum estimates average 53, 000 m 3 /s. Maximum average estimates in this study are lower than the minimum estimates (64, 000 m 3 /s) from past research based on total basin area; estimates in this thesis remain many orders of magnitude larger than any modern flashy system (the type of system the Parthenon has been interpreted as in the past). The overall paleocurrent direction found in this thesis is to the southwest; similar to past analyses. The total mean paleocurrent direction is 211 degrees; the mean of the outcrop means is 191 degree; and the mean of the paleodischarge weighted outcrop means is 198 degrees. There is little change between the overall paleocurrent directions when using vector or just directional data...|$|R
