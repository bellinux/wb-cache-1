5|$|Symeon's {{other main}} {{emphasis}} {{is the power}} of the Holy Spirit to transform, and the profound mystical union with God that is the end result of a holy life. Symeon referred to this as the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, compared to the more ritualistic Baptism of water. Symeon believed that Christianity had descended into formulae and church ritual, which for many people replaced the earlier emphasis on actual and direct experience of God. The Discourses express Symeon's strong <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> life of a Christian must be much more than mere observance of rules, and must include personal experience of the presence of the living Christ. Symeon describes his own conversion and mystical experience of the divine light.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{religious}} policy {{reflected the}} Imperial <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{unity of the}} Empire presupposed unity of faith, and it appeared to him obvious that this faith could only be the orthodox (Nicaean). Those of a different belief were subjected to persecution, which imperial legislation had effected {{from the time of}} Constantius II and which would now vigorously continue. The Codex contained two statutes that decreed the total destruction of paganism, even in private life; these provisions were zealously enforced. Contemporary sources (John Malalas, Theophanes, John of Ephesus) tell of severe persecutions, even of men in high position. In 529, the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens was placed under state control as paganism, strangling this training school for this branch of Hellenistic philosophy..|$|E
5|$|In July 1991, Špegelj and Đodan's {{advice was}} {{supported}} by a number of Croatian Parliament members. In response, Tuđman dismissed Đodan the same month he was appointed Defence Minister, and Špegelj resigned his command of the ZNG on 3 August. The deteriorating situation in eastern Croatia, including the JNA expulsion of ZNG troops from Baranja, intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci, increasing losses and the growing <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> JNA were actively supporting the Croatian Serb revolt, forced Tuđman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the withdrawal of the JNA to its barracks {{by the end of the}} month. The ultimatum stated that if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider it an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a ceasefire and a peace conference was accepted by the Yugoslav Presidency and by Tuđman, despite his earlier ultimatum. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency, Stjepan Mesić, ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. This order was motivated by Tuđman's concern that the conference would drag on while the ZNG lost territory. Even though the order was opposed by other members of the presidency, it gave Croatia justification to openly confront the JNA.|$|E

25|$|The ecclesiological {{questions}} {{gave rise}} to an interest in giving liturgical expression to the theological <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Church of England had sustained a fundamentally Catholic character after the English Reformation.

25|$|A final meeting {{took place}} in Oslo in September 1951, where {{marriage}} questions were again on the agenda.

It was decided that a request to this effect be forwarded to Rome. As we now know, this was soon to be granted.|$|E

25|$|Fortescue {{remarked that}} the medieval {{explanations}} are interesting as showing with what reverence people studied {{the text of}} the Canon and how, when every one had forgotten the original reasons for its forms, they still kept the <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mass is full of venerable mysteries and that all its clauses mean more than common expressions. He added that in this conviction the sometimes naive medieval interpreters were eminently right.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E
25|$|By mid-May, the {{defenders}} were becoming {{concerned about their}} dwindling food supply; on 14 May, however, the Turkish forces unexpectedly retreated. One of Cevdet's last acts before the retreat was to order the shelling of the American compound, a violation of diplomatic immunity that Ussher suggests was made from Cevdet's <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Americans had aided the city's defence. The cause of Cevdet's retreat became evident on 18 May, when elements of a Russo-Armenian regiment arrived, {{the vanguard of the}} Russian Army which arrived some hours later.|$|E

The US committed $59 million for training and non-lethal equipment for the Presidential Guard, and persuaded Arab allies to fund the purchase of further weapons. Israel, too, allowed light arms to flow to members of the Presidential Guard. Jordan and Egypt hosted at least two battalions for training.|$|E

50|$|Turning {{away from}} the Enlightenment {{conception}} of Greek myth {{as a reflection of}} a universal religion in its infancy, Müller placed the study squarely as the outcome of an encounter between the particular character of a people and a specific historical setting, where, in the broadest sense it has remained, though his <b>convictions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> core of each culture is uniquely its own led him to deny the influence of Egyptian art on Greek art, already being recognised at the time.|$|R
25|$|In fact, {{from the}} beginning, {{a sense of}} urgency gave the first Zionists the {{profound}} <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews {{at the beginning of the}} century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.|$|E
25|$|The Geschichte der Halbinsel Morea set Fallmerayer at loggerheads {{with the}} European philhellenes in general, {{and with the}} Bavarian King Ludwig I in particular, a {{convinced}} philhellene who already in 1829 had begun to advance the candidacy of his son, Otto, for the Greek throne (Otto became King of Greece in 1832). Ludwig's philhellenism was in fact grounded in the <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Greek revolt against Ottoman rule represented the return of antique Hellenic virtue. Ludwig's displeasure with Fallmerayer led to a long delay in the confirmation of Fallmerayer's election to the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities.|$|E

A roundup of related research on Journalist's Resource, a project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, found few if any downsides to children being raised by a same-sex couple, and some positive effects.|$|E

25|$|All three {{representatives from}} Nevis, {{including}} {{the leader of}} the opposition in the Nevis Island Assembly, objected to the introduction of these bills into the National Assembly in Saint Kitts, arguing that the bills would affect the ability of Nevis to develop its offshore financial services sector and that the bills would be detrimental to the Nevis economy. All the representatives in opposition in the National Assembly shared the <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bills, if passed into law, would be unconstitutional and undermine the constitutional and legislative authority of the Nevis Island Administration, as well as result in the destruction of the economy of Nevis.|$|E
25|$|The Royalists {{were now}} {{fighting}} with the courage of despair. Those who still fought against Charles did so with the full determination to ensure the triumph of their cause, and with the <b>conviction</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only possible way was the annihilation of the enemy's armed forces. The majority, however, were so weary of the war that the Earl of Manchester's Presbyterian royalism, which contributed so materially to the prolongation of the struggle, {{would probably have been}} accepted by four-fifths of all England as the basis of a peace. It was, in fact, in the face of almost universal opposition, that Fairfax and Cromwell and their friends at Westminster guided the cause of their weaker comrades to complete victory.|$|E

But any attempt to interpret this in terms of action would have bound the Church to annihilate not merely a single state, but all states.|$|E
