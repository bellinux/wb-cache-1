When using such components, versioning becomes a key issue. While various ad-hoc techniques and coding idioms {{have been used to}} provide versioning, all of these techniques have deficiencies - ambiguity, the necessity of recompilation or re-coding, or the loss of binary <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs.</b> Components from different software vendors are versioned at different times. Maintaining compatibility between versions must be consciously engineered. New technologies such as distributed objects further complicate libraries by requiring multiple implementations of a type simultaneously in a program. This paper describes a new C++ object model called the Shared Object Model for C++ users and a new implementation model called the Object Binary Interface for C++ implementors. These techniques provide a mechanism for allowing multiple implementations of an object in a program. Early analysis of this approach has shown it to have performance broadly comparable to conventional implementations...|$|E

40|$|Large {{software}} {{systems are}} developed by composing multiple programs. If the programs manipulate and exchange complex data, such as network packets or files, {{it is essential}} to establish that they follow compatible data formats. Most of the complexity of data formats is associated with the headers. In this paper, we address <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> <b>programs</b> operating over headers of network packets, files, images, etc. As format specifications are rarely available, we infer the format associated with headers by a program as a set of guarded layouts. In terms of these formats, we define and check compatibility of (a) producer-consumer programs and (b) different versions of producer (or consumer) programs. A compatible producer-consumer pair is free of type mismatches and logical incompatibilities such as the consumer rejecting valid outputs generated by the producer. A backward compatible producer (resp. consumer) is guaranteed to be compatible with consumers (resp. producers) that were compatible with its older version.

40|$|Background Optimal {{management}} of {{type 2 diabetes}} requires achievement of optimal glucose, blood pressure and lipid targets through promotion of prudent diet, regular physical activity and adherence to necessary medication. This may require the development <b>of</b> new <b>programs</b> for the coordination of required multidisciplinary services. Diffusion of innovations theory offers a conceptual framework that may facilitate the implementation <b>of</b> such <b>programs.</b> Methods To illustrate this, we have re-examined the implementation experiences previously reported by the developers of an actual diabetes management pilot program in Montreal, {{with an eye toward}} identifying potentially important process factors that could effectively increase adoption and sustainability. Results Physician participation in the program appeared to be influenced by perceived advantages <b>of</b> participation, <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>program</b> with own perspective and perceived barriers to participation. Organizational features that may have influenced participation included the extent <b>of</b> the <b>program’s</b> integration within the existing health care system.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that salt intake be less than 5 g/day, a goal that only a small proportion of people achieve. Iodine deficiency can cause cognitive and motor impairment and, if severe, hypothyroidism with serious mental and growth retardation. More than 2 billion people worldwide are at risk of iodine deficiency. Preventing iodine deficiency by using salt fortified with iodine {{is a major}} global public health success. Programs to reduce dietary salt are technically compatible with programs to prevent iodine deficiency through salt fortification. However, for populations to fully benefit from optimum intake of salt and iodine, the programs must be integrated. This review summarizes the scientific basis for salt reduction and iodine fortification <b>programs,</b> the <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>programs,</b> and the steps that need to be taken by the WHO, national governments, and nongovernmental organizations to ensure that populations fully benefit from optimal intake of salt and iodine. Specifically, expert groups must be convened to help countries implement integrated programs and context-specific case studies of successfully integrated programs; lessons learned need to be compiled and disseminated. Integrated surveillance programs will be more efficient and will enhance current efforts to optimize intake of iodine and salt. For populations to fully benefit, governments need to place a high priority on integrating these two important public health programs. ...|$|R

40|$|Writing program {{generators}} {{involves the}} development <b>of</b> <b>programs</b> that manipulate representations <b>of</b> <b>programs,</b> thus offering unlimited possibliities for abstraction. Abstractions not expressable in typed languages {{can always be}} expressed as generators. For example generator mechanisms are implicit in the eq-types of Standard ML, and the deriving clauses of Haskel type classes, neither {{of which can be}} encoded within the language. While these mechanisms always generate well typed code, they are "hard coded" into the compiler. Our goal is to incorporate generator like abstraction mechanisms into programming languages, while ensuring that only well typed programs are executed. This can be accomplished by a generate and then type-check approach or an inference mechanism that guarantees that only well typed programs are generated. In this paper we investigate both possibilities. The problems associated with program generators include problems of "hygiene" and the type <b>compatibility</b> <b>of</b> the <b>programs</b> being generated. Naive approaches to typing generators have either been inflexible (giving rigid, invariant types to the meta-level expressions representing programs requiring every object term to have the same type) or undecidable (requiring dependent types with arbitrary equality theories on expression equality). We solve the hygiene problems by the use of syntactic closures and have approached the type problem in two ways. First, by using a two level system (a la Nielson and Nielson[9]) we are able to embed a meta-computation phase which associates invariant code types to object expressions, into a later phase which then indexes these code types with the object expression's type. This ensures that only well-typed programs reach the run-time phase. We guarantee that the meta-computation phase terminates by restricting its expressiveness by the use of catamorphisms as the exclusive mechanism to encode recursion. Second we introduce a theory of dependent types for two-level languages that has a useful, decidable theory due to the use of catamorphisms, rather than arbitrary recursion, in the expressions that may index dependent types. We show that this can give useful types to program generators which detect type problems in generated code at the compile-type of the generator. Third we show that by embedding second level type declarations as values in first level computations we are able to construct polytypic program generators, such as polymorphic equality and generic map using our theory...|$|R

This paper {{is based on the}} data which was collected from five NGOs and six cultural communities which are the beneficiaries of the NGOsâ€™ development programs. The theoretical underpinnings of this paper are situated in cultural conservatism, a philosophy which valorises the traditional cultural institutions and the organic change of these cultural communities. This study establishes that, the programs implemented by the NGOs in Zimbabwe are predetermined and are detached from the cultures of the communities in which they are implemented. In view of the argument that culture is an important component in development, both as cultural capital and in defining development, this paper concludes that the prescriptive NGOsâ€™ development programs are detrimental to cultural sustainability and sustainable development in Zimbabwe. Therefore, this paper argues that there is need to integrate the cultural capital of the communities in the designing and implementation of the NGOs development programs in Zimbabwe...|$|R
