500|$|Some camera systems use {{predefined}} scripts {{to decide}} how to select the current shot for commonly seen shot scenarios called film idioms. Typically, the script is going to be triggered {{as a result of an}} action. For instance, when the player's character initiates a conversation with another character, the [...] "conversation" [...] script is going to be triggered. This script will contain instructions on how to [...] "shoot" [...] a two-character conversation. Thus the shots will be a combination of, for instance, over the shoulder shots and close-up shots. Such script-based approaches may switch the camera between a set of predefined cameras or rely on a constraint solver to generate the camera coordinates to account for variability in scene layout. [...] This scripted approach and the use of a constraint solver to compute virtual cameras was first proposed by Drucker. [...] Subsequent research demonstrated how a script-based system could automatically switch cameras to view conversations between avatars in a realtime <b>chat</b> <b>application.</b>|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Multimedia Communication has {{improved}} rapidly {{to allow people}} to communicate via the Internet. However, Internet users cannot communicate with each other unless they use the same <b>chatting</b> <b>applications</b> since each <b>chatting</b> <b>application</b> uses a certain signaling protocol to make the media call. The interworking module is a very critical issue since it solves the communication problems between any two protocols, and enables people around the world to make a voice/video call even if they use different <b>chatting</b> <b>applications.</b> Providing interoperability between different signaling protocols and multimedia applications takes the advantages of more than one protocol. Usually, each signaling protocol has its own messages which differ from other signaling protocol messages format. Thus, when two clients use different signaling protocols want to communicate phonetically, the sent/received messages between them will not be understood because the control and media packets in each protocol are different than the corresponding ones in the other protocol, The interworking module solves this kind of problem by matching the signals and media messages by providing translation gateways in the middle between the two protocols. Thus, many interworking modules have been proposed in order to enable many protocols’ users to chat with each other without any difficulties. This paper compares two interworking modules between Inter-Asterisk eXchange Protocol and Jingle Protocol. An experimental implementation in terms of session time is provided...|$|R

The mapping architecture is a very critical issue since it solves the communication problems between any two protocols, as well as it enables people around the world to make a voice/video call even if they use different <b>chatting</b> <b>applications.</b> Providing the interoperability between different signaling protocols and multimedia applications takes the advantages of more than one protocol. Many mapping architectures have been proposed to ease exchanging the media between at least two users without facing any difficulties such as SIP-Jingle, IAX-RSW, H. 323 -MGCP, etc. However, the design of any of the existing mapping architectures has some weaknesses related to larger delay, time consuming, and security matters. The only way to overcome these problems is to propose an efficient mapping architecture. This paper proposed a new mapping architecture between Inter-Asterisk eXchange Protocol and Jingle Protocol. The proposed mapping architecture consists of IAX domain (IAX client, IAX server, IAX-to-Jingle gateway), and Jingle domain (Jingle client, Jingle server, Jingle-to-IAX gateway). The tasks of the translation gateways are represented by the URI conversion, media capability exchange, translator of call setup and teardown signals, and real time media transmission...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: E-learning uses {{a number}} of {{communication}} tools and technologies over internet to send/receive assignment and quizzes, conduct examinations and interaction between teacher and students. These tools and technologies include <b>chat</b> <b>applications</b> with audio and video features, discussion forums and emails. In spite all of these communication tools, e-learning faces the problem of communication gap and interaction delay. <b>Chat</b> <b>applications</b> like Yahoo or MSN messenger may help to overcome this problem {{but they are not}} meant for an e-learning university, so, they are not suitable to be used for an e-learning university. In this paper we propose an e-learning methodology to minimize communication gap and interaction delay between students and teacher. The proposed methodology is an idea of virtual class, as its major component to conduct both an audio and text chat sessions with the students. It gives the impression of a real world class: the instructor allows students one by one to ask their questions and all other students watch or listen to them. The developed system also includes other features: recording the chat session which may be published on the university web site and send it automatically to all participants of virtual class...|$|R
