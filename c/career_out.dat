5|$|At {{the start}} of the 193637 season, Miller was {{selected}} for the Colts, a state under-21 team that played at district level. At the end of the 1936 school year, Miller completed year 10 by passing five of his eight subjects. Disinclined towards university studies, he left school without finishing his leaving year and began working as a clerk for a car business. Miller felt confident that he could make a <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of sport and therefore felt that further education was unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, 96, Domitian {{was assassinated}} in a palace {{conspiracy}} organised by court officials.

Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E

5|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} in {{his left}} knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making a <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for Hereford United, including in the first team {{when they were in}} the fourth, and later in the third, division of the English Football League. He was earning up to £33 a week. But in 1973, at the age of 21, the pain in his joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} market started with comic book stores, and hobby shops displaying and selling cards, with the cards' values determined somewhat arbitrarily {{by the employees}} of the store. With {{the expansion of the}} internet, prices of cards were determined by the amount of tournament deck lists a given card would appear in. If a card was played in a tournament more frequently, the cost of the card would be higher (in addition to the market availability of the card). When eBay, Amazon, and other large online markets started to gain popularity, the Magic {{secondary market}} evolved substantially. Buying and selling Magic cards online became a source of income for people who learned how to manipulate the market. Today, the secondary market is so large and complex, it has become an area of study for consumer research, and some people make a <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of market manipulation, creating mathematical models to analyze the growth of cards' worth, and predict the market value of both individual cards, and entire sets of cards.|$|E
5|$|With legal matters subsided, the 2005–06 season began. Following midfielder {{and team}} captain Patrick Vieira's {{departure}} from Arsenal, Gilberto became {{a senior member}} of the Arsenal team. Shortly into the season, in September 2005, his desire to see his <b>career</b> <b>out</b> with the club led to Gilberto extending his Arsenal contract to June 2009. A month later this loyalty was repaid when, on 18 October 2005, Gilberto made his first appearance for Arsenal as captain, against Sparta Prague. Although Gilberto had a period of bad form during the winter months of the season, his good defensive performances during the latter stages of the UEFA Champions League (in particular, games against Real Madrid, Juventus and Villarreal) gained him praise. On 17 May 2006 Gilberto played for Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League Final against FC Barcelona, which Arsenal lost 2–1.|$|E

In 2006 when Steve Irwin died, PETA's vice-president Dan Mathews said Irwin had made a <b>career</b> <b>out</b> of antagonizing frightened wild animals.

500|$|Iclaliye ("Glorious") was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the late 1860s and early 1870s.
