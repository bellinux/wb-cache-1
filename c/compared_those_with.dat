5000|$|There are studies {{suggesting}} genetic factors {{account for}} a fair proportion of inter-individual BMI (Body Mass Index). Among different types of genetic variation between humans, SNPs are suggested {{to be the most}} important marker for the study of nutrigenomics. [...] Multiple studies have found association between SNPs and obesity. One of the most well known obesity associating gene is the FTO gene. Among studied individuals, it was found that those with AA genotype showed a higher BMI <b>compared</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> TT genotype when having high fat or low carbohydrate dietary intake. [...] The APO B SNP rs512535 is another obesity related variation. It was found that the A/G heterozygous genotype was found to have association with obesity (in terms of BMI and waist circumference). The same study also found that for individuals with habitual high fat diet (>35% of energy intaken), individuals with GG homozygotes genotype showed higher BMI compared to AA allele carriers. However, this difference is not found in low fat consuming group (<35% of energy intaken). Besides the FTO genes and APO B, SNPs in various genes such as MC4R, SH2B1, MTCH2, SEC16B etc. have been found to be associated with obesity. Although many of these genetic variations are found in populations all over the world, there are also variations unique to certain races or populations.|$|E

40|$|Background: Tetralogy of Fallot is {{the most}} common cyanotic {{congenital}} heart disease. The systolic and diastolic function in both ventricles is altered even after successful corrective surgery for this defect with a transannular patch. Pulmonary regurgitation, a common complication after this treatment, is usually well tolerated in childhood. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the combined diastolic and systolic function of both ventricles using the Doppler-derived myocardial performance index (Tei index) in patients who underwent surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot using a transannular patch. In this article we discuss the impact of pulmonary regurgitation on right ventricular function and clinical outcome, the role of echocardiographic imaging, and current management strategies for patients with pulmonary regurgitation after this treatment. Methods: Sixty eight patients with tetralogy Fallot were studied in Shahid Rajaie referral Cardiovascular Center during 2003 - 2005. The studied population, 36 male and 32 female with a mean age of 7. 5 Â± 4 years and a history of corrective surgery for tetralogy of Fallot using a transannular patch. These patients were randomly selected and assessed by Doppler echocardiography. Results: Fifty-seven patients (84 %) had mild to moderate pulmonary regurgitation, whereas 11 patients (16 %) had severe pulmonary regurgitation. Right ventricular Tei index was significantly increased in patients with severe pulmonary regurgitation <b>compared</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> mild to moderate pulmonary regurgitation (0. 54 Â± 0. 18 vs 0. 24 Â± 0. 11, P< 0. 01).

Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that pulmonary regurgitation is a serious complication after repair of tetralogy of Fallot with a transannular patch.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels {{are used to}} diagnose heart failure, and as an entry criterion for inclusion into trials. We investigated a population of HFpEF patients who had been randomised into a study based on clinical parameters, and <b>compared</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> low BNP levels to those with elevated BNP levels. Methods We examined patients who had been enrolled in the Coordinating study evaluating Outcomes of Advising and Counselling in Heart Failure (COACH), with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF &gt;= 40 %), and <b>compared</b> <b>those</b> <b>with</b> low BNP (&lt; 100 pg/ml; n = 30) to those with elevated BNP (= 100 pg/ml; n = 127). Baseline characteristics, comorbidities, biomarkers, quality of life, and outcome parameters (hospitalisations and death) were compared between the groups. To validate our findings, we repeated all analyses for NT-proBNP (&lt; 300 pg/ml and = 300 pg/ml). Results Patients were similar with regard to most clinical characteristics (including age, sex, and LVEF), biomarkers, and comorbidities. In contrast, patients with a low BNP had higher body mass index levels (31 kg/m(2) vs. 27 kg/m(2); p &lt; 0. 01) and lower cardiac troponin I (9 pg/ml vs. 15 pg/ml; p = 0. 02). In addition, these patients were less frequently prescribed diuretics and beta-blockers. No differences in quality of life, heart failure related symptoms and the primary and secondary outcomes were observed between these groups. These observations were confirmed for NT-proBNP. Conclusion Among the patients with clinically diagnosed HFpEF, those with low BNP are strikingly similar to those with elevated BNP levels, except for BMI, which was significantly higher in these patients.
