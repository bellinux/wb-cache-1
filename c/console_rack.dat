5|$|In August 2007, Sony Computer Entertainment America {{released}} {{news that}} PlayStation 3 consoles {{would be used}} as the dedicated servers for Warhawk. A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 <b>consoles</b> in <b>racks.</b> Each server is able to support 32 players. The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform, such as procedurally generated water and waves, as well as volumetric clouds.|$|R
5000|$|This smaller console {{contains}} {{all of the}} features of the larger console in a smaller form factor, and quickly became the industry's standard touring and festival console for many years. Though it has fewer input faders, it can still run the same show, as it can be connected to the same combinations of inputs and outputs described above. Avid sold its last Profile and Mix <b>Rack</b> <b>consoles</b> in the Summer of 2016, although they are still supported.|$|R
40|$|Description of a 91. 5 -cm (36 -in.) {{airborne}} infrared telescope {{installed in}} a C 141 A StarLifter as a national IR observatory. The telescope system is mounted in a specially constructed cavity located {{just ahead of the}} leading edge of the wing. All controls and ancillary systems are located in <b>consoles</b> and <b>racks</b> mounted aft of the telescope. The telescope is a conventional Cassegrain design which can be used either directly with the focal point behind the primary mirror or in a folded configuration by inserting a tertiary mirror following the secondary which folds the optical path through the support bearing into the aircraft cabin area. The telescope system is designed to operate at all ambient conditions from sea level to 15, 200 m. The system is optimized for operation at ambient temperatures experienced at 13, 000 to 15, 000 m (220 K). The entire telescope assembly with the exception of noncritical covers and brackets is constructed of Invar-type material to minimize the effects of thermal distortions. Pointing accuracy and stability of the telescope with respect to the target are achieved through multiple stages of stabilization and vibration isolation equipment...|$|R
5000|$|The editing console was {{interfaced}} to two {{equipment racks}} of support equipment (which were usually located remotely {{in another room}} from the <b>console).</b> The first <b>rack</b> contained the interface electronics for the system, monitoring equipment, and a Digital PDP-11 minicomputer with 32 kilobytes of RAM, which controlled the system. The second rack contained all the audio & video electronics, and the [...] "Skip-Field Recorder", which took in video & audio for editing from a VTR, and then recorded such to one or several disk pack drives interfaced to the 600. The CMX 600 could support up to six disk pack drives, for a total recording time of 27 minutes. Each disk pack could record up to 5.4 minutes of NTSC video, or 4.5 minutes of PAL video.|$|R
50|$|Schimmelpenninkâ€™s updated White Bicycle {{system is}} {{supported}} by a patented smart card technology intended to counter misuse. The integrated access, parking and control systems discourages theft, and the bicycles are immediately identifiable due to their unusual design. Registered users can access the White Bicycles in a network of unmanned parking lots around the city. Such parking lots are equipped with a main <b>console</b> and have <b>racks</b> that hold up to ten bikes. When a club member inserts a card with an embedded microchip into the console, they are asked to identify their final destination and at that time book the use of a bicycle for thirty minutes. The central computer identifies the user and makes a reservation for them at a free parking slot near their indicated destination point. The cyclist then has half an hour to get from point A to point B and deposit the bike as programmed. This is the basic structure of the Lyons bicycle project and others that have come on line in the last few years. Schimmelpennink has freely contributed his knowledge to such initiatives.|$|R
2500|$|The tools {{needed to}} make beats in the late 1970s were funk, soul, and other music genre records, record turntables, DJ mixers, audio consoles, and {{relatively}} inexpensive Portastudio-style multitrack recording devices. In the 1980s and 1990s, beatmakers and producers used the new electronic and digital instruments that were developed, suchas samplers, sequencers, drum machines, and synthesizers. From the 1970s to the 2010s, various beatmakers and producers have used live instruments, such as drum kit or electric bass on some tracks. To record the finished beats or beat tracks, beatmakers and producers {{use a variety of}} sound recording equipment, typically multitrack recorders. Digital Audio Workstations, also known as DAWs, became more common in the 2010s for producers. Some of the most used DAWs are Fruity Loops Studio, Ableton Live, and Pro Tools.
