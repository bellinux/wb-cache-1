5000|$|Web caches store popular <b>content</b> on <b>servers</b> {{that have}} the {{greatest}} demand for the content requested.

In this paper, we describe a new CDN design that associates synthetic load-aware coordinates with clients and <b>content</b> <b>servers</b> and uses them to direct content requests to cached content. This approach helps achieve good performance when request workloads and resource availability in the CDN are dynamic. A deployment and evaluation of our system on PlanetLab demonstrates how it achieves low request times with high cache hit ratios {{when compared to other}} CDN approaches. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} Web service {{architecture}} for achieving bidirectional XML updating. The update mechanism exploits {{the power of}} bidirectioanl transformations so that users can update XML data by editing a view that is generated by some transformation of the XML data. This architecture consists of three tiers: data viewer clients, a bidirectional transformation engine, and some <b>content</b> <b>servers</b> accessible through the Internet. Due {{to the use of}} standard Web service technologies, data viewer clients and <b>contents</b> <b>servers</b> can be easily replaced by the ones chosen by users. Users can use this architecture to implement their own applications that exploit the power of bidirectional transformations without the burden of installing and maintaining the bidirectional language package. ...|$|R
