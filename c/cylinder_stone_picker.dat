50|$|A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> (or rock picker) is an {{implement}} to sieve {{through the top}} layer of soil to separate and collect rocks and soil debris from good topsoil. It is usually tractor-pulled. A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> is similar in function to a rock windrower (rock rake); a <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> generally digs to greater depths to remove stones and rocks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> has digging teeth, a {{conveyor}} system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth {{are at the}} leading edge of the <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some <b>stone</b> <b>pickers</b> use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>pickers</b> {{are used}} in farming and landscaping, where stones need {{to be removed from}} the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm {{machinery}} (such as hay balers, combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using <b>stone</b> <b>pickers</b> is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground.|$|R

These consist of a stationary <b>stone</b> <b>cylinder</b> upon which a smaller <b>stone</b> <b>cylinder</b> rotates. Smaller ones, for household use, were operated by two people. Larger ones, for community or commercial use, used livestock to rotate the upper cylinder.|$|R

40|$|The {{equipment}} (Fig. 1) {{consists of}} a 10 -mm suction-irrigation pipe, Maelecot catheter (no. 30 / 32), and a small plastic contain-er with air-tight cap. The <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> (Fig. 2) is prepared as fol-lows. With {{the help of the}} hot metal perforator, a small hole of ~ 3 mm (air vent) diameter is made in the cap of the plastic con-tainer. A second hole of ~ 10 mm diameter is made in the side wall. A small length of Maelecot catheter is used to connect the box to the 10 -mm suction-irrigation pipe. The air vent is closed with the right index finger and the system is inserted through the 10 -mm (internal diameter) cannula (Fig. 3). Its tip should be placed near the stone to be extracted. The air vent is opened. As the intra-abdominal pressure (10 – 12 mmHg) is high, there is a gush of air through the cannula which takes the stone out. With this technique, stones less than 10 mm in diameter can be vent-ed out. Larger stones are crushed and then they can be dealt wit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new scheme {{of a highly}} {{efficient}} line for preparing safflower grains for processing consisting of an air-sieve separator, a magnetic separator, an ovary, a puppet, and a <b>stone</b> <b>picker.</b> The new after vortex separator is a vibroseparator for separating the products close in physical properties, grinding Machine with a duo-aspirator, a photoseparator and a device for moisture-thermal treatment. Advantages of the proposed line for preparation of safflower grain for processing are that an additional plant {{in front of the}} photocarerator of the grinding machine and duo-espirator allows the crest to separate and remove or refine the shell of the seed {{in the form of a}} shell layer for more efficient subsequent spectral point analysis, which determines the grain composition for the purpose of sorting it On the basis of chemical composition and color in the photo separator, and sequential placement after the stone separator of a vibro separator for separation of products close in physical properties, a grinding machine with a duo-aspirator, a photoseparator and a device for moisture-thermal treatment, provides an intensification of the technological process of efficient separation of safflower from impurities and its preparation for further processing and Due to the rational layout of equipment. A highly efficient photocell separator is also provided, the advantages of which are that the installation of a storage and vibrating feeder in relation to the slanting tray from the back side and the execution of a smooth curved transition to the vibrating feeder in the upper part of the pitcher allows improving the separation of grain products by reducing the amplitude of grain oscillations, Caused by a rebound from the surface of the tray during the loading of the sorted material from the vibrating feeder...|$|R

50|$|The Adam and Eve {{cylinder}} seal, {{also known}} as the ''''Temptation seal'''' is a small <b>stone</b> <b>cylinder</b> of Post-Akkadian origin, dating from about 2200 to 2100 BCE.

50|$|The {{house is}} square in plan, {{surrounded}} by twelve <b>stone</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{topped by a}} shallow pyramid roof, while at the centre lies a large courtyard beneath a flywire roof. Due to its remote location, the site was not originally connected to water or electricity. Because of this the house had to collect and store rainwater, so several of the <b>stone</b> <b>cylinders</b> house water tanks. The house also features a large schoolroom for the owner's homeschooled children. Internally, the private functions and services of the house line {{the walls of the}} courtyard with small windows onto the courtyard, leaving large open plan spaces along the perimeter of the building. The perimeter walls are fully glazed, opening onto deep verandas which allow for circulation inside the house.The main living space was originally heated by a large fireplace, however this proved to be ineffective, and the owners subsequently provided several extra wood burning heaters throughout the house.|$|R

40|$|Young {{plants of}} the palm, Astrocaryum jauari, are well-adapted anatomically and physiologically to hypoxic conditions. Annual {{inundation}} {{for as long}} as 300 days, at water temperatures of 28 -degrees-C, produce neither leaf loss nor rotting of the roots. At a depth of 1. 2 m beneath blackwaters, the leaves in the crowns of the plants show little decrease in the amount of chlorophyll. In contrast, submersion to an equal depth in whitewater produces a loss of chlorophyll. Photosynthetic oxygen production decreases to less than 30 percent of the terrestrial rate in plants submerged beneath blackwater, and to less than 10 percent in plants submerged in whitewater. Ethanol production compensates for temporary energy deficits. Respiration by the roots is greatly reduced but does not cease during inundation. Well-developed aerenchyma permits gas transport from the branches to the roots. A <b>cylinder</b> of <b>stone</b> cells and sclerenchyma fibers in the outer periphery of the primary bark prevents the collapse of the root aerenchyma due to reduced pressure within the roots and increasing external pressure as water depth rises...|$|R

25|$|Seals {{were used}} in the {{earliest}} civilizations and are of considerable importance in archaeology and art history. In ancient Mesopotamia carved or engraved <b>cylinder</b> seals in <b>stone</b> or other materials were used. These could be rolled along to create an impression on clay (which could be repeated indefinitely), and used as labels on consignments of trade goods, or for other purposes. They are normally hollow and it is presumed that they were worn on a string or chain round the neck. Many have only images, often very finely carved, with no writing, while others have both. From ancient Egypt seals in the form of signet-rings (see below), including some with the names of kings, have been found; these tend to show only names in hieroglyphics.|$|R

It differs according to the order, being plain in the Doric Order, fluted in the Ionic and foliate in the Corinthian. Doric and usually Ionic capitals are cut with vertical grooves known as [...] "fluting". This fluting or grooving of the columns is a retention of an element of the original wooden architecture.|$|R
