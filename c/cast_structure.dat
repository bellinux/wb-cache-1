Stellite {{was a major}} {{improvement in}} the production of poppet valves and valve seats for the valves, particularly exhaust valves, of internal combustion engines. By reducing their erosion from hot gases, the interval between maintenance and re-grinding of their seats was dramatically lengthened. The first third of the M2HB machine gun and M60 machine gun barrels (starting from the chamber) are lined with Stellite. The locking lugs and shoulders of Voere Titan II rifles were also made of Stellite.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the counter-force of prosthetic screws {{before and after}} the rectification procedure of the seating base of prosthetic framework screws. Methods: With a metal matrix containing three replicas of conical abutments (Micro-Unit; Conexão) placed at 10 mm from center to center, ten multiple <b>cast</b> <b>structures</b> were made of a titanium monoblock. The multiple <b>cast</b> <b>structures</b> were fastened onto the metal matrix abutments with a torque of 10 NCm. The screwing sequence was performed from the central pillar towards the distal ones.

This procedure was carried out before and after rectification of the seating base of the prosthetic screws, by means of a manual rectifier tip (Conexão Sistemas de Prótese, São Paulo, Brazil). The mean counter-torque values were calculated for each structure before and after rectification. The t-Test for paired samples was used to compare the evaluated situations.
