5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to <b>collude</b> with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in its objectives, UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Cheating on {{standardized}} tests {{has been a major}} concern as it potentially minimizes measurement precision. One major way to reduce cheating by collusion is to administer multiple forms of a test. Even with this approach, potential collusion is still quite large. A Latin-square treatment structure for distributing multiple forms is proposed to further reduce the <b>colluding</b> potential. An index to measure the extent of <b>colluding</b> potential is also proposed. Finally, with a simple algorithm, the various Latin-squares were explored to find the best structure to keep the <b>colluding</b> potential to a minimum.

40|$|Abstract — An anti-collusion {{fingerprinting}} {{system is}} developed to protect media files against time-varying collusion attacks {{based on the}} scalar Costa scheme (SCS) and <b>colluder</b> weight recovery. We treat the host signal as a parallel Gaussian channel and fingerprints as transmitted user signals. We decompose the Gaussian channel into multiple independent subchannels, and assign different user messages to different subchannels. Then, <b>colluder</b> weights in collusion attacks can be estimated using pilot symbols at the decoder, and all weights can be estimated and compensated. As a result, the decoding region on the parametric space can be recovered as an original format. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed fingerprinting system has excellent performance in <b>colluder</b> detection.

We adapt the concept of collusion-resistant Nash equilibrium to model protocols that are resilient to both crash failures and strategic manipulations {{of a group of}} <b>colluding</b> agents. For a system with $n$ distributed agents, we design a deterministic protocol that tolerates 2 <b>colluding</b> agents and a randomized protocol that tolerates $n - 1 $ <b>colluding</b> agents, and both tolerate any number of failures. We also show that if colluders are allowed an extra communication round after each synchronous round, there is no protocol that can tolerate even 2 <b>colluding</b> agents and 1 crash failure...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a new privacy-preserving {{elliptic}} curve based grouping proof protocol with <b>colluding</b> tag prevention(CTP) has been proposed.

In this paper, we show that the CTP protocol is vulnerable to some <b>colluding</b> tag attacking scenario. In addition, we propose a new {{elliptic curve}} based grouping protocol which can fix the problem. Our proposal {{is based on a}} formally proved privacy preserving authentication protocol and has the advantage of being resistant against <b>colluding</b> tags attacks with the same amount of computation...|$|R

Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, <b>collude</b> with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women.

25|$|The British wine merchants {{used this}} {{opportunity}} to leverage their strength {{in order to maximize}} profits. In 1727, they grouped together to form a trade association and built the Factory House, a private gentlemen's club, where they could meet and <b>collude</b> on details pertaining to the wine trade. They bought all the wine from growers on credit, holding off payment till the wine was sold. They built large warehouses in Vila Nova de Gaia where they could keep the wine for years aging. Less than scrupulous shippers also committed widespread wine fraud by importing grapes from regions outside the Douro to blend, as well as adding non-grape based wine ingredients like elderberry juice for coloring and dried pimentos to add spicy flavors. These tactics increased the leverage of the British shippers and meant they could set whatever prices they wanted to pay the Portuguese grape growers. To ensure more fair pricing, the growers often had to resort to more unorthodox business dealings such as the prostitution of their daughters to the British shippers.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or <b>collude</b> to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Shill bidding {{is where}} {{spurious}} bids are intro-duced into an auction {{to drive up}} the final price for the seller, thereby defrauding legitimate bidders. Trevathan and Read presented an algorithm to detect the presence of shill bidding in online auctions. The algorithm observes bidding patterns over a series of auctions, and gives each bidder a shill score to indicate the likelihood that they are engaging in shill behaviour. While the algorithm is able to accurately identify those with suspicious behaviour, it is designed for the instance where {{there is only one}} shill bidder. However, there are situations where there may be two or more shill bidders working in collusion with each other. <b>Colluding</b> shill bidders are able to engage in more sophisticated strategies that are harder to detect. This paper proposes a method for detecting <b>colluding</b> shill bidders, which {{is referred to as the}} collusion score. The collusion score, either detects a <b>colluding</b> group, or forces the colluders to act individually like a single shill, in which case they are detected by the shill score algorithm. The collusion score has been tested on simulated auction data and is able to successfully identify <b>colluding</b> shill bidders.

Braathens and SAS decided {{to divide the}} cross-subsidize the taxes between their routes, something Color Air {{was not able to}} do. This was because the tax was only valid for routes within Southern Norway; Braathens and SAS could therefore tacitly <b>collude</b> to increase the prices to Northern Norway, and thereby subsidize their routes in Southern Norway. Color Air on the other hand would be forced to put the full tax on all its departures. While the government had no way to hinder the incumbents from doing this, Gudmund Restad, Minister of Finance from the Center Party, encouraged the airlines to not [...] "cheat", and follow the intentions of the law, even if he admitted that there was nothing the government could do to hinder the airlines from cross-subsidizing.|$|E
500|$|Saladin {{structured}} the Ayyubid empire {{around the}} concept of collective sovereignty i.e. a confederation of principalities held together {{by the idea of}} family rule. Under this arrangement there existed numerous [...] "petty sultans" [...] while one family member, as-Sultan al-Mu'azzam, reigned supreme. After the death of Saladin, this coveted position became open to whomever was strong enough to seize it. Subsequent rivalry between the Ayyubids of Syria and Egypt reached a point where the rulers of each territory would at times <b>collude</b> with Crusaders against the other. Ayyubid rule differed in these two regions. In Syria, each major city was ruled as a relatively independent principality under an Ayyubid family member, while in Egypt the long tradition of centralized rule enabled the Ayyubids to maintain direct control over the province from Cairo. It was Baghdad, seat of the Caliphate, however, that exercised cultural and political hegemony over the Ayyubid territories, particularly those in Southwest Asia. For instance, the qadi ("chief justice") of Damascus was still appointed by the Abbasids during Ayyubid rule.|$|E

But with the book's allusions to Jasper's homosexuality, Yelin added that Lessing's [...] "critique of women's infatuation with patriarchal misogyny and their emotional dependence on misogynist men" [...] is muted by homophobia and the [...] "misogyny pervasive in patriarchal constructions of (male) heterosexuality". Lalbakhsh and Yahya noted that Lessing depicts Alice as a [...] "typical housewife" [...] who cares for her family, in this case, the squat, but is [...] "ignored and neglected".
