5|$|The <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> {{leading up}} to Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris had been very uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines. According to the historian Edward Grant, the theologians desired to condemn Aristotle's teachings on the eternity {{of the world and}} the unicity of the intellect.|$|E

5000|$|The terms {{virtuous circle}} and vicious circle (also {{referred}} to as virtuous cycle and vicious cycle) refer to complex <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that reinforce themselves through a feedback loop. A virtuous circle has favorable results, while a vicious circle has detrimental results. Both circles are complex <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> with no tendency toward equilibrium (social, economic, ecological, etc.) - {{at least in the}} short run. Both systems <b>of</b> <b>events</b> have feedback loops in which each iteration of the cycle reinforces the previous one (positive feedback).

5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not {{been used as a}} coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E

Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia, and the local authorities begin to incite Višegrad's non-Serb population against the town's Serb residents. The bridge with the old road to Sarajevo suddenly regains its importance, as the railway line is not adequate to transport all the materiel and soldiers who are preparing to attack Serbia in the autumn of 1914. Austria-Hungary's invasion is swiftly repulsed and the Serbians advance across the Drina, prompting the Austro-Hungarians to evacuate Višegrad and destroy portions of the bridge.|$|E

40|$|While Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) {{have become}} ubiquitous, testing them remains largely adhoc. Since {{the state of}} a GUI is {{modified}} by events on the GUI widgets, a useful approach is to consider test input for a GUI as an event sequence. Due to the combinatorial nature of these sequences, testing a GUI thoroughly is problematic and time-consuming. Moreover, the possible values for certain GUI widgets, such as a textbox, are also combinatorial compounding the problem. This paper presents Barad, a novel GUI testing framework based on symbolic execution. Barad addresses uniformly event-flow as well as data-flow in GUI applications: generating tests in the form <b>of</b> <b>event</b> sequences and data inputs. We generate test cases as <b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> listener method invocations and map these chains to event sequences that force the execution of those invocations. Since listeners for some events in the GUI are not present, this approach prunes significant regions <b>of</b> the <b>event</b> input space. We introduce symbolic widgets as {{a higher level of}} abstraction, which enables symbolic execution of GUI applications. We obtain data inputs through executing symbolically the generated test cases (<b>chains</b> <b>of</b> <b>event</b> listener method invocations). Barad generates significantly fewer tests compared to traditional GUI testing techniques, while improving branch and statement coverage. 1...|$|R

Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, Abdul Qadir was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance. To mitigate Daoud's suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the Saur Revolution (literally the April Revolution) was planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> which ended with the communists seizing power.

In advance, Dönitz had ordered a board of inquiry and court martial to clarify the circumstances of the shooting. During the court martial, Gottlob stated that, in accordance with his orders, he had asked for the password three times without receiving a response from the person, whom he could not visually identify in the darkness.

5|$|In Europe, {{deaths from}} {{smallpox}} often changed dynastic succession. The only surviving son of Henry VIII, Edward VI, died from complications shortly after apparently {{recovering from the}} disease, thereby nullifying Henry's efforts to ensure a male successor to the throne (his two immediate successors were both women, who had both had it and survived). Louis XV of France succeeded his great-grandfather Louis XIV {{through a series of}} deaths of smallpox or measles among those earlier in the succession line. He himself died of the disease in 1774. William III lost his mother to the disease when he was only ten years old in 1660, and named his uncle Charles as legal guardian: her death from smallpox would indirectly spark a <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events</b> that would eventually lead to the permanent ousting of the Stuart line from the British throne.

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The <b>chain</b> <b>of</b> <b>events,</b> as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
