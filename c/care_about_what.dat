Despite earlier criticism, many fans commented and {{circulated}} {{that he should not}} be sorry, with many from India supporting him. Even during his arrival from Dubai back to Pakistan, {{a few days after the}} rest of the team, fans chanted 'Boom Boom Afridi' at the airport amidst high security.|$|E

500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy Remixed was generally negative. Emily Tartanella of PopMatters {{explained that the}} remixers' efforts ultimately make Bloc Party's work [...] "less engaging, less meaningful". Ben Patashnik of NME stated that the album is largely monotonous and includes too many pedestrian experiments in dance music. Drowned in Sound's Chris Power indicated that [...] "in putting their names to the album Bloc Party {{seem to be saying}} they either don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they ask fans to spend their money on or they don't know much about electronic music".|$|E

[...] He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other. Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the [...] "red reality" [...] and gave the episode a [...] "B+", writing that [...] "Jake reminded [...] of Al Pacino's aging [...] in Donnie Brasco." [...] Sepinwall liked Jake's actor, Lawrence, praising his appearance on the Awake episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{murder of}} {{the heir to the}} Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife {{produced}} widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not really <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.. Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied [...] "Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government." [...] An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Chargé d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.|$|E

After Singer's statement, Dickinson reappeared on a subsequent broadcast of Entertainment Tonight to reassert her account from her prior interview on the program. In addition, she publicized photographs she took with a Polaroid camera of Cosby wearing a checkered bathrobe {{in order to support}} her assertions. In the interview with Kevin Frazier she stated her account was the truth: [...] "It is not a lie. It is my right as a woman. I have to speak up {{and you have to be}} able to go in and just be brave and do it for all the women that can't come forward." [...] She explained her motivation for going public and her desire for her voice to be heard: [...] "The loss of innocence that I suffered and that these women suffered is why I'm sitting here today. And I don't <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Cosby or networks or anybody says, you will hear me." ...|$|E

Unsatisfied with his physical conditioning, he began attending a gym as an 11-year-old. Despite this, Colón has stated {{that he did not}} intend to become a wrestler at first and only did so for exercise. It was not until completing his college education that he decided to train, after noticing that his condition was on par with the wrestlers despite his age. However, despite this Colón initially expected to retire within ten years and run a private business. He admits that during this initial stage, he received peer pressure to match the accomplishments of his father. Colón's decision to sign with World Wrestling Entertainment was a controversial one among the Puerto Rican wrestling community. He was criticized by the locals, labeled as someone who had [...] "sold out" [...] his Puerto Rican wrestling traditions over for the [...] "flash and flair" [...] of the American company. Colón spoke of this in an interview with The Sun in which he stated [...] "I did not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they thought. I've always dreamed of working for the WWE when I was young, and I took that chance when it came".|$|E

She begins a {{relationship}} with Ben (now played by Harry Reid), which is discovered by Emma Summerhayes (Anna Acton) who informs Max of the relationship. [...] Max demands that Abi does not see Ben anymore, which Abi refuses to do. Abi later discovers that Max used Ben to sign over part of Phil's businesses to him. In February 2015, Abi is accused by Max of killing Lucy. Abi did not kill Lucy, but it is revealed that on the night Lucy died, Abi had a confrontation with Lucy about her affair with Max, which resulted in Abi slapping Lucy.

After she moves in, Ben reveals {{to her that he}} might still be gay and is worried he will never get over his homosexuality but Abi assures him that they will make things work. She continuously mocks Jay and accuses him of being jealous of her relationship with Ben. Jay tries to make Abi see that Ben is not interested in her, but she pretends not to <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Jay says. Abi discovers a letter from Sharon's birth mother and Sharon says that she intends on meeting her birth father after discovering that her mother has died. When Paul Coker (Jonny Labey) arrives in Walford, Abi suspects Ben of cheating on her with Paul. She and Ben have sex, so Ben can convince her he is not gay. Following Ben's arrest for Lucy's murder, Abi tells Phil that Max assaulted Lucy to get Ben off. Despite being innocent, Max turns himself in and is formally charged while Ben is released. Stacey visits Max, who tells her that he thinks Abi killed Lucy. Stacey confronts Abi, who attacks Stacey, blaming her for her parents' split and Bradley's death, and later vents to Carol that she does not think Max cares about her. Carol visits Max in prison, where he informs her that the reason he thinks Abi killed Lucy is because she attacked and beat her {{on the night of the}} murder. After confronting Abi on this, Carol agrees that she has been out of control lately and advises her to call Tanya for moral support. During the phone call, Abi finds out that not only is Oscar ill, but Cora had apparently not stayed with Tanya at her house as she had earlier said. Abi, Carol and Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) find Cora living rough and bring her home. She reveals she saw Max and Abi cleaning the car lot after Lucy was killed, forcing Abi to admit that Max and Lucy had argued there and she was helping Max clean Lucy's blood. Abi then gives a statement to the police. Max is later found guilty of the murder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{elements}} of the ceremony have changed little over the Mafia's history. These elements {{have been the subject}} of much curiosity and speculation. [...] Sociologist Diego Gambetta points out that the Mafia, being a secretive criminal organization, cannot risk having its recruits sign application forms and written contracts which might be seized by the police. [...] Thus they rely on the old-fashioned ritual ceremony. [...] The {{elements of}} the ceremony are made deliberately specific, bizarre, and painful so that the event is both memorable and unambiguous, and the ceremony is witnessed by a number of senior mafiosi. The participants may not even <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the symbols mean, and they may indeed have no intrinsic meaning. [...] The real point of the ritual is to leave no doubt about the mafioso's new status so that it cannot be denied or revoked on a whim.|$|E

The letter cited his poor attendance of the House of Commons and bad treatment of Canada's Turkish and Macedonian community as reasons to be considered unfit. According to Tsai, Karygiannis contacted him by telephone saying he did not <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they had written and expressing content that the authors of the letter [...] "had been able to write in English". In his public response, Karygiannis denied making such a comment and complained that the letter was signed in part by [...] "Turks and Macedonians, who don't like it, because I am Greek, and they have problems with Greeks." [...] As for Tsai's discontent, Karygiannis explained it by the Conservative candidate's feelings after having got [...] "his butt kicked" [...] during the election.|$|E
2500|$|Importantly, the ready-to-hand only {{emerges from}} the prior {{attitude}} in which we <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{is going on and}} we see the hammer in a context or world of equipment that is handy or remote, and that is there [...] "in order to" [...] do something. In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be. Only by studying our [...] "average-everyday" [...] understanding of the world, as it is expressed in the totality of our relationships to the ready-to-hand entities of the world, can we lay appropriate bases for specific scientific investigations into specific entities within the world.|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} game 4 out of 10, accusing it of [...] "strangely lacking in soul, and {{consistently}} failing {{to make you}} <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you're doing and why." [...] He also found the game too easy; [...] "there's rarely any requirement {{to play the game}} skillfully. You just charge in all-guns-blazing, snap between targets with the hugely generous auto-aim facility and blitz one obliging enemy after another. At the core there remains an enjoyably precise combat system, but EA has predictably pandered to the mysterious demands of the audience of players who want games to be played for them and want zero challenge [...] the sight of you and your AI buddies charging around getting raked with gunfire and sprinting away unharmed is a pathetic sight, and smacks of game designers not even bothering to try anymore." [...] He concluded [...] "this is a stark return to the EA of old, where a treasured licence is butchered irredeemably. Lacking both a challenge and soul, and failing to even engage on a narrative level, what you're left with is an overly forgiving shooter with weak strategy elements." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Publishers Weekly {{reviewer}} selected Sniegoski's [...] "Noah's Orphans" [...] as {{the best}} of the four stories noting that [...] "Sniegoski manages to make a far-fetched setup both plausible and moving". The editor at SFRevu wrote [...] "the depth of characterization and emotional conflict [...] stands out". The Entertainment Examiner reviewer identified both [...] "Noah's Orphans" [...] and Butcher's [...] "The Warrior" [...] as equally the best stories saying “Both Sniegoski and Butcher infuse their characters...with solid, relatable emotion that truly makes you <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> is going on. Their action and dialogue is tense and engaging, even in the calmest scene, and the details they use are vivid enough to create a strong mental image of the scene without taking over the story." [...] Other reviewers found [...] "The Warrior" [...] to be typical of the Harry Dresden series. Richardson's [...] "The Third Death of the Little Clay Dog" [...] was called [...] "a delightful tale" [...] and [...] "an intriguing mystery" [...] that [...] "neatly merges noir conventions with a fantastical plot", though the characterization was panned as being [...] "flat and inexpressive". Though described as [...] "a roller coaster ride of a story" [...] and [...] "wildly imaginative" [...] Green's [...] "The Difference A Day Makes" [...] was found to employ [...] "gratuitous macabre writing" [...] in trying to describe [...] "increasingly twisted and depraved scenarios, using the same stock descriptions and dialogue". Another reviewer wrote that [...] "Green goes overboard" [...] describing Nightside so that [...] "story is more about the setting than any actual plot... the ending feel like a letdown".|$|E
