40|$|AbstractToday, {{innovative}} lightweight constructions {{and highly}} complex parts for aircraft {{can be realized}} by Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM), also called 3 D-printing, in a time-saving and cost-efficient way. However, these new production technologies are not only considered for lightweight components {{but also for the}} manufacturing of molds, tools and jigs. In this context the additive manufacturing of heated compression molds for the production of thermoset composites by using a Selective Laser Melting (SLM) or also called Laser Beam Melting (LBM) process is particularly promising. In comparison to conventional machining the additive tool manufacturing obtains shortened time for development, simplified of the production due to less process steps, reduced production lead time and a general cost reduction. By the way, less energy consumption and improved material usage for the manufacturing of composite molds are further benefits, which cause an additional increase of the cost efficiency and economical sustainability. Moreover, an optimization of the fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) part quality, an improvement of the reproducibility of manufacturing processes and a higher freedom of the part design can be realized due to a higher complexity of the mold geometry, an increased functional integration, new design approaches of heating channel systems and an improved temperature distribution of the additive manufactured compression molds. Consequently, these new composite tool manufacturing opportunities promise enormous potentials, but also several challenges for the future production of aircraft components. This paper deals with a first feasibility analysis of the Additive Layer Manufacturing of heated composite molds, jigs and tools for aerospace industries. Furthermore, the additive manufacturing of a heated research mold for a Sheet Molding <b>Compound</b> (SMC) <b>aircraft</b> component and first investigation findings of the influences on the manufacturing process parameters by using this research mold are further key aspects of the present work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSensory {{effects in}} eyes and airways are common {{symptoms}} reported by aircraft crew and office workers. Neurological symptoms, such as headache, {{have also been}} reported. To assess the commonality and differences in exposures and health symptoms, a literature search of aircraft cabin and office air concentrations of non-reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ozone-initiated terpene reaction products were compiled and assessed. Data for tricresyl phosphates, in particular tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCP), were also compiled, {{as well as information}} on other risk factors such as low relative humidity. A conservative health risk assessment for eye, airway and neurological effects was undertaken based on a “worst-case scenario” which assumed a simultaneous constant exposure for 8 h to identified maximum concentrations in aircraft and offices. This used guidelines and reference values for sensory irritation for eyes and upper airways and airflow limitation; a tolerable daily intake value was used for ToCP. The assessment involved the use of hazard quotients or indexes, defined as the summed ratio(s) (%) of compound concentration(s) divided by their guideline value(s). The concentration data suggest that, under the assumption of a conservative “worst-case scenario”, aircraft air and office concentrations of the compounds in question {{are not likely to be}} associated with sensory symptoms in eyes and airways. This is supported by the fact that maximum concentrations are, in general, associated with infrequent incidents and brief exposures. Sensory symptoms, in particular in eyes, appear to be exacerbated by environmental and occupational conditions that differ in aircraft and offices, e. g., ozone incidents, low relative humidity, low cabin pressure, and visual display unit work. The data do not support airflow limitation effects. For ToCP, in view of the conservative approach adopted here and the rareness of reported incidents, the health risk of exposure to this <b>compound</b> in <b>aircraft</b> is considered negligible...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} the climate and air quality impacts of aviation requires detailed measurements of the emissions of intermediate-volatility and semi-volatile organic <b>compounds</b> (I/SVOCs) from <b>aircraft.</b> Currently both the amount and chemical composition of aircraft I/SVOC emissions remain poorly characterized. Here we characterize I/SVOC emissions from aircraft, using a novel instrument for the online, quantitative measurement of the mass loading and composition of low-volatility organic vapors. Emissions from the NASA DC 8 aircraft were sampled on the ground, 143 m downwind of the engines and characterized {{as a function of}} engine power from ground idle (~ 4 % maximum rated thrust) through 85 % power. Results show that I/SVOC emissions are highest during engine-idle operating conditions, with decreasing but non-zero I/SVOC emissions at higher engine powers. Comparison of I/SVOC emissions with total hydrocarbon (THC) measurements, VOC measurements, and an established emissions profile indicates that I/SVOCs comprise 10 – 20 % of the total organic gas phase emissions at idle, and an increasing fraction of the total gas phase organic emissions at higher powers. Positive matrix factorization of online mass spectra is used to identify three distinct types of I/SVOC emissions: aliphatic, aromatic and oxygenated. The volatility and chemical composition of the emissions suggest that unburned fuel is the dominant source of I/SVOCs at idle, while pyrolysis products make up an increasing fraction of the I/SVOCs at higher powers. Oxygenated I/SVOC emissions were detected at lower engine powers (≤ 30 %) and may be linked to cracked, partially oxidized or unburned fuel components...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{satellite}} and aircraft observations have been integrated to better quantify {{the distribution and}} temporal variability of surface emissions at global and regional scales. This presentation will give examples of approaches {{using a combination of}} space-borne instruments, aircraft data collected during field campaigns, and atmospheric modeling. These methods have also been used to assess the capability of future space missions to provide a better understanding of emissions. We discuss several case studies demonstrating an approach to evaluate NOx emissions at a sector level by comparing satellite retrievals and in-situ aircraft sampling to regional and global chemical-transport model calculations of NO 2 columns. These studies address impacts of NOx emissions controls at US power plants and the quantification of NOx emissions from motor vehicles, industrial facilities, and ports in US cities and in megacities around the globe. Space-borne instruments in geostationary (GEO) orbit will soon monitor major air pollutants across North America, Europe, and Asia. We investigate the possibility that GEO observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns can provide information about urban volatile organic <b>compound</b> (VOC) emissions. <b>Aircraft</b> observations constrain model simulations of the emissions of primary VOC species and their atmospheric oxidation to form HCHO. Model simulations of tropospheric HCHO columns are then compared with retrievals from current satellite instruments in low earth orbit and from proposed GEO instruments.

40|$|Hydroxyl radical (OH) is {{the main}} daytime oxidant in the {{troposphere}} and determines the atmospheric lifetimes of many <b>compounds.</b> We use <b>aircraft</b> measurements of O 3, H 2 O, NO, and other species from the Convective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics (CONTRAST) field campaign, which occurred in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) during January–February 2014, to constrain a photochemical box model and estimate concentrations of OH throughout the troposphere. We find that tropospheric column OH (OHCOL) inferred from CONTRAST observations is 12 to 40 % higher than found in chemical transport models (CTMs), including CAM-chem-SD run with 2014 meteorology as well as eight models that participated in POLMIP (2008 meteorology). Part of this discrepancy {{is due to a}} clear-sky sampling bias that affects CONTRAST observations; accounting for this bias and also for a small difference in chemical mechanism results in our empirically based value of OHCOL being 0 to 20 % larger than found within global models. While these global models simulate observed O 3 reasonably well, they underestimate NOx (NO + NO 2) by a factor of 2, resulting in OHCOL ~ 30 % lower than box model simulations constrained by observed NO. Underestimations by CTMs of observed CH 3 CHO throughout the troposphere and of HCHO in the upper troposphere further contribute to differences between our constrained estimates of OH and those calculated by CTMs. Finally, our calculations do not support the prior suggestion of the existence of a tropospheric OH minimum in the TWP, because during January–February 2014 observed levels of O 3 and NO were considerably larger than previously reported values in the TWP...|$|R
40|$|The NASA DC- 8 and P- 3 B {{aircraft}} flew {{within about}} a kilometer {{or less of}} each other on three occasions during the Transport and Chemical Evolution Over the Pacific (TRACE-P) campaign in order to intercompare similar measurements on the two aircraft. The first and last intercomparisons were in relatively remote marine environments during transits to and from Asia. The first began with a boundary layer measurement followed by an ascent to 3 km. The second set of intercomparisons was at a fixed altitude of about 5. 2 km {{off the coast of}} Japan, also in relatively clean air. Finally, the third measurement began at 5. 3 km and then descended into the boundary layer. A number of measurements were compared with the best agreement observed for the most abundant compounds such as CO 2 and CH 4 and with very good agreement for CO, O 3, and j values. Other comparisons, including measurements of the same <b>compounds</b> on both <b>aircraft</b> and measurements of the same compound by two different instruments on the DC- 8, varied over a wide range from quite good for PAN, NO, HNO 3, H 2 O; to reasonable agreement for OH, HO 2 CH 2 O, acetone, and methylethylketone; and to generally poor for NO 2,SO 2, PPN, acetaldehyde, and methanol. The comparison results, particularly those for the fast 1 -s CO and O 3 measurements, suggest that credible intercomparisons can be made using two aircraft in close proximity for relatively long lifetime and stable compounds. Much new understanding can also be gained from measurements of more reactive and generally shorter lifetime compounds, but additional improvements are needed to make such studies as meaningful as those of longer lifetime compounds. Comparisons such as these, made as a component of a larger field campaign, have the advantage that they test the actual instrument configuration used during the field study and they require no additional instrument installation and testing...|$|R
40|$|O presente estudo justifica-se pelo crescente aumento da economia e conseqüentemente dos diferentes tipos de transportes para viabilizar esta economia, a exemplo do transporte aéreo que vem crescendo significativamente.

O aeroporto situa-se a 749 m de altitude com ventos médios de 129 graus e velocidade média de cinco nós, temperatura média de 19 graus centígrados e umidade relativa do ar média de 80 por cento. Um bioindicador vegetal proposto foi a Tradescantia pallida, com 15 floreiras em cada ponto mencionado, analisando o potencial mutagênico através dos números de micronúcleos (Trad-MCN) e metais pesados impregnados nas folhas da planta, sendo coletadas as inflorescências e folhas mensalmente durante um ano e meio. Para caracterizar a área de estudo foi analisado o material particulado presente nos diversos pontos, utilizou-se amostradores mini-vol, com exposição por 24 horas em sete coletas durante um ano. Para verificar os compostos orgânicos voláteis (COVs), foram feitas três coletas através de canisters. As maiores concentrações de gases provenientes da queima do querosene foram encontradas nos pontos: pátio, pista L e bairro. Os resultados indicaram uma correlação positiva (p= 0, 034) entre COVs e MCN, {{no local}} de maior concentração (pátio, indicando que os compostos orgânicos voláteis provenientes de combustível de aeronaves (QAV) apresentaram componentes capazes de causar mutagenicidade em nosso estudo. The worthiness {{of this study}} lies on the fact that, within the scenario of the multiplication of various kinds of transportation means resulting from the economical development, the growing use of air transportation means has been quite significant. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify a mutagenic potential effects caused by aircraft fuel on a vegetable indicator. The locations selected to carry out this research are the São Paulo International Airport Guarulhos (points: tower, apron, runway L and runway R), an adjoining district which lies within the route of the aircrafts, and Parque Estadual da Cantareira (a public park), 16 km away from the airport and apparently not impacted by the aircraft traffic (reference point). The airport lies at an altitude of 749 meters, with average winds of 129 degrees and average speed of five knots, average temperature of 19 degrees centigrade and air relative humidity of 80 per cent. The vegetal bioindicator propos, the Tradescantia pallida, with 15 flowerbeds placed in each of the locations mentioned above, which were used for the observation of the mutagenic potential through the analysis of the amounts of micronuclei (Trad-MCN) and heavy metals accumulated on the leaves.

40|$|Amino acids, as {{building}} blocks of living species, are ubiquitous. Their presence in atmospheric precipitation and aerosols has been noted for many years; however, measurements of their abundance in aerosol are scarce. As a result, relatively little is understood about their sources, and impact on ecological systems and atmospheric processes. In this thesis project, I have made measurements of amino acids and aliphatic amines in aerosol samples collected at three locations (Hong Kong, Nanjing, and Jeju Island, S. Korea) in the Eastern Asia region from 2000 to 2002. The sampling locations ranged from rural surroundings (e. g., Hok Tsui in Hong Kong and Jeju Island) to highly urbanized locations (e. g., Mong Kok in Hong Kong and Nanjing). A set of 14 aerosol samples collected on research aircraft were also included in this project. Aerosol particles collected on filter substrates were extracted with water. Amino compounds in the water extracts were subsequently derivatized with a fluorescence agent, separated on a high performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) column, and detected by a fluorescence detector. The concentrations of total free and hydrolysable amino compounds were found to range from 604 - 2788 pmol/m 3 and 775 - 3197 pmol/m 3. These levels {{were similar to those}} observed in continental locations in the U. S., but much lower than those measured over the oceans. Higher levels of amino compounds were observed in samples collected in urban areas in comparison with rural locations. Nanjing had the highest levels and Jeju Island had the lowest levels of amino compounds among all the sampling locations. Among the three sampling locations in Hong Kong, the rural site Hok Tsui had the lowest concentrations whereas the roadside site Mong Kok and the urban site Tsuen Wan had higher concentrations of amino <b>compounds.</b> The <b>aircraft</b> samples also show that the pollution-dominated layer was found to be most abundant in amino compounds. Both the ground-based and aircraft measurements suggested that urban centers were sources for amino compounds in aerosols. Analysis of size segregated aerosol samples indicated that the aerosol size distribution of amino compounds was bimodal, one major fine mode and one minor coarse mode. The majority of amino compounds were present in particles less than 2. 5 μm. This discounts ocean as a major source for aerosol amino compounds since sea salt aerosol materials are mainly in the coarse mode. This also excludes soil dusts as an important source for airborne amino compounds because dust particles are dominated by the coarse mode. It is speculated that the fine mode amino compounds likely come from gas-particle conversion or bioaerosols of small sizes, but the exact pathway has yet to be identified. The most abundant amino compounds were glycine and methylamine. The few abundant amino compounds were highly correlated in samples collected in Hong Kong, suggesting common sources. The Nanjing samples, however, lacked good correlations among the abundant amino compounds, indicating sources for amino compounds might be location-dependent. Amino compounds in aerosols are a source of biologically utilizable nitrogen for ecosystems. As water-soluble compounds. they could also act as cloud condensation nuclei; thereby play a role in atmospheric processes that affect global climate and regional visibility. The abundance of amino compounds observed in this project signals that further work is needed to understand the sources of this group of compounds...|$|R
40|$|Most {{conceptual}} design techniques for aircraft implicitly {{assume that the}} aircraft manufacturer operates in a monopoly. This is because these techniques do not directly account for the possible actions of a competitor. By examining several motivating examples from the aviation industry, {{it was determined that}} {{in the presence of a}} competitor the design of an aircraft can be impacted. Therefore, current design approaches were deemed lacking because they do not account for the fact that aircraft markets are best characterized as a duopoly where two manufacturers are competing for market share. It was also determined that most forms of competition can be categorized as technology infusions or enterprise-based solutions. There was a need identified to determine how to select an appropriate strategy in the presence of competition. This problem is further complicated by the inherent uncertainty that exists in designing an <b>aircraft</b> <b>compounded</b> with the lack of perfect knowledge of a competitor. The main objective of this dissertation was to construct a framework for facilitating the direct comparison between an aircraft design and a competitor's design during the early phases of {{conceptual design}}. This framework should parametrically account for design considerations and possible competitive strategies in an integrated environment to not only analyze the physical performance of an aircraft, but also the economic viability for a given market. This lead to the development of the Competition-influenced Decision Support (CoDeS) Framework, which allows for the interactive exploration of competitive strategies using exploratory or normative forecasting. These strategies were assessed using a validated modeling and simulation environment by implementing the established technique of k-factors to represent technology strategies and the developed technique of λ-factors to represent enterprise strategies. In order to gain a clear understanding about the interdependencies that exist between an aircraft design, a competitor's design, and competitive strategies (technology and enterprise), the effects of uncertainty were mitigated using a two-step approach. First, the large variability from the effects of uncertainty where mitigated by using scenario-based analysis. Secondly, a hybrid formulation using a modified Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratio approach combined with a multi-criteria decision making technique. Two techniques were considered: an overall evaluation criterion and the technique for ordered preferences by similarity to ideal solution to compare strategies between two aircraft competing for market share. Finally, the CoDeS Framework was implemented for three use cases in order to demonstrate its capabilities. The first use case examined an exploratory forecasting approach for analyzing a proposed enterprise strategy. The second use case examined normative forecasting of enterprise strategies in order to determine a minimum threshold for a competitive strategy. Finally, the third use case examined a hypothetical scenario of two aircraft manufacturers trying to enter the Asian market [...] in this scenario, one manufacturer competes using technologies and the other competes using a maintenance-based enterprise strategy. The completion of this research yielded a parametric, integrated framework that can be used interactively in order to assess the effects of competition during the conceptual design of an aircraft.
