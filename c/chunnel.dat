The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the <b>Chunnel</b> from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E

Packed full {{of people}} and animals that Weapon XII has turned into mindless slaves, {{confusion}} runs rampant. Knowing {{that those who have}} fallen prey to Weapon XII's influence are lost, Fantomex kills Darkstar and all others who are mentally connected to the creature. After Fantomex destroys Weapon XII by using a remote detonator, it is noticed that there are two empty Weapon Plus transport tubes in the Chunnel: one that held the violent Weapon XII and another that held something called Weapon XIII. After the battle, Fantomex's ceramic mask slips a bit and Jean Grey uses her telepathy to deduce his true identity: Fantomex is actually Weapon XIII and had also been in transit in the <b>Chunnel.</b> It was during the accident in the <b>Chunnel</b> that he escaped and was subsequently chased to the X-Corporation building. He confesses to Jean Grey that he is not the master thief that he had claimed, but is now set out to earn that reputation. He assures Jean Grey that he refuses to be anyone's soldier, and as a result Jean Grey allows Fantomex to disappear into the <b>Chunnel</b> before the authorities arrive.|$|E

50|$|During {{his first}} appearance, Fantomex seeks {{a safe haven}} at the X-Corporation in Paris while fleeing from authorities. He {{claims to be a}} mutant thief with the {{ill-defined}} power of misdirection. Bleeding profusely from bullet wounds, he asks for asylum, which Professor X grants him. Fantomex explains to Professor X and Jean Grey that he is being hunted because {{he is one of the}} most wanted thieves in Europe. Neither Professor X nor Jean Grey are able to verify his claims due to his ceramic mask, a device that blocks their mental probes. However, they agree to aid him, and after escaping the soldiers who surround the building, Fantomex uses his ship E.V.A. (named, in yet another reference, after Diabolik's lover Eva Kant) to take Professor X and Jean Grey to his home in France. While there, he introduces them to his mother and continues to describe his success as a thief. In fact, he tells the two that he has stolen sensitive information about the Weapon Plus project while in the <b>Chunnel,</b> and offers to sell it to Professor Xavier for $1 billion. After submitting his proposal, he puts himself in a light hypnotic trance and removes the bullets that riddle his body. Finished, he asks Professor X and Jean Grey to accompany him back to the <b>Chunnel</b> in an effort to destroy Weapon XII. The three speed away in E.V.A., leaving the house and elderly woman behind.|$|E

50|$|When the Kingpin enacts {{a plot to}} use the Channel Tunnel as a {{means of}} {{establishing}} an international crime network, he hires Rapido to assist him, along with fellow assassins Snakebite, Chauffard, and Batroc the Leaper. When the Punisher travels to Europe and begins investigating the <b>Chunnel</b> plan, Rapido and the other mercenaries ambush him and his companion, Morgan Sinclair, and shoot their helicopter down over the Vosges. Rapido and the other hitmen then go after a group of Swiss and Italian mobsters in Geneva, but their attempt to kill all of them is foiled by the Punisher and Sinclair. Rapido and his allies track the Punisher and Sinclair down to Spain, but the duo escapes them again, so Rapido and the others reconvene in London.|$|E
50|$|The Channel Tunnel (Le tunnel sous la Manche; also {{referred}} to as the <b>Chunnel)</b> is a 50.5-kilometre (31.4 mi) undersea rail tunnel (linking Folkestone, Kent, in the United Kingdom with Coquelles, Pas-de-Calais, near the city of Calais in northern France) beneath the English Channel at the Strait of Dover. Ideas for a cross-Channel fixed link appeared as early as 1802, but British political and press pressure over compromised national security stalled attempts to construct a tunnel. The eventual successful project, organised by Eurotunnel, began construction in 1988 and was opened by British Queen Elizabeth II and French President François Mitterrand in a ceremony held in Calais on 6 May 1994. The same year the American Society of Civil Engineers elected the Channel Tunnel as one of the seven modern Wonders of the World.|$|E
50|$|Few public details {{have yet}} been {{released}} by the Indonesian Government about these matters. A thorough cost-benefit analysis is not yet available. A well-informed public discussion has therefore not yet been possible. The Indonesian government's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknology, or BPPT) has sponsored a number of preliminary discussions about aspects of the possible bridge technology in recent years. Some of the difficult technical, financial and economic issues involved {{in the construction of}} the Channel Tunnel between the United Kingdom and France appear to be relevant for planning about the best arrangements for a transport connection across the Sunda Strait. Demand forecasts for the use of the <b>Chunnel</b> Tunnel, for example, turned out to be far too optimistic thus leading to a benefit shortfall. The result was that revenues received through the operation of the tunnel were much less than expected during the first few years of operation.|$|E
5000|$|In {{everyday}} {{foreign exchange}} market trading and news reporting, the currency pairs are often referred to by nicknames rather than their symbolic nomenclature. These are often reminiscent of national or geographic connotations. The GBP/USD pairing is known by traders as cable (also the cable), which has its origins from the time when a communications cable under the Atlantic Ocean synchronized the GBP/USD quote between the London and New York markets. GBP is also referred to by traders as quid. The following nicknames are common: [...] "Swissy" [...] or [...] "Euro-Swissy" [...] for EUR/CHF, Fiber for EUR/USD, <b>Chunnel</b> for EUR/GBP, Loonie and The Funds for USD/CAD, Aussie for AUD/USD, Gopher for USD/JPY, Guppy for GBP/JPY, Yuppy for EUR/JPY, and Kiwi or The Bird for the New Zealand Dollar NZD/USD pairing. New innovations include Barney for USD/RUB and Betty for EUR/RUB after the fictional characters the Rubbles in The Flintstones. Additionally, exotic pairs have earned more esoteric nicknames such as [...] "Glock" [...] for COP/SGN after the service pistol often carried by police officers (the ticker {{can be viewed as}} (Cop's G(u)n)). Nicknames vary between the trading centers in New York, London, and Tokyo.Care should be taken with the use of 'Betty, for EUR/RUB as, in London markets 'Betty' is used as cockney slang for Cable as in Betty Grable = Cable = GBP/USD.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new algorithm, <b>CHUNNEL,</b> to automatically find, characterize, and display tunnels or pores in proteins. The correctness {{and accuracy of}} the algorithm is verified on a constructed set of proteins and used to analyze large sets of real proteins. The verification set contains proteins with artificially created pores of known path and width profile. The previous benchmark algorithm, HOLE, is compared with the new algorithm. Results show that the major advantage of the new algorithm {{is that it can}} successfully find and characterize tunnels with no a priori guidance or clues about the location of the tunnel mouth, and it will successfully find multiple tunnels if present. <b>CHUNNEL</b> can also be used in conjunction with HOLE, with the former used to prime HOLE and the latter to track and characterize the pores. Analysis was conducted on families of membrane protein structures culled from the Protein Data Bank as well as on a set of transmembrane proteins with predicted membrane-aqueous phase interfaces, yielding the first completely automated examination of tunnels through membrane proteins, including tunnels that exit in the membrane bilayer...|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was part of}} the session : Pre-, Trans-, Cross-, Multi-Disciplinary 24 th National Conference on the Beginning Design StudentSix years ago, Idaho's Dept. of Architecture began to question the relevance of its art based beginning design foundation. As one of a few programs tied to a broader college art core, our faculty was beginning to question whether this pre-disciplinary core was essential to the education of an architect. While this debate was in progress, the university upper administration in the grips of the post 9 / 11 financial crisis decided to eliminate our poorly funded College of Art and Architecture which merged into a much larger College of Letters, Arts and Social Sciences. Then came the tipping point [...] . it was announced that the Fine Arts Program would be eliminated from the university. Unanimous protest erupted from the architecture faculty and alumni as well as other prominent artists and citizens within the state. One of the more interesting members of this group of architecture alums is surprisingly not an architect, but a construction manager, (Jack Lemley) who took charge of the lagging construction effort of the English <b>Chunnel</b> and most recently, the rescue of Boston's Big Dig. After two years of organized protest, the Idaho State Board of Education restored the College of Art and Architecture which has resulted in a re-invigoration and confidence in art and the need for an all college interdisciplinary core shared between Art, Landscape Architecture, Virtual Technology Design, Architecture and Interior Design. The college is {{now in the process of}} re-thinking the core art curriculum with high hopes of establishing a curriculum that will unite the college's knowledge silos and create a student who is not afraid to cross disciplines when tackling a problem. This paper challenges the notion that one must be introduced immediately into a specialized discipline. In an age when it is comfortable to slip into the familiar surroundings of knowledge silos, we are at a time when flexible interdisciplinary thinking is highly encouraged with-in academia and the outside world. This paper asserts that a pre-disciplinary core is necessary in order to be interdisciplinary and transdiciplinary. Like our biological blastema cells whose DNA awaits the last bit of instruction to form into either a fingernail, or a brain neuron, our students need a flexible core of knowledge that can be utilized across disciplines. At a time when global warming could narrow our architectural education towards efficient linear engineering curriculums, we need a strong counterbalance of humanities and art to challenge and expand our students' thinking. This paper will reflect on the second year of progress from our College's Foundation Committee with its debates, alternatives, political struggles and logistical challenges. It is hoped that interested parties from the Beginning Design Conference will contribute to the re-thinking of our new core and the inevitable debates that will follow...|$|E
