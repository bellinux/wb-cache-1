40|$|<b>Commuter’s</b> modal {{choice is}} a complex {{phenomenon}} in urban transportation. It is a key determinant of modern transport planning. <b>Commuters</b> always {{want to get a}} hold on any mode at any point of time to meet their travel demand and the selection of mode depends on various factors associated with the commuting. In Savar Pourashava, modal choice by <b>commuters</b> varies with <b>commuter’s</b> socio-economic background and demographic characteristics. It also varies with the services that are provided by the various modes operating in the study area. The land use characteristics also affect the travel behavior pattern of <b>commuters</b> in the study area. The attitude and preference of <b>commuters</b> towards modes are also varied from each other. For achieving efficient and reliable transportation system in terms of modal choice of the <b>commuters</b> in the study area, it is essential to identity various factors affecting the travel pattern of the <b>commuters.</b> This research has attempted to identity these factors in modal choice and investigated over the mode that has been preferred by individual <b>commuters</b> and the reasons for selection of the mode.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding the {{commuting}} {{patterns of}} long-duration <b>commuters</b> {{and the possible}} changes in these patterns can help policymakers adopt the more reasonable land use and transportation policies. With Kunming in China as a case study, the determinants of long-duration commuting trips were identified based on logistic regression model. The results indicated that age, education level, number of workers, presence of retirees, and residential location {{have a significant impact}} on the occurrence of long-duration commuting trips. The ideal commuting times and tolerance thresholds of commuting time of long-duration <b>commuters</b> were also investigated. The statistical results revealed the distributions of ideal commuting times and tolerance thresholds of commuting time of both short- and long-duration <b>commuters.</b> The average tolerance threshold of commuting time and the average ideal commuting time of long-duration <b>commuters</b> were greater than those of short-duration <b>commuters.</b> For 97. 2 % of the long-duration <b>commuters,</b> their actual commuting time was longer than the ideal commuting time; this finding indicates that most long-duration <b>commuters</b> are dissatisfied with their commuting time.

40|$|AbstractGaining {{a better}} {{understanding}} of commuting characteristics in rural areas could provide urban planners and policy makers with a new insight into urban development and planning. In many cities, travellers move from urban areas to live in rural areas due to fast urbanization. Therefore, an empirical study was conducted in Jinhexincheng community that is a typical rural community in Jiading District, Shanghai. Commuting behaviours were collected, and local <b>commuters</b> were categorized into three groups: relocated <b>commuters,</b> non-relocated <b>commuters,</b> and near-work <b>commuters.</b> Relocated <b>commuters</b> were further classified into Working Place Changed group and Not Yet Changed group. This study compared commuting time, trip distance, departure time, travel mode of the above five categories. Commuting behaviours of the residents to downtown Shanghai were also investigated for the comparison purpose. The results indicate that there are significant differences between <b>commuters</b> living in rural and central areas. Non-relocated <b>commuters</b> and working place not changed <b>commuters</b> have longer trip distance and commuting time. Based on the proposed improvement measures of the transportation system, decision makers could draw a lesson from the commuting characteristics and the effects of relocation on residents’ commuting behaviours...|$|R

Yawkey station was originally opened as an infill station in 1988, for limited service to Boston Red Sox games at Fenway Park.

50|$|Parel {{railway station}} {{has only one}} foot over-bridge (FOB) on the {{southern}} side of the platform. This creates problems for <b>commuters</b> during peak hours. Due to this, <b>commuters</b> used to cross the tracks on to the adjoining platform 3 and use the FOB of that platform. This prompted the Railway's {{to put up a}} fence between the platforms in order to stop <b>commuters</b> from crossing the tracks. This has increased the pressure on the over-bridge even more and hence forced the Railway's into assigning the Railway Protection Force and Home Guard to help <b>commuters</b> cross the bridge and prevent any stampedes. They also protect the <b>commuters</b> from any approaching trains.|$|R

40|$|Users of multiple-mode public {{transportation}} {{were compared to}} users of privately owned vehicle (POV) transportation in work commuting within two different travel corridors of Santa Clara County, California. In the first corridor, high tech companies were the source of questionnaire respondents; in the second corridor, the respondents were predominately municipal and county office employees. Most intermodal travel in the first corridor was with multiple buses. In the second corridor, <b>commuters</b> who used a bus and light-rail combination were studied. Survey results from the sample of work <b>commuters</b> who faced a multiple bus combination in travel in the High Tech corridor indicate uncertainty, travel time and distance (the distance from residence to initial mode, interface between modes, and from final stop to work location) were rated as more important, but lower in satisfaction by POV <b>commuters</b> than by {{public transportation}} <b>commuters.</b> Results of Importance-Satisfaction Analysis (ISA) of ratings indicated that for POV <b>commuters,</b> travel time, uncertainty, and distance were factors in the quadrant of high importance and low satisfaction, which is most relevant managerially. In the ratings of public transportation <b>commuters,</b> wait time was clearly the factor in this quadrant. Cleanliness and uncertainty were lower satisfaction factors close to the boundary of the high importance quadrant. In survey results from a sample of work <b>commuters</b> to an urban city center who faced a light-rail and bus combination, POV <b>commuters</b> rated most factors as more important, but less satisfactory than <b>commuters</b> who used public transportation. The differences of largest magnitude in both importance and satisfaction were in cost, total travel time, and distance. The largest difference between POV and public transportation <b>commuters</b> in this corridor was in cost. Design implications of the studies differ across travel corridors. Whereas in the High Tech corridor, improving factors of wait time, travel time, and uncertainty {{appear to have a}} priority over cost for both public and POV work <b>commuters.</b> The results in the Downtown corridor suggest the opposite. For public transportation <b>commuters</b> in this corridor, cost is the most important factor. The differences in results in the comparisons across public transportation <b>commuters</b> and POV <b>commuters</b> in each sample strongly suggest that independent studies of travel corridors with different travel mode alternatives can be informative and have different managerial implications, even when they are within the same county...|$|R
