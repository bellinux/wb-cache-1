5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the Far East Air Forces, the <b>Continental</b> <b>Air</b> Command, and the Air Defense Command. He retired in 1951 {{after he was}} passed over for Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force.

5|$|The Air Commando sergeants, James J. Stanford and Charles Larimore Jones {{discovered}} the problem, obtained manuals on forward air control {{and went to}} work to resolve the issue. In short order, they arranged rides in Air America and <b>Continental</b> <b>Air</b> Services aircraft and began marking ground targets. The expedient worked and the sergeants, using radio call sign Butterfly, succeeded brilliantly.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} <b>Continental</b> <b>Air</b> Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E

5|$|In September, Saville told Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington, and the {{assembled}} Air Force staff that America's air defenses were wholly inadequate. The Chiefs of Staff agreed that air defense {{was second in}} importance only to a strong retaliation force, one that would give pause to an aggressor. In November, Saville was named commanding general of ADC. He worked to combine it with Tactical Air Command (TAC) to form {{the backbone of the}} <b>Continental</b> <b>Air</b> Command (CONAC) organization. In February 1949, Saville updated the House Armed Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1952, he {{was named}} {{commander}} of the <b>Continental</b> <b>Air</b> Command at Mitchel Air Force Base, New York. From July 1953, he was concurrently U.S. Air Force Representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee. He was U.S. Representative to the NATO Military Committee, Military Representatives Committee, and NATO Standing Group, stationed in Washington, D.C., from April 1956 until May 1958, when he became air deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, at SHAPE Headquarters in Paris, France. He retired on 31 July 1961, but on 15 September 1961 he was recalled to active duty to become director of the National Security Council's Net Evaluation Subcommittee Staff at the Pentagon. He retired a second time on 30 April 1965.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} classification is that involving air masses. The Bergeron classification is {{the most}} widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate {{the stability of the}} atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w. While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar <b>continental</b> <b>air</b> masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E

2500|$|The UK {{is mostly}} under the {{influence}} of the maritime polar air mass from the north-west.

South and south-east of England are the least exposed to Polar air masses from the north-west, and on occasion see <b>continental</b> tropical <b>air</b> mass from the south, which brings warm dry air in the summer.|$|R

500|$|Tropical and {{equatorial}} air masses are hot as they develop over lower latitudes. [...] Those that develop over land (continental) are drier and hotter {{than those that}} develop over oceans, and travel poleward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. [...] Maritime tropical air masses are {{sometimes referred to as}} trade air masses. [...] Monsoon air masses are moist and unstable. [...] Superior air masses are dry, and rarely reach the ground. [...] They normally reside over maritime tropical air masses, forming a warmer and drier layer over the more moderate moist air mass below, forming what is known as a trade wind inversion over the maritime tropical <b>air</b> mass. <b>Continental</b> Polar <b>air</b> masses (cP) are air masses that are cold and dry due to their continental source region. <b>Continental</b> polar <b>air</b> masses that affect North America form over interior Canada. <b>Continental</b> Tropical <b>air</b> masses (cT) are a type of tropical air produced by the subtropical ridge over large areas of land and typically originate from low-latitude deserts such as the Sahara Desert in northern Africa, which is the major source of these air masses. Other less important sources producing cT air masses are the Arabian Peninsula, the central arid/semi-arid part of Australia and deserts lying in the Southwestern United States. <b>Continental</b> tropical <b>air</b> masses are extremely hot and dry.|$|R
