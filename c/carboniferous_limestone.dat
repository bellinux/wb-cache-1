5|$|North {{and east}} of the Mendips the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> layers {{are found in the}} {{subsurface}} and are exposed in Avon Gorge, and are overlain by younger strata in Dundry Hill and the Cotswolds, where oolitic limestone of Jurassic age is found at the surface. West of the main Mendip plateau the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills are {{the most}} southerly <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> upland in Britain. The rock strata known as the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> were laid down during the early Carboniferous Period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe {{underwent}} continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic Era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe.|$|E
5|$|At Middle Hope a {{sequence}} of <b>carboniferous</b> <b>limestone</b> is exposed, which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas, demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections. The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform. These features {{have led to the}} designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site (RIGS).|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} hard, grey, often shelly, <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones.</b> These were {{laid down in}} a warm, shallow sea during {{the early part of}} the Carboniferous Period when Wales lay just south of the equator. Subsequent earth {{movements}} have folded and fractured the crust, and during the next 100 million years they suffered extensive erosion. These earth movements left the upfolded <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> as an area of high ground, extending through what is now the Vale of Glamorgan.|$|R

5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that existed {{at the time of}} their creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone,</b> the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} {{southern}} section of the Peak District, where <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> is found {{at or near the}} surface, is known as the White Peak in contrast to the northern Dark Peak and the South West Peak, which are characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland.|$|E
50|$|Sutton {{stone is}} a {{geologic}} formation located only in South Wales. Sutton stone consists of white, conglomeratic limestones with pebbles of black chert (silica) and <b>carboniferous</b> <b>limestones,</b> {{laid down in}} early Jurassic times. It was named by geologist Henry De la Beche in 1846.|$|R
25|$|Lamprey fossils {{are rare}} because {{cartilage}} does not fossilize as readily as bone. The first fossil lampreys were originally found in Early <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones,</b> marine sediments in North America: Mayomyzon pieckoensis and Hardistiella montanensis, from the Mississippian Mazon Creek lagerstätte and the Bear Gulch limestone sequence.|$|R
50|$|Silurian gritstone is quarried {{along the}} North Craven Fault above Ingleton and in Ribblesdale. Lower <b>Carboniferous</b> Great Scar <b>Limestone</b> is quarried {{in those areas}} and also near Grassington. <b>Carboniferous</b> reef <b>limestone</b> is quarried around Skipton.|$|R
5|$|The {{ecology of}} the area {{includes}} ancient woodland and calcareous grassland which supports nationally rare species including the Cheddar pink. The underlying rocks are <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> containing phreatic caves at Shute Shelve Cavern and Picken's Hole from which fossils dating from the Middle Devensian have been recovered.|$|E
5|$|The main {{geological}} {{component of}} the Mendips is <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone.</b> It represents {{the remnants of a}} much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic unconformity, Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were extruded. The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The Mendip Hills, {{of which}} Brean Down forms the most {{westerly}} part, {{are the most}} southerly <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> upland in Britain. These rock strata were laid down during the early Carboniferous period, about 320–350million years ago. Subsequently, much of northwestern Europe underwent continental collision throughout the late Paleozoic era, culminating in the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of}} the Carboniferous period, 300million years ago. This tectonic activity produced a complex suite of mountain and hill ranges across what is now southern Ireland, south-western England, Brittany, and elsewhere in western Europe. As a result of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now comprises at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. West of the main Mendip plateau the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> continues in Bleadon Hill and Brean Down, and on the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm.|$|E

It {{is one of}} a line of swallets marking the junction of the Limestone shales with the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestones</b> where water running off the Old Red Sandstone of Blackdown finds its way underground. [...] Further excavation has now linked Rod's Pot to nearby Bath Swallet.|$|R
50|$|A varied geology {{is found}} within the {{boundaries}} of the parish, ranging from rocks laid down in the Iapetus Ocean in Ordovician times, through the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> of the Askrigg Block on Whernside and Ingleborough and coal measures within the Craven Basin, to the Quaternary drumlin field in Ribblehead. It is a classic field study area for students of geology.|$|R
5|$|The Mendips are {{the most}} southerly <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestone</b> uplands in Britain. They are {{composed}} of three major anticlinal structures, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The limestone is quarried for building stone and the other rocks for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. Sand, gravel and peat are extracted {{in other parts of}} the county.|$|E
5|$|The Old Red Sandstone is {{a series}} of red sandstones, marls and conglomerates. It rises as an {{anticline}} in the Mendips and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Portishead. <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone,</b> of marine origin, covers the sandstone and appears in the Avon Gorge and at Weston-super-Mare where it contains volcanic rocks. There are outlying hills at Worlebury, Middle Hope, the Failand Ridge, Broadfields Down, Portishead Down and Wrington Hill.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> Series, {{which contain}} ooliths and fossil debris {{on top of}} Old Red Sandstone, and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny {{is seen in the}} sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils.|$|E
50|$|The Slide Mountain Terrane is a late Paleozoic terrane made of {{a complex}} of oceanic rocks in {{northern}} and southern British Columbia, Canada. The rocks of the terrane include <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones,</b> fine grained quartz rich clastics, conglomerates and volcanic rocks. Permian Kelso Group mafic volcanics are included. The Kelso Group volcanics originated from an ocean ridge environment adjacent to the Permian continental margin.|$|R
50|$|The Forest of Dean {{is formed}} of a raised basin of {{palaeozoic}} rocks folded in the Variscan Orogeny, {{similar to the}} South Wales coalfield to the west. Underlain by great thicknesses of the Old Red Sandstone, the basin is filled with <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones,</b> sandstones and coal measures, {{all of which have}} contributed to the industrial history of the region. Its highest point is Ruardean Hill (290m).|$|R
50|$|Ecton Hill is a {{historic}} mining area at Ecton, formerly a group of important copper producing mines in central England. It is now a scheduled monument. It {{is located in the}} Staffordshire Moorlands area, where the valley of the river Manifold cuts through Lower <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> which have been subjected to folding and faulting during the Hercynian and Alpine orogenies. There is locally intense hydrothermal copper-lead-zinc mineralisation, unusual for the region in its inclusion of substantial quantities of copper.|$|R
5|$|The site {{is at the}} top of a <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> ridge on the {{northern}} edge of the Mendip Hills. It forms part of the Black Down Pericline where the limestone has been exposed because of erosion of the overlying Triassic Dolomitic Conglomerate. The soil depth varies considerably, owing to the slope within the site and the effects of its exposure to the wind.|$|E
5|$|Made of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone,</b> it is a {{continuation}} of the Mendip Hills. Two further continuations are the small islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm. The cliffs on the northern and southern flanks of Brean Down have large quantities of fossils laid down in the marine deposits about 320–350 million years ago. The site has been occupied by humans since the late Bronze Age and includes the remains of a Romano-Celtic Temple. At the seaward end is Brean Down Fort which was built in 1865 and then re-armed in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone,</b> which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry stone walls that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{rocks are}} Lower <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> of Dinantian age, which form {{the core of}} the White Peak within the Peak District National Park. Because {{northern}} Derbyshire is effectively an uplifted dome of rock layers which have subsequently eroded back to expose older rocks in the centre of that dome, these are encircled by progressively younger limestone rocks until they in turn give way on three sides to Upper Carboniferous shales, gritstones and sandstones of Namurian age.|$|R
50|$|The Forest of Dean {{has been}} an area for timber {{production}} for hundreds of years. This has been maintained by careful planting and woodland management regimes. There is a mosaic of woodland types. The central region of the Dean lies on Coal Measures of the Carboniferous time period. This supports Oak and the ground flora is lime-hating. Around this central area are the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> and Devonian sandstones. These produce fertile soils and support a variety of woodland types with a richer ground flora.|$|R
50|$|The hill is {{composed}} of a layer cake of rocks laid down during the Carboniferous period. Lowermost, and exposed along its shallow northern scarp, are <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestones</b> whilst above these is the coarse Twrch Sandstone (formerly the 'Basal Grit') of the Marros Group (former 'Millstone Grit Series') also dating from the Carboniferous period. A number of northwest to southeast aligned faults runs across the hill. The limestone gives rise to karstic scenery including numerous shakeholes. These occur on the gritstone area {{as well as the}} limestone.|$|R
5|$|The {{island is}} formed of <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestone</b> {{and is often}} {{described}} as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} Carboniferous Period, 300million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestone.</b> Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, the peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and varied landscape provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the <b>carboniferous</b> <b>limestone</b> and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} rock types on the Mendips: the Devonian {{sandstones}} visible around Blackdown and Downhead and the <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>Limestones,</b> which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations. There are nine active quarries {{and a host of}} disused sites, several of which have been designated as geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature. Because of the effect quarrying has on the environment and local communities, a campaign has been started to halt the creation of any new quarries and to restrict the activities and expansion of the existing ones.|$|R

50|$|Many {{types of}} {{industrial}} minerals {{are found in}} the United Kingdom, especially England. However, the location of individual industrial minerals and their quality fundamentally reflects geology and many are highly restricted in their occurrence. This causes many to coincide with environmentally sensitive areas. Examples include fluorspar and potash, which are essentially confined to National Parks. <b>Carboniferous</b> <b>limestones</b> and the Cretaceous Chalk are the two main limestone resources which are used for cement and industry in England. These rocks also give rise to highly attractive scenery and consequently cause controversies when utilised.|$|R
