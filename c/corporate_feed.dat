50|$|A {{problem with}} the {{multilayer}} zoneplate reflector is the complexity introduced, which might offset the advantage of using Fresnel zoneplate antennas. One solution is to print an inhomogeneous array of conducting elements on a grounded dielectric plate, thus leading to the so-called single-layer printed flat reflector 2. This configuration bears {{much in common with}} the printed array antenna but it requires the use of a feed antenna instead of a <b>corporate</b> <b>feed</b> network. In contract to the normal array antenna, the array elements are different and are arranged in a pseudo-periodic manner. The theory and design method of single layer printed flat reflectors incorporating conducting rings and experimental results on such an antenna operating in the X-band were given in 2. Naturally, this leads to a more general antenna concept, the phase correcting reflective array.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{examines}} {{the feasibility of}} using the phase cancellation technique with an electrically small ground plane. A modified broadband twin slot structure fed by a <b>corporate</b> microstrip <b>feed</b> on an electrically thin substrate is made unidirectional by using a backing ground reflector. The coupling to the quasi-TEM mode is reduced through a phase cancellation technique by placing the twin elements {{at a distance of}} about half a guided wavelength. Traditional designs employing phase cancellation used an electrically large ground plane, typically about 2. 5 λo from each slot edge to the ground plane edge. In this work, it is demonstrated that a ground plane that is only 0. 5 λo from each slot edge actually achieves smoother radiation patterns and higher gain. The proposed structure maintains its primary characteristics over the large impedance match bandwidth of the antenna (18 %). The total size is about 1. 6 λox 1. 6 λox 0. 25 λo. As a result of the reduced overall size compared to previous implementations, this structure could be useful in numerous wireless applications.

40|$|Private-sector indebtedness, {{measured}} as the debt to income level, {{has grown in}} recent years and is now at historically high levels. Previous authors have concluded that indebtedness is an important determinant of the rate of liquidation among non-financial companies (Wadhwani, 1986; Davis, 1987; Vleighe, 2001). Observing the number of corporate liquidations in an economy (and insolvent liquidations in particular) is important because of the significance of the financial health of non-financial firms for other agents in the economy. Insolvent liquidations, where corporates have not declared their ability to repay all outstanding debts from the proceeds of the liquidation process, in sufficiently high numbers could be a cause of financial instability by forcing banks to write-off bad debts. These liquidations could also transmit financial distress to other corporates (similarly through bad debts) and households (by making household members unemployed). Our analysis shows that the corporate debt to income level has risen {{in recent years and}} that the rate of all liquidations has begun to rise recently after several years during which the rate halved.
