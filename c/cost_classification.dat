40|$|Notably {{absent in}} {{previous}} research on inductive expert systems {{is the study of}} mean-risk tradeoffs. Such tradeoffs may be significant when there are asymmetries such as unequal <b>classification</b> <b>costs,</b> and uncertainties in classification and information acquisition costs. The objective of this research is to develop models to evaluate mean-risk tradeoffs in value based inductive approaches. We develop a combined mean-risk measure and incorporate it into the Risk Based induction algorithm. The mean-risk measure has desirable theoretical properties (consistency and separability) and is supported by empirical results on decision making under risk. Simulation results using the Risk Based algorithm demonstrate: (i) an order of magnitude performance difference between mean based and risk based algorithms and (ii) an increase in the performance difference between these algorithms as either risk aversion, <b>classification</b> <b>cost</b> uncertainty or <b>classification</b> <b>cost</b> asymmetry increase given modest thresholds of the other two factors. 1...|$|R

Noting the difficulties associated with this approach, decision tree design directly from a set of labelled samples is proposed in this paper. The feature space is first partitioned to transform the problem to one of discrete features. The resulting problem is solved by a dynamic programming algorithm over an explicitly ordered state space of all outcomes of all feature subsets. The solution procedure is very general and is applicable to any minimum <b>cost</b> pattern <b>classification</b> problem in which each feature has a finite number of outcomes. These techniques are applied to (i) voiced, unvoiced, and silence classification of speech, and (ii) spoken vowel recognition. The resulting decision trees are operationally very efficient and yield attractive classification accuracies...|$|R
