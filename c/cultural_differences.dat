40|$|Internationalised online {{education}} offers a valuable window for {{research into the}} cultural processes of globalisation. This paper reports preliminary findings of a doctoral project about <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> in an online MBA unit with an internationalised student group. The case study was conducted as a critical ethnography (Carspecken 1996) adapted to virtual settings (Hine 2000). The study was also informed by a critical realist frame (Bhaskar 2002) which recognises the ontological level of potentials that can shape events, {{in addition to the}} empirical (that which is observable) and the actual (that which occurred). <b>Cultural</b> <b>difference</b> has typically been associated with negative potentials in pedagogical settings, in particular, the risks/problems of exclusion, disadvantage, and cultural offence. In emerging discourses of internationalisation, however, <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> is often constructed as potentially beneficial, enriching the mutual exchange of new insights. In this case study, the negative potential of intercultural offence and the positive potential of <b>cultural</b> <b>difference</b> as a vicarious asset for the curriculum were influentia...|$|R
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess <b>cultural</b> <b>differences.</b> They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about <b>cultural</b> <b>differences.</b> Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries to rate numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's complex sound-images and {{philosophical}} approach have caused frequent comparisons with mystical filmmakers such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Robert Bresson.

Some draw parallels between certain imagery in Kiarostami's films with that of Sufi concepts.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were <b>cultural</b> <b>differences,</b> the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

50|$|Organized {{into six}} “stages” of {{increasing}} sensitivity to difference, the DMIS identifies the underlying cognitive orientations individuals use to understand <b>cultural</b> <b>difference.</b> Each position along the continuum represents increasingly complex perceptual organizations of <b>cultural</b> <b>difference,</b> {{which in turn}} allow increasingly sophisticated experiences of other cultures. By identifying the underlying experience of <b>cultural</b> <b>difference,</b> predictions about behavior and attitudes can be made and education can be tailored to facilitate development along the continuum. The first three stages are ethnocentric as one sees his own culture as central to reality. Climbing the scale, one develops a more and more ethnorelative point of view, meaning that one experiences one's own culture as {{in the context of}} other cultures.By the fourth stage, ethnocentric views are replaced by ethnorelative views.|$|R

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Henry's death, Richard successfully claimed his father's lands; he later left on the Third Crusade, but never married Alice as he had agreed with Philip Augustus. Eleanor was released from house arrest and regained control of Aquitaine, where she ruled on Richard's behalf. Henry's empire, however, did not survive long and collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John, when Philip captured all of the Angevin possessions in France except Gascony. This collapse had various causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> between England and Normandy but, in particular, the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} {{and scope of}} aboriginal assimilation and acculturation on Taiwan has led to three general narratives of Taiwanese ethnic change. The oldest holds that Han migration from Fujian and Guangdong in the 17th century pushed the Plains Aborigines into the mountains, where they became the Highland peoples of today. A more recent view asserts that through widespread intermarriage between Han and aborigines between the 17th and 19th centuries, the aborigines were completely Sinicized. Finally, modern ethnographical and anthropological studies have shown a pattern of cultural shift mutually experienced by both Han and Plains Aborigines, resulting in a hybrid culture. Today people who comprise Taiwan's ethnic Han demonstrate major <b>cultural</b> <b>differences</b> from Han elsewhere.|$|E
