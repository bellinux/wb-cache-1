50|$|STS-72, the 74th {{flight of}} the Space Shuttle program and the 10th of the orbiter Endeavour was {{launched}} at 4:41AM EST January 11, 1996 after a brief hold at the T-5 minute mark due to communication issues. The nighttime launch window was {{in support of the}} mission's primary objective, the capture and return to Earth of a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft known as Space Flyer Unit (SFU). The 3577 kg SFU was launched by Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan on 18 March 1995 aboard a Japanese H-II rocket (HII-3), and spent ten months in orbit conducting automated research in materials science, biology, engineering, and astronomy. Mission Specialist Koichi Wakata operated the orbiter's remote manipulator system arm on flight day three to pluck SFU from orbit. Both of the satellites's solar arrays had to be jettisoned prior to retrieval when sensors indicated improper latching following their retraction. This jettison procedure had been incorporated in preflight training as a contingency in the event of such an occurrence. The canisters housing the arrays were jettisoned 12 minutes apart as Endeavour and the SFU traveled across Africa on the thirtieth orbit of the mission. The <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> delayed the capture of the satellite by about an hour and half. Once in Endeavour's payload bay, the satellite's internal batteries were bypassed following connection of a remotely operated electrical cable {{to the side of the}} satellite.|$|E

40|$|This {{study has}} {{concerned}} {{itself with the}} comparative efficiency of instructions, elicitations, and reinforcements in the manipulation of affective verbal behavior. Bandura has suggested that simple instructions to emit a verbal operant would be superior to the usual reinforcement <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> in increasing verbal response rate. The {{results indicate that the}} instruction groups achieved significantly higher rates for both positive and negative emotional words than the reinforcement groups supporting Bandura's prediction. The elicitation group also exceeded the reinforcement group in the emission of negative affect words. It is suggested that verbal behavior can be successfully manipulated by procedures other than the usual verbal conditioning methods. In a recent paper Bandura (1962) has suggested that the verbal conditioning experiment {{can be viewed as a}} problem-solving situation in which the subtle cues or reinforcements dispensed by the experimenter (E) successively guide the subject (5) in selecting the appropriate response from his repertoire of previously acquired verbal behaviors. In line with this interpretation Bandura predicts that a simple request for a verbal operant would be a more efficient means of influencing response emission than the usual responsereinforcement <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure.</b> This proposal rests on the assumption that the appropriate response has already been acquired and the variable being manipulated relates to the temporal discrimination of response emission rather than to the acquisition process per se. Thus, the more directly relevant the cues are to the performance of the task and, inferentially, the more "aware" the 5 is of the relevent response parameters, the greater the degree of response influence. Krasner (1965), on the other hand, has argued that Bandura's suggestion might be feasible when an unambiguous task is required, such as instructions to emit plural nouns.

40|$|AbstractThe good {{behavior}} game (GBG) is an interdependent group <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> {{designed to reduce}} disruptive behavior in classroom settings. In the GBG, a class is divided into groups, simple rules are made, and contingencies are placed on the students’ rule-following behavior. This procedure has been proven effective across various student ages, and its simplicity and long-term effects have contributed to its popularity in school settings. Although it has been systematically evaluated across {{a wide range of}} student ages, research on the GBG is lacking in the area of population- and setting-specific assessments. In this evaluation, the GBG was implemented in three classrooms (student ages 7 - 12) at a school for children with severe problem behavior; in particular, these students had already displayed behavior that might be described as “delinquent” or “predelinquent. ” Disruptive behavior substantially decreased across all three classrooms {{as a result of the}} intervention.

40|$|The Space Shuttle {{does not}} dock at an exact 90 {{degrees to the}} International Space Station (ISS) x-body axis. This offset from 90 degrees, along with error sources within their {{respective}} attitude knowledge, causes the two vehicles to never completely agree on their attitude, even though they operate as a single, mated stack while docked. The docking offset {{can be measured in}} flight when both vehicles have good attitude reference and is a critical component in calculations to transfer attitude reference from one vehicle to another. This paper will describe how the docking offset and attitude reference errors between both vehicles are measured and how this information would be used to recover Shuttle attitude reference from ISS in the event of multiple failures. During STS- 117, ISS on-board Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) computers began having problems and after several continuous restarts, the systems failed. The failure took the ability for ISS to maintain attitude knowledge. This paper will also demonstrate how with knowledge of the docking offset, the <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> to recover Shuttle attitude reference from ISS was reversed in order to provide ISS an attitude reference from Shuttle. Finally, this paper will show how knowledge of the docking offset can be used to speed up attitude control handovers from Shuttle to ISS momentum management. By taking into account the docking offset, Shuttle can be commanded to hold a more precise attitude which better agrees with the ISS commanded attitude such that start up transients with the ISS momentum management controllers are reduced. By reducing start-up transients, attitude control can be transferred from Shuttle to ISS without the use of ISS thrusters saving precious on-board propellant, crew time and minimizing loads placed upon the mated stack...|$|E
40|$|Repairing damaged thermal {{protection}} system tile requires the Space Shuttle to be oriented such that repair platform access from the International Space Station (ISS) is possible. To do this, the Space Shuttle uses the Orbiter Repair Maneuver (ORM), which utilizes the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS) to rotate the Space Shuttle {{in relation to}} the ISS, for extended periods of time. These positions cause difficulties and challenges to performing a safe separation (no collision or thruster plume damage to sensitive ISS structures) should an inadvertent release occur or a <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> require it. To help protect for an SRMS failure or other failures, a method for separating without collision and the ability to redock to ISS from the ORM configuration was needed. The contingency ORM separation solution elegantly takes advantage of orbital mechanics between ISS and the separating Space Shuttle. By pitching the ISS down approximately 45 degrees, in a majority of the ORM repair positions, the altitude difference between the ISS and Space Shuttle center of gravity is maximized. This altitude difference results in different orbital energies (orbital periods) causing objects to separate from each other without requiring translational firings. Using this method, a safe contingency ORM separation is made possible in many odd positions even though some separation positions point high powered thrusters directly at fragile ISS and Soyuz solar arrays. Documented in this paper are the development simulations and procedures of the contingency ORM separation and the challenges encountered with large constraints to work around. Lastly, a method of returning to redock with the ISS to pick up the stranded crew members (or transfer the final crew members) is explained as well as the thruster and ISS loads analysis...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the tubing hanger crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower Tubing Hanger Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A <b>contingency</b> <b>procedure</b> is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to lock the dogs into the tubing hanger nipple profile. It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so alonger displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP setting tool has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug locking dogs can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized setting tool and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{response}} to the increasingly more challenging prospects to drill, due to depletion of old reservoirs and increasing water depths, is the Low Riser Return System (LRRS). The LRRS is a system designed to manage the wellbore pressure in offshore drilling by riser level regulations. A subsea pump module {{is connected to the}} riser and enables cuttings and mud return to surface in a separate conduit. One of the systems applications, which will be discussed throughout this report, involves operating with a partially evacuated riser together with heavier than conventional mud. With this technique, new well control procedures have to be established. Due to the utilization of a lowered mud level in the riser with corresponding heavy mud, various new elements and procedures compared to conventional well control are introduced, which subsequently raises additional challenges and possible problems. This report will first introduce the LRRS system with its equipment, before describing the general principles of conventional well control. Thereafter well control procedure based on published material will be presented and the different elements that constitute LRRS well control will be described. Discussions regarding the well control implementation, the reliability of the well control <b>procedures,</b> <b>contingencies</b> and alternative <b>procedures</b> will be conducted at the end.
