The design of <b>control</b> <b>and</b> performance <b>evaluation</b> systems in the pre and post-privatization periods is compared {{so that it can be}} understood in relation to the changes observed at a high corporate level (corporate governance and firm strategy). We carry out various case studies on five privatized Spanish companies. The results support several conclusions. First, the variables that are traditionally related to greater board independence in monitoring do not undergo variation after privatization. Second, the interests of the firms’ new ownership have an impact on firm strategy after privatization. Finally, <b>control</b> <b>and</b> performance <b>evaluation</b> system designs clearly align with firm strategy after privatization...|$|R

50|$|Virtual {{organizations}} are completely dependent to technology {{as they are}} entirely internet-based. It is more than necessary for the individuals involved in a partnership to possess similar technological tools from its associates. Compatibility matters resulting from the hardware and software such as the operating system as well as certain computer’s software might disturb {{the efficiency of the}} virtual organization. For instance, the occurrence of incompatibility issues (difficulty in integrating information generated with dissimilar tools) concerning the hardware or software, would dramatically affect virtual organizations’ process and performance as they depend on these tools. Institute, uphold and spread a definite common knowledge between partners is one of the ultimate issue to virtual organizations’ management.
