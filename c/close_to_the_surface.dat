5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become Nevada, and because their claim was <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> it was easily extracted without initial capital investment. The Bowers Mining Company quickly made Eilley and Sandy very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Vegetative {{reproduction}} occurs {{naturally in}} some species that produce stolons or when roots come <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the soil. Older leaves that touch the ground may sprout plantlets. Pygmy sundews reproduce asexually using specialized scale-like leaves called gemmae. Tuberous sundews can produce offsets from their corms.|$|E

5|$|All of the Solar System planets except Mercury have {{substantial}} atmospheres because their gravity {{is strong enough}} to keep gases <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The larger giant planets are massive enough to keep large amounts of the light gases hydrogen and helium, whereas the smaller planets lose these gases into space. The composition of Earth's atmosphere is different from the other planets because the various life processes that have transpired on the planet have introduced free molecular oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|Common {{trees are}} oaks, willows and alders, which {{tolerate}} wet soils. Because the phreatic table is very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> soils hardly freeze {{in winter and}} drought rarely occurs in summer. The nature reserve also has meadows and reed beds. Common animals include a large variety of birds (storks, curlews, harriers), amphibians and mammals (beavers). The reserve {{is home to the}} largest fallow deer population in France. This animal was introduced to the area in 1854.|$|E

5|$|Iran {{experiences}} {{at least one}} minor earthquake per day on average, and the Zagros region is particularly prone to seismic activity. During the last 100years, Iran has been hit by more than 130events stronger than magnitude5, with damaging earthquakes near Qeshm recorded in 1360, 1703, 1884, 1897, 1902, and 1905. The majority of Iranian quakes occur in the upper crust, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> {{which means that they}} are potentially more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread {{out around the}} base of the plant for varying distances, <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E
5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the body.|$|E
50|$|This marine fish usually {{lives on}} the ocean floor at depths between 50 and 2000 m, but it {{occasionally}} comes <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> larvae are pelagic, drifting relatively helplessly, but at around 4 cm, they migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom. Young between the ages of two and four years live <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore, moving into deeper waters as they grow older.|$|R
50|$|To treat tumors {{at greater}} depths, the proton {{accelerator}} must produce a beam with higher energy, typically given in eV or electron volts. Proton therapy treats tumors <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> body with lower energy protons. Accelerators used for proton therapy typically produce protons with energies {{in the range}} of 70 to 250 MeV. Adjusting proton energy during the treatment maximizes the cell damage the proton beam causes within <b>the</b> tumor. Tissue <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of <b>the</b> body than the tumor receives reduced radiation, and therefore reduced damage. Tissues deeper in the body receive very few protons, so the dosage becomes immeasurably small.|$|R

The delineated upwardly migration of hydrocarbon pool {{in the study area}} localized <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> mapped faults seem to have lost their integrity; it appears the faults are non-sealing as evident from the chimney analysis. It is recommended that proposed wells in this field should be within 600 – 1000  ms.|$|R
5|$|There are no large rivers, but {{abundant}} small water streams exist. Some {{of these}} streams are permanent, {{such as the}} Este River, which feeds into the Ave. The source of the Esteiro Stream {{is located at the}} base of Cividade Hill and empties at the beach of Aver-o-Mar, while the Alto River's source is at the base of São Félix and reaches the Atlantic at Rio Alto Beach. The land is well-irrigated, springs and wells are very common, since underground water is often <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to this {{extremely}} thin membranous tissue, a bat's wing {{can significantly}} {{contribute to the}} organism's total gas exchange efficiency. Because of the high energy demand of flight, the bat's body meets those demands by exchanging gas through the patagium of the wing. When the bat has its wing in an open/spread out position it allows {{for an increase in}} surface area to volume ratio. The surface area of the wings is about 85% of the total body surface area, suggesting the possibility of a useful amount of gas exchange. The subcutaneous vessels in the membrane very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> allow for the diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E
50|$|Live {{individuals}} {{of the genus}} have only been collected in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Little is known about their biology because they live in deep waters, whereas the more well-understood Nautilus genus lives <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|R
50|$|Electronic tagging {{has shown}} Humboldt squid undergo diel {{vertical}} migrations, which bring them <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> from dusk <b>to</b> dawn.

50|$|Climate-friendly gardeners may use deep-rooted {{plants such}} as comfrey <b>to</b> bring {{nutrients}} <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> topsoil, but will do so without making the leaves into a liquid feed, because the rotting leaves in the anaerobic conditions under water may emit methane.|$|R
5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked out, then another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E
5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface feeders, obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
50|$|Mining on {{the range}} {{continued}} until 1984. Also like the Vermilion Range, mining slowed as it became more economical to extract taconite deposits from the Mesabi Range, which were <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> mines were safer than the mines deep underground.|$|R
50|$|African tigerfish mainly {{live near}} the bottom of the large {{freshwater}} rivers and lakes they inhabit. During the day they tend <b>to</b> be found <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and then move towards the bottom at night. They thrive in highly oxygenated water in warm climates.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} the westernmost of all Toei stations, and, {{at a depth}} of 11.9 m below ground level, the {{platform}} is <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of all <b>the</b> Ōedo Line stations. There are five exits from the station, labelled A1 through to A5.|$|R
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{suborder}} Cryptobranchoidea {{contains the}} primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
5|$|The town {{owes its}} {{existence}} mainly to two ore bodies that formed about 1.75billion years ago along a ring fault in the caldera of an undersea volcano. Tectonic plate movements, plate collisions, uplift, deposition, erosion, and other geologic processes eventually exposed {{the tip of}} one of the ore bodies and pushed the other <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> both near Jerome. In the late 19thcentury, the United Verde Mine, developed by William A. Clark, extracted ore bearing copper, gold, silver, and other metals from the larger of the two. The United Verde Extension (UVX) Mine, owned by James Douglas, Jr., depended on the other huge deposit. In total, the copper deposits discovered in the vicinity of Jerome were among the richest ever found.|$|E
