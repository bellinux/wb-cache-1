40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} value of <b>day</b> <b>services</b> at green care farms (GCFs) {{in terms of social}} {{participation}} for people with dementia. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with dementia who attended <b>day</b> <b>services</b> at a GCF (GCF group, n = 21), were on a waiting list (WL) for <b>day</b> <b>services</b> at a GCF (WL group, n = 12), or attended <b>day</b> <b>services</b> in a regular day care facility (RDCF group, n = 17) and with their family caregivers. Results: People with dementia in the GCF and WL group were primarily males, with an average age of 71 and 76 years, respectively, who almost all had a spousal caregiver. People with dementia in the RDCF group were mostly females with an average age of 85 years, most of whom had a non-spousal caregiver.
