'Well, sir,' said Knott, rather {{frightened by}} the parson's vehemence, 'she come t' our house i' the carrier's cart o' Wednesday, when it was welly nine o'clock at night; and Dorkis run out, for she heared the <b>cart</b> <b>stop,</b> an' Miss Sarti throwed her arms roun' Dorkis's neck an' says, [...] "Tek me in, Dorkis, tek me in," [...] an' went off into a swoond, like. An' Dorkis calls out to me,--"Dannel," [...] she calls--an' I run out and carried the young miss in, an' she come roun' arter a hit, an' opened her eyes, and Dorkis got her to drink a spoonful o' rum-an'-water--we've got some capital rum as we brought from the Cross Keys, and Dorkis won't let nobody drink it. She says she keeps it for sickness; but for my part, I think it's a pity to drink good rum when your mouth's out o' taste; you may just as well hev doctor's stuff. However, Dorkis got her to bed, an' there she's lay iver sin', stoopid like, an' niver speaks, an' on'y teks little bits an' sups when Dorkis coaxes her. An' we begun to be frightened, and couldn't think what had made her come away from the Manor, and Dorkis was afeared there was summat wrong. So this mornin' she could hold no longer, an' would hev no nay but I must come an' see; an' so I've rode twenty mile upo' Blackbird, as thinks all the while he's a-ploughin', an' turns sharp roun', every thirty yards, {{as if he was}} at the end of a furrow.

40|$|Introduction: After {{achieving}} undetectable HIV-RNA on cART, on cessation, HIV-RNA rebounds to pre-treatment {{values for}} the majority due {{to the presence of}} an inaccessible viral reservoir. There is some evidence that cART during primary HIV infection (PHI) limits the reservoir size, optimizing the chance of maintaining viral control off cART. Data are required to predict possible viral controllers for treatment interruption following cART. This analysis aims to investigate the effect of cART duration and the rate of viral blips while on cART initiated in PHI, and other factors on maintaining viral control for those stopping cART. Material and Methods: Using CASCADE data on HIV seroconverters, we characterized virologic blip (viral suppression on cART followed by a single HIV-RNA above a blip threshold and a subsequent measure below the threshold without cART change) rates for those starting cART within six months of seroconversion (SC). Using Cox models, we examined the effect of the following factors on time to virologic rebound (HIV-RNA> 1000) after cART stop: cART duration, severity/rate of blips on cART, time from SC to cART start, cART class, SC year, SC age, CD 4 at cART start/stop, sex and HIV risk group. Results: The 660 individuals initiating cART in PHI were mostly male (91 %), seroconverting between 1995 and 2012, with a median (IQR) age of 34 (29, 41) years mostly infected through sex between men (73 %). Median cART duration was 14. 8 (7. 0, 31. 7) months initiated at a median 1. 9 (0. 5, 3. 9) months post SC. 13 (11, 16), 9 (7, 11), 6 (5, 9) and 7 (6, 10) % of individuals experienced blips > 50, 100, 200 and 400 copies/mL, respectively. Of those who experienced blips, most (77 – 90 %, depending on blip threshold) experienced just one. Among 250 individuals with undetectable HIV-RNA at <b>cART</b> <b>stop,</b> median time to rebound was 1. 6 (0. 30, 5. 8) months. Time on cART was the only factor independently associated with control after stopping, HR for rebound= 0. 91 (0. 86, 0. 98) per extra six months spent on cART, HR for ever blipping > 400 copies/mL while on cART= 0. 88 (0. 40, 1. 93). Conclusions: Blips occur in about 10 % of individuals who initiate cART in PHI, most of who experience only one blip, but was not predictive of subsequent virologic rebound. Increasing time spent on cART initiated in PHI could increase time of virological suppression after <b>cART</b> <b>stop...</b>|$|E
40|$|HIV RNA {{levels are}} {{influenced}} by genetic characteristics of both the host and the virus. Here we applied machine learning techniques to determine if plasma-derived HIV- 1 amino acid sequences {{can be used to}} predict spontaneous virologic control. We studied the relationship between HIV- 1 env genotype and viral load in 20 chronically infected patients undergoing treatment interruptions (SSITT, Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial) and in 104 primary HIV infected (PHI) patients before antiretroviral therapy (cART) and where applicable also after treatment stop. Extensive longitudinal sampling during the interruptions was performed in nine SSITT patients. Sequences obtained from these nine patients during the first virus rebound were used as a training data set and revealed a strong genetic signature (accuracy 98. 6 % in cross-validation) associated with control of viremia at levels below 5000 copies/mL of viral RNA maintained for at least 2 months after the final <b>cART</b> <b>stop.</b> The simple sequence pattern at gp 120 positions 268 E/ 358 T was confirmed to be predictive of control in the clonal sequences originating from these patients during all subsequent rebounds. Sequences from the remaining 11 SSITT patients with less frequent sampling and from the PHI patients were used for external validation. High sensitivities (71 - 100 %) and negative predictive values (80 - 100 %) but low positive predictive values (12 - 40 %) were achieved in the patient-wise analysis which was based on presence of the genetic pattern in all clones. These results suggest that presence of virus lacking the amino acid pattern 268 E/ 358 T is associated with VL > 5000 at baseline of PHI and with low probability of spontaneous virologic control after treatment stop. Conversely, however, presence of 268 E/ 358 T does not predict control of viremia. These residues in HIV gp 120 might affect in vivo HIV- 1 fitness either at the level of Env function or influence susceptibility to adaptive or innate immune response...|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} a carrier's <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> before Mrs. Holl's house, {{to the great}} amazement of the neighbourhood--for such an {{occurrence}} had not been known {{in the memory of}} the oldest inhabitant in the street, and quite a crowd of children collected to witness the delivery of a square heavy box of considerable weight at the door.|$|R
60|$|Dinah did {{not know}} that the crowd was silent, gazing at her with a sort of awe--she did not even know how near they were to the fatal spot, when the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped,</b> and she shrank appalled at a loud shout hideous to her ear, like a vast yell of demons. Hetty's shriek mingled with the sound, and they clasped each other in mutual horror.|$|R
60|$|As {{they passed}} the {{different}} mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more, where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily {{as if they had}} only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which, another road appeared to run off. And here, the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{every item}} of my plan was crowned with success. Our reunited life {{was more than}} all that we had looked forward to.

60|$|At {{last the}} <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> at a house, where the hamper was taken out, carried in, and set down. The cook gave the carrier sixpence; {{the back door}} banged, and the cart rumbled away. But there was no quiet; {{there seemed to be}} {{hundreds}} of carts passing. Dogs barked; boys whistled in the street; the cook laughed, the parlour maid ran up and down-stairs; and a canary sang like a steam engine.|$|R

60|$|The {{hackney-coach}} jolted along Fleet Street, as hackney-coaches usually do. The horses 'went better', {{the driver}} said, {{when they had}} anything before them (they must have gone at a most extraordinary pace when there was nothing), and so the vehicle kept behind a cart; when the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped,</b> it stopped; and when the cart went on again, it did the same. Mr. Pickwick sat opposite the tipstaff; and the tipstaff sat with his hat between his knees, whistling a tune, and looking out of the coach window.|$|R
5000|$|A twelve-year-old {{apprentice}} stonemason, Allan Cunningham, observed {{his return}} to his house and wrote that [...] "The poet returned on the 18th July 1796 in a small spring-cart. The ascent to his house was steep, and the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at the foot of}} the Mill-hole Brae; when he alighted he shook much, and stood with difficulty; he seemed unable to stand upright. He stooped as if in pain, and walked tottering towards his door: his looks were hollow and ghastly, and those who saw him then expected never to see him again".|$|R
6000|$|Notwithstanding {{the awful}} jolting of the cart, Jess had been asleep {{for the last}} two hours. Her arm was hooked round the back of the seat, and her head rested against John's great-coat, which he had fixed up {{in such a way as}} to make a pillow. [...] "Where are we?" [...] she asked, waking up with a start as the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped.</b> [...] "I have had such a bad dream! I dreamt that I was {{travelling}} through life, and that suddenly everything stopped, and I was dead." ...|$|R
60|$|He said never a word, but {{he turned}} his mule about, end for end, retraced {{some part of the}} way we had gone, and, {{striking}} into another path, led me to the mountain village, which was, as we say in Scotland, the kirk-town of that thinly peopled district. Some broken memories dwell in my mind of the day breaking over the plain, of the <b>cart</b> <b>stopping,</b> of arms that helped me down, of a bare room into which I was carried, and of a swoon that fell upon me like sleep.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the road}} came {{a sound of}} {{creaking}} axles, and then a slow cloud of dust, and then a bull-cart bearing Ransie Bilbro and his wife. The <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> at the Justice's door, and the two climbed down. Ransie was a narrow six feet of sallow brown skin and yellow hair. The imperturbability of the mountains hung upon him like a suit of armour. The woman was calicoed, angled, snuff-brushed, and weary with unknown desires. Through it all gleamed a faint protest of cheated youth unconscious of its loss.|$|R

The <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> at a wine shop named Broken Bowl (Chinese:破碗居) {{on the east side of}} Xuanwu Gate, where the convict would be offered a bowl of rice wine. The bowl would be smashed after it was drunk. During the executions of infamous convicts, it was common for a large crowd to gather and watch. The torture death by a thousand cuts was also carried out at the execution ground.|$|R
60|$|The Big House was {{the hub of}} {{the ranch}} organization. Half a mile from it, it was encircled by the various ranch centers. Dick Forrest, saluting {{continually}} his people, passed at a gallop the dairy center, which was almost a sea of buildings with batteries of silos and with litter carriers emerging on overhead tracks and automatically dumping into waiting manure-spreaders. Several times, business-looking men, college-marked, astride horses or driving <b>carts,</b> <b>stopped</b> him and conferred with him. They were foremen, heads of departments, and they were as brief and to the point as was he. The last of them, astride a Palomina three-year-old that was as graceful and wild as a half-broken Arab, was for riding by with a bare salute, but was stopped by his employer.|$|R
50|$|Now {{plunged into}} darkness, the <b>cart</b> <b>stops</b> {{at the peak}} of the hill. A fuse is heard in the distance, and soon is visible snaking its way along either side of the car. It winds across the floor, and a green lantern is {{suddenly}} illuminated. It sits on top of boxes and boxes of dynamite, hooked to the quickly approaching fuse. The fuse reaches the boxes and jets of flame are shot out as the car drops at a 95° angle (the 95° drop is a 45° spiral beyond vertical drop). A camera flashes and daylight (or more darkness if riding at night) bursts into view. A barrel roll and a half are followed by a half loop. The car slows to a stop back in the station, and riders are unloaded.|$|R
30|$|The force {{required}} {{to bring the}} <b>cart</b> to <b>stop</b> is considered high for most users which {{also contribute to the}} feeling of discomfort on the upper arm and forearm, and this contributed to the quest of the users for a braking system in order to ease the halting of the cart.|$|R
60|$|From hence {{they passed}} along and took in other dead bodies, till, as honest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him {{alive in the}} cart; yet all this while he slept soundly.

So another called to him and said, 'Who are you?' The fellow answered, 'I am the poor piper. Where am I?' 'Where are you?' says Hayward. 'Why, you are in the dead-cart, {{and we are going to}} bury you.' 'But I an't dead though, am I?' says the piper, which made them laugh a little though, as John said, they were heartily frighted at first; so they helped the poor fellow down, and he went about his business.|$|R

40|$|Control of {{compliant}} {{mechanical systems}} is increasingly being researched for several applications including flexible link robots and ultra-precision positioning systems. The control problem in these systems is challenging, especially with gravity coupling and large deformations, because of inherent under actuation {{and the combination}} of lumped and distributed parameters of a nonlinear system. In this paper we consider an ultra-flexible inverted pendulum on a cart and propose a new nonlinear energy shaping controller to keep the pendulum at the upward position with the <b>cart</b> <b>stopped</b> at a desired location. The design {{is based on a}} model, obtained via the constrained Lagrange formulation, which previously has been validated experimentally. The controller design consists of a partial feedback linearization step followed by a standard PID controller acting on two passive outputs. Boundedness of all signals and (local) asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium is theoretically established. Simulations and experimental evidence assess the performance of the proposed controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES We {{designed}} {{two different}} studies to evaluate two different combination antiretroviral therapy (<b>cART)</b> <b>stopping</b> strategies namely a 'staggered stop' approach (STOP 1 study) and a 'protected stop' approach (STOP 2 study) {{to find the}} best 'universal stop' strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients who <b>stopped</b> <b>cART</b> for any reason were recruited. In STOP 1, 10 patients on efavirenz continued dual nucleos(t) ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) for 1 week after discontinuing efavirenz. Efavirenz concentrations were measured weekly for up to 3 weeks. In STOP 2, 20 patients <b>stopped</b> their <b>cART</b> and replaced it with two tablets of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) (100 / 50 mg) twice daily for 4 weeks. Lopinavir, efavirenz, nevirapine and tenofovir concentrations were measured weekly for up to 4 weeks. Virological and resistance testing were performed. RESULTS In STOP 1 five patients still had efavirenz present (median t(1 / 2) = 148. 4 h) 3 weeks after stopping. In STOP 2, 15 / 20 patients had a viral load (VL) of 1 week after stopping. No patients developed new resistance mutations. CONCLUSIONS Plasma efavirenz concentrations can persist up to 3 weeks after patients stop efavirenz-containing regimens. This suggests a strategy of stopping efavirenz only 1 week before NRTIs may not be long enough for some individuals. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy for a 4 week period may be an alternative pharmacologically and virologically effective universal stopping strategy which warrants further investigation...|$|R
