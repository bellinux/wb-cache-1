5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem.

50|$|The Uruguayan savanna {{ecoregion}} used to {{be covered}} by grasslands, palm savannas, and gallery forests along the Uruguay, Negro, Yaguarí, Queguay, and Tacuarembó rivers. Unfortunately, agriculture and <b>cattle</b> <b>ranching</b> have heavily altered these natural communities. The savannas are critically endangered because there are few small isolated patches of intact habitat remaining.

5|$|Most of Thistle's {{residents}} were railroad employees sent {{to live in}} the town, but there were some who had settled before the railroads arrived. The first Europeans were part of the Mormon migration to Utah, and the first of these was the Pace family, who migrated from Nauvoo, Illinois, reaching Thistle in 1848. Fifth-generation descendants of the Pace settlers continued to operate a family-owned <b>cattle</b> <b>ranch</b> until the town was evacuated. Other settlers included Mormons who originally settled elsewhere in Utah but subsequently arrived to homestead fertile ground on Billies Mountain, on the north wall of the canyon. Among them was the mountain's presumed namesake, William Johnson. Homesteading was practiced in Thistle until the early 1900s. Until the arrival of the railroads, the town's economy was based mainly on farming and ranching, although there was also some mining activity in the region, including a vein of asphaltum that was mined between 1892 and 1914.|$|E
5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and <b>cattle</b> <b>ranch</b> before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
