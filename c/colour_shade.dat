5|$|The crag martins {{are four}} species of small {{passerine}} {{birds in the}} genus Ptyonoprogne of the swallow family. They are the Eurasian crag martin (P.rupestris), the pale crag martin (P.obsoleta), the rock martin (P.fuligula) and the dusky crag martin (P.concolor). They {{are closely related to}} each other, and have formerly sometimes been considered to be one species. They are closely related to the Hirundo barn swallows and are placed in that genus by some authorities. These are small swallows with brown upperparts, paler underparts without a breast band, and a square tail with white patches. They can be distinguished from each other on size, the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> of the upperparts and underparts, and minor plumage details like throat colour. They resemble the sand martin, but are darker below, and lack a breast band.|$|E

50|$|After the {{formation}} of Serbia and Montenegro, the Yugoslav tricolour was {{to be replaced by}} a new compromise flag. Article 23 of the Law for the implementation of the Constitutional Charter stated that a law specifying the new flag was to be passed within 60 days of the first session of the new joint parliament. Among the flag proposals, the popular choice was a flag with a shade of blue in between the Serbian tricolour and the Montenegrin tricolour of 1993-2004. The <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> Pantone 300C was perceived as the best choice. However the parliament failed to vote on the proposal within the legal time-frame and the flag was not adopted. In 2004, Montenegro adopted a radically different flag, as its independence-leaning government sought to distance itself from Serbia. Proposals for a compromise flag were dropped after this and the Union of Serbia and Montenegro never adopted a flag.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a {{development of a}} design of experiment technique for quality improvement in automotive manufacturing industrial. The quality of interest is the <b>colour</b> <b>shade,</b> {{one of the key}} feature and exterior appearance for the vehicles. With low percentage of first time quality, the manufacturer has spent a lot of cost for repairing work as well as the longer production time. To permanently dissolve such problem, the precisely spraying condition should be optimised. Therefore, this work applied the multiple regression and response surface methods or RSM to investigate significant factors and to determine the optimum factor level in order {{to improve the quality of}} paint shop. Firstly, 2 k full factorial was employed to study the effect of five factors including the paint flow rate at robot setting, the paint levelling agent, the paint pigment, the additive slow solvent, and non volatile solid at spraying of atomising spraying machine. The response value of <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> at 15 and 45 degree are measured using spectrophotometer. Then the regression models of <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> at both degrees were developed from the significant factors affecting each response. Consequently, both regression models were placed into the form of linear programming to maximise the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> subjected to 3 main factors including the pigment, the additive solvent and the paint flow rate. This led to the determination of new levels of decision variables and brought 70 % reduction on paint repairs cost and improve first time quality from 70 % to 88 % for the production of interes...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> {{preferences}} of individuals, grouped according to their personality types are alike or not. The researchers also tried to study the difference in <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> preferences based on gender differences. The objective was to understand whether the <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> preferences of individuals are affected by their individual personality types or not and whether gender plays any role in selection of colour shades of individuals. The study sample consisted of a total of 80 subjects, randomly selected from within the age group of 18 - 25. An attempt was made to maintain a balance between two genders and across the ages. The research instruments used were Eysenck’s Personality Test (to measure the personality types) and a separate Colour Bar- Colour Preference Test was designed to serve the purpose of this study. The subjects were made to fill both the questionnaires and then the items were scored and results were analyzed. Positive scoring was done for Eysenck’s personality questionnaire and negative scoring was used to score the Colour Bar-Colour Preference Test. The data collected was divided into: Introverts (female, male) and Extroverts (female, male). From the data collected the mean, standard deviation and correlation between extraversion scores and the most preferred colour scores, for all the four groups. The mean, standard deviation, and correlation for the four groups was found to be 436. 4 (IF), 529. 2 (IM), 504 (EF), 453. 4 (EM) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{industrial}} {{quality inspection}} of colour texture surfaces, such as ceramic tiles or fabrics, {{it is important}} to maintain a consistent <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> or tonality during pro-duction. We present a multidimensional histogram method using a novelty detection scheme to inspect the surfaces. The image noise, introduced by the imaging system, is found mainly to affect the chromatic channels. For colour tonality inspection, the difference between images is very subtle and comparison in the noise dominated chromatic channels is er-ror prone. We perform vector-ordered colour smoothing and extract a localised feature vector at each pixel. The resulting histogram represents an encapsulation of local and global information. Principal component analysis (PCA) is per-formed on this multidimensional feature space of an auto-matically selected reference image to obtain reliable <b>colour</b> <b>shade</b> features, which results in a reference eigenspace. Then unseen product images are projected onto this eigenspace and compared for tonality defect detection using histogram comparison. The proposed method is compared and evalu-ated on a data set with groundtruth...|$|E
