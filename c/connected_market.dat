We prove existence and explicitly characterize equilibrium when transportation costs are quadratic. We exhibit interesting equilibrium features for price policy, market shares, and profits. In equilibrium, the multiproduct firm uses its <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> shares to build asymmetric pricing schemes that allow {{a fraction of}} its product line (brands, stores or firms) to be shielded from outside competition and hence extracts maximum consumer surplus. Our results {{shed some light on}} the link between product differentiation and mergers and acquisitions activity (M&As). ...|$|E

This gives rise to data-driven indirect network effects. We construct a dynamic model of R&D competition, where duopolists repeatedly determine their innovation investments, and show that such markets tip under very mild conditions, moving towards monopoly. In a tipped market, innovation incentives both for the dominant firm and for competitors are small. We also show under which conditions a dominant firm in one market can leverage its position to a <b>connected</b> <b>market,</b> thereby initiating a domino effect. We show that market tipping can be avoided if competitors share their user information...|$|E

In this paper we introduce two new risk measures that generalise the Conditional Value–at–Risk and the Conditional Expected Shortfall in a multiple setting. The proposed risk measures aim to capture extreme tail co–movements among several multivariate <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> participants experiencing contemporaneous distress instances. Analytical expressions for the risk measures are obtained under a parametric model that postulates a joint dynamic {{evolution of}} the underlying institutions' losses and gains. We consider a multivariate Student–t version of Markov Switching models as a robust alternative to the usual multivariate Gaussian specification, accounting for heavy–tails and time varying non–linear correlations. An empirical application to US banks is considered to show that our model–based risk measurement framework provides a better characterisation of the dynamic evolution of the overall risk of a financial system and a more complete picture of how the risk spreads among institutions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Global {{companies}} are pressed {{by the need}} to simultaneously manage globally since they consider the whole world as their own market, and locally, because the global market consists of various different and weakly <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> segments. The need to be global and local at the same time presents, perhaps the most important challenge for management of global companies in 21 st century. Searching this balance presents also an important challenge for human resource management (HRM), regarding the ways of accomplishing it. HRM is expected to contribute to achievement of global competitive advantage worldwide efficiency, local responsiveness, as well as transfer of learning within global organizations. The transfer of learning gains on its importance as many authors see it as the main motive of establishing global companies. However, regardless of recognized significance of organizational learning for global companies, international HRM literature simply lacks studies related to transfer of learning, recommendations about how to develop this organizational ability, how to improve it and measure, and how to provide permanency of the learning process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is through reviewing the relevant literature, to shed light on different aspects of the responsiveness-integration paradigm and its implications on the transfer of learning in global companies...|$|E
40|$|Consumer credit {{borrowing}} – using credit cards, store {{cards and}} personal loans – {{is an important}} and routine part of many of our lives. But what happens when these everyday forms of borrowing go ‘bad’, when people start to default on their loans and when they cannot, or will not, repay? It is this poorly understood, controversial, but central part of both the consumer credit industry and the lived experiences of {{an increasing number of}} people that this book explores. Drawing on research from the interior of the debt collections industry, as well as debtors' own accounts and historical research into technologies of lending and collection, it examines precisely how this ever more sophisticated, globally <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> functions. It focuses on the highly intimate techniques used to try and recoup defaulting debts from borrowers, {{as well as on the}} collection industry’s relationship with lenders. Joe Deville follows a journey of default, from debtors’ borrowing practices, to the intrusion of collections technologies into their homes and everyday lives, to the collections organisation, to attempts by debtors to seek outside help. In the process he shows how to understand this particular market, we need to understand the central role played within it by emotion and affect. By opening up for scrutiny an area of the economy which is often hidden from view, this book makes a major contribution both to understanding the relationship between emotion and calculation in markets and the role of consumer credit in our societies and economies. This book will be of interest to students, teachers and researchers in a range of fields, including sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, economics and social psychology...|$|E
40|$|Personalisation is {{the latest}} dynamic in the long and complex {{relationship}} between the third and public sectors who work {{within the field of}} social care. It has been seen as both an opportunity for third sector organisations (TSOs) to have the freedom to deliver the more flexible and holistic support that they aspire to, but also a potential financial challenge due to the need to compete for more individualised purchasing of care. In this paper we respond to calls to move beyond seeing personalisation as a ‘blanket’ approach and experience, through exploring the impacts within the particular field of carer support. Building on a literature review and a stakeholder event, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with those working in the third sector, and those in related policy and commissioning roles within the public sector. These interviews highlighted the fact that despite different perspectives on the scale and nature of change required, the move towards more personalised support was seen as a positive development for carers. Benefits that were reported included opportunities to pursue personal interests, to have regular breaks from caring and to improve the relationship with the ‘cared for’. However, such impacts were seen to be reduced through lack of public sector funding, complicated and lengthy assessment and financial procedures, and carers’ personal ability and capacity to take up the potential opportunities. The aspiration of personalisation (that is, more individualised and flexible support determined and led by the recipients) was seen by most interviewees as being in line with the values of TSOs who work in this sector. In principle this would mean that TSOs are well placed to respond to carers through a personalised model of care which would therefore be of benefit to carers and TSOs. However, there were also concerns that through their emphasis on quality and fair wages for staff, TSOs may struggle to compete with other providers if carers act as ‘individual consumers’ seeking to get the most service possible from their personal budget allocation. Other interviewees viewed many TSOs as having become complacent and no longer responsive to the changing needs and aspirations of carers, and for them these competitive pressures would either force the existing organisations to change or lead to their decline. Personalised support for carers reflects debates in broader public policy regarding the distinctiveness (or not) of the third sector, and the most beneficial approach through which the public sector should engage with and provide funding to TSOs. Furthermore the <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> pressures will arguably test out in practice if carers do value and will therefore pay for services provided by TSOs. Ultimately though, if personalised support for carers relies on discrete public sector funding, then the chances of significant progress being made in a time of austerity seems unlikely. Success will depend on TSOs being able to identify and draw upon other funding routes (including carers purchasing services out of their own resources) and mainstream services embracing the needs of carers alongside that of the cared-for...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the four}} main market {{segments}} of PV solar electricity {{there are already}} three areas competitive today. These are off-grid industrial and rural as well as consumer applications. The overall growth within the past 8 years was almost 40 % p. a. with a "normal" growth of about 18 % p. a. {{for the first three}} market segments whereas the grid <b>connected</b> <b>market</b> increased with an astonishing 63 % p. a. The different growth rates catapulted the contribution of grid connected systems in relation to the total market from about one quarter 6 years ago towards more than three quarters today. The reason for this development is basically due to industry-politically induced market support programs in the aforementioned countries. It is quite important to outline under which boundary conditions grid connected systems will be competitive without support programs like the feed in tariff system in Germany, Spain and some more to come in Europe as well as investment subsidies in Japan, US and some other countries. It will be shown that in a more and more liberalized utility market worldwide electricity produced by PV solar electricity systems will be able to compete with their generating cost against peak power prices from utilities. The point of time for this competitiveness is mainly determined by the following facts: 1. Price decrease for PV solar electricity systems leading to an equivalent decrease in the generated cost for PV produced kWh. 2. Development of a truly liberalized electricity market. 3. Degree of irradiation between times of peak power demand and delivery of PV electricity. The first topic is discussed using price experience curves. Some explanations will be given to correlate the qualitative number of 20 % price decrease for doubling cumulative worldwide sales derived from the historic price experience curve with a more quantitative analysis based on our EPIA-Roadmap (productivity increase and ongoing improvements for existing technologies as well as development of new concepts to broaden the product portfolio in coming years). The second topic outlines the most likely development of liberalized electricity markets in various regions worldwide. It will be emphasized that in such markets the future prices for electricity will more and more reflect the different cost for bulk and peak power production. This will not only happen for industrial electricity customers - as already today in many countries - but also for private households. The third topic summarizes the existing data and facts by correlating peak power demand and prices traded in various stock exchange markets with delivered PV kWh. It will be shown that a high degree of correlation is existent. Combining the three topics and postulating reverse net metering the competitiveness of PV solar electricity as described is most likely to occur. The described price decrease of modules will also have a very positive impact on off-grid rural applications, mainly in 3 rd world countries. It will be shown that this is strongly advanced due to the development of mini-grids starting from solar home systems - with mini grids looking very similar to on-grid applications in weak grid areas of nowadays electricity network...|$|E

It is also found that it is possible for interconnectors to generate considerable revenues without any consistent price differences between the <b>connected</b> <b>markets.</b> This shows that interconnectors between seemingly very similar electricity markets can be an attractive proposition for a profit-seeking investor.
