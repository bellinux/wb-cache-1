5|$|Among primary {{headache}}s, the International Classification of Headache Disorders {{distinguishes between}} tension headache (the most common), migraine, and <b>cluster</b> <b>headache.</b> Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are {{widely recognized as}} effective {{for the treatment of}} tension headache.|$|E
25|$|The ICHD-2 {{classification}} defines migraines, tension-types headaches, <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> {{and other}} trigeminal autonomic headache {{as the main}} types of primary headaches. Also, according to the same classification, stabbing headaches and headaches due to cough, exertion and sexual activity (sexual headache) are classified as primary headaches. The daily-persistent headaches along with the hypnic headache and thunderclap headaches are considered primary headaches as well.|$|E
25|$|Particularly, {{cardiovascular}} function {{appears to be}} lateralized and tied to emotional stress. Intense emotional stimuli that cause stress can lead to alterations in {{cardiovascular function}}. The right insular cortex probably plays the most significant role in these phenomena. Similar lateralization is probably involved in cardiovascular malfunction in patients with head injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, meningitis and encephalitis, migraine, <b>cluster</b> <b>headache</b> and neurosurgical procedures.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cluster</b> <b>headaches</b> {{are very}} rare. They affect only 1–3 per {{thousand}} {{people in the}} world. <b>Cluster</b> <b>headaches</b> affect approximately {{three times as many}} men as women.|$|R

50|$|Although CPH {{is often}} {{compared}} to <b>cluster</b> <b>headaches,</b> {{it is much}} less prevalent, occurring in only 1-3% of those who experience <b>cluster</b> <b>headaches.</b> CPH occurs roughly in 1 in 50,000 people, while <b>cluster</b> <b>headaches</b> are comparatively more common and are found in 1 in 1000 people.Cluster headaches occur primarily in men, while CPH is more commonly diagnosed in women. The female to male ratio of diagnosed patients can range anywhere from 1.6:1 to 2.36:1. Symptoms may begin to appear at any age, but onset usually occurs in adulthood with a mean starting age within the thirties.|$|R
500|$|The {{trigeminal nerve}} (V) {{comprises}} three distinct parts: [...] The Ophthalmic (V1), the Maxillary (V2), and the Mandibular (V3) nerves. [...] Combined, these nerves provide sensation {{to the skin}} of the face and also controls the muscles of mastication (chewing). Conditions affecting the trigeminal nerve (V) include trigeminal neuralgia, <b>cluster</b> <b>headache,</b> and trigeminal zoster.|$|E
500|$|Painful {{conditions}} {{which do not}} originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or alveolar mucosa (usually squamous cell carcinoma), {{conditions which}} cause gingivostomatitis and desquamative gingivitis. Various conditions may involve the alveolar bone, and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, infarcts in the jaws caused by sickle cell disease, and osteomyelitis. Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal zoster (maxillary or mandibular division), trigeminal neuralgia, <b>cluster</b> <b>headache,</b> and trigeminal neuropathies. Very rarely, a brain tumor might cause toothache. Another chronic facial pain syndrome which can mimic toothache is temporomandibular disorder (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. [...] Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed atypical odontalgia, which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain). Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth).|$|E

25|$|For {{people with}} {{extended}} periods of <b>cluster</b> <b>headaches,</b> preventive therapy can be necessary. Verapamil is recommended as first line treatment. Lithium can also be useful.
