5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's freedom of <b>choice,</b> <b>at</b> {{the moment of the}} annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being one}} of a short group of non-championship games still {{detailed}} in the Official Rules and Records Book of the Billiard Congress of America, as of 2006, bottle pool was known only to be the billiard sport of general <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> a few New York City social clubs such as the two mentioned previously. A veteran member of both those clubs opined in 2006 that there were then fewer than 1,000 dedicated bottle pool players nationwide.|$|E

He was the first <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> left-back for manager Tony Pulis, playing in 28 league matches as the team {{successfully}} fought for survival. However, he missed the final five matches of the season due to a slipped disc. He later underwent surgery.|$|E

For instance, bottle pool {{is known to have}} had a dedicated following with faculty at the University of Michigan from 1911 until approximately 1999, and is the billiard game of <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> exclusive New York City enclaves such as the Racquet and Tennis Club and the Union Club.|$|E
5|$|Royal Rumble (2005) was {{the eighteenth}} annual Royal Rumble {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was presented by PlayStation 2 and {{took place on}} January 30, 2005, at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California and featured talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a match at that year's WrestleMania, (in this instance: WrestleMania 21) for his <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> either the WWE Championship or the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Some {{shortest}} path {{problems that can}} be solved using the A * algorithm have a large branching factor due to the combination of multiple <b>choices</b> <b>at</b> each move. Multiple sequence alignment and multi-agent pathfinding are examples of such problems. If the search can be stopped after each choice instead of being stopped at each combination of choices, it takes much less memory and much less time. The goal of the paper {{is to show that}} Partial Move A * is much better than A * for these problems when the branching factor is large due to a large combination of <b>choices</b> <b>at</b> each move. When there is such a large combination of <b>choices</b> <b>at</b> each move, Partial Move A * can yield large memory gains and speedups over regular A*. I...|$|R

5|$|The leading staged rivalry {{written into}} the event was between Batista and King Booker. At Survivor Series, WWE's November {{pay-per-view}} event, Batista defeated Booker to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 1, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, one of WWE's primary television programs, King Booker and Finlay both demanded a match against Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. General Manager Theodore Long, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that Booker and Finlay would instead form a tag team to compete against Batista and a partner of his <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> Armageddon. Later that night, Batista announced that his partner would be WWE Champion John Cena, {{a member of the}} Raw brand. The following week on an episode of SmackDown!, Batista defeated Finlay by disqualification after Booker interfered on Finlay's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, Cena defeated Finlay after lifting Finlay up on his shoulders and slamming him to the mat, a move that Cena dubbed the FU.|$|E
5|$|Tittle led the NFL in {{touchdown}} passes {{for the first}} time in 1955, with 17, while also leading the league with 28 interceptions thrown. When the 49ers hired Frankie Albert as head coach in 1956, Tittle was pleased with the <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> first, figuring Albert would be a good mentor. However, the team lost four of its first five games, and Albert replaced Tittle with rookie Earl Morrall. After a loss to the Los Angeles Rams brought San Francisco's record to 1–6, Tittle regained the starting role and the team finished undefeated with one tie through the season's final five games.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Mr. Nobody {{tells the}} {{journalist}} {{that neither of}} them exist. They are figments {{in the mind of}} the 9-year-old Nemo at the train station, as he was forced to make an impossible choice. The young boy tries to find the correct decision, following each choice to its conclusion. Eventually, the boy takes a third option: to not make the <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> all. He leaves both parents and runs away towards an unknown future. This ambiguous choice somehow leads to him and Anna reuniting happily. The film returns to old Nemo on his death bed. The calculated time arrives and Mr. Nobody's last words are watched by the world. The expansion of the universe comes to a halt and time appears to reverse. The universe ceases to dissipate, and finally begins contracting. Consequently, Nemo's life simplifies itself. He is able to return to his childhood, watch his parents get back together and be with Anna. The 118-year-old man cackles triumphantly as he springs back into awareness with the realization that his younger self has finally found his one true love and life.|$|E

5|$|Oxbow {{was moved}} {{with the rest}} of Lukas' horses to winter {{headquarters}} at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas. He started his Triple Crown prep season on January 19, 2013, with a win at the Fair Grounds Race Course in New Orleans in the mile and 70-yard (1,672 m) Grade III Lecomte Stakes. Ridden for the second time by Jon Court, he went off as the fourth <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> 5–1 and had a favorable number four post position. He came out of the gate quickly and was the front-runner throughout the race. At the top of the homestretch, he was only a half length in front of the field, but then he drew away and won by more than eleven and a half lengths. Horses he beat that day included Golden Soul, who later placed second in the Kentucky Derby, and I've Struck a Nerve, who Oxbow faced again later in the Risen Star Stakes. He earned a speed figure of 94 and an additional ten points towards qualification for the Derby. That month, Lukas also contacted veteran Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens, who had just returned to racing after a seven-year retirement, and discussed having Stevens ride Oxbow in future races.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} scripted into Taboo Tuesday was between John Cena and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship, in which Cena would also defend the title against the fans' choice of three {{possible}} opponents: Kane, The Big Show, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began at Unforgiven, Raw's previous pay-per-view event, in which Cena intentionally disqualified himself. In WWE, a championship cannot change hands via count-out or disqualification, as a result, Cena retained the title. On the October 17 episode of Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, General Manager Eric Bischoff, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, {{announced that a}} standard match involving three wrestlers, termed as a Triple Threat match, for the WWE Championship, would take place between Cena, Angle and the fans' <b>choice</b> <b>at</b> Taboo Tuesday. Bischoff was scripted to promote three series of qualifying matches, in which the winner would receive {{a spot on the}} ballot as a potential challenger to Cena and Angle. The winners were Kane, The Big Show, and Shawn Michaels. The following week, a Triple Threat match was scheduled between the three competitors. Michaels won the match after he delivered a superkick to Big Show and Kane and pinned the Big Show for the win. The following week, Bischoff announced a singles match between Cena and Michaels. Late in the match, Angle attacked both Cena and Michaels. Cena, however, retaliated and lifted Angle up on his shoulders, but Michaels managed to deliver a superkick to Cena.|$|E
