50|$|At a {{small number}} of {{locations}} on single track lines in Britain, interlaced loops had been provided where sprung catch points were required because of the steep gradient. The points {{at either end of the}} loop were set according to the train's direction of travel. Trains running uphill were routed via the loop incorporating the sprung <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b> Trains running downhill used the opposite loop, bypassing the <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> became {{widespread}} in the United Kingdom after the Abergele rail disaster (1868), where runaway wagons containing paraffin oil (kerosene) collided with an express train. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> continued {{to be used in}} the UK until the mid-20th century. At this time, continuous automatic brakes, which automatically stop any vehicles separated from their train, were widely adopted, making <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> largely obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> {{are rarely}} needed, {{it is not}} always clear whether they will in fact derail a runaway train {{effectively}} and as safely as possible. For example, use of Castle Cary <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> would result in the train being directed into a footbridge. Use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> to derail a train that had passed a signal at danger at London Paddington station in June 2016 resulted in the empty train, a British Rail Class 165, hitting and severely damaging an overhead line electrification stanchion, causing all services to and from the station to be halted for hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are {{installed}} on the running line itself, where the railway climbs at a steep gradient. They are used to prevent runaway vehicles colliding with another train further down the slope. In some cases, <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> lead into a sand drag to safely stop the runaway vehicle, which may be travelling at some speed. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are usually held in the 'derail' position by a spring. They can be set to allow a train to pass safely in the downhill direction using a lever or other mechanism to override the spring for a short time.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Gresham {{made his}} Evolve debut losing to Matt Riddle. At Evolve 65 he lost to <b>Catch</b> <b>Point.</b>|$|E
50|$|Yehi {{made his}} Evolve debut at Evolve 51 losing to Lio Rush. Yehi {{returned}} to Evolve in early 2016 in the Style Battle 2016 Tournament Round Robin Challenge losing to Tracy Williams and Matt Riddle. At Evolve 55 he lost to Anthony Nese in a four-way match. At Evolve 56, Yehi joined <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> after {{a loss to}} Drew Gulak. At Evolve 61, Yehi lost a WWE Cruiserweight Classic qualifying match to T.J. Perkins. Yehi defeated Anthony Nese at Evolve 62 after applying a Koji Clutch after Nese attempted a 450 Splash, this was Yehi's first win in Evolve. At Evolve 65, <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> defeat Jonathan Gresham, Darby Allin and Chris Dickinson. At Evolve 73, Yehi and Tracy Williams became the Evolve tag team champions {{for the first time}} after defeating Chris Hero (replacement for Drew Galloway) and DUSTIN, Tony Nese and Drew Gulak, and The Gatekeepers. <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> successfully defended the Evolve Tag Team titles at Evolve 74, defeating Peter Kaasa and Ricochet.|$|E
50|$|Tracy Williams is an American {{professional}} wrestler, currently {{performing for}} Evolve, {{where he is}} the former two-time Evolve Tag Team Champion, with Fred Yehi, forming the team of <b>Catch</b> <b>Point.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> may {{consist of}} a full turnout or a single switch blade. In some cases, on a track that is only traversed by uphill traffic, {{trailing}} point blades are held {{in a position to}} derail any vehicle travelling downhill. However, any traffic travelling in the correct (uphill) direction can pass over the turnout safely, pushing the switch blades into the appropriate position. Once the wheels have passed, the <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> are forced back into the derailing position by springs. In these cases, a lever may be provided to temporarily override the <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> and allow safe passage down the gradient in certain controlled circumstances.|$|R
5000|$|On 12 November 1961, {{locomotive}} No. 48674 was derailed by <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> between Four Oaks and Sutton Coldfield.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, in snowy conditions, at Carrbridge, a Class 66 {{passed a}} red signal {{as well as}} <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ae 6/6 11437 «Stadt Basel» {{caused a}} stir when it derailed after passed a ground signal ("Zwergsignal") at red on a {{shunting}} track and derailed on a <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b> The engine {{ended up in a}} tilted position in the ballast beside the main track. However, it wasn't damaged heavily and returned to service soon after the incident.|$|E
50|$|A border fence {{was built}} on the {{overpass}} at the western end of the station in 1960. In addition to the platform on track 1, there were three platforms with tracks for use within the GDR as well as the more northerly track 11 for freight trains to be dispatched to and from West Germany. This track was secured to the west by a <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b> Only when the person in charge of the Border Troops gave the order could the <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> be set to allow exit to West Germany. Even from the west there were catch points. Moreover, running through the station without stopping was technically impossible. In 1975, four pairs of interzone trains ran via Oebisfelde, in the summer five. In addition, there were nine pairs of trains in passenger trains to/from Stendal, ten pairs of trains to/from Haldensleben and six to seven pairs of trains to/from Salzwedel. Steam trains operated until 1988. Immediately west of the station there was a collision between an express train and a tank car on 27 July 1991. There were three deaths; it took several years to clear the site.|$|E
5000|$|At Evolve 64, {{a grudge}} match between Galloway and Drew Gulak was rescheduled as an Evolve Tag Team Championship main-event match between <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> and Galloway and the {{returning}} Chuck Taylor (now wrestling {{under the name}} [...] "Dustin"). Galloway and DUSTIN were successful in capturing the championships, making Galloway the first ever two-time Evolve Tag Team Champion. The following night in the main-event of Evolve 65, Galloway defeated Johnny Gargano, following two Future Shock DDT's, a Claymore kick and three Tombstone Piledrivers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> {{originate}} {{from the days}} of the 'unfitted' goods train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely unbraked wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive's own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually applied brakes (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake runaway cars. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst climbing a steep grade - although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all 'fitted' (and broken couplings are far less common), <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> are mostly obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Near the 2 milepost, {{there was}} a quarry siding {{on the east side}} of the line, and a further set of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> in both running lines.|$|R
25|$|The waggon {{capacity}} was 50 cwt in 1784, {{increased to}} 60 cwt by 1796. In the early 1820s Elgin waggonway had spring <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> with iron rails, worked by remote control.|$|R
50|$|The {{new line}} {{runs through the}} area of the station on a roughly 15 metre-high embankment. The station's tracks are divided into an area for {{high-speed}} line operations (with the German operating points code of FMT) and an area serving regional operations on the Lower Westerwald Railway (operating points abbreviation FMTN). There is only an indirect connection between the two parts: the eastern <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> from the northern Intercity-Express (ICE) platform track (4), has a connection to platform track 5 (the regional platform); this involves a reversal.|$|E
50|$|In October 2009 it was {{confirmed}} that the Byrom Street cutting was a hitching and unhitching point for trains being cable hauled to Edge Hill via the Victoria Tunnel. Shunting locomotives took trains from The Waterloo Good Station to the cutting to be hitched onto the cable. The Cutting was also a water and fuelling point for shunters. After 1895 cable hauling ceased and locomotives pulled trains the whole length of the Victoria and Waterloo tunnels. Byrom Street Cutting became a runaway <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> for runaway trains in the tunnel. Byrom Street cutting was never a passenger station. The Victoria and Waterloo tunnels were cleared of debris and reflectors placed on the roof after a survey of the tunnels.|$|E
5000|$|Dustin and Galloway {{made their}} first Evolve Tag Team Championship defense at Evolve 67 on 20 August 2016. They teamed with EC3 against Fred Yehi, TJP and Ethan Page (replacement for Tracy Williams) in a No DQ Six Man Tag where a pin fall on EC3 {{would result in}} a title change. At this show, Galloway would also build a feud with his former WWE Tag Team partner Cody Rhodes and veteran {{announcer}} Joey Styles, after they both refused his invitation to join his [...] "crusade". On 13 November, while Galloway was out with an injury, Dustin and Galloway's replacement, Chris Hero, lost the Evolve Tag Team Championship. However, it was later announced that, despite supposed champions <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> holding the physical belts, Evolve would continue to recognise both Galloway and Dustin as the Evolve Tag Team Champions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> and {{trap points}} are types of turnout which act as railway safety devices. Both work by guiding railway {{carriages}} and trucks from a dangerous route onto a separate, safer track. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> {{are used to}} derail vehicles which {{are out of control}} on steep slopes (known as runaways). Trap points are used to protect main railway lines from unauthorised vehicles moving onto them from sidings or branch lines. Either of these track arrangements may lead the vehicles into a sand drag or safety siding, track arrangements which are used to safely stop them after they have left the main tracks.|$|R
50|$|A {{freight train}} became divided at Pendlebury, Lancashire. The rear portion {{was too heavy}} for the banking {{locomotive}} to hold, and it was pushed back downhill and derailed by <b>catch</b> <b>points,</b> as were the wagons.|$|R
50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{interrupter}} may be fitted at <b>catch</b> <b>points,</b> trap points or buffer stops {{to maintain a}} track circuit in the 'occupied' state {{in the event of}} a derailment. The track circuit remains de-energised until the interrupter is replaced.|$|R
5000|$|Between 22 and 24 January 2016, Galloway and Johnny Gargano {{entered a}} three-day tournament to crown the inaugural Evolve Tag Team Champions. At Evolve 53, they {{defeated}} <b>Catch</b> <b>Point</b> (Drew Gulak and TJ Perkins), at Evolve 54 they defeated The Bravado Brothers {{and in the}} finals at Evolve 55, Galloway and Gargano defeated Chris Hero and Tommy End to win the tournament and championship. They lost the title to Drew Gulak and Tracy Williams on 2 April. Following the match Galloway went on a rant claiming he spent his entire title reign as Evolve champion bringing legitimacy to Evolve only for WWE and more specifically NXT to come and squash everything he did while also claiming the companies working relationship with WWE was compromising independent wrestling. Galloway then turned on Gargano, attacking him and Ethan Page. At EVOLVE 60, Galloway defeated Ethan Page. Over the following months, Galloway began aligning himself with other former WWE stars starting with Ethan Carter III who debuted for the promotion at Evolve 61 attacking Johnny Gargano during his match with Galloway. Continuing the feud, Galloway and EC3 defeated Gargano and TJP in the street fight main-event to Evolve 62 with help from Chris Hero who joined their group and would then claim Cody Rhodes would be joining the group too. The following night at Evolve 63, Galloway defeated Ethan Page in an [...] "Anything Goes" [...] match.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a path planning and control strategy that enables an unmanned non-holonomic vehicle to intercept a fast moving object. The path planning is performed under model uncertainty, {{with respect to}} the vehicle's maneuverability, as well as uncertainty in the estimation of the object's future trajectory and position. This problem involves the tracking of the dynamic object in a cluttered environment and the accurate estimation of its future position in the presence of noisy measurements. The ground vehicle (interceptor) is required to intercept the dynamic object at a predicted (catch) location in a finite amount of time. This time restriction presents quite a challenge given the inherent limitation in the vehicle's steering and maneuverability. The solution strategy is divided into three sub-problems: 1) prediction, 2) path planning and 3) control. The prediction of the parameters that describe the dynamic's object in space is accomplished via Kalman Filtering which, in conjunction with an impact predictor, provide the waypoints needed to construct a reference path that will place the interceptor {{on a collision course with}} the dynamic object (target.) A pure pursuit algorithm was used to steer the interceptor along a reference trajectory, which was designed to make the vehicle engage the dynamic object on a near tail-on aspect. In the endgame, the pure pursuit algorithm was modified to ensure arrival to the <b>catch</b> <b>point</b> while a position controller was added to ensure timely arrival to the predicted catch location. The problem statement was then augmented to include obstacle avoidance. (cont.) The dynamic object was required to navigate around fixed obstacles in order to catch the dynamic object. Results will show that the proposed strategy performed very well in the absence of obstacles and was well suited to handle the maneuverability constraints of the non-holonomic vehicle. Results also will show that, with minor modifications to the path planner, the interceptor successfully managed to avoid obstacles and catch the dynamic object although at a slightly lower success rate. The proposed solution was first demonstrated in simulation and then tested using MIT's RAVEN testbed. by Sergio A. Cafarelli. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|Disused station Rupertswood {{is located}} between Clarkefield and Sunbury. Clarkefield was the {{junction}} for the Lancefield branch line which operated between 1881 and 1956. <b>Catch</b> <b>Points</b> were in use at Clarkefield in 1929. The station was historically known as Lancefield Junction for this reason.|$|R
50|$|East {{and west}} of the station are sets of points leading to the {{platform}} tracks. Operations over the points toward the platform tracks can be run at 100 km/h. The main through tracks are protected by <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> against side-on collisions from trains running from the platform tracks.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Jewell's, a branch line curved {{off to the}} right to the John Darling mine, the <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> to this siding {{actually}} joining the derelict duplication and by the layout it was apparently intended to work each road as an independent single line as far as Redhead.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second type}} of derail is the [...] "split rail" [...] type. These are {{basically}} a complete or partial railroad switch which directs the errant rolling stock away from the main line. This form is common throughout the UK, where it is called trap <b>points</b> or <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 12 July 1932, {{locomotive}} No. 4738 was hauling {{a passenger}} train that ran {{back in a}} tunnel at [...] station and was derailed by <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b> The derailed carriages fouled an adjacent line and a freight train ran into them and was also derailed. There were no injuries.|$|R
50|$|Near the 1 milepost was {{the level}} {{crossing}} at Shandon, where the railway crossed the road leading to Shandon {{station on the}} West Highland Railway. Sprung <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> were installed in the Up (southbound) line {{just south of the}} crossing on account of the gradient which fell steeply towards Faslane.|$|R
50|$|Railway {{trackage}} has guard rails (aka check rails) {{to guide}} wheels through possible <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> on turnouts or diamonds. Similarly, guard rails may be installed inside the innermost running rails on very sharp curves.
