40|$|In {{the quest}} to {{increase}} channel bandwidths in wireless communication systems, two important trends are to move towards wider continuous bands at mm-wave frequencies and to aggregate smaller bands at cellular frequencies. In this dissertation {{a few of the}} challenges and possible circuit and DSP solutions for efficient high data rate communication using these techniques are described. First, an issue relating to cellular uplink carrier aggregation is discussed and a DSP based solution developed. Second, the design of a broad band CMOS PA for mm-wave applications is presented. Third, the design of an mm-wave predistortion system and its use to predistort an array of mm-wave CMOS SOI PAs is described. In the near term, cellular carriers plan on employing carrier aggregation to increase data rates. This can lead to significant receiver desensitization for a number of LTE band combinations, because of the cross-modulation products created by the nonlinearity of RF front-end components. To mitigate this effect, an all-digital cancellation algorithm is proposed in this thesis that canceled the <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>product</b> and improved the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and error-vector-magnitude (EVM) of the desired received signal by up to 20 dB. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation, the possibility of using mm-wave CMOS PAs for wideband communication is described. The design of CMOS stacked-FET PAs with an emphasis on appropriate complex impedances between the transistors is presented. The stacking of multiple FETs enables the use of higher supply voltages, which in turn allows higher output power and a broader bandwidth output matching network. A 4 -stack amplifier design that achieves a saturated output power greater than 21 dBm while achieving a maximum power-added- efficiency (PAE) greater than 20 % from 38 GHz to 47 GHz is reported. Finally, the thesis describes predistortion of an array of stacked-FET PAs after spatial power combining. Predistortion improved the signal quality to a high level, which allowed the use of complex modulation schemes, which in turn allows high data rates in a spectrally efficient manner. After predistortion a 100 -MHz wide, 1024 -QAM signal was demodulated with an EVM of 1. 3 %, which corresponds to a data rate of 1 Gb/...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} {{characterize}} the memory effects in a nonlinear concurrent dual-band transmitter is presented. It {{is an extension of}} the conventional two tone test for power amplifiers to concurrent dual band transmitters. The output signal of a concurrent dual-band transmitter is affected not only by intermodulation products but also by <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>products.</b> In one frequency band, the transmitter is excited by a two tone signal which frequency separation is swept. In the second band the transmitter is concurrently excited by an other two tone signal with slightly wider frequency separation. The frequency difference of the two signals is fixed during the frequency sweep. The two tone test is made at different power levels. The upper and lower third-order inter- and <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>products</b> are measured. The asymmetry between the upper and lower third-order inter- and <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>products</b> are measures of the transmitter's memory effects. The measurement results show that the memory effects are more dominant in the third-order intermodulation products than in the cross modulation products. An error analysis and system calibration was performed and measurement results for two different devices are presented. QC 20150604 </p...|$|R
40|$|The World {{today is}} deeply {{transformed}} by the advancement in wireless technology. The envision of a smart society where interactions between physical and virtual dimensions of life are intertwined and where human interaction is mediated by machines, e. g., smart phones, demands increasingly more data traffic. This continual increase in data traffic requires re-designing of the wireless technologies for increased system capacity and flexibility. In this thesis, aspects related to behavioral modeling, characterization, and linearization of multi-channel/band power amplifiers (PAs) are discussed. When building a model of any system, it is advantageous {{to take into account}} the knowledge of the physics of the system and include into the model. This approach could help to improve the model performance. In this context, three novel behavioral models and DPD schemes for nonlinear MIMO transmitters are proposed. To model and compensate distortions in GaN based RF PAs in presence of long-term memory effects, novel models for SISO and concurrent dual-band PAs are proposed. These models are based on a fixed pole expansion technique and have infinite impulse response. They show substantial performance improvement. A behavioral model based on the physical knowledge of the concurrent dual-band PA is derived, and its performance is investigated both for behavioral modeling and compensation of nonlinear distortions. Two-tone characterization is a fingerprint method for the characterization of memory effects in dynamic nonlinear systems. In this context, two novel techniques are proposed. The first technique is a dual two-tone characterization technique to characterize the memory effects of self- and <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>products</b> in concurrent dual-band transmitter. The second technique is for the characterization and analysis of self- and cross-Volterra kernels of nonlinear 3 x 3 MIMO systems using three-tone signals. QC 20161205 </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{development of}} recent research in nonlinear distortion is {{the expansion of}} the conventional two-tone test for power amplifiers to the concurrent dual-band transmitters, by Amin et al. A general framework using dual two-tones is developed, which shows that the output signal is affected not only by intermodulation (IM) products but also by <b>cross-modulation</b> (CM) <b>products.</b> In this paper, we will make a number of clarifications to Amin et al. 2 ̆ 7 s paper. The effects of IM and CM in passband will be discussed, IM represents a reduction for compressive devices, and CM reflects an interference caused by the signal from the other band, and followed by the analysis of out-of-band IM. It was concluded that out-of-band IM needs to be taken into consideration for the design of power amplifiers when two bands are very close...|$|R
40|$|In a {{multimode}} transceiver, several communication standards may {{be active}} {{at the same}} time. Owing to {{the small size of}} the transceiver, the transmitter for one standard induces a large interference on the receiver for another one. When this large interference passes through the inherently non-linear receiver front-end (FE), distortion products are generated. Among these <b>products,</b> the <b>cross-modulation</b> (CM) <b>product</b> is the most problematic one, as it always has the same centre frequency as the desired signal. Increasing the FE linearity to lower the CM distortion leads to unacceptable power consumption for a handheld device. Considering the continuous increase of digital computation power governed by Moore’s law an attractive alternative approach is to digitally compensate for the CM distortion. An existing solution to compensate for the CM distortion is tailored to single-mode transceivers and requires an auxiliary FE. By using the locally available transmitted interference in the multimode transceiver, the authors propose a CM compensation method which requires no additional analogue hardware. Hence the power consumption and complexity of the multimode transceiver can be reduced significantly. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can lower distortion to a negligible amount at realistic interference levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{demands for}} high data rates and {{broadband}} wireless access require the development of wireless systems that can support wide and multi-band signals. To deploy these signals, new radio frequency (RF) front-ends are required which impose new challenges in terms of power consumption efficiency and sources of distortion e. g., nonlinearity. These challenges are more pronounced in power amplifiers (PAs) that degrade the overall performance of the RF transmitter. Since {{it is difficult to}} optimize the linearity and efficiency characteristics of a PA simultaneously, a trade-off is needed. At high input power, a PA exhibits high efficiency at the expense of linearity. On the other hand, at low input power, a PA is linear {{at the expense of the}} efficiency. To achieve linearity and efficiency at the same time, digital pre-distortion (DPD) is often used to compensate for the PA nonlinearity at high input power. In case of multi-channel PAs, input and output signals of different channels interact with each other due to cross-talk. Therefore, these PAs exhibit different nonlinear behavior than the single-input single-output (SISO) PAs. The DPD techniques developed for SISO PAs do not result in adequate performance when used for multi-channel PAs. Hence, an accurate behavioral modeling is essential for the development of DPD for multi-channel RF PAs. In this thesis, we propose three novel behavioral models and DPD schemes for nonlinear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmitters in presence of cross-talk. A study of the source of cross-talk in MIMO transmitters have been investigated to derive simple and powerful modeling schemes. These models are extensions of a SISO generalized memory polynomial model. A comparative study with a previously published MIMO model is also presented. The effect of coherent and partially non-coherent signal generationon DPD performance is also highlighted. It is shown experimentally that with partially non-coherent signal generation, the performance of the DPD degrades compared to coherent signal generation. In context of multi-channel RF transmitters, PA behavioral models and DPD schemes suffer from a large number of model parameters with the increase in nonlinear order and memory depth. This growth leads to high complexity model identification and implementation. We have designed a DPD scheme for MIMO PAs using a sparse estimation technique for reducing model complexity. This technique also increases the numerical stability when linear least square estimation model identification is used. A method to characterize the memory effects in a nonlinear concurrent dual-band PAs is also presented. Compared to the SISO PAs, concurrent dual-band PAs are not only affected by intermodulation distortions but also by cross-modulation distortions. The characterization of memory effects inconcurrent dual-band transmitter is performed by injecting a two-tone test signal in each input channel of the transmitter. Asymmetric energy surfaces are introduced for the intermodulation and <b>cross-modulation</b> <b>products,</b> which can be used to identify the power and frequency regions where the memory effects are dominant.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} (RF) {{power amplifiers}} (PAs) represent {{the most challenging}} design parts of wireless transmitters. In order to be more energy efficient, PAs should operate in nonlinear region where they produce distortion that significantly degrades the quality of signal at transmitter’s output. With the aim of reducing this distortion and improve signal quality, digital predistortion (DPD) techniques are widely used. This work focuses on improving the performances of DPDs in modern, next-generation wireless transmitters. A new adaptive DPD based on an iterative injection approach is developed and experimentally verified using a 4 G signal. The signal performances at transmitter output are notably improved, while the proposed DPD does not require large digital signal processing memory resources and computational complexity. Moreover, the injection-based DPD theory is extended to be applicable in concurrent dual-band wireless transmitters. A cross-modulation problem specific to concurrent dual-band transmitters is investigated in detail and novel DPD based on simultaneous injection of intermodulation and <b>cross-modulation</b> distortion <b>products</b> is proposed. In order to mitigate distortion compensation limit phenomena and memory effects in highly nonlinear RF PAs, this DPD is further extended and complete generalised DPD system for concurrent dual-band transmitters is developed. It is clearly proved in experiments that the proposed predistorter remarkably improves the in-band and out-of-band performances of both signals. Furthermore, it {{does not depend on}} frequency separation between frequency bands and has significantly lower complexity in comparison with previously reported concurrent dual-band DPDs...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is to develop and {{investigate}} a new possible solution for compensation of in-phase/quadrature-phase (I/Q) impairments and power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity in wireless transmitters using accurate, low complexity digital predistortion (DPD) technique. After analysing the distortion created by I/Q modulators and PAs together with nonlinear crosstalk effects in multi-branch {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) wireless transmitters, a novel two-box model is proposed for eliminating those effects. The model is realised by implementing two phases which provide an optimisation of the identification of any system. Another improvement is the capability of higher performance of the system without increasing the computational complexity. Compared with conventional and recently proposed models, the approach developed in this thesis shows promising results in the linearisation of wireless transmitters. Furthermore, the two-box model is extended for concurrent dual-band wireless transmitters and it takes into account <b>cross-modulation</b> (CM) <b>products.</b> Besides, it uses independent processing blocks for both frequency bands and reduces the sampling rate requirements of converters (digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital). By using two phases for the implementation, the model enables a scaling down of the nonlinear order and the memory depth of the applied mathematical functions. This leads to a reduced computational complexity in comparison with recently developed models. The thesis provides experimental verification of the two-box model for multi-branch MIMO and concurrent dual-band wireless transmitters. Accordingly, the results ensure both the compensation of distortion and the performance evaluation of modern broadband wireless transmitters in terms of accuracy and complexity...|$|R

The proposed architecture {{is based on}} simultaneous injection of in-band intermodulation (IM) and <b>cross-modulation</b> (CM) distortion <b>products.</b> A general fundamental-frequency model for concurrent dual-band transmitter is developed theoretically and proofed experimentally. An individual impact of each IM and CM distortion component is theoretically derived and analyzed. It is clearly proven by theoretical analysis and experiments that the proposed predistorter improves the in-band and out-of-band performances of both signals. The simulation and experimental studies are performed using various signal sets. The proposed predistorter {{does not depend on}} frequency separation between bands and has low computational complexity in comparison with concurrent dual-band DPD's state-of-the-art. In addition, it is clearly shown in experiments that when using iterative simultaneous injections, a phenomenon known as distortion compensation limit can be reduced.
