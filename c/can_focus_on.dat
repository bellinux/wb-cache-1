While driving through a snowstorm, Paul accidentally hits Stephen King with his car, causing Paul to swerve {{off the road and}} crash into a snowbank, while King gets the idea for another novel within seconds and manages to finish writing the plot in just a few seconds before hitting the ground completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|The party {{claims that}} by disowning tariffs and {{restrictions}} {{imposed by the}} European Union Customs Union (EUCU) the UK <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> adopting amicable free trade with the Commonwealth of Nations. The party would further seek to reduce unemployment by limiting the proportion of migrant work imported from EU member states, as well as attempt to lower Council Tax by scrapping the fiscal implications of the union's Landfill Directive. Independence from Europe claims that by abandoning the EU, and thus the cost of membership, the UK's national debt can be cleared. Domestic budgetary policies include the raising of personal allowance to £15,000, broad simplification of both personal and corporate tax and opposition to zero-hours contracts. In addition, the party condones the forced collection of tax from evaders and the nationalisation of private finance initiatives (PFIs).|$|E

5|$|Following her {{resignation}} from Vector in {{the wake}} of her discoveries and the Gnosis Terrorism, Shion allies with underground group Scientia to investigate. Her former co-worker Allen takes her place looking after KOS-MOS. Meanwhile, Canaan, Jr., Jin, chaos, MOMO and Ziggy are investigating a landmass that originated from Lost Jerusalem. They are attacked by Margulis, then the landmass is swallowed with the Elsa in an inverted pocket of hyperspace. Shion meanwhile visits Allen, and sees the demonstration of two new weapons for fighting the Gnosis—T-elos, a battle robot meant to replace KOS-MOS; and Omega, a mech created from the Proto Omega's remains and piloted by Abel. After the test, T-elos' creator Roth Mantel informs Allen that KOS-MOS will be scrapped so development <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> T-elos. As KOS-MOS's weaponry {{is the only way to}} break into the hyperspace pocket and save the Elsa, Shion leads the group into the facility and rescues KOS-MOS, guided at one point by Abel. During this time, Shion has frequent visions of the girl Nephilim, and has blackouts where she is contacted by U-DO. Events are also observed by Wilhelm, who is working with the Testaments to find both Abel and Abel's Ark.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E

25|$|According to the Transactional Model, people {{deal with}} {{stressful}} situations by appraisals of stressor and resources. The primary appraisal {{deals with the}} individual meaning of the specific stressor, which is the care situation in this case. The secondary appraisal analyzes the own abilities and resources to cope with that situation. On this basis, the individual coping efforts are used {{to deal with the}} stressful situation. As per Carver, these efforts <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> problem management or emotional regulation. Dysfunctional strategies are possible, too. Studies found that a high caregiver burden often comes along with dysfunctional strategies what means activities which don’t solve the problem but worsen it (e.g. self-criticism, substance abuse).|$|E
25|$|Train-based ICBMs do {{offer some}} {{advantages}} over missiles in fixed silos, namely {{that the enemy}} can never be sure where they are—or, more accurately, where {{all of them are}} at any given moment. But as a 2014 RAND study pointed out, rail and truck launchers have their drawbacks. Maintaining a missile on a train is more difficult than in a silo, while rail lines and roads can be blocked by snow, which tends to restrict railroad ICBMs to warmer climates. In addition, because there are {{only a limited number of}} rail lines and highways in an area, enemy surveillance <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> a few areas. And, once located, mobile missiles are more vulnerable than ICBMs in hardened silos.|$|E

Provided with the guidance of Howcast producers, filmmakers are encouraged to flex their creative muscles while building their professional reels and launching their online careers. Filmmakers choose from ready-to-shoot scripts in numerous categories. Each script includes pre-recorded voiceovers, animated graphics, and music tracks so that filmmakers <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the creative aspects of shooting and editing their videos. Every accepted video earns a stipend of $50 and if a video is a success on Howcast.com, there are opportunities for revenue sharing.|$|E
25|$|Every student {{engages in}} a mentored {{scholarly}} project conducted longitudinally throughout the four-year curriculum. Completion and {{presentation of the}} scholarly project is due {{in the spring of}} the senior year and is a requirement for graduation. Students pursue their projects through several program options, which may include areas of concentration. Students <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> more traditional laboratory-based or clinical research projects or can conduct research in less common areas such as health policy, epidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research. An innovative system of Web-based learning portfolios facilitates learner-mentor communication and enriches the possibilities for collaboration within and beyond the University. The Scholarly Project immerses students in scientific investigation to foster data-collection, hypothesis-development, and research skills that are critical to the practice of clinical medicine.|$|E

In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E

25|$|Non-human {{research}} {{still has}} a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points {{in the evolution of}} what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, {{as it is in the}} nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using plovers and dogs, and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.|$|E

The New Rolling Stone Album Guide commented that [...] "heartfelt pleas for racial unity and cloudy musings on the 'State of the World' don't obscure the pulsating beat of other songs" [...] from the album. Jonathan Van Meter from Spin was critical of the song, saying that [...] "State of the World", [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] formed [...] "a Spike Lee-esque trilogy made even less convincing by a tiresome house music back-beat and that unfortunate, outdated beat on every fourth count". AllMusic's editor Alex Henderson called the song [...] "disturbing".|$|E

500|$|Although Daniels {{had claimed}} to be {{reluctant}} to seek higher office, many media outlets, including Politico, The Weekly Standard, Forbes, The Washington Post, CNN, The Economist, and The Indianapolis Star began to speculate that Daniels may intend to seek the Republican nomination for president in 2012 after he joined the national debate on cap and trade legislation by penning a response in The Wall Street Journal to policies espoused by the Democratic-majority Congress and the White House in August 2010. The speculation has included Daniels' record of reforming government, reducing taxes, balancing the budget, and connecting with voters in Indiana. Despite his signing into law of bills that toughened drug enforcement, regulated abortion, and a defense of marriage act, he has angered some conservatives because of his call for a [...] "truce" [...] on social issues so the party <b>can</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> fiscal issues.
