40|$|In {{order to}} improve {{real-time}} in industrial wireless network, the TMNP-scheduling algorithm (scheduling algorithm based on throughput maximization of non-periodic <b>communication</b> <b>tasks)</b> is proposed in this paper. The basic principles of TMNP-scheduling algorithm are analyzed, and a theory proof has been finished. The theory proof shows that TMNP-scheduling algorithm optimizes communication window debris. Compared with typical scheduling strategy of application layer in industrial control network, the TMNP-scheduling algorithm improves throughput of non-periodic <b>communication</b> <b>tasks</b> in industrial wireless network. At the same time, the nonlinear programming model is founded to generate scheduling timetable based on TMNP-scheduling algorithm. Finally, a simulation model of industrial wireless network is established. The simulation shows that TMNP-scheduling algorithm is not only effective in reducing time-out problems of periodic <b>communication</b> <b>tasks,</b> but also improving throughput of non-periodic <b>communication</b> <b>tasks.</b> © 2005; 2012 JATIT & LLS.

Interestingly, of the students who scored deviantly high on the Per-Mag, those who also scored above the mean on a depression scale were the most likely to demonstrate cognitive slippage. Additionally, Edell (1987) reinforced the idea that although individuals with sub-clinical psychopathology exhibit more severe thought disorder on unstructured tests, they perform relatively normally on more structured measures of cognition.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} current human-robot <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> is that robots cannot {{understand}} complex human speech utterances, while humans cannot efficiently use the fixed task request utterances required by robots. Nonetheless, future planetary exploration missions {{are expected to}} require astronauts on extra-vehicular activities to communicate task requests to robot assistants with speech- and gesture-type user interfaces {{that can be easily}} embedded in their space suits. The solution proposed in this thesis is indirect <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> based on the human-like ability to utilise object-action relationships in <b>task</b> <b>communication.</b> Conventional <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods, in which all task parameters need to be communicated explicitly, are evaluated against <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods where affordances, i. e. action possibilities, are used to complete <b>task</b> <b>communication.</b> These so-called affordance-based <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods are evaluated by means of four user experiments: two performed with a fully autonomous centauroid robot in a planetary exploration work context and two with a simulated robot in a lander assembly work context. The first two experiments are performed in unambiguous work environments, where each object is associated with only one action and vice versa, while the last two experiments are performed in ambiguous work environments, where each object and action is normally associated with several actions and objects, respectively. The user experiments show that affordance-based <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods can be used to decrease both the human workload and <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> times in a planetary exploration work context. Furthermore, affordance-based <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods are found to be preferred over conventional <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods. The affordance-based <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> methods derived can be applied to facilitate any human-robot <b>task</b> <b>communication</b> that includes a priori known or recurring task sequences. In this thesis, the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated for frame-based dialogue managers, which are widely used in robotics...|$|R
30|$|While {{communication}} channels {{are necessary to}} transfer data between the different tools in the analysis pipeline, {{the need for a}} dedicated communication middleware is not as clear. In some cases, ingestion and <b>communication</b> <b>tasks</b> are handled by the same tool. Figure 5 acknowledges this possibility by displaying both functions in the same box. However, data may flow to an increasingly large number of destinations. Certain tools also split up or parallelize tasks across a large number of distributed workers. Having middleware decouple the ingestion component from other processes supports “asynchronous operations and [promotes] scalability, robustness and performance” [30]. Thus, using dedicated middleware for <b>communication</b> <b>tasks</b> is encouraged for big data systems.|$|R

30|$|We briefly {{explain a}} {{potential}} {{extension of the}} current model to multi-hop scenario. In this case, a task i and its immediate predecessor task j might be allocated to nodes that are {{in one or more}} hops away of each other. Assume that j needs the data from i for execution. Hence, one needs to find the way to communicate this data through multi-hop. In WSNs, the communication is broadcast in nature. To represent the broadcast feature of wireless communication, the DAG representation of application is extended to Hyper-DAG. The weight of edges between two computation tasks is represented as a separate <b>communication</b> <b>task.</b> Unlike in single-hop networks, there might be multiple simultaneous communications in multi-hop networks. In order to schedule the <b>communication</b> <b>task,</b> one models multi-hop channel as a virtual node on which only the <b>communication</b> <b>task</b> can be scheduled. To avoid the interference between simultaneous communication tasks, one may consider the penalty of infinity cost for the case of interference and zero otherwise. In case that the source and destination of a <b>communication</b> <b>task</b> are one or more hop away from each other, one can schedule based on the path generated by a low complexity routing algorithm [25].|$|E

This study attempts to fill some of the gaps by first amalgamating extant research to develop more comprehensive inventories of <b>communication</b> <b>tasks,</b> skills, and attributes (TSA) that would be critical for ELAs. Next, 59 practitioners (who have supervised ELAs) of accounting firms (both Big- 4 and local firms) and members of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) based in Singapore responded to our pilot survey to rate the frequency of <b>communication</b> <b>tasks</b> performed by ELAs, the importance of the identified communication skills and attributes, and the ELAs' communication skills and performance. Findings on importance ratings and importance–performance gaps provide useful insights to accounting/business/communication educators and researchers, higher education institutions, accounting students, and accounting practitioners in Singapore to better understand the current communication needs and/or deficiencies of the accounting profession.

To measure those effects, all blindfolded participants performed a <b>communication</b> <b>task</b> and a collision avoidance task on the first day. They were asked to perform the same tasks two weeks later. Participants of the training condition were asked to play the VAD game for seven days (30 min/day) for two weeks, whereas the control group did not play the game within that period. Results of playing the VAD game revealed {{that the number of}} face-contacts in the <b>communication</b> <b>task</b> increased significantly. In contrast, no difference was detectable in the subjectively rated levels of tension during the <b>communication</b> <b>task</b> between the two conditions. Furthermore, results showed that playing the VAD game altered the participants ’ avoidance behaviors. Therefore, we can conclude that the effects of playing the VAD game transfer to communication behaviors in social interaction and to avoidance behaviors from approaching objects in a real environment. 1...|$|E
