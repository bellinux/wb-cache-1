40|$|The {{potential}} of the Internet as a marketing channel that would give businesses the opportunity to reach global audiences has been identified since its early days. However, the emergence of Social Media was a determining factor in engaging those audiences in a more active way with the Internet phenomenon. In comparison to more traditional marketing media, in Social Media, users are not passive consumers and receivers of marketing messages. Instead, they become actively involved in their creation and sharing (Hanna et al., 2011). User-generated content and content sharing are two important (for companies) activities that prove the <b>consumer's</b> <b>empowerment</b> through Social Media. To {{get a closer look}} at this phenomenon, my research focuses on brand videos that achieve going viral and investigates the extent to which individual video content characteristics (such as audiovisuals and plot) affect the consumer's decision to create a story about a brand video in Social Media...|$|R

Three case studies are provided to better explain the advantages and challenges from implementing online social communities. As customer retention is harder to achieve, and fragmented media and advertising clutter makes traditional marketing highly inefficient, marketers have to find optimal ways to balance their Integrated Marketing Communication mix between old and new channels. A passive recognition of the existing shift in power is not sufficient. The dawn of an interesting and interactive marketing era has arrived. Marketers have to rethink their strategies, as in the future only those companies that facilitate three-way communication dialogue between customers-company- and employees will thrive and succeed...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{pharmaceutical}} {{industry is a}} leader in research and development investment. New treatments need to be communicated to the market, and consumers are increasingly interested in learning about new drugs. Direct to consumer advertising of prescription medicines (DTCA) is a controversial practice where many of the arguments for and against are not supported by strong evidence. This paper aims to contribute to a research agenda that is forming in this area. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reports on a systematic review that was conducted and applies accepted theoretical models to the DTCA context. The systematic review methodology is widely accepted in the medical sector and is successfully applied here in the marketing field. Findings – The hierarchy of effects model is specifically applied to DTCA with a clear emphasis on <b>consumer</b> rights, <b>empowerment,</b> protection and knowledge.

To protect the general interest, government has giving guarantee and legal certainty on using measurement unit and the truth of measurement particularly on BDKT truth size. Based on this, there were several question arise such as: First, how is the test procedures on BDKT which is done by Balai Kemetrologian Surabaya. Second, how is the effectivity of legal protection on consumers about the truth size of BDKT. Third, what is the settlement effort done by Balai Pelayanan Kemetrologian Surabaya to create legal protection for consumer if there are violation concerning the truth size of BDKT. This experiment is using sociologic juridical approach, data collection technique is interviews with respondent, documentation study by collecting data which obtained directly from the experimental sites, observation and questionnaire spread toward 25 respondent. Then it would descriptive qualitatively analyzed. Result of the experiment on 25 random consumers through questionnaire spread, 25 people has once bought BDKT, 14 people admitted not knowing the whereabouts of Balai Kemetrologian Surabaya and only 11 people knew {{that there is a}} governmental body who guarantee the truth size of BDKT which is Balai Pelayanan Kemetrologian. The conclusions are legal protection implementation on consumer about the truth size of BDKT still ineffectively implemented. These can be seen from a lot of BDKT still didn’t fulfilling standard criteria as explained in article 22, 23 in Legal Metrology Laws, and there are still several prohibited act as explained in article 31 Legal Metrology Laws. There are also obstacles started with job range of Balai Kemetrologian Surabaya is still too vast, several limitations on human resources, fund, medium and infrastructure, and also represive act which is done by Sub-Office still didn’t optimal in relation with the truth size of BDKT. In this matters, settlement efforts which is done by Balai Kemetrologian Surabaya consist of two ways, that is, preventive efforts and repressive efforts, in this matter if there are violation, Balai Kemetrologian Surabaya should made a report about the form of violation toward Office of Trade and Industry (Dinas Perindustrian dan Perdagangan) which would be managed by Sub-Office as PPNS, official with the rights to do investigation of violation of Legal Metrology Laws. Therefore, Balai Pelayanan Kemetrologian Surabaya cannot work optimally if they didn’t have support from Metrology Sub-Office (Sub Dinas Metrologi).

40|$|Purpose: People with {{disability}} have a {{right to}} assistive technology devices and services, to support their inclusion and participation in society. User-centred approaches aim to address consumer dissatisfaction and sub-optimal outcomes from assistive technology (AT) provision, but make assumptions of <b>consumer</b> literacy and <b>empowerment.</b> Policy discourses about consumer choice prompt careful reflection, and this paper aims to provide a critical perspective on user involvement in assistive technology provision. Methods: User-centred approaches are considered, using literature to critically reflect on what user involvement means in AT provision. Challenges at the level of interactions between practitioners and consumers, and also the level of markets and policies are discussed, using examples from Australia. Results: There is no unanimous conceptual framework for user-centred practice. Power imbalances and differing perspectives between practitioners and consumers make it difficult for consumers to feel empowered. Online access to information and international suppliers has not surmounted information asymmetries for consumers or lifted the regulation of publicly funded AT devices. Conclusions: Ensuring access and equity in the public provision of AT is challenging in an expanding market with diverse stakeholders. Consumers require personalised information and support to facilitate their involvement and choice in AT provision...|$|R
