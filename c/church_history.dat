5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume <b>church</b> <b>history</b> project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize <b>church</b> <b>history.</b> Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.|$|E

5|$|In March 1982, Arrington's wife Grace died. Arrington married Harriet Horne, {{granddaughter of}} Alice Merrill Horne, in November 1983.

In 2005, the Institute was closed and the department's historians were returned to LDS Church Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed {{as the first}} Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It {{was the first time}} a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS <b>Church</b> <b>history,</b> ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for <b>Church</b> <b>History.</b> Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.|$|E

5|$|Besides the director, a matron, {{business}} manager and dietitian staffed a typical camp.

The strength of instructional programs varied from camp to camp, and after nine hours of physical labor, it could be difficult to motivate the men to attend classes. Most camps had libraries, some showed current films and camp number 56 (Camp Angel) near Waldport, Oregon had a particular emphasis on the arts. Camps produced newsletters and yearbooks documenting their experiences.|$|E
5|$|At the age {{of eight}} the younger Reginald began {{attending}} the local grammar school at Whitchurch, where he remained for five years. In 1796 {{he was sent to}} Bristow's, a small private school in Neasden a few miles north of Central London. This establishment provided intensive learning for around a dozen boys, preparing them for eventual entry to Oxford or Cambridge universities. At Bristow's Reginald met John Thornton, who became a lifelong friend. The pair shared a lively interest in <b>church</b> <b>history</b> and beliefs; a lengthy letter, written by Heber to Thornton, is described by Heber's biographer Arthur Montefiore as being worthy of a learned theologian. In October 1800 Heber entered Brasenose College, Oxford; Thornton's decision to go to Cambridge was a matter for Heber's considerable regret.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{uncertain}} what role the Ten Commandments played in early Christian worship, evidence suggests they were recited during some services and used in Christian education. For example, the Commandments are included {{in one of the}} earliest Christian writings, known as the Teaching of the Twelve Apostles or the Didache. Scholars contend that the Commandments were highly regarded by the early Church as a summary of God's law. The Protestant scholar Klaus Bockmuehl believes that the Church replaced the Commandments with lists of virtues and vices, such as the seven deadly sins, from 400–1200. Other scholars contend that throughout <b>Church</b> <b>history</b> the Commandments have been used as an examination of conscience and that many theologians have written about them. While evidence exists that the Commandments were part of catechesis in monasteries and other venues, there was no official Church position to promote specific methods of religious instruction during the Middle Ages. The Fourth Lateran Council (1215) was the first attempt to remedy this problem. Surviving evidence reveals that some bishops' efforts to implement the Council's resolutions included special emphasis on teaching the Commandments in their respective dioceses. Centuries later, the lack of instruction in them by some dioceses formed the basis of one of the criticisms launched against the Church by Protestant reformers.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick held honorary {{degrees from}} the {{universities}} of Glasgow, Uppsala, Yale, Leeds, Manchester, Surrey, Chicago, Harvard, Jena and the Augustinian University of Rome. He was made an honorary fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1958, just before he took up his Oxford Chair; and of Magdalene College, Cambridge, in 1962. He also treasured a stole {{given to him by}} Pope John Paul II in 1982, and this was placed on his coffin during his funeral at Christ Church on 25 June 2008. Two Festschriften were made in his honour, one for his contributions to the study of <b>church</b> <b>history</b> (Christian Authority, ed. Gillian Evans, 1988), the other for his ecumenical work (The Making of Orthodoxy, ed. Rowan Williams, 1989). In addition to his work on ARCIC he was involved in similar conversations with the Eastern Orthodox Churches. In 1974 Ladbrokes had Chadwick at odds of 7–1 for appointment as the next Archbishop of Canterbury; his brother Owen was at 6–1. In 1984 The Times reported that both brothers were reputed to have turned down more than one bishopric.|$|E
5|$|Takla Sadeq Makuriya (1913–2000), {{historian}} and {{former head of}} the National Archives and Library of Ethiopia, wrote various works in Amharic as well as foreign languages, including a four-volume Amharic-language series on the history of Ethiopia from ancient times until the reign of Selassie, published in the 1950s. During the 1980s he published a three-volume tome exploring the reigns of 19th-century Ethiopian rulers and the theme of national unity. He also produced two English chapters {{on the history of the}} Horn of Africa for UNESCO's General History of Africa and several French-language works on Ethiopia's <b>church</b> <b>history</b> and royal genealogies. Some volumes from his vernacular survey on general Ethiopian history have been edited and circulated as school textbooks in Ethiopian classrooms by the Ministry of Education. Kebede Michael (1916–1998), a playwright, historian, editor, and director of archaeology at the National Library, wrote works of world history, histories of Western civilization, and histories of Ethiopia, which, unlike his previous works, formed the central focus of his 1955 world history written in Amharic.|$|E
5|$|The {{open and}} idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's {{immediate}} supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed {{to defend the}} division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Peterson, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In {{a meeting with the}} first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the <b>Church</b> <b>History</b> organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the Ensign, exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the Ensign did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.|$|E
