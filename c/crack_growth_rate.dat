Compact tension specimens were subjected to fatigue, creep and creep-fatigue loading. The combined effects on <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> of load level and hold time have been examined. Stress intensity factors are found to correlate <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> reasonably well for fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth.</b> Creep <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> are found to correlate with stress intensity factor and C*(t). <b>Crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> under hold time cycles are successfully correlated with C*(t) avg under various load levels and hold times. <b>Crack</b> <b>growth</b> under creep-fatigue loading has been simulated by elastic-plastic-steady state creep finite element analyses. The results of analysis show that fatigue loading interrupts stress relaxation around the crack tip during hold time and causes stress reinstatement, thereby giving rise to accelerated <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> compared with <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> under static loading.

50|$|Crack closure is a {{phenomenon}} in fatigue loading, during which the crack remains in a closed position even though some external tensile force is acting on the material. During this process the crack opens only at stress above a particular stress. This is due to factors such as plastic deformation or phase transformation during crack propagation, corrosion of crack surfaces, presence of fluids in the crack, or roughness at cracked surfaces.

All tests were conducted in mechanical strain control in the temperature range between 100 and 750 [*]°C.

However, due to the fact that the tests were conducted in mechanical strain control, the stress response is very different for the IP and OP cycles.

By taking the stress response into account and comparing the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> for equivalent effective stress intensity factor rages ΔKeff defined as Kmax − Kclosure, very similar <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> were actually noticed independent of whether an IP or OP cycle were used.

In 1985, ASDGRO {{was used as the}} basis for crack growth analysis for the Sikorsky H-53 Helicopter under contract to Warner-Robins ALC. The program was modified to utilize very large load spectra, approximate stress intensity solutions for cracks in arbitrary stress fields, and use a tabular <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> relationship based on the Walker equation on a point-by-point basis (Harter T-Method). The point loaded crack solution from the Tada, Paris, and Irwin Stress Intensity Factor Handbook was originally used to determine K (for arbitrary stress fields) by integration over the crack length using the unflawed stress distribution independently for each crack dimension. After discussions with Dr. Jack Lincoln (ASD/ENSF), a new method was developed by Mr. Frank Grimsley (AFWAL/FIBEC) to determine stress intensity, which used a 2-D Gaussian integration scheme with Richardson Extrapolation which was optimized by Dr. George Sendeckyj (AFWAL/FIBEC). The resulting program was named MODGRO since it was a modified version of ASDGRO.|$|E

50|$|Manufacturers and {{operators}} of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the inspection schedule is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rate</b> is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, dye penetrant, and X-ray inspections. By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|E

Fatigue <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> were measured by the plastic replication technique over the crack length regime from 100 mrn to 1 mm. Tests were performed in load control for Waspaloy and Inconel 718 under high stress (max < 0. 9 ays) elastic fatigue conditions with- 1 < Ra < 0. 5 and frequency = 20 cpm. Tests were performed for Gatorized ® IN 100 in load control under high stress (max < 0. 9 ays) elastic fatigue conditions with- 1 < Ro < 0. 1 and frequency = 10 cpm. Strain control tests were performed under elastic-plastic fatigue conditions with Act = 0. 6 % to 1. 2 %, RE = 0, and frequency = 10 cpm. Under elastic fatigue conditions, the LEFM stress intensity factor range correlated small crack (100 grm < a < 1 mm) with long <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> and consolidated small <b>crack</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rates</b> at different stress levels.
