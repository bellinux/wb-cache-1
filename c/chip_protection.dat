40|$|LEDs, as {{energy-efficient}} solid-state lighting devices, {{will replace}} conventional incandescent and fluorescent light bulbs {{in the next}} few years, resulting in tremendous energy savings. In addition to high lighting efficiency, LED bulbs have other advantages over traditional light sources including long life expectancy, easy maintenance and environmental friendly. Uniquely, LEDs can be switched on/off at very high speed without flickering to human eyes, which means the light can be modulated to realize visible light communications (VLC) while lighting. However, almost all reported VLC systems are based on discrete PCB board electronics that are needed to drive the LEDs and process the signals. While discrete and PCB electronics based VLC systems demonstrated the feasibility and capability, the fundamental problem arise in terms of the system size, performance, reliability and costs. This thesis proposed the first reported Manchester modulation based transceiver integrated circuit (IC) for LED-based VLC system, including voltage & current reference generation, LED-based transmitter, optical receiver, Manchester encoding & decoding circuitry, digital control and full <b>chip</b> ESD <b>protection.</b> Before the integrated solution for VLC, discrete and PCB electronics based VLC system was at first built and demonstrated. The link performance, especially the noise performance, was studied at to provide initial guideline to the next step of integrated transceiver design. However, challenges arise in all aspects of integrating various electronics on a single chip and are mostly addressed in this thesis. Super high accuracy Bandgap structure with trimming and curvature correction was proposed to provide precise voltage and current source to the whole transceiver. Chopper modulation was further introduced to reduce the Opamp offset effect and low frequency noise. For the lighting LED-based transmitter, pre-equalization was employed to boost the modulation bandwidth of LED. At the receiver side, two important optical receiver structures, including singe photodiode and imaging receiver, was discussed and compared. The principles of Manchester encoding and decoding were then investigated and designed, from the perspective of both system level and IC design level. In addition, the transceiver features I 2 C programming interface. Last but not the least, full <b>chip</b> ESD <b>protection</b> was designed for this transceiver implemented in 0. 18 ìm BCDMOS technology while field-dispensable ESD concept was proposed and verified for ultra-high speed IC implemented in 28 nm CMOS technology...|$|R

40|$|Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1) is a mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that is {{regulated}} {{under conditions of}} cellular stress. ASK 1 phosphorylates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and elicits an apoptotic response. ASK 1 activity is regulated at multiple levels, 1 of which is through inhibition by cytosolic chaperones of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 family. Among the proteins that determine Hsp 70 function, CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp 70 -interacting protein) is a cochaperone and ubiquitin ligase that interacts with Hsp 70 through an amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Prominent among the cellular functions mediated by <b>CHIP</b> is <b>protection</b> against physiologic stress. Because ASK 1 is known to contain a TPR-acceptor site, we examined the role of CHIP in regulating ASK 1 function. CHIP interacted with ASK 1 in a TPR-dependent fashion and induced ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent degradation of ASK 1. Targeting of ASK 1 by CHIP inhibited JNK activation in response to oxidative challenge and reduced ASK 1 -dependent apoptosis, whereas short interfering RNA (siRNA) -dependent depletion of CHIP enhanced JNK activation. Consistent with its ability to reduce cytoplasmic ASK 1 levels, CHIP triggered the translocation of ASK 1 partner protein death-associated protein (Daxx) into the nucleus, where it is known to activate an antiapoptotic response. These results indicate that CHIP regulates ASK 1 activity by inducing its ubiquitylation and degradation, which, together with its effects on Daxx localization, provides a mechanism for the antiapoptotic effects of CHIP observed {{in the face of}} cellular and physiologic stress...|$|R
40|$|Designers of {{integrated}} circuits {{have always been}} concerned about the damaging effects of ESD (Electrostatic Discharge). However, as their designs become increasingly more complex, the problem of analyzing the schemes they develop to protect against ESD is quickly becoming too difficult perform manually. Current VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) designs exceed one hundred bondpads, through which the device communicates with the outside environment, and through which harmful amounts of current might enter the <b>chip.</b> A <b>protection</b> scheme for a complex device such as this might require a network of thousands of non-trivial connections between the bondpads to keep harmful amounts of current from the chip’s delicate core. In order to measure the robustness of a protection scheme designers {{would like to be}} able to take resistance measurements between bondpad pairs. On such large designs, this can be a monumental task. In this paper we focus on two things: the automation of strategies previously performed manually, and an in-depth development of (newer) more accurate techniques provided by network flow algorithms, each for gauging the degree of protection afforded by ESD Protection Schemes. The underlying algorithms we will discuss for automating this ESD Analysis are well understood. However, their application, and the introduction of more advanced simulation techniques make this discussion original. We would like to develop a tool which not only accurately models the protection scheme against an ESD event, but also helps to pinpoint its weaknesses. In many cases it is not obvious that the techniques we suggest can be applied or adapted to the simulation of electrical devices and networks. It is also interesting that such techniques make no direct use of Kirchoff’s Voltage or Current Laws (KVL/KCL) yet still produce meaningful and accurate results. This document is intended to summarize standard techniques for analysis of ESD protection schemes, as well as to introduce some clever variations on more complicated algorithms whose intent is to generate more meaningful results never before feasible manually. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} rapid proliferation of wireless communications, which continues to enjoy a booming growth driven by unprecedented technology advances and strong consumer demands. New wireless technologies are being developed to provide people with high-speed low-cost multi-mode multi-task wireless communication environments with high quality of service (QoS). Of all the proposed wireless techniques, ultra wideband (UWB) is a promising technology, which becomes a front contender for various extremely high data throughput wireless applications, particularly for wireless video streaming and wireless sea-volume data transformation typically requiring a data speed up to several giga bit per second (Gbps). This dissertation describes research and integrated circuit (IC) implementation of a single-full-band carrier-free impulse-radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) system. The IR-UWB transceiver adopts a simple-most-digital architecture with low design complexity, aiming to achieve the whole IR-UWB system-on-a-chip (SoC) in standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. Detail analysis for the IR-UWB system architecture is provided. Critical circuit building blocks, such as pulse generator (PG), BPSK modulation, receiver front-end low-noise amplifier (LNA) and correlator, are described both theoretically and experimentally. Adequate on-chip electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection is required for all IC <b>chips</b> and ESD <b>protection</b> design for radio-frequency (RF) IC emerges as a challenging design task as semiconductor IC technologies continue to advance into the very-deep-sub-micron (VDSM) regime.

40|$|During {{the long}} {{shutdown}} LS 3 when the LHC will be upgraded to the HL-LHC, the inner tracker of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC will be replaced. This {{also includes the}} innermost part of ATLAS, the pixel detector. The goal is to collect 3000 /fb with this detector. To ensure a stable and reliable operation for this time (~ 10 years), {{there has to be}} a control system which steers and monitors the detector, similar to the detector control system (DCS) of the current pixel detector. Due to massive changes in the concept of the new pixel detector, the current DCS cannot be reused and a new one is being developed. This new DCS concept for the pixel detector contains three paths, a hard wired interlock path, a diagnostics path integrated into the data acquisition and a control and feedback path for user interactions during operation. In this contribution we describe an improved concept of the control and feedback path, especially designed for the case of a serially powered detector. Though the operation of a parallel powering scheme with DC-DC converters is also possible. The control and feedback path is made up by a network of two nodes: The first node, the DCS controller, is located at the End-of-Stave card at the end of each sub structure (disc or half stave). The second node, the DCS chip, is located on the flex attached to each detector module. To cope with the high radiation levels and the low material budget, these nodes are implemented in custom made ASICs. Communication between these two nodes is transmitted by an I 2 C bus, which was enhanced with four check bits to provide better reliability. To meet the standards of the ATLAS DCS, the communication from the DCS chip to the DCS computers is realized by a CAN bus. Besides the new concept, the first prototype of the DCS chip the PSPP (Pixel Serial Powering and <b>Protection)</b> <b>chip</b> will be introduced.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Many of our nation's children have difficulty accessing needed health care services. In 2008, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reported that about 25 percent of children with insurance and about 55 percent of uninsured children did not receive a recommended routine checkup within the previous year. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), children face growing risks from chronic physical conditions such as asthma and obesity and from mental health disorders such as depression, and yet, as we have reported, their access to services may be impeded {{by a number of}} barriers, including a lack of health insurance and a lack of convenient transportation to medical appointments. Access to mental health care services may also be impeded by concerns about stigma [...] negative attitudes and beliefs often associated with receiving such care [...] which can be a deterrent to seeking these services. To help increase children's access to primary health care and other health care services, states and communities have established school-based health centers (SBHC). SBHCs are located on school grounds, provide health care services regardless of ability to pay, and offer a broader range of services than a school nurse generally provides. Almost all SBHCs provide primary care, and they vary in {{the extent to which they}} provide other health care services, such as immunizations, behavioral health care, oral health care, health and nutrition education, and reproductive health care. SBHCs improve children's access to health care services by reducing financial and other barriers to care, especially for children who are poor or uninsured. For example, as we reported in our July 2009 report on children's access to mental health care services following Hurricane Katrina, SBHCs in Louisiana have emerged as a key approach to providing access to primary health care and mental health care services. Although the principal sources of financing for SBHCs overall are state, local, and private funds, some federal program funds have been used by SBHCs to provide health care services to school-aged children. The three key sources of federal grant funds are HHS's Health Center Program, Title X Family Planning program, and Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Services Title V Block Grant program. In addition to receiving grant funding through grantees of these programs, SBHCs may bill Medicaid for certain services provided to children enrolled in Medicaid. SBHCs may also bill private insurance and other types of public programs for covered services, such as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (<b>CHIP).</b> The Patient <b>Protection</b> and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) appropriated additional federal funding for SBHCs. This funding is to be made available through a program established specifically to fund equipment and facilities. HHS also provides partial funding for a biennial survey of SBHCs that is conducted by the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care (NASBHC) [...] a private nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of SBHCs. The survey for the 2007 - 2008 school year was made available to the 1, 909 SBHCs in NASBHC's database and included information such as the services SBHCs provided, the types of organizations that sponsored them, the sources of grant funds they received, and the types of insurance they billed. The Health Care Safety Net Act of 2008 required that we study the economic costs and benefits of SBHCs. However, we informed cognizant committee staff that data on economic costs and benefits were unavailable. In this report, we describe (1) what is known about federal grant funds received by SBHCs, and (2) what is known about Medicaid reimbursements received by SBHCs. ...|$|R
