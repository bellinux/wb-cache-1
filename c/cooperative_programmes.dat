A special focus highlighted women as in the category which had endured poverty the most in South Africa. The South African government, through its various departments, has a responsibility {{to improve the lives of}} South Africans, and the Eastern Cape Provincial Department of Social Development is one of the departments which has committed itself towards changing the lives of women in the community. As a strategy to implement community development, the Provincial Department of Social Development is funding women <b>cooperative</b> <b>programmes.</b> Women cooperatives are a relatively new endeavour to address poverty within the democratic South Africa.

A purposive sampling method was used to select two women <b>cooperative</b> <b>programmes</b> in the Chris Hani District Municipality to explore the role of women in community development in the current context of democracy and social welfare transformation in South Africa; to explore the impact of gender through women cooperatives on community development and to explore strategies for the empowerment of women through community development intervention.

40|$|Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) {{and mercury}} (Hg) {{are known to}} be transported over {{relatively}} long distances from their sources. Deposited metals may accumulate over time in soils and catchments, and then follow varying pathways to endpoints in humans and the environment. Cadmium and lead, that are emitted primarily as particulate matter, and mercury in gaseous form, can be transported over long distances. This is especially the case when emissions consist of either relatively small particles or of gaseous compounds. The latter occurs especially for anthropogenically emitted mercury, tetra-methyl lead and tetra-ethyl lead.

40|$|Concerns on {{the harmful}} effects of air {{pollutants}} in 1970 s prompted international collaboration to combat air pollutants at their sources. The Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution was established in 1979, with subsequent setup of its working bodies. They included the Working Group on Effects, which laid the basis for the cooperative monitoring and research of air pollution effects. This group comprises several international <b>cooperative</b> <b>programmes</b> and task forces. They cover a variety of receptors from ecosystems (forests, surface waters, vegetation) to materials and health effects on populations, including mapping activities and integrated monitoring. The research addresses many interlinking environmental problems and causative pollutants: acidification, terrestrial eutrophication, health effects, corrosion, ozone, particulate matter, contamination by heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. The observational and modelling results cover the geographical area United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the recorded trends span more than 15 years. The effect-oriented work has initiated and supported the development of several air pollutant emission reduction protocols under the Convention, some based on effects-based model calculations. The cooperation has created a nexus of observational networks and interdisciplinary policy-linked research unique in the world. ...|$|E

History is considered here to be a key element in understanding and shaping the future of geounions. Scientific and organisational aspects of their activities, including cooperation with international and intergovernmental institutions, are analysed using the example of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). The geounions' activities are compared to those of professional societies. Future development of scientific unions and their role in the changing global landscape of geosciences are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the aims of Section 2, this chapter explores {{international}} students’ transition experiences in China. The popularity of China as a study abroad destination has been rising rapidly {{over the past decade}} (China Association for International Education) (see Figure 8. 1). The data show that international students studying in China in 2013 came from over 200 different countries, and Asian countries represented over 60 % of the total international student enrolment. However, the number of international students from Africa and Europe has seen the fastest growth (see Table 8. 1). There are three factors that might contribute to this latest trend. First, with the rise of higher education internationalisation, more students opt to study overseas in order to enhance their learning experience, feel the pulse of different cultures, and obtain a competitive advantage by having an international expertise (Institute of International Education, 2013; Sherry, Thomas, & Chui, 2010; Zhou, Jindal-Snape, Topping, & Todman, 2008). Second, the increasing economic power of China has made it more attractive for prospective international students.

Very few cooperative activities were employed during the observation period, making it impossible to determine the effects of engaging in such activities. An analysis of the qualitative observations elucidated techniques that these teachers used to create a smoothly functioning class.

40|$|Intellectual capital (IC) {{is a key}} {{concept to}} {{sustaining}} a global livestock industry. Accumulated IC in animal science has contributed to successfully developing an efficient global industry, but that has come {{at a cost to}} the environment. The challenge is to develop IC to address the negative aspects of the livestock industry, yet continue the advances towards more efficient livestock production and improved qualities of livestock products. Investments in IC to sustain the livestock industry must not only be technical of an animal science nature, but should include external constituencies such as customers and various other associated entities. IC for the livestock industry is required at different levels that range from labourers to university science graduates. Undergraduate and postgraduate education in animal science must be designed to meet the objectives of a sustained career development and the ability to address the challenges facing the livestock industry. There need not be only one type of graduate, but curricula can be adapted to provide graduates with a different focus and clearly defined output objectives of curricula designed in consultation with the industry.

40|$|Recent {{studies on}} quality {{management}}, certification, and {{supply chain management}} emphasize that (1) ISO 9000 certification is becoming a must for many companies to compete, and (2) quality is a strategic variable {{that should be considered}} and managed not only within the single ® rm, but also across the supply chain of which the firm is part. Nevertheless, many empirical works on ISO 9000 concentrate on the impact of certification on companies’ internal quality systems, whereas they do not pay the same attention to both upstream and downstream interactions across the supply chain, and to their influences on quality management practices and performance. This study examines whether the diffused adoption or knowledge/confidence in the ISO 9000 quality system requirements (i. e. `sensitivity’ to certification) by diverse supply chain members can really influence quality management practices/procedures and operational performance of individual firms in supply chains. These topics are examined through analysis of data gathered by means of a survey based on a sample of 100 Italian certified manufacturing companies. It was found that those firms with the most advanced internal quality systems tend to buy extensively from certified suppliers and to be reliant on the quality level of their deliveries. However, such trust on certified suppliers rarely implies the formalization of medium- long term <b>cooperative</b> <b>programmes.</b> As for performances, the impact of supply chain sensitiveness seems to be significant on punctuality, delivery speed and volume flexibility, while there are no significant effects on quality and cost performance...|$|E
