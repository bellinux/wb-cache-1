In a study {{conducted}} by Penrose in 1938 [1] in Colchester, an over-representation of males over females of 20 to 25 per cent was already documented. One of the reasons proposed to account for the over-representation of males with mental retardation has been that the X chromosome has several genes which are important in brain development [2]. Currently, more than 60 X-linked mental retardation syndromes are cited in McKusick's catalogue [3]. Some of them present with obvious clinical manifestations, such as hydrocephalus, ophthalmological anomalies or defined biochemical defects. But there still remain 20 or more disorders, which are summarized under the term 'non-specific X-linked mental retardation', and most of them still need delineation.
