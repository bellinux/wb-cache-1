Research has shown that significant value can be derived from IT investments if organisations actively and effectively manage their IT investments using a <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> approach. The goal of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of how IT <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> affects strategic IT investment decision making. First, an IT <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Management</b> Maturity Index is developed so that IS managers can readily assess the level of maturity of their organisation’s IT <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> Second, a structural model is presented to examine the influence of IT <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> on decision rationality and organisational political behaviour. Next, we examine how these two outcomes of IT <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> impact firm performance.

40|$|Product {{innovation}} {{is a key}} driver of any company’s growth. The biggest challenge in managing product {{innovation is}} in determining the most promising new product development (NPD) projects from the many ideas generated, known as <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> In practice, NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> still bears some problematic issues, including focusing mainly on portfolio selection rather than managing the entire process, the vague links between the process and business strategy, {{and a lack of}} formal process. Therefore, a study that looks at NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> through different perspectives is required. NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> deals with dynamic decision-making processes, involving not only selection decisions, but also decisions to delay, continue or even terminate projects. To understand this integrative process, a systematic literature review that explored four knowledge domains, i. e., NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management,</b> decision- making, strategy and organisational routines, was carried out. It involved 40 articles published from 1981 - 2012. The review focused on revealing how decision-making processes in NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> are conducted and how they relate to the strategy process and organisational routines. The key findings show that decisions in the NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> process are made through interaction between cognitive and political factors, overlooking the organisational factors in the process. Furthermore, the extant literature does not explicitly explain how to link the NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> process to the strategy process. Also, the findings indicate that the concept of organisational routines had not been used when investigating NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> These are the research gaps that led to the three research questions: 1) How are organisational factors involved with the cognitive and political factors in the decision-making processes in NPD portfolio management?; 2) How do the decision-making processes in NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> link to the business strategy?; and 3) To what extent are organisational routines related to the decision-making processes in NPD <b>portfolio</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although {{recently}} {{a lot of}} attention has been devoted to IT project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> in theory as well as in practice, research in this area is particularly focused on approaches for project selection. Related tasks and especially the organizational environment in which IT project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> is embedded are often excluded.

Furthermore, governance issues in IT project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> are illustrated and a category schema for the assessment of governance structures in the different fields of activities is introduced. In contrast to existing publications in this field of research, which usually employ a maturity level perspective, the paper focuses on {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} centralized, decentralized and federal structures in different fields of activities of IT project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> The paper is intended to highlight why different degrees of centralization in IT project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> can be observed in practice...|$|R
40|$|Services in {{the form}} of {{business}} services or IT-enabled (Web) Services have become a corporate asset of high interest in striving towards the agile organisation. However, while the design and management of a single service is widely studied and well understood, little is known about how a set of services can be managed. This gap motivated this paper, in which we explore the concept of Service <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Management.</b> In particular, we propose a Service <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Management</b> Framework that explicates service portfolio goals, tasks, governance issues, methods and enablers. The Service <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Management</b> Framework is based upon a thorough analysis and consolidation of existing, well-established <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> approaches. From an academic point of view, the Service <b>Portfolio</b> <b>Management</b> Framework can be positioned as an extension of <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> conceptualisations in the area of service management.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} aspects of {{importance}} for organising project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> Project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> of industrial development projects is commonly agreed {{to be a way}} of maximising the value of the development effort, creating a balance of the activities undertaken, and ensuring a strategic alignment when choosing and compromising among development opportunities. For several years, both practitioners and researchers have developed tools and methods assisting managers in decisions regarding the project portfolio composition. During the last decade the research in the area has developed to include aspects of which participants to involve and how to arrange the project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> activities. In project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> literature it is commonly agreed that no one best way to organise for project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> exists. Despite diverse efforts, the literature has so far not provided a thorough knowledge of aspects in areas concerning the selection of participants to involve and how to arrange the project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> activities. It is therefore such aspects that are addressed in this thesis. The research strategy has been to use case studies, and the main empirical data used in the thesis stem from a single case study at the business unit for Away-From-Home Tissue products at SCA. Supplementing the latter data is a multiple case study of six Swedish companies. The findings in the thesis show that aspects {{of importance for}} organising project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> concern three different areas: how the <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> activities are arranged (i. e. procedural aspects), how the tools and methods are used, and how to involve relevant organisational participants (i. e. organisational aspects). It is also seen that including different types of projects in the same project portfolio (i. e. product development, manufacturing process development, technology development) yields implications for how to organise the project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> The process must allow for taking into account different strategies, different ways of evaluating projects, different needs of updating the portfolio, and an involvement of managers with different knowledge in the activities. The findings demonstrate that the same tools and methods can be used in different ways throughout the process for assisting the project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management.</b> Lastly, it is found that how the project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> activities are arranged, and which organisational participants are involved, will affect the use of tools and methods in project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R

40|$|Project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} {{in the past and}} recently the research has focused more on specific areas of project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management,</b> such as project <b>portfolio</b> risk <b>management</b> and <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> quality. The research on process development projects as a project portfolio is not extensive. New product development portfolios focus more on creating new and creative products and on analyzing technological trends. Internal process development projects, on the other hand, are not necessarily executed to increase the revenue of the company but they increase organizational capabilities. This thesis examined the process development project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> practices in a large Finnish company. The case company is experiencing major growth {{in the next few years}} which is why many process development projects are in planning or already in execution phase. The study was a constructive study with a multi-method qualitative research approach. This means that there were many methods used for qualitative data collection. The empirical data was gathered with semi-structured interviews and a workshop in the case company. The study revealed that the current process development project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> is fragmented in the case company and therefore the case company needs improved project management practices. The current challenges in process development project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> were for example single project management inefficiency, lack of systematic communication and the fact that there were no clear project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> practices at the company level. In order to improve the management of internal process development projects, an assessment system was created. The features of the assessment system were for example a scoring model for project proposals, categorization for projects and a project <b>portfolio</b> <b>management</b> process with integrated organizational model...|$|R
