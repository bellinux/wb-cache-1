The {{purpose of this}} work was to study the anatomy and morphology of the leaf, comparing rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. -Arg. ] clones (RRIM 600 and GT 1) grafted on the same root stock (Tjir 1), grown under the same climatic and soil conditions. This study allowed clones to be differentiated and also provided information on the location and disposition of laticifers in the leaf tissue. Cross sections of the mesophyll, <b>center</b> <b>ribbing</b> and petiole regions were made, followed by usual permanent histological blade methods. Biometric analyses of tissue extensions in the palisade and spongy parenchymas were carried out, {{and the number of}} cells in the spongy parenchyma were counted. At the same time, biometrical analyses were made for stomata. The comparison between the clones showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in epidermal cell height, spongy parenchyma height, number of cells in the spongy parenchyma layer, and size and width of leaflets. However, variation was observed for cell thickness in the palisade parenchyma. The clone GT 1 presented greater thickness as compared to the RRIM 600 clone. GT 1 had also a greater number of stomata in comparison to RRIM 600, but they were smaller.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} the effects of a blowing ratio {{measured}} with narrowband liquid crystal in transonic experiments on the heat transfer characteristics of trailing edge cutback. The experimental results are compared and contrasted in terms of available data for traditional experiments with thermocouples. It is concluded that the blowing ratio exerts rather significant effects on film cooling effectiveness distribution of the <b>rib</b> <b>center</b> line. As the blowing ratio decreases, similar to the cooling effectiveness distribution curve of the slot center line, that of the <b>rib</b> <b>center</b> line makes a clockwise rotation about the end. When the blowing ratio increases, the regular film cooling effectiveness curve of the surface becomes rather smooth. On the whole measuring surface, the most intensive heat transfer occurs at the extended borderline of the slot and the rib, neither at the <b>rib</b> <b>center</b> line nor at the slot center line. The experimental results of cooling effectiveness measured with thermocouples are lower than those with liquid crystal. In addition, the transient experiments using narrowband liquid crystal can eliminate the higher errors of Nusselt numbers in measurements with thermocouples at the slot outlet...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect and analyze retail cuts from the beef rib and plate that had been {{identified}} as needing nutrient composition updates in the United States Department of Agriculture?s (USDA) National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR). Twenty beef carcasses were selected from three different regions of the United States, and the rib and plate were collected for shipment via refrigerated truck to the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology <b>Center.</b> Each <b>rib</b> and plate was fabricated 14 to 21 d postmortem into the appropriate retail cuts to be used for this study. The cuts were dissected, either raw or cooked (braised, grilled, roasted), into four separable components: separable lean, seam fat, external fat, and refuse. Bone and heavy connective tissue were considered refuse. Percent total chemical fat, moisture, protein, and ash analyses were conducted on the separable lean component obtained from dissection. Cooking yields were evaluated for each of the three cooking methods utilized in this study. Grilled cuts had the highest numerical yield followed by roasted and braised cuts. Dissection data showed single muscle cuts had a higher percentage of separable lean than retail cuts composed of multiple muscles. Boneless and lip-off retail cuts contained a higher percentage of separable lean when compared to their bone-in and lip-on counterparts. Finally, proximate analysis data showed that as retail cuts increased in the percentage of total chemical fat, the percentage of moisture decreased. When percentage of total chemical fat was stratified by USDA quality grade, most cuts showed differences between USDA Choice and Select quality grades. This study was a collaborative project; therefore, the results and discussion of this thesis are only based on findings from Texas A and M University's data.

40|$|The turtle {{shell is}} an {{evolutionary}} novelty that is synapomorphic for chelonians. The carapace is {{initiated by the}} entrapment of the ribs by the carapacial ridge (CR), a lateral bulge of the dorsal ectoderm and dermal mesoderm. The mechanisms by which the CR is initiated, the ribs entrapped and the dorsal dermis ossified, remains unknown. Similarly, {{the formation of the}} plastron remains unexplained. Here, we present a series of anatomical investigations into plastron and carapace formation in the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta, and the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina. We document the entrapment of the ribs by the CR and the formation of the plastron and carapacial bones by intramembranous ossification. We note the formation of the ossification <b>centers</b> around each <b>rib,</b> which suggest that the rib is organizing dermal ossification by secreting paracrine factors. The nuchal ossification center is complex and appears to involve multiple bone-forming regions. Individual ossification centers at the periphery of the carapace form the peripheral and pygial bones. The intramembranous ossification of the plastron proceeds from nine distinct ossification centers, and there appear to be interactions between the spicules of apposing centers as they draw near each other...|$|R

All patients were treated with posterior spinal arthrodesis with segmental spinal instrumentation. The degree of flexibility obtained with the traditional and new methods was compared with the degree of correction observed on the radiograph made, with the patient standing, one week after the operation. Preoperatively, the mean Cobb angle was 58 degrees on the anteroposterior radiograph made with the patient standing, 31 degrees on the lateral-bending radiograph made with the patient supine, and 24 degrees on the fulcrum bending radiograph. The mean angle was 25 degrees on the anteroposterior radiograph made one week postoperatively, so the mean correction was 57 per cent. The difference between the mean angle on the lateral-bending radiograph and that on the postoperative radiograph was significant (p < 0. 001); however, the mean angle measured on the preoperative fulcrum bending radiograph and the postoperative angle were almost identical. We found the fulcrum bending radiograph to be more predictive of the degree of flexibility and correctability than the lateral- bending radiograph in this group of patients who had segmental spinal instrumentation for correction of idiopathic scoliosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Behrooz Abbasi, for the Master of Science Degree in Mining and Mineral Resources Engineering, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale TITLE: A NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF MINE INTERSECTIONS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR STABILITY MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. Yoginder P. Chugh Back ground: Partial {{extraction}} room-and-pillar mining systems provide {{about 60}} % {{of the underground}} coal mined in the USA. This mining system develops 3 -way and 4 -way intersections. Rock falls related to fatal and nonfatal injuries in the USA for the period 2002 to 2007 identified that about 70 % of these falls occur at intersections even though they represent only about 20 - 25 % of the area mined. A recent study on 2004 to 2008 roof-falls data base (RFDB) for Illinois mines, found that over 80 % of these falls occurred at intersections. Thus, {{there is a significant}} need to improve stability of coal mine intersections if fatal and nonfatal injuries are to be controlled. The overall goal of this research is to develop an improved scientific understanding of stress distribution and instability around a 4 -way intersection. An additional goal is to evaluate primary and secondary support layouts for improved stability around 4 -way intersections. The following specific tasks were established for this research. *	Perform 3 -D numerical analyses to develop a better understanding of stress, strain and displacement distributions and associated instabilities around a 4 -way intersection to identify ground support requirements. *	Identify primary and secondary supports systems that may be suited to meet ground support requirements in (1) above. *	Perform numerical analyses with identified primary and secondary supports installed to assess improvements in stability around an intersection. Analyses results show that pillar ribs across an intersection fail first and lead to progressive failure of immediate roof layers. The failure of immediate roof layers extends about 1. 8 m. In detail, coal ribs around the intersection corners mostly fail due to tensile stress, while roof and floor strata fail due to shear stresses and <b>rib</b> <b>center</b> fail due to combination of shear and tension mechanism. Primary supports significantly improve stability, but they are not adequate to ensure stability of four-way intersections. Secondary supports are needed to further improve stability of intersections. Also, based on the failure analysis a new secondary support system plan was proposed and analyzed...|$|R
