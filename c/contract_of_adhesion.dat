40|$|Businesses {{are accused}} of using {{arbitration}} as a private dispute resolution system that shields their transgressions from public scrutiny, uses arbitrators and institutions that are perceived as biased, and prevents any real means of justice to the consumer. Something {{must be done to}} ensure that consumers facing mandatory arbitration clauses within <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> are protected from businesses that seek to use arbitration as an advantageous means to resolve disputes. The American public, a section of Congress, and the arbitration community are all responding, but out-of-date law and recent decisions are thwarting their efforts. It is time for Congress to act, but in doing so it must recognize that old biases toward the use of arbitration will not move the discussion forward. Congress must seek to address the use of arbitration in consumer contracts without creating new issues by prohibiting the use of arbitration in its entirety and/or by attempting to protect consumers from contract clauses that do not seek to enhance the power imbalance that is inherent within <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> This Article will seek to address these issues by first identifying the issues relating to the FAA, the surrounding case law, and the alternative readings of section 2 of the FAA. The Article will then examine and reject some of the early attempts at addressing those issues while considering current attempts by both academics and industry to address the issue <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> and arbitration clauses. The Article will conclude, in Part III, by considering who should be protected, identifying what they should be protected from and how those protections can be accomplished. Finally, the Article will claim that Congress must seek to protect a narrow class of individuals from significantly disadvantageous arbitration clauses within <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion...</b>|$|R

50|$|Standard form {{contracts}} may exploit unequal power relations: If {{the good}} {{which is being}} sold using a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> is one which is essential or {{very important for the}} purchaser to buy (such as a rental property or a needed medical item) then the purchaser might feel they {{have no choice but to}} accept the terms. This problem may be mitigated if there are many suppliers of the good who can potentially offer different terms (see below), although even this is not always possible (for instance, a college freshman may be required to sign a standard-form dormitory rental agreement and accept its terms, because the college will not allow a freshman to live off-campus).|$|E

While there is nothing unenforceable or even wrong about adhesion contracts in themselves, specific terms may render them unconscionable. Examples of gross one-sidedness would be provisions that limit damages against the seller, or limit the rights of the purchaser to seek relief in the courts against the seller. In the 2009 case of Harris v. Blockbuster Inc., the plaintiff argued that Blockbuster's provision to compel arbitration and forbid class action lawsuits was illusory and unconscionable. However, whether that contract was unconscionable is unknown, as the court ruled that it was illusory and therefore not enforceable, and disregarded all further consideration.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, {{attorney}} Marc Bragg sued Linden Lab, {{claiming that}} it had illegally deprived him of access to his account after he discovered a loophole in the online land auction system which allowed regions to be purchased at prices below reserve. Although most users and commentators believed that Bragg would have no chance of winning, a number of legal developments occurred {{as a result of}} the case, including a court ruling that parts of the Second Life Terms of Service were unenforceable, due to being an unconscionable <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> [...] The case eventually ended with Bragg's virtual land and account being restored to him in a confidential out-of-court settlement. As such, a settlement created no precedent and thus left users with confusion as to what legal rights they truly had with respect to their virtual land, items, and account. Many of Bragg's legal arguments rested on the claim—advertised on Linden Lab web site—that virtual land within Second Life could be [...] "owned" [...] by the purchasing user, which was removed shortly after the settlement, leading to speculation that this was part of the reason for the settlement.|$|E
50|$|Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, {{joined by}} Justice Marshall. Justice Stevens had {{several reasons for}} dissenting, {{including}} objections to <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> created by parties who have unequal bargaining power, {{the fact that the}} notice of the forum selection clause was not made available to the purchaser until after payment was tendered and a lack of an opportunity for refunds at the point when the forum selection clause was disclosed.|$|R
50|$|Another factor {{which might}} {{mitigate}} {{the effects of}} competition on the content <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm’s liability, not necessarily to implement managers' competitive decisions.

These contract exchanges have greatly benefited both their participants and the public at large, but participation was long limited to a wealthy few. A decade ago, however, Internet websites, including Hotwire and Priceline, brought the power <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> exchanges directly to consumers, allowing regular people to flex their collective bargaining power to obtain low prices on travel services. Even more recently, other such 2 ̆ 2 consumer contract exchanges, 2 ̆ 2 including Prosper and MoneyAisle, have organized vibrant markets for small loans and certificates of deposit {{to the benefit of}} consumer borrowers and investors. Modern contract law usually bends over backwards to protect consumers, so one would surely expect it to be supportive of or at least not hostile to, these developments. Surprisingly, however, one strand of common law doctrine [...] the rules that pertain to so-called 2 ̆ 2 <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> 2 ̆ 2 [...] actually stifles the development <b>of</b> consumer <b>contract</b> exchanges by undermining the reliable enforceability <b>of</b> the <b>contracts</b> they generate.

Instead, they had to switch to manual entry from ChessBomb. Alleged violators included not only ChessBomb and Chessdom, but also ICC, Chess24, and Der Spiegel. Although the Terms and Conditions (#10) mention New York state law as applicable to those who signed up, Merenzon sent a cease and desist letter that invoked 10 years imprisonment under Russian law. The specifying of choice of venue and choice of law in a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> can also be in dispute. Agon also impeded the credentials of Salim Fazulyanov, allegedly as retaliation against his website Kavkaz-Chess.ru for being the first Russian site to publish Chessdom's open letter. Eventually Agon's own worldchess.com editorial staff broke ranks, declaring that an embargo was not the way to go, but a show. The main argument is: holding all the trumps like live video and exclusive interviews with players (and other VIPs) should be enough, without resorting to legal blusterings. Before Round 2, Agon partially relented, dispensing with its presumptory 2-hour PGN embargo, designating the game's end instead. In round 1, the moves were carried live without restriction by official partner NRK. About 45 minutes into second round, the NRK live move transmission became suspended, causing other sites to also experience confusion. According to reporter Tarjei Svensen on Twitter, Agon was actively pursuing lawsuits against ChessBomb, Chess24, ICC, and ChessGames.com, with the chilling effect of causing them to essentially suspend activity. The Norwegian online newspaper site VG Direkte (also an official partner) initially stayed active (with the browsewrap language: [...] "By viewing this page you expressly agree not to publish any information concerning the chess moves of the candidates tournament 2016 chess games until the end of such game"), but then also suspended activity.

Faced with inefficiency and ineffectiveness of the courts regulators are constantly looking into alternatives to increase access to justice and improve efficiency of the dispute resolution mechanisms. The EU has recently enacted ADR and ODR regulations for consumer cross-border disputes. At the same time, we have witnessed parallel attempts from several public bodies and international organisations to introduce the legal framework for the resolution disputes coming out of online transactions. These proposals are in principle focusing on e-commerce aspects of dealing with low-cost consumer/seller disputes.

40|$|THE CIVIL JURY {{trial is}} fast disappearing from our legal landscape, and one {{important}} reason for its disappearance is {{the rapid growth of}} mandatory arbitration. Yet, the imposition of mandatory arbitration eliminates the civil jury, and often this elimination is not made through a knowing, voluntary, or intelligent waiver. As I have argued elsewhere in greater detail, unless federal courts are generally willing to abandon the Seventh Amendment 2 ̆ 2 knowing/voluntary/intelligent 2 ̆ 2 civil jury trial waiver standard, they need to significantly revise their approach to mandatory arbitration clauses. If a given state allows the civil jury trial right to be waived through a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion,</b> even if the waiver is not knowing, voluntary, or intelligent, then that same standard should be applied to arbitration clauses. To the extent that the particular jurisdiction applies some version of the 2 ̆ 2 knowing, voluntary, intelligent 2 ̆ 2 test to determine whether the jury trial right has been waived, then that precise test should be applied to the arbitration clause. Companies 2 ̆ 7 imposition of mandatory arbitration against consumers, employees, and others now threatens the jury trial right to the extent that courts fail to apply the traditional jury trial waiver to mandatory arbitration provisions...|$|E
40|$|Arbitration {{has grown}} rapidly {{during the past}} 20 years. Particularly notable and {{problematic}} is the rapid onset of new or mass arbitration that has resulted from the judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s modern favorable attitude toward enforcement of arbitration clauses, even those imposed upon consumers, employees, small vendors, and debtors {{as part of a}} standardized <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> In a separate article (See 2 ̆ 2 Mandating Minimum Quality in Mass Arbitration, 2 ̆ 2 76 U. Cin. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2007)), I present a more comprehensive list of what I regard as the necessary steps that must be taken to insure minimally acceptable quality and fairness in mass arbitration. In this article, I focus more specifically on the questions of impartiality, adherence to substantive law, and judicial review, although these concerns are of course also dimensions of any reasonably broad inquiry into quality. The explosion of mass arbitration during the late 20 th Century has created too much potential that arbitration could become an unfair forum for dispute resolution. Of particular concern is the impartiality and competence of the arbitrator, consistency with substantive law, and quality control through appellate review. This article advances three operational proposals for achieving rough equivalency between arbitration and litigation: (1) a licensing system for arbitrators in mass arbitrations; (2) a default rule that arbitration follow substantive law and reach results consistent with substantive law; and (3) replacement of the current deferential standard of review for arbitration awards with appellate review similar to that accorded trial court decisions. However, parties in traditional commercial arbitration should be permitted to contract around the requirement of licensed arbitrators bound to follow substantive law and should also be permitted to stipulate to restricted judicial review...|$|E
5000|$|The {{enforceability}} of an EULA {{depends on}} several factors, {{one of them}} being the court in which the case is heard. Some courts that have addressed {{the validity of the}} shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion,</b> unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the U.C.C.—see, for instance, Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.. [...] Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, Microsoft v. Harmony Computers, Novell v. Network Trade Center, and Ariz. Cartridge Remanufacturers Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.|$|R

The court perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, legal systems apply the doctrine of contra proferentem; giving the benefit of any doubt {{in favor of the}} party upon whom the contract was foisted. Some courts when seeking a particular result will use contra proferentem to take a strict approach against insurers and other powerful contracting parties and {{go so far as to}} interpret terms <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> in favor <b>of</b> the other party, even where the meaning of a term would appear clear and unambiguous on its face, although this application is disfavored.|$|R

40|$|There is {{controversy}} over awarding punitive damages by arbitration in securities disputes. Securities disputes are unique because {{the vast majority}} of such disputes are filed at Self Regulatory Organizations (“SROs”) which are subject to SEC oversight. However, other securities disputes are filed at the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), which is not subject to SEC oversight. As a result differing rules evolved for SRO arbitrations than those applicable at the AAA. No SRO rule directly authorized punitive damages but section 31 (d) of the Uniform Code of Arbitration prohibits limiting the ability of arbitrators to make any award. Whereas a AAA rule specifically provided that arbitrators may award any remedy or relief which the arbitrators deem just and equitable. Predictably, the turmoil over punitive damages continued in the courts. The Ruder Committee Report proposed the imposition of a cap on punitive damages of $ 750, 000. Even if the SEC approved the rigid cap rule in a filing by the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”), the question arises where is the legislative authorization to deprive an investor of relief otherwise available in court? The Supreme Court through McMahon gave an investor the ability to obtain in arbitration whatever relief was available in court, which the Ruder Report’s cap rule clearly violates. The rigid cap rule must be rejected {{in view of the fact}} that it bears no reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, its unilateral imposition by an SRO subjects it to questionable validity, it is strongly opposed by the public, it is not imposed at the AAA or at the other SRO arbitration forums, it violates Section 31 of the Uniform Code of Arbitration, it buttresses the argument that the pre-dispute arbitration agreement has become an unenforceable <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion,</b> it rekindles public distrust of the SRO arbitration process, it violates the spirit under which McMahon was decided, and there are less objectionable ways to solve the securities industry’s fears of a runaway punitive award...|$|E
40|$|Can {{a privately}} {{negotiated}} arbitration agreement deprive {{employees of the}} statutory right to sue in court on claims of discrimination in employment because of race, sex, religion, age, disability, and similar grounds prohibited by federal law? Two leading U. S. Supreme Court decisions, decided almost two decades apart, reached substantially different answers to this questionand arguably stood logic on its head in the process. In the earlier case of Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., involving arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement, the Court held an adverse award did not preclude a subsequent federal court action by the black grievant alleging racial discrimination. But ten years ago, in Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., the Court ruled that an individual employee 2 ̆ 7 s agreement to arbitrate all employment disputes prevented him from going to court with the claim he was terminated {{on the basis of}} age. Most disinterested observers have approved Gardner-Denver 2 ̆ 7 s rejection of arbitral finality, but have denounced Gilmer 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement of a so-called 2 ̆ 2 mandatory arbitration 2 ̆ 2 clause imposed on an employee as a condition of employment. Yet, if different results were justified, a good argument can be made from the perspective of voluntariness that the Supreme Court got it backwards. The arbitration provision in Gardner-Denver was negotiated by a union that was presumably more nearly equal in bargaining power to the employer than the isolated employee in Gilmer. The latter had to sign what was in effect a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion.</b> Nonetheless, however plausible may be the abstract objections to mandatory arbitration, my thesis is that the ordinary rank-and-file employee may well be better off as a practical matter having assured access to an arbitrator rather than theoretical access to a judge and jury. An increasing amount of empirical evidence suggests that is true even for the individual employee in the nonunion setting. A fortiori, it should be true for the employee represented by a union in the collective bargaining situation. Employers, too, are likely to gain from the use of arbitration instead of court litigation...|$|E
40|$|Depuis le 1 er janvier 1994, Québec s'est doté d'un nouveau Code civil qui établit, en {{harmonie}} avec les chartes, le droit commun applicable aux rapports entre les personnes. Ainsi se pose la question de l'harmonisation de ces règles à celles qui régissent les rapports particuliers entre employeurs, syndicats et salariés. La question est d'autant plus intéressante que ce nouveau Code civil traite directement de la relation de travail et qu'il ne comporte aucune réserve à l'endroit du Code du travail et des conventions collectives. L'arrivée de ce nouveau Code civil imposera une délicate gestion des conflits de droit {{en raison de}} l'inévitable rencontre de ces deux codes, Code civil et Code du travail, et de leur acte respectif, le contrat de travail et la convention collective. Since January 1, 1994, Quebec has had a new Civil Code which, {{in combination}} with the charters of rights, establishes the common law applicable to relations between persons. Thus arises {{the question of how to}} harmonize these rules with those that govern the specifie relations between employers, unions and employees. The question is all the more interesting because this new Civil Code deals directly with the employment relationship without any reference to the Labour Code or to collective agreements. The appearance of this new Civil Code will require delicate management of conflict of laws because of the unavoidable connection between the Civil Code and the Labour Code and their respective instruments, the contract of employment and the collective agreement. The coexistence of the two codes will necessitate a re-examination of several decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada which establish that, where there is a collective agreement in place, there will no longer be room for a contract of employment. The Supreme Court of Canada itself will have to examine this issue and make the necessary distinctions, taking into account the fact that the Civil Code makes no exceptions for the employment relationship and that it now contains 13 articles dealing directly with the contract of employment. The explanation put forward on a few occasions by the Supreme Court to the effect that the collective agreement would be a tripartite contract, will no longer be acceptable. The study of the coexistence of these two codes is all the more interesting owing to the fact that the development of collective labour relations law was meant to preclude certain effects of the rules of civil law which were at the time too favourable towards Syndicat catholique des employes de magasins de Quebec Inc. v. Compagnie Paquet Ltee,[1959] R. C. S. 206;McGavin Toastmaster Udv. Ainscough,[1976] 1 R. C. S. 718;CAIMAWv. Paccar of Canada Ud,[1989] 2 R. C. S. 983. employers or which ignored the situation of employees. Now the new Civil Code lays down a series of rules meant to protect employees through the enforcement of the criteria of equality and good faith. If the contract of employees was to disappear due solely to the presence of a collective agreement, it would follow that the Quebec Civil Code would not apply to these employees, at least for the purposes intended by the Labour Code and the collective agreement. If this were the case, such employees, unions and employers, would, find themselves set aside for the same purposes and roles by the application of the following articles :— Article 2085 C. C. Q. with respect to employee loyalty;— Articles 2089, 2090 and 2095 which stipulate the contractual freedom related to the limite of free competition;— Articles 2091, 2092 and 2094 where ways to resiliate a contract of employees are set out; — Articles 2097 which ensures the survival of the employment relationship following the arrival of a new employer at the helm of the enterprise. The same applies to common law provisions concerning the respect of reputation and privacy of a person (articles 35 to 41 of the C. C. Q.), the interpretation of contracts, articles 1379, 1432, 1435 and 1436 (<b>contract</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion)</b> and the requirement of good faith (articles 6 and 7 of the C. C. Q.), etc. It should be immediately stated that it is essential that the harmonization of the rules of law not create a backlash which would allow the contract of employment to serve as a valid legal tool to reduce the real importance of the collective agreement. Furthermore, we maintain that this legitimate and necessary protection of the collective agreement should not in any way override the Quebec Civil Code, the renewed common law, nor should it repudiate the contract of employment. It should be noted that our common law, the civil law of French origin, which is codified in a concise, simple and direct style, is specific to us. It is recognized indirectly by the 1867 Constitution, since it predated the Constitution and this situation was confirmed. Barring a serious legal and political heresy, or shameful laxity, or else recalcitrant judicial imperialism, one cannot act as if our codified common law did not exist or was simply interchangeable with or able to be assimilated to the Common Law. Aside from the very existence of the Labour Code and collective agreements, the specifity of the law of collective labour relations is not so special as to require, suppose or imply that this branch of labour law be removed from the common body of Quebec private law. It should be remembered that labour law, just like its component related to collective labour relations, is concerned with persons (employee and employer), relations between these same persons and the properties to which these relations are directed or which result from these relations. However, these same three aspects are precisely those set out in the preliminary provision of the Quebec Civil Code : "The Civil Code of Quebec, ( [...] .), governs persons, relations between persons, and property". In labour law, it is necessary to be able to draw from a broad and rich source of law in order to use it as a basis for this area of law and to make up for these inevitable gaps, deficiencies or silences. This source and this general framework cannot, for constitutional, political and cultural reasons, be an avowed or hidden common law. As well, only the Civil Code of Quebec can and must serve in this way. Such is the usual legal and political function of the Quebec Civil Code, and this role can only serve to bring closer together the attributes appropriate to law, namely coherence, security, logic, foreseeable nature, etc. If the situation is as described in this paper, then we must learn how to harmonize the law of collective relations with the Civil Code of Quebec. Analyses of the contents of collective agreements confirm our common knowledge that the legal foundations of the basic data of labour relations and the employment relationship are not found there. It would be a matter of :— the presence of the employee, his constraint, his obligations to be available;— his obligation related to discretion and loyalty, etc.;— the employer's power to give orders, to discipline and even to suspend unilaterally the provision of mutual benef its, his obligation to pay a salary, his right of accession, his responsibility towards third parties somehow related to the employee, etc. If employees not covered by collective agreements are subject to the Civil Code of Quebec as codified common law there is no principle or postulate that would allow us to believe that the simple presence of a collective agreement would change this situation. In order to settle any real or apparent conflict over the terms and conditions of employment that derive from these different sources, the two necessary criteria are : public order and the objectively more favourable norm. Furthermore, there are several provisions in the Quebec Civil Code which favour employees and which cannot for whatever reason be ignored because of the existence of a collective agreement. We would also argue that, with the same reservations, the collective agreement would be subject to the Quebec Civil Code. In fact, if this common body of Quebec private law is applicable to persons and relations between persons, then it also applies to the persons and property which are the subject of collective agreements. This means in particular that the collective agreement cannot validly contain clauses that go against the provisions of public order decreed in the Quebec Civil Code (article 62 of the Labour Code) and that other provisions of the Civil Code, in as much as they are compatible, make up for the gaps, innuendos and silences of the collective agreement. Furthermore, the Labour Code sets out several special rules to manage the development of the collective agreement, to specify its contents and its importance. These special and precise rules obviously constitute as many provisions that can be added to and taken out of this same Quebec Civil Code. The sole fact that one would be tempted to use the contract of employment to reduce, violate or destroy the importance of a collective agreement cannot justify such a denial of principle. In reality, of course, employees and employers do not generally negotiate the individual employment contract. Even so, this fiction does not stand in the way of the application of the Civil Code of Quebec to employees covered by collective agreements...|$|E
5000|$|Insurance {{contracts}} are generally considered <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>adhesion</b> because the insurer draws up the contract and the insured {{has little or}} no ability to make material changes to it. This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> In 1970 Robert Keeton suggested that many courts were actually applying 'reasonable expectations' rather than interpreting ambiguities, which he called the 'reasonable expectations doctrine'. This doctrine has been controversial, with some courts adopting it and others explicitly rejecting it. [...] In several jurisdictions, including California, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, the insured is bound by clear and conspicuous terms in the contract even if the evidence suggests that the insured did not read or understand them.|$|R

The article argues that the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s current preference for such agreements is not statutorily well-founded. Specifically, it contends that the Federal Arbitration Act {{was not intended to}} make such agreements binding on unknowing consumers or employees. Turning next to policy analysis, the article asserts that the Supreme Court has erred in expressing a preference for binding arbitration in cases where such arbitration was not knowingly and voluntarily accepted by both parties. In particular, it argues that binding arbitration is not necessarily better and cheaper for all parties than litigation. Rather, a company can use a binding arbitration clause to secure significant strategic advantages over less knowledgeable parties. The article further argues that by using preemption principles to preclude states from protecting their own citizens from unfair binding arbitration Congress and the Supreme Court have trammeled important federalism interests...|$|R
