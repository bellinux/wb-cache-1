50|$|The sword-tail newt (<b>Cynops</b> <b>ensicauda)</b> is an {{endangered}} species of true salamander from the Ryukyu Archipelago in Japan. It has recently been placed on Japan's Red List of Threatened Amphibians. Sometimes, sword-tail newts are called fire-bellied newts, {{not to be confused}} with the common Chinese and Japanese species, because of their bright orange bellies, which serve as a warning to predators that they are poisonous. They can be differentiated from these two species by their large size, broader heads and (against Japanese fire-bellies) smoother skin. This newt ranges from brown to black above, occasionally with an orange dorsal stripe. Some individuals may have light spotting or speckling on their backs.|$|E
40|$|AbstractSodefrin-like female-attracting {{pheromone}} was purified {{from the}} abdominal glands of male sword-tailed newts, <b>Cynops</b> <b>ensicauda,</b> by gel-filtration chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The final product comprises 10 amino acid residues with the sequence SILSKDAQLK which {{coincided with the}} sequence deduced from its precursor cDNA. This peptide was designated silefrin. The sequence of silefrin was {{different from that of}} sodefrin by two amino acid residues, with substitutions Leu for Pro and Gln for Leu at positions 3 and 8, respectively. Both native and synthetic silefrin exerted an equipotent activity in attracting conspecific females...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCloning of cDNA {{encoding}} a decapeptide pheromone (sodefrin) {{that attracts}} conspecific female newts was attempted. A cDNA clone encoding a protein consisting of 189 amino acid residues including a sodefrin sequence was isolated from a Cynops pyrrhogaster abdominal gland cDNA library. Likewise, a cDNA clone encoding a molecule {{comparable to the}} sodefrin precursor was obtained from a <b>Cynops</b> <b>ensicauda</b> abdominal gland cDNA library. This clone encoded a precursor protein of 192 amino acid residues, including a sodefrin-like peptide sequence with substitutions of two amino acid residues. This is the first report of a peptide pheromone precursor in vertebrates...|$|E

In this study, four new analogs, 8 -epi- 5, 6, 11 -trideoxyTTX, 4, 9 -anhydro- 8 -epi- 5, 6, 11 -trideoxyTTX, 1 -hydroxy- 8 -epi- 5, 6, 11 -trideoxyTTX, and 1 -hydroxy- 4, 4 a-anhydro- 8 -epi- 5, 6, 11 -trideoxyTTX, were isolated from the newt, <b>Cynops</b> <b>ensicauda</b> popei, and their structures were determined using spectroscopic methods. These are the first 8 -epi-type analogs of TTX {{that have been found}} in a natural source. Furthermore, we examined the composition of the TTX analogs in this newt and in the ovary of the puffer fish, Fugu poecilonotus, using LC/MS. The results indicate that TTX and 11 -deoxyTTX were present in both sources. However, 6 -epiTTX and 8 -epi-type analogs were detected only in the newt, while 5, 6, 11 -trideoxyTTX was a specific and major analog in the puffer fish. Such considerable differences among analog compositions might reflect differences in the biosynthesis or metabolism of TTX between these animals...|$|E
