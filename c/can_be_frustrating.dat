5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? {{was named}} Book of the Year by the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 1998. In 2006, it ranked 17th on Christianity Todays list of fifty books {{that have shaped}} Evangelicals the most. In a Publishers Weekly review, Henry Carrigan notes an anecdotal style that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> but {{ultimately}} worth reading. For the Presbyterian Record, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway writes that he found the book refreshing and inspirational. What's So Amazing About Grace? has been endorsed {{by a number of}} public figures, including Irish musician Bono, British adventurer Debra Searle, and World Vision Australia CEO Tim Costello.|$|E
25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people {{may be perceived as}} being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the DVD, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of both subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for someone attempting to learn a foreign language.|$|E

25|$|People with {{executive}} dysfunction have {{a slower}} cognitive processing speed and thus often {{take longer to}} complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle {{translation}} can {{be different}} from the translation of written text. Usually, during the process of creating subtitles for a film or television program, the picture and each sentence of the audio are analyzed by the subtitle translator; also, the subtitle translator {{may or may not have}} access to a written transcript of the dialog. Especially in the field of commercial subtitles, the subtitle translator often interprets what is meant, rather than translating the manner in which the dialog is stated; that is, the meaning is more important than the form—the audience does not always appreciate this, as it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> for people who are familiar with some of the spoken language; spoken language may contain verbal padding or culturally implied meanings that cannot be conveyed in the written subtitles. Also, the subtitle translator may also condense the dialog to achieve an acceptable reading speed, whereby purpose is more important than form.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} often called a Super Mario 64 clone for its {{similarity}} in gameplay. Gerstmann compared it favourably to Mario, saying that [...] "it doesn't stray {{too far from}} the formula, but it makes the logical progressions you would expect Nintendo to make." [...] Game Informer observed that, while both games are very similar, Banjo-Kazooie has less emphasis on the platforming and more on exploration. Schneider noted that the worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are [...] "bigger, more detailed and are filled with interactive characters at every corner." [...] Colin Williamson of AllGame stated similar pros, crediting the level design as [...] "simply delightful, loaded with creativity, secrets, and memorable characters." [...] Nintendo Power remarked that the game's puzzles were fresh and that the characters [...] "have more of a loud-mouthed attitude than Mario and crew. One habitually-criticized aspect of the game was its flawed camera system. Game Revolution remarked that it can occasionally be in a bad angle to gauge a jump properly, while Edge said that its fixed position in underwater sections <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> while retrieving collectables.|$|E

500|$|The game's mission design {{received}} mixed reviews. Martin {{criticized the}} limited geographical variety of each level, but Welsh applauded the map variety, adding that each level feels different, as ideas were never identical. He further praised the game's portrayal of nature, describing it as [...] "elegantly expressed". Gonzalez {{added that the}} game's variety was sufficient, and is successful in keeping the game interesting. Some critics criticized the game's difficulty curve, and added that the later levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> as they are significantly more challenging and demand high levels of time management. Winterhalter however, criticized {{the first half of}} the game, calling it a [...] "tutorial" [...] that must be endured before reaching the better missions, while describing the latter half as addictive. Justin McElroy from Joystiq added that the natural disasters featured are way too unpredictable, and lamented that the game had failed to provide players enough clues when the player failed and destroyed the entire tribe. Tom Francis of PC Gamer echoed similar statements, that the game seldom notified players of their mistakes, and that levels are excessively trial-and-error and feel too stressful for players to play. Jamin Smith of VideoGamer.com criticized the mission structure and objectives for being unrewarding and lacking a sense of progression.|$|E
500|$|Vergne {{was angry}} with d'Ambrosio's {{defensive}} driving {{and found the}} manner d'Ambrosio performed the manoeuvres as not being [...] "acceptable and fair". He described d'Ambrosio's tactics as [...] "totally stupid" [...] and that it prevented him from winning the race and questioned his intelligence. Vergne revealed that d'Ambrosio {{wanted to have a}} conservation about the manoeuvres but Vergne did not wish to speak to him. D'Ambrosio argued that his defensive driving was fair, saying that he was doing his own race. He argued that in the event that the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, felt he was overly aggressive, he would be notified and issued a warning D'Ambrosio said that from his point of view, he steered into the corner early and argued that he did not change his line: [...] "Sure, I didn’t give much space but this is racing. I understand it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating</b> but everyone is doing their own race and it’s what the fans want to see.” He felt he could have achieved a maximum finishing position of fifth but the energy targets displayed on his steering wheel dashboard did not match those provided to him by Dragon, which caused him to push hard until his team realised they were mistaken. Vergne changed his verdict on the clash weeks later after admitting he was not aware that d'Ambrosio had incorrect information relayed to him and felt he had performed [...] "a great race". [...] "Things like this can happen. I don't think there are any more worries about it", he said.|$|E
2500|$|Declarative {{sentences}} show a 2–3–1 pitch pattern. If {{the last}} syllable is prominent the final decline in pitch is a glide. For example, in This is fun, this is is at pitch 2, and fun starts at level 3 and glides down to level 1. But if the last prominent syllable {{is not the}} last syllable of the utterance, the pitch fall-off is a step. For example, in That <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating,</b> That can be has pitch 2, frus- has level 3, and both syllables of -trating have pitch 1. Wh-questions work the same way, as in Who (2) will (2) help (3↘1)? and Who (2) did (3) it (1)?. But if something is left unsaid, the final pitch level 1 is replaced by pitch 2. Thus in John's (2) sick (3↘2) ..., with the speaker indicating more to come, John's has pitch 2 while sick starts at pitch 3 and drops only to pitch 2.|$|E

Seomyeon subway station is also home to a large number of underground shops, selling a variety of products, predominately clothing and footwear. These are small boutique shops, selling locally produced products. Though shopping here <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating,</b> as you are often not allowed to try on the merchandise, you are sure to find some great bargains. The local head offices of Korean and international banks are located in Seomyeon. It is recognized as the ascendant shopping and entertainment district. It is also home to [...] "Seomyeon Medical Street", the district encompassing the 1km-radius range around Lotte Department Store in Seomyeon and the Buam subway station. The Street is home to a total of 160 cosmetic and other medical clinics, including those specializing in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology and dentistry. Directly adjacent to Seomyeon is Bujeon Market, the largest traditional market in the city. Other companies with offices here include Yeolmae Food.|$|E
2500|$|Mia {{insists that}} it's common {{knowledge}} that he's the third best-looking guy at AEHS after Josh Richter and Justin Baxendale and described his nose as aquiline, mouth as [...] "eminently kissable" [...] and neck as aromatic due to an intoxicating blend of Tide from his shirt collar, his Gillette shaving foam and Ivory soap and a special Michael smell makes it the best smell in the world. Michael loves Mia just as she is, though her neurotic behavior and insecurity <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrating.</b> In fact, Michael {{is the one who}} often feels insecure in their relationship because he knows Clarisse Marie Renaldo does not think he is an appropriate consort and all the gossip magazines would much rather prefer to see Mia date a fellow royal or celebrity like James Franco or as Mia's other grandmother, Mamaw suggests Zac Efron from High School Musical. Due to this, Michael believes moving to Japan and developing his robotic arm would finally prove to the world that he is, in fact, worthy of dating a princess. Michael returns to New York a multi-millionaire and the president/owner of his own robotics company, Pavlov Robotics, named after his dog. [...] Michael donates a robot arm to Genovia from his company for free even though the waiting list is long, helping Mia's father win the election. Mia realizes that she is still in love with Michael, but tries to convince herself otherwise. When she and Michael kiss on a coach ride, however, she writes, [...] "I can't do this to J.P. I just can't. Oh my God, though, I love Michael so much." [...] When J.P. and Mia split due to J.P using her and lying to her, she and Michael reunite, spending the night together.|$|E

50|$|Anycast allows any {{operator}} whose {{routing information}} is accepted by an intermediate router to hijack any packets {{intended for the}} anycast address. While this at first sight appears insecure, it {{is no different from}} the routing of ordinary IP packets, and no more or less secure.

50|$|Since the leading-tone triad is diminished, it {{is rarely}} found in root position. Instead, it is {{commonly}} found in first inversion. In a four-part chorale texture, the third of the leading-tone triad is doubled {{in order to avoid}} adding emphasis to the tritone created by the root and the fifth. Unlike a dominant where the leading-tone <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> and not resolve to the tonic if it is in an inner voice, the leading-tone in a leading-tone triad must resolve to the tonic.

5000|$|The {{strength}} of Toss Across is its balance between luck and skill. While the game generally rewards accurate tossing and effective strategy, there are elements {{of luck to}} game play. Even if a player succeeds in hitting the square they wish to change, it is often impossible to control the effect one's beanbag impact will have. Blocks may turn quickly, spinning a few times before coming to rest, at which point any side may be facing up. Players <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> by hitting the square they want, only to change it to their opponent's letter. Further, the low quality of the plastic board can punish players. Blocks do not always turn, even when impacted.|$|R
