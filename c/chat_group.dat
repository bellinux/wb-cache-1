25|$|Research {{suggests}} that the bystander effect may be present in computer-mediated communication situations. Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress. In the experiment, 400 online chat groups were observed. One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room: either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen. The purpose of the experiment {{was to determine whether}} or not the gender of the victim mattered, if the size of each <b>chat</b> <b>group</b> had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name would have any effect. Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim. Consistent with findings of Latané and Darley, the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect. The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups. However, this effect was nonexistent when the victim (Suzy or Jake) asked for help from a specific person in the <b>chat</b> <b>group.</b> The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was 36.38 seconds. The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was 51.53 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Avatars can {{communicate}} via local <b>chat,</b> <b>group</b> chat, global instant messaging (known as IM), and voice (public, private and group). Chatting {{is used for}} localized public conversations between two or more avatars, and is visible to any avatar within a given distance. IMs are used for private conversations, either between two avatars, or {{among the members of}} a group, or even between objects and avatars. Unlike chatting, IM communication does not depend on the participants being within a certain distance of each other. As of version 1.18.1.2, voice chat, both local and IM, was also available.|$|E
40|$|Because of {{the embarrassment}} that can {{surround}} female sexual dysfunctions, online interventions offer an anonymous and private treatment alternative. Recently, an online cognitive-behavioral treatment for female sexual dysfunctions was evaluated. Although significant improvements {{were observed in}} sexual functioning, the treatment was primarily a behavioral intervention because of difficulties with engaging participants in cognitive therapy over e-mail. To address this limitation, the use of <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> was incorporated into a new online treatment for female sexual dysfunctions—the PursuingPleasure program. Thirty-eight women participated in the PursuingPleasure <b>chat</b> <b>groups.</b> The goals of the <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> were to address and overcome challenges as women progressed through PursuingPleasure {{and to create a}} social support network where group therapy processes could be used. The <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> aimed to address misunderstandings, monitor changes, and receive feedback. A qualitative analysis of the <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> revealed that they helped to facilitate the cognitive-affective aspects of the program, as well as fulfill their other intended functions. This study demonstrates how the use of <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> in the online treatment of female sexual dysfunctions is a useful addition to Internet-based treatment. Feedback suggests that the <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> were one of the most helpful aspects of the program, although a small group of women reported finding the groups unhelpful...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which language is evolving in certain online courses within French higher education.

Previous research (Panckhurst and Bouguerra 2003, Panckhurst 1999) suggests that CMC issues are of particular interest in relation to linguistic and extra-linguistic aspects. In our view, the discourse which occurs when one uses the computer for electronic mail (email), discussion <b>groups</b> (DGs) and <b>chat</b> <b>groups</b> (CGs) (“Netspeak” as Crystal terms it or mediated electronic discourse (MED) in our terminology), emerges specifically because the computer is in use. The computer becomes a sort of new mediator, creating new methods, new styles, and new “genres”...|$|R
