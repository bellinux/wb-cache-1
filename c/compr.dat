40|$|This paper {{presents}} an arbitrary h. o. accurate ADER DG method on space-time adaptive meshes (AMR) for {{the solution of}} two important families of non-linear time dependent PDE for <b>compr.</b> dissipative flows: the <b>compr.</b> Navier-Stokes equations and the equations of visc. and res. MHD in 2 and 3 space-dimensions. The work continues a recent series of papers concerning the development and application of a proper a posteriori subcell FV limiting procedure suitable for DG methods. It is a well known fact that a major weakness of h. o. DG methods lies in the difficulty of limiting discontinuous solutions, which generate spurious oscillations, namely the so-called 'Gibbs phenomenon'. In the present work the main benefits of the MOOD paradigm, i. e. the computational robustness even {{in the presence of}} strong shocks, are preserved and the numerical diffusion is considerably reduced also for the limited cells by resorting to a proper sub-grid. An important feature of our new scheme is its ability to cure even floating point errors that may occur during a simulation, for example when taking real roots of negative numbers or after divisions by zero. We apply the whole approach {{for the first time to}} the equations of <b>compr.</b> gas dynamics and MHD in the presence of viscosity, thermal conductivity and magnetic resistivity, therefore extending our family of adaptive ADER-DG schemes to cases for which the numerical fluxes also depend on the gradient of the state vector.

We further investigated the production of Interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), and the responsiveness to IL- 2 of alveolar lymphocytes obtained from sarcoidosis patients and stimulated by P. acnes in vitro. In 21 untreated sarcoidosis patients, 7 treated patients and 13 control subjects, the mean IL- 2 activity of fluid released from cultured alveoloar lymphocytes was 9. 8 ± 15. 7 (M±SD), 1. 9 ± 4. 7 and 0. 2 ± 0. 8 u/ml respectively. The IL- 2 activity of lymphocytes from untreated patients was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p< 0. 02). Neither perioheral lymphocytes in sarcoidosis patients nor in controls produced IL- 2 stimulated by P. acnes. The responsiveness of alveloar lymphocytes to recombinant IL- 2 was evaluated by 3 H-thymidine uptake in the presence and absence of P. acnes. Lymphocytes stimulated by P. acnes showed a significantly increased uptake (3, 766 ± 3, 929 dpm) <b>compred</b> to ustimulated lymphocytes (1, 123 ± 968 dpm) obtained from 11 untreated sarcoidosis patients (p< 0. 02).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment with the orally active dopamine agonist ibopamine in patients with mild to moderate chronic congestive heart failure and to compare the results with those of treatment with digoxin and placebo. BackgroundIbopamine and digoxin are drugs that exert hemodynamic and neurohumoral effects. Because there is accumulating evidence that progression of disease in chronic heart failure is related not only to hemodynamic but also to neurohumoral factors, both drugs might be expected to have a favorable long-term effect. Methods. We studied 161 patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (80 % in New York Heart Association functional class II and 20 % in class III), who were treated with ibopamine (n = 53), digoxin (n = 55) or placebo (n = 53) for 6 months. Background therapy consisted of furosemide (0 to 80 mg); all other drugs for heart failure were excluded. Clinical assessments were made at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Results. Of the 161 patients, 128 (80 %) completed the study. <b>Compred</b> with placebo, digoxin but not ibopamine significantly increased exercise time after 6 months (p = 0. 008 by intention to treat analysis). Ibopamine was only effective in patients with relatively preserved left ventricular function, as it significantly increased exercise time in this subgroup (for patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction > 0. 30; p = 0. 018 vs. placebo). No patient receiving digoxin withdrew from the study because of progression of heart failure, compared with six patients receiving ibopamine and two receiving placebo. At 6 months, plasma norepinephrine was decreased with digoxin and ibopamine therapy (− 106 and − 13 pg/ml, respectively) but increased with placebo administration (+ 62 pg/ml) (both p < 0. 05 vs. placebo). Plasma aldosterone was unaffected, but renin was decreased by boat agents after 6 months (p < 0. 05 vs. placbo). Total mortality and ambulatory arrhythmias were not significantly affected by the two drugs. Conclusions. Ibopamine and digoxin both inhibit neurohumoral activation in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. However, the clinical effects of these drugs are different and appear {{to be related to the}} degree of left ventricular dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Backgrounds and Aim: One of the {{remuneration}} methods {{in the hospital}} system in Iran is per case, based on a classification system termed Global system (GS). The GS, supported by Irans Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME), was established in 1999 and is now used for cost reimbursement in the second- and third-levels of health care services. In this system, patients are classified into 60 categories, based on the most frequent surgical operations. However, it now appears, {{that there are many}} questions about this system. This study aims to compare the global operations reimbursement rates with actual costs in the Cancer Institute, Tehran, in 2003 and 2004. nMaterials and Methods: This survey was a retrospective, analytical-descriptive one aiming at comparing the global operations reimbursement rates with actual costs in 646 global operations carried out in the Cancer Institute in 2003 and 2004. The global-operations and actual-costs data were gathered from Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and High Council of Insurance annual regulations, respectively, and analyzed using SPSS 11. 5 software and the Wilcoxon non-parametric test. Results: The differences between the cost reimbursement rates of global operations and their actual costs were lower in 2004 as compared to those in 2003. Also, the actual costs of operations were higher than the global operations reimbursement rates in both years and the difference was significant statistically in either year (P< 0 / 001). Conclusion: Some of the MOHME and Cancer Institutes authorities and experts believe that the decrease in differences between the cost reimbursement rates of global operations and their actual costs in 2003 <b>compred</b> to 2004 is due to increased awareness of physicians and the accounting and discharge units personnel of the global operations and related regulations, as well as increasing global operations reimbursement rates. Also, they believe that the differences between the global operations reimbursement rates and their actual costs in either year could be attributed to not considering the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patients co-morbidities, etc. in calculating the global operations reimbursement rates. It is suggested to make more realistic calculations, taking into account such variables as the actual inflation rate, hospital types, patient co-morbidities, etc...|$|R
40|$|An {{existing}} {{simulation model}} of the Weber Basin (GRES Model) {{was used as a}} basis for creating an equivalent model on the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) system. The GRES Model was developed by the Utah Division of Water Resources (UDWR) and simulates the historical water allocation from 1950 to 2006. Using the GRES Model and additional information obtained from UDWR staff, two different WEAP models were created. The two models differed only in how water is transmitted to the service areas. End-of-month reservoir storage and other outputs from the GRES Model were compared to the two WEAP models. The two models turn out to be almost equal. The simplest version of the two WEAP models was selected and named the WEAP Weber Basin Model. The WEAP Weber Basin Model is basically a historical simulation of water allocation in the Weber Basin and shows that the storage level in most reservoirs, except Causey, does not reach the buffer zone. This result indicates the historical water security of the basin and also the security in the foreseable future. The WEAP Weber Basin Model was also modified. Two scenarios consider demand growth (i) with, and (ii) without applying water conservation. These modifications were applied to one of the service areas which serves purely municipal and indusrial demands. The inflow to the system was populated by randomly reshuffling the historical flows. This is assuming that the historical flows will repeat in a random order in the future. Hence the inflows to the streams in 2006 were assigned the historical inflows of 1968 and so on. The result from the WEAP Weber Basin Model without conservation (with growth) shows that most of the reservoirs, with the exception of Pinveview and Willard Reservoirs, do begin to draw from the buffer zone {{towards the end of the}} simulation period. Different storage carryover policies tested show that the reliability of the system decreases while its resilience increases when more and more of the water in the buffer zone is carried over between time steps. Applying conservation seems to reduce the shortages created when different storage carryover policies were implemented <b>compred</b> to the model that did not apply conservation...|$|R
