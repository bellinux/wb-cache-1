50|$|Generally {{the tubes}} {{are made of}} {{stainless}} steel, copper alloys such as brass or bronze, cupro nickel, or titanium depending on several selection criteria. The use of copper bearing alloys such as brass or cupro nickel is rare in new plants, due to environmental concerns of toxic copper alloys. Also depending on the steam cycle water treatment for the boiler, it may be desirable to avoid tube materials containing copper. Titanium <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> are usually the best technical choice, however the use of titanium <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> has been virtually eliminated by the sharp increases in the costs for this material. The tube lengths range to about 85 ft (26 m) for modern power plants, {{depending on the size}} of the condenser. The size chosen is based on transportability from the manufacturers’ site and ease of erection at the installation site. The outer diameter of <b>condenser</b> <b>tubes</b> typically ranges from 3/4 inch to 1-1/4 inch, based on condenser cooling water friction considerations and overall condenser size.|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{equipped}} with reciprocating steam engines, during its long life {{a total of}} eighteen generating sets were installed and in turn replaced with larger units or scrapped. The final equipment was of fairly typical 1940's design with eight Babcock stoker-fired boilers using the range system, feeding two British Thomson-Houston 34 MW sets and two Richardsons-Westgarth 30 MW sets, running at 650 psi and 875 F superheat. Two of the cooling towers were unique, nationally and probably globally, in having the control room, 33 kV switchgear, relay room, garages and main stores beneath them. The station was coal-fired throughout its life, although small quantities of more unusual low-cost fuels were burned,including coke, sawdust, and at one period chicken droppings. Fuel was delivered originally by canal and later by rail,with small quantities by road. Although in later years the station was small in comparison with modern stations, it was extremely successful,and had a high availability, load factor and thermal efficiency when compared with most stations similar in design and age. It was the first station {{in the country to}} use the innovative [...] "Taprogge" [...] system of on-load <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> cleaning.For thirteen years, from 1959 to 1971, the load factor never dropped below 50%, well above that of the system as a whole. In 1968-1970, Ocker Hill had the highest load factor of any CEGB stoker-fired station, and the third highest thermal efficiency. During periods of plant shortage, it repeatedly carried overloads of up to 20%.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{greater part}} of the {{horizontal}} <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> is occupied by the stratified and annular flows, which play important roles in condensation heat transfer coefficients. Both a volume of fluid (VOF) interface tracking method and k-ε two equations model was applied to analyze {{the characteristics of the}} stratified and annular flows for horizontal tubes, obtaining distribution of velocity, contours of both temperature and local condensation heat transfer coefficients. The computation shows that an annular flow having thinner liquid film attached on the inner surface of tubes appears at the inlet of the horizontal <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> because vapor exerts a higher interfacial shear stress on the gas-liquid interface, therefore, there are a higher local condensation heat transfer coefficients there. Next, as vapor quality decreases and condensate gravity increases along the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> length, the condensation flow pattern transforms from the annular flow into the stratified flow in which local condensation heat transfer coefficients decreases and distributes unevenly along the circumference as liquid film {{at the bottom of the}} <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> become thicker. In addition, in the stratified flow, a wave structure is formed in the middle of the condensate pool at the bottom of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> because condensate on the top of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> slides into the bottom of the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> and collapse each other. The heat transfer rate calculated by the present method is compared to those predicted from a Shah correlation, the agreement is found to be good, and both errors is within 7 %...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{engineered}} {{safety systems}} in the advanced boiling water reactor is a passive containment cooling system (PCCS) which is composed {{of a number of}} vertical heat exchanger. After a loss of coolant accident, the pressurized steam discharged from the reactor and the noncondensable (NC) gases mixture flows into the PCCS <b>condenser</b> <b>tube.</b> The PCCS condenser must be able to remove sufficient energy from the reactor containment to prevent containment from exceeding its design pressure. The efficient performance of the PCCS condenser is thus vital to the safety of the reactor. In PCCS <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> three flow conditions are expected namely the forced flow, cyclic venting and complete condensation modes. The PCCS test facility consists of steam generator (SG), instrumented condenser with secondary pool boiling section, condensation tank, suppression pool, storage tank, air supply line, and associated piping and instrumentation [...] The specific design of condensing tube is based on scaling analysis from the PCCS design of ESBWR.

The EIS diagrams showed a semicircle that was better defined as the experimental time increased, indicating the decreasing tarnishing resistance of the immersed specimens. The EIS results were validated using Kramers-Kronig relationships. SEM micrographs of biofouling indicated that the number of microorganisms on the SS surfaces increased with immersion time.

40|$|The {{diameter}} and configuration of tubes are important design parameters of power condensers. If a proper tube diameter is applied during {{the design of}} a power unit, a high energy efficiency of the condenser itself can be achieved and the performance of the whole power generation unit can be improved. If a tube assembly is to be replaced, one should verify whether the chosen <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> diameter is correct. Using a diameter that is too large increases the heat transfer area, leading to over-dimensioning and higher costs of building the condenser. On the other hand, if the diameter is too small, water flows faster through the tubes, which results in larger flow resistance and larger pumping power of the cooling-water pump. Both simple and complex methods can be applied to determine the <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> diameter. The paper proposes a method of technical and economic optimisation taking into account the performance of a condenser, the low-pressure (LP) part of a turbine, and a cooling-water pump as well as the profit from electric power generation and costs of building the condenser and pumping cooling water. The results obtained by this method were compared with those provided by the following simpler methods: minimization of the entropy generation rate per unit length of a <b>condenser</b> <b>tube</b> (considering entropy generation due to heat transfer and resistance of cooling-water flow), minimization of the total entropy generation rate (considering entropy generation for the system comprising the LP part of the turbine, the condenser, and the cooling-water pump), and maximization of the power unit’s output.
