30|$|The morphologies of the {{fabricated}} CNT emitters {{were characterized}} using a field emission {{scanning electron microscope}} (FESEM; Hitachi S- 4800, Chiyoda-ku, Japan). The adhesive force of the CNT/metal binder coating on a substrate was measured by a pencil hardness test, which is described in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D 3363. Field emission properties of the fabricated CNT emitters were characterized in a vacuum chamber, which is schematically shown in Figure  1 b. A diode type with a copper disc (diameter, 30 mm) acting as an anode was employed for the field emission test. A negative high voltage of 0 ~ − 70 kV {{was applied to the}} CNT emitter while the Cu anode was grounded. The distance between the CNT emitter and the anode was fixed to 15 mm. In order to protect the high-voltage power supply due to high-voltage arcing, a <b>current-limiting</b> <b>resistor</b> (resistance, 10 MΩ) was installed between the power supply and the emitter.|$|E
40|$|The {{dependence}} of the field emission effect on distance is applied for displacement sensing and high-resolution positioning. Silicon atomic force microscopy probes were used as a field emission source by applying voltages up to 400 V between this probe and a counter-electrode sample consisting of TiW sputtered on a silicon wafer. From current-voltage characteristics measured for distances varying from 50 to 950 nm, values for the field enhancement factor were determined which show a dependence on the electrode separation. This dependence can be correctly described by a model the authors developed using finite-element calculations and {{is determined by the}} emitter geometry and tip radius. Feedback to the probe position was used to maintain a constant current to apply this distance dependence for positioning. When increasing the applied voltage from 5 to 40 V for a constant current of 3 nA, the probe position is raised similar to 90 nm. The nonlinear sensitivity of this positioning method is determined by the varying field enhancement and can be fitted by the same calculated model. Using feedback, the field emitter can be positioned with high lateral resolution and scanned over a conducting surface. Increasing the bias voltage from 3 to 50 V results in an increase in the emitter-sample distance and a decrease in lateral resolution. Damage to the scanned surface has to be prevented by using a <b>current-limiting</b> <b>resistor</b> and by annealing the probe and sample under ultra high vacuum conditions before use.

These rover Li-ion batteries are characterized by their unique low temperature capability, in addition to the usual advantages associated with Li-ion chemistry in terms of mass, volume and energy efficiency.

Brief {{description of}} the application circuitry IR 2137 is a three-phase gate driver with enhanced protection features such as desaturation for the highside devices. The usual application circuitry is presented in Fig. 1. It shows the communication link with the microcontroller stages through the PWM signal {{as well as the}} Fault and Clear_Fault signals. This stage needs a 5 V power supply. The operation mode of the Desat function or over-current protection (ITRIP) are not detailed in this design tip as they are presented in a separate technical paper. This design tip is trying to address the questions regarding the applicability of the IR 2137, the particular design of the bootstrap stage when applied within different PWM converters, to the design of the gate resistors {{as well as to the}} grounding issues. 2. Considerations regarding the bootstrap stage IR 2137 is delivering the control pulses for three-phase inverters that are working under a PWM algorithm. There are different types of PWM algorithms that are currently used by industry. Any particular PWM algorithm defines different values of the minimum and maximum pulse-widths.

40|$|A {{circuit and}} method for {{transmitting}} and receiving on-off-keyed (OOK) signals with fractional signal-to-noise ratios uses available high-temperature silicon- on-insulator (SOI) components to move computational, sensing, and actuation abilities closer to high-temperature or high-ionizing radiation environments such as vehicle engine compartments, deep-hole drilling environments, industrial control and monitoring of processes like smelting, and operations near nuclear reactors and in space. This device {{allows for the}} networking of multiple, like nodes {{to each other and}} to a central processor. It can do this with nothing more than the already in-situ power wiring of the system. The device s microprocessor allows it to make intelligent decisions within the vehicle operational loop and to effect control outputs to its associated actuators. The figure illustrates how each node converts digital serial data to OOK 18 -kHz in transmit mode and vice-versa in receive mode; though operations at lower frequencies or up to a megahertz are within reason using this method and these parts. This innovation s technique modulates a DC power bus with millivolt-level signals through a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor) and resistor by OOK. It receives and demodulates this signal from the DC power bus through capacitive coupling at high temperature and in high ionizing radiation environments. The demodulation of the OOK signal is accomplished by using an asynchronous quadrature detection technique realized by a quasi-discrete Fourier transform through use of the quadrature components (0 and 90 phases) of the carrier frequency as generated by the microcontroller and as a function of the selected crystal frequency driving its oscillator. The detected signal is rectified using an absolute-value circuit containing no diodes (diodes being non-operational at high temperatures), and only operational amplifiers. The absolute values of the two phases of the received signal are then summed and hard limited (digitized) by comparing them to a reference level and are then input into a microprocessor as a serial bit stream. The quasi-discrete Fourier transform is performed in high-temperature components (operational amplifiers, analog switches, resistors, and capacitors). The demodulated signal is a serial data stream that is input to the UART (universal asynchronous receiver transmitter) receiver pin of the microprocessor. The OOK of the carrier frequency uses the output of the UART pin as an enabling signal that drives the gate of the MOSFET. Logic low bits enable the carrier frequency (realized by using the 0 phase signal from the microcontroller, though either phase may be used) to be DC-coupled to the power supply bus through a <b>current-limiting</b> <b>resistor</b> mounted between the MOSFET drain and the supply rail.

40|$|A circuit {{topology}} {{has been}} designed to guarantee the output of intrinsically safe power for the operation of electrical devices in a hazardous environment. This design uses a MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor) as a switch to connect and disconnect power to a load. A test current is provided through a separate path to the load for monitoring by a comparator against a preset threshold level. The circuit is configured so that the test current will detect a fault in the load and open the switch before the main current can respond. The main current passes through the switch and then an inductor. When a fault occurs in the load, the current through the inductor cannot change immediately, but the voltage drops immediately to safe levels. The comparator detects this drop and opens the switch before the current in the inductor has a chance to respond. This circuit protects both the current and voltage from exceeding safe levels. Typically, this type of protection is accomplished by a fuse or a circuit breaker, but in order for a fuse or a circuit breaker to blow or trip, the current must exceed the safe levels momentarily, which may be just enough time to ignite anything in a hazardous environment. To prevent this from happening, a fuse is typically current-limited by the addition of the resistor to keep the current within safe levels while the fuse reacts. The use of a resistor is acceptable for non-battery applications where the wasted energy and voltage drop across the resistor can be tolerated. The use of the switch and inductor minimizes the wasted energy. For example, a circuit runs from a 3. 6 -V battery that must be current-limited to 200 mA. If the circuit normally draws 10 mA, then an 18 -ohm resistor would drop 180 mV during normal operation, while a typical switch (0. 02 ohm) and inductor (0. 97 ohm) would only drop 9. 9 mV. From a power standpoint, the <b>current-limiting</b> <b>resistor</b> protection circuit wastes about 18 times more power than the switch and the inductor configuration. In the fault condition, both the resistor and the inductor react immediately. The resistor reacts by allowing more current to flow and dropping the voltage. Initially, the inductor reacts by dropping the voltage, and then by not allowing the current to change. When the comparator detects the drop in voltage, it opens the switch, thus preventing any further current flow. The inductor alone is not sufficient protection, because after the voltage drop has settled, the inductor would then allow the current to change, in this example, the current would be 3. 7 A. In the fault condition, the resistor is flowing 200 mA until the fuse blows (anywhere from 1 ms to 100 s), while the switch and inductor combination is flowing about 2 A test current while monitoring for the fault to be corrected. Finally, as an additional safety feature, the circuit can be configured to hold the switch opened until both the load and source are disconnected...|$|E
