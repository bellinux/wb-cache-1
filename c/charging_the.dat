Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

5|$|Some large shark species, such as {{the tiger}} shark, the dusky shark, the great white shark and the bull shark, prey on the {{bottlenose}} dolphin, especially calves. The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by <b>charging</b> <b>the</b> predator; dolphin 'mobbing' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark. Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size. Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins, but this seems rare, and other orcas may swim with dolphins. Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators. Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to outswim their predators, or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee.|$|E

5000|$|Conductive metal objects contain mobile {{electric}} charges (electrons) {{that can}} move about freely in the metal. [...] In an uncharged state, {{each part of}} the metal contains equal quantities of positive and negative charges, intimately mixed, so no part of it has a net charge. If an external charged object is brought near a piece of metal, the force of <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> causes these internal charges to separate. [...] <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of opposite polarity to <b>the</b> external <b>charge</b> are attracted to it, and move {{to the surface of the}} object facing <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>charges</b> of <b>the</b> same polarity are repelled and move to the surface of the metal away from <b>the</b> <b>charge.</b> This is called electrostatic induction. In Procedure 2 above, as <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> C is lowered into <b>the</b> container, <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal of the container separate. If C has a positive <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>charges</b> in <b>the</b> metal are attracted to it and move to the inner surface of the container, while <b>the</b> positive <b>charges</b> are repelled and move to the outside surface. If C has a negative <b>charge,</b> <b>the</b> <b>charges</b> have opposite polarity. Since the container was originally uncharged, the two regions have equal and opposite <b>charges.</b> <b>The</b> induction process is reversible: in Procedure 4, when C is removed, the attraction of <b>the</b> opposite <b>charges</b> cause them to intermingle again, and <b>the</b> <b>charge</b> on <b>the</b> surfaces reduces to zero.|$|R

5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy land for a potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included <b>charging</b> <b>the</b> U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E

The French reorganised the country into a client state named the Batavian Republic, and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the Batavian Republic, but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, 22 May, Nansouty {{received}} his second cuirassier brigade, Doumerc's 2nd and 9th regiments. During the morning, having received some reinforcements, Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes's Corps forward, in an attack against the enemy line. Nansouty's and Lasalle's cavalry protected the infantry columns, <b>charging</b> <b>the</b> enemy cavalry to clear their path. However, at around 21:00 in the morning, news that the great bridge over the Danube had broken, making the arrival of further reinforcements virtually impossible, forced Napoleon to call off his attack and order a phased retreat. The situation of the French army was critical, with Marshal Lannes fatally wounded, and a great number of losses in men. It took all the skill of Nansouty and the other cavalry commanders to contain the formidable Austrian onslaught in order to allow the rest of the army to gradually disengage. After most of the army had safely crossed an arm of the Danube onto the island of Lobau, Nansouty's men were also withdrawn from the battlefield during the night, with the French cavalry subsequently celebrated for their role in preventing a catastrophic defeat that day.|$|E
