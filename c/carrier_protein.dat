5|$|Screening of {{an extract}} of Hydnellum peckii {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} an effective anticoagulant, named atromentin (2,5-dihydroxy-3,6-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,4-benzoquinone), and similar in biological activity to the well-known anticoagulant heparin.

5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds—some {{with unique}} biological activity—have been isolated and identified from Hydnellum species. For example, Hydnellum peckii contains atromentin, a pigment with anticoagulant properties similar to heparin. Atromentin also possesses antibacterial activity, inhibiting the enzyme enoyl-acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> reductase (essential for the biosynthesis of fatty acids) in the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.|$|E
5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5000|$|... 4'-Phosphopantetheine is an {{essential}} prosthetic group of several acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> involved in pathways of primary and secondary metabolism including the acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> (ACP) of fatty acid synthases, ACPs of polyketide synthases, and peptidyl <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> (PCP) and aryl <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> (ArCP) of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS). Phosphopantetheine fulfills two demands in these biosynthetic pathways. First, the intermediates remain covalently linked to the synthases (or synthetases) in an energy-rich linkage. Second, the flexibility and length of the phosphopantetheine chain (approximately 2 nm) allows the covalently tethered intermediates {{to have access to}} spatially distinct enzyme-active sites. This increases the effective molarity of the intermediate and allows an assembly line-like process.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Control {{of small}} {{molecule}} hapten epitope densities on antigenic <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> {{is essential for}} development and testing of optimal conditions for vaccines. Yet, accurate determination of epitope density can be extremely difficult to accomplish, especially {{with the use of}} small haptens, large molecular weight <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins,</b> and limited amounts of protein. Here we report a simple radiometric method that uses 14 C-labeled cystine to measure hapten epitope densities during sulfhydryl conjugation of haptens to maleimide activated <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins.</b> The method was developed using a (+) -methamphetamine (METH) -like hapten with a sulfhydryl terminus, and two prototype maleimide activated <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins,</b> bovine serum albumin (BSA) and immunocyanin monomers of keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The method was validated by immunochemical analysis of the hapten−BSA conjugates, and least-squares linear regression analysis of epitope density values determined by the new radiometric method versus values determined by matrix...|$|R
25|$|The {{oxytocin}} peptide is synthesized as an inactive {{precursor protein}} from the OXT gene. This precursor protein {{also includes the}} oxytocin <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> neurophysin I. The inactive precursor protein is progressively hydrolyzed into smaller fragments (one of which is neurophysin I) via a series of enzymes. The last hydrolysis that releases the active oxytocin nonapeptide is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).|$|E
25|$|ATP {{hydrolysis}} is used {{to transport}} hydrogen ions against the electrochemical gradient (from low to high hydrogen ion concentration). Phosphorylation of the <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> and the binding of a hydrogen ion induce a conformational (shape) change that drives the hydrogen ions to transport against the electrochemical gradient. Hydrolysis of the bound phosphate group and release of hydrogen ion then restores the carrier to its original conformation.|$|E
25|$|Triclosan binds to {{bacterial}} enoyl-acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> reductase (ENR) enzyme, {{which is}} encoded by the gene FabI. This binding increases the enzyme's affinity for {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD+). This results {{in the formation of}} a stable, ternary complex of ENR-NAD+-triclosan, which is unable to participate in fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acids are necessary for building and reproducing cell membranes. Humans do not have an ENR enzyme and thus are not affected by this mode of action.|$|E

25|$|DHEA {{does not}} bind to or {{activate}} the progesterone, glucocorticoid, or mineralocorticoid receptors. Other nuclear receptor targets of DHEA besides the androgen and estrogen receptors include the PPARα, PXR, and CAR. However, whereas DHEA is a ligand of the PPARα and PXR in rodents, {{it is not}} in humans. In addition to direct interactions, DHEA is thought to regulate a handful of other proteins via indirect, genomic mechanisms, including the enzymes CYP2C11 and 11β-HSD1 – the latter of which is essential for the biosynthesis of the glucocorticoids such as cortisol and has been suggested {{to be involved in the}} antiglucocorticoid effects of DHEA – and the <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> IGFBP1.|$|E
25|$|To achieve maximum purity in {{a single}} step, {{affinity}} purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an agarose support. If the antigen is a peptide, it is commonly synthesized with a terminal cysteine, which allows selective attachment to a <b>carrier</b> <b>protein,</b> such as KLH during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing media is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt elution buffer is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.|$|E
25|$|Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle {{begins as}} the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which {{is derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Note that the {{cyclohexane}} ring of the starting unit is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The starting unit is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.|$|E

25|$|Nonribosomal peptide {{synthesis}} occurs through distinct modules {{that can}} load {{and extend the}} protein by one amino acid through the amide bond formation at the contact sites of the activating domains. Each module typically consists of an adenylation (A) domain, a peptidyl <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> (PCP) domain, and a condensation (C) or elongation domain. In the A domain, the specific amino acid is activated by converting into an aminoacyl adenylate enzyme complex attached to a 4'phosphopantetheine cofactor by thioesterification The complex is then transferred to the PCP domain with the expulsion of AMP. The PCP domain uses the attached 4'-phosphopantethein prosthetic group to load the growing peptide chain and their precursors. The organization of the modules necessary to biosynthesize Vancomycin is shown in Figure 1. In the biosynthesis of Vancomycin, additional modification domains are present, such as the epimerization (E) domain, which isomerizes the amino acid from one stereochemistry to another, and a thioesterase domain (TE) {{is used as a}} catalyst for cyclization and releases of the molecule via a thioesterase scission.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{regulation}} of iron metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the HFE gene, where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of transferrin, which is iron's <b>carrier</b> <b>protein</b> in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low ferritin stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE {{is only part of}} the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE genotype. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of hepcidin in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Facilitated diffusion== Facilitated diffusion, {{also called}} carrier-mediated osmosis, is the {{movement}} of molecules across the cell membrane via special transport proteins that are embedded within the cellular membrane. Large, insoluble molecules, such as glucose, vesicles and <b>proteins</b> require a <b>carrier</b> molecule {{to move through the}} plasma membrane. Therefore, it will bind with its specific <b>carrier</b> <b>proteins,</b> and the complex will then be bonded to a receptor site and moved through the cellular membrane. Facilitated diffusion is a passive process: the solutes move down their concentration gradient and do not require the expenditure of cellular energy for this process. <b>Carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> and channel proteins allow for the diffusion of molecules across the cell membrane. <b>Carrier</b> <b>proteins</b> undergo conformational alterations to allow molecules to pass, while channel proteins form unblocked pores.|$|R

[...] The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. [...] Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid.|$|E
