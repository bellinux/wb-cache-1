5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, using these symbols.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{in their}} Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are {{increasingly}} clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes {{to soak in}} the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together.|$|E

When completed, Yamaguchi felt that Documentaly expressed what the band had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> while living in Tokyo. In contrast to Kikuuiki, which left him emotionally drained, he felt optimistic after completing Documentaly, feeling that he had a future in music. The Documentaly sessions led Yamaguchi to decide to live as a musician for a full-time career.|$|E

5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. As they <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the workings of the}} Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E

50|$|Working with William Bateson, Garrod <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> {{the pattern}} of alkaptonuria {{appearance}} in children based on Mendelian principles. Once he applied Mendel’s concepts to alkaptonuria, he published a paper in 1902 called “The Incidence of Alkaptonuria: A Study of Chemical Individuality”. In the paper, Garrod explains how he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the condition and speculates as to its causes. He cites various case studies and compares alkaptonuria to albinism in how it's inherited.|$|R

25|$|Goethe's book {{provides}} {{a catalogue of}} how colour is perceived {{in a wide variety}} of circumstances, and considers Isaac Newton's observations to be special cases. Unlike Newton, Goethe's concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour, as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived. Philosophers have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the distinction between the optical spectrum, as observed by Newton, and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe—a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe's theory in Remarks on Colour.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} LGBT-inclusive {{curriculum}} is {{introduced by the}} National Sexuality Education Standards set forth by the Future of Sex Education Initiative. These education standards outline seven core topics {{that must be addressed}} in sex education; one of those core topics is identity. The identity topic presents lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender identities as possibilities for students as they progress through life and <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> who they are. These standards, the Future of Sex Education argues, will start in kindergarten and will evolve into more complex topics throughout schooling as the students mature and age.|$|E
25|$|Titus Andronicus is by {{no means}} the most brutal of Shakespeare's plays. More people die in Richard III. King Lear is a much more cruel play. In the whole Shakespearean {{repertory}} I can find no scene so revolting as Cordelia's death. In reading, the cruelties of Titus can seem ridiculous. But I have seen it on the stage and found it a moving experience. Why? In watching Titus Andronicus we <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> – perhaps more than by looking at any other Shakespeare play – the nature of his genius: he gave an inner awareness to passions; cruelty ceased to be merely physical. Shakespeare discovered the moral hell. He discovered heaven as well. But he remained on earth.|$|E
25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that {{it makes no sense}} to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> God, which in turn is why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E

25|$|Many of Joseph Smith's early revelations prophesied {{that the}} Latter Day Saints would build Zion, a new Jerusalem, a {{religious}} utopia centered in Jackson County, MO. The Prophet urged {{his followers to}} give everything they had to this cause. However, when they failed to live the Law of Consecration, which was a promise to voluntarily give all their property to the community for equal distribution, Joseph Smith received a revelation that God would build Zion later, when the people were ready. Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Zion as primarily a community {{way of life that}} is centered around Jesus Christ, but many people still believe that, when they are ready, {{they will be able to}} build the literal city of Zion as well.|$|E
25|$|Davidson's work is {{well noted}} for its unity, as he has brought a similar {{approach}} {{to a wide variety}} of philosophical problems. Radical interpretation is a hypothetical standpoint which Davidson regards as basic to the investigation of language, mind, action, and knowledge. Radical interpretation involves imagining that you are placed into a community which speaks a language you do not understand at all. How could you <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the language? One suggestion is that you know a theory that generates a theorem of the form 's means that p' for every sentence of the object language (i.e. the language of the community), where s is the name of a sentence in the object language, and p is that sentence, or a translation of it, in the metalanguage in which the theory is expressed. However, Davidson rejects that suggestion on the grounds that the sentential operator 'means that' is sensitive not only to the extensions of the terms that follow it, but also to their intensions. Hence, Davidson replaces 'means that' with a connective sensitive only to the extensions of sentences; since the extension of a sentence is its truth value, this is a truth functional connective. Davidson elects the biconditional (if and only if) as the connective needed in a theory of meaning. He concludes that a theory of meaning must be such that for each sentence of the object language it generates a theorem of the form 's is true if and only if p'. A theory of truth for a language can serve as a theory of meaning.|$|E

500|$|Magoon's primary {{responsibilities}} {{within the}} Canal Zone were to improve sanitation and {{to deal with}} the all-too-common outbreaks of yellow fever and malaria. At first, he refused to believe that the diseases were carried by mosquitos because, he reasoned, the native population would have been more affected. At this time, the nature of human acquired immunity to diseases was not well understood. The Chicago Tribune, in an article about conditions in the canal, referred to the notion that yellow fever was carried by mosquitos as [...] "bugaboo". However, by January 1906, Magoon had long <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the role of mosquitos in the transmission of diseases, as evidenced in a New York Times article wherein Magoon addressed criticisms of his administration in detail; by then he had undertaken a vigorous and ambitious plan to eliminate the swamps that bred mosquitos.|$|E
500|$|As {{members of}} the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken.

Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, [...] "What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever." [...] Some {{members of the}} group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship. Others, as the group itself would <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another.|$|E
