5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> and the law of {{real estate}} that governs the {{transfer}} of rights from one party to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt. In this situation the party who is assigned the debt can sue the debtor despite any contractual agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E
5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, {{judgments}} handed down by the courts are considered a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly <b>contract</b> <b>law,</b> equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the cases that have had scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

C. 5 : 34), {{and includes}} supplemental material {{not found in}} earlier versions of these reprints.

5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as the jury had been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in <b>contract</b> <b>law.</b> The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E
5|$|On {{behalf of}} Somersett, it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery, neither {{the common law}} of England, nor any law made by Parliament {{recognised}} the existence of slavery, and slavery was therefore illegal. Moreover, English <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> did not allow for any person to enslave himself, nor could any contract be binding without the person's consent. The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles. A law passed in 1765 said that all lands, forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown, which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery. When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case, they argued that a contract {{for the sale of}} a slave was recognised in England, and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid.|$|E
5|$|Slade's Case (or Slade v. Morley) {{was a case}} in English <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> {{that ran}} from 1596 to 1602. Under the medieval common law, claims seeking the {{repayment}} of a debt or other matters could only be pursued through a writ of debt in the Court of Common Pleas, a problematic and archaic process. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded in creating another method, enforced by the Court of King's Bench, through the action of assumpsit, which was technically for deceit. The legal fiction used was that by failing to pay after promising to do so, a defendant had committed deceit, and was liable to the plaintiff. The conservative Common Pleas, through the appellate court the Court of Exchequer Chamber, began to overrule decisions made by the King's Bench on assumpsit, causing friction between the courts.|$|E

5|$|The {{legal system}} of Saudi Arabia {{is based on}} Sharia, Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the traditions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The sources of Sharia also include Islamic {{scholarly}} consensus developed after Muhammad's death. Its interpretation by judges in Saudi Arabia {{is influenced by the}} medieval (Islamic Golden Age) texts of the literalist Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence. Uniquely in the Muslim world, Sharia has been adopted by Saudi Arabia in an uncodified form. This, and the lack of judicial precedent, has resulted in considerable uncertainty in the scope and content of the country's laws. The government therefore announced its intention to codify Sharia in 2010, but this is yet to be implemented. Sharia has also been supplemented by regulations issued by royal decree covering modern issues such as intellectual property and corporate law. Nevertheless, Sharia remains the primary source of law, especially in areas such as criminal, family, commercial and <b>contract</b> <b>law,</b> and the Qur'an and the Sunnah are declared to be the country's constitution. In the areas of land and energy law the extensive proprietorial rights of the Saudi state (in effect, the Saudi royal family) constitute a significant feature.|$|E

25|$|Contract {{theory is}} the body of legal theory that {{addresses}} normative and conceptual questions in <b>contract</b> <b>law.</b> One {{of the most important}} questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with Charles Fried, maintains that the purpose of <b>contract</b> <b>law</b> is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, Contract as Promise. Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of legal realists and critical legal studies theorists.|$|E

Defenders of the decision have responded that it simply began bringing the U.S. more in line with international arbitration practice, helping American companies compete in a global economy.
