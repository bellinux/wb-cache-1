5000|$|Acer [...] is a genus {{of trees}} or shrubs {{commonly}} known as maple. The genus {{is placed in the}} Sapindaceae family. There are approximately 128 species, most of which are native to Asia, with a number also appearing in Europe, northern Africa, and North America. Only one species, Acer laurinum, extends to the Southern Hemisphere. The type species of the genus is the sycamore maple, Acer pseudoplatanus, the most <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> species in Europe.|$|E
50|$|The native {{range of}} field maple {{includes}} much of Europe, including Denmark, Poland and Belarus, England north to southern Scotland (where {{it is the}} only native maple), southwest Asia from Turkey to the Caucasus, and north Africa in the Atlas Mountains. In many areas, the original native range is obscured by widespread planting and introductions. In North America it is known as hedge maple and in Australia, it is sometimes called <b>common</b> <b>maple.</b> In Nottinghamshire, England it was known locally as dog oak.|$|E

Maple wood (Acer Pseudoplatanus) for musical instruments is used to getting back plates and sides for string instruments (violin family). This species of wood is valued for both acoustic qualities but mostly for aesthetic, using a natural defect of maple wood characterized by wavy grain. The paper presents the research on visco-elasticity behavior of maple wood with different types of grain deviation in wood from very curly maple to <b>common</b> <b>maple.</b> The storage modulus, loss modulus, damping capacity in varying temperature conditions and for different loading frequencies were determined using dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA).

30|$|To {{identify}} the likely response {{of a single}} species to regional environmental changes, {{the first step is}} to determine its distribution and current status. This addresses concerns about forest biodiversity stability and functional resilience on New England landscapes in the future. Two of the most <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> species in New England were selected for the purpose, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum). The species abundance (SppA) and importance value (IV) of the two species were calculated for the latitudinal bands (Eqs.  8 and 9).|$|E
30|$|Tree species {{diversity}} increases {{from the north}} to the south at a rate about 2 – 3 species per latitudinal degree. Tree {{species diversity}} is better predicted by tree height than forest age or biomass. Very different distribution patterns of two <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum), highlight the vulnerability of sugar maple and its potential replacement by red maple on New England landscapes. Red maple generally already outperforms sugar maple, and will likely and continuously benefit from a changing climate in New England.|$|E

30|$|We {{chose the}} two most <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> species in New England, sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and red maple (Acer rubrum), to assess their current status, looking for {{approaches}} that could detect species responses to changing environments. Sugar maple is one of most important ecological and economic tree species in New England. It {{has the ability to}} extract water from deep to surface soils, which can benefit other tree species. Concerns about sugar maple decline with crown dieback, reduced growth rate, increased mortality and failed regeneration across much of its range (Bishop et al. 2015) have triggered many studies searching for causes (Houston 1999; Horsley et al. 2000; Hufkens et al. 2012; Halman et al. 2013; Bishop et al. 2015; Bal et al. 2017). Multiple factors likely contribute, including insect defoliation, summer drought, warmer winters, and anthropogenic acidic inputs in the last decades. These have likely combined to make sugar maple less healthy and vulnerable to root diseases, nonnative earthworms, or suppression by other local tree species that are more tolerable to stressors (Houston 1999; Long et al. 2009; Hufkens et al. 2012; Halman et al. 2013; Bishop et al. 2015; Bal et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Background: Atypical {{myopathy}} (AM) in horses {{is caused}} by the plant toxin hypoglycin A, which in Europe typically is found in the sycamore maple tree (Acer pseudoplatanus). Owners are concerned about whether their horses are in danger if they graze near maple trees. Hypothesis/Objectives: To measure hypoglycin A in the most <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> tree species in the Netherlands, and to determine whether concentration of toxin is a predictor of AM in horses. Methods: A total of 278 samples of maple tree leaves, sprouts, and seeds were classified by species. Mean concentrations of hypoglycin A were compared for the type of sample, the season and the occurrence of AM in the pasture (non-AM versus AM). Statistical analysis was performed using generalized a linear model (SPPS 22). Results: Almost all Acer pseudoplatanus samples contained hypoglycin A, with concentrations differing significantly among sources (P <. 001). Concentrations were significantly higher in seeds from the AM group than in seeds from the non-AM group (856 ± 677 and 456 ± 358 mg/kg, respectively; P =. 039). In sprouts and leaves this was not the case. Acer platanoides and Acer campestre samples did not contain detectable concentrations of hypoglycin A. Conclusions and clinical importance: Acer platanoides and campestre seem to be safe around paddocks and pastures, whereas almost all Acer pseudoplatanus samples contained hypoglycin A. In all AM cases, Acer pseudoplatanus was found. Despite significantly higher concentration of hypoglycin A in seeds of pastures where AM has occurred, individual prediction of AM cannot be made by measuring these concentrations because of the high standard deviation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Unusually {{high levels}} of dieback have {{recently}} been reported in sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marsh., in Upper Michigan, and a network of plots was established {{to determine the extent}} and factors associated with the dieback. A possible contributor to this dieback is sapstreak disease caused by Ceratocystis virescens (Davidson) Moreau. Unhealthy trees with considerable crown dieback were evaluated across the western Upper Peninsula, MI to determine the prevalence of the sapstreak fungus using a minimally destructive sampling technique. Approximately 8 % of 90 trees sampled were sapstreak positive and approximately 10 % of trees were positive at one site that had recently been harvested. While the {{high levels of}} maple dieback present in these forests appear not to be directly caused by widespread sapstreak disease, the occurrence of sapstreak may be significantly impacting trees at some locations. However, even when present on a low number of trees, the biointeraction of sapstreak and decay rates from other fungi could be important for future tree mortality and value to the forest industry. Therefore, the effect of two sapstreak fungal isolates on the amount of decay caused by two <b>common</b> <b>maple</b> white rot fungi, Trametes versicolor (L. :Fr.) Pilat. And Irpex lacteus (Fr. :Fr.) Fr. was tested in the laboratory. Sugar maple wood blocks were precolonized by two native isolates of C. virescens followed by inoculation and incubation with decay fungi. Mean percent weight loss of blocks by white rot decay fungi ranged from 39 % to 55 %, but decay rates were not significantly affected by the presence of the sapstreak fungus. </p...|$|E
