Sodišče Evropske unije je v tej zadevi povzelo najpomembnejša pravila razlage pojma »civilna in gospodarska zadeva« ter se prvič ukvarjalo s pojmom »sodišče«, v zvezi s katerim je postavilo pomembne smernice pri odločanju ali se organ šteje za »sodišče« v smislu Uredbe št. 1215 / 2012. Eno izmed pomembnejših načel razlage Uredbe št. 1215 / 2012 je načelo avtonomnosti, kar pomeni, da so za opredelitev pojmov odločilna splošna pravna načela in cilji, ki jih je mogoče izpeljati iz pravil prava EU, hkrati pa je potrebno te pojme razlagati s sklicevanjem na cilje in ureditev uredbe. V skladu s tem je Sodišče Evropske unije v zadevi Pula Parking odločilo, da je potrebno za ugotovitev ali gre za civilno in gospodarsko zadevo, preučiti pravno razmerje med strankama spora ter podlago in pravila za uveljavljanje vloženega pravnega sredstva. Glede pojma »sodišče« je Sodišče Evropske unije odločilo, da se v skladu s ciljem uredbe, ki je olajševanje dostopa do sodnega varstva, za sodišče v smislu uredbe štejejo organi, ki so v nacionalnih predpisih držav članic opredeljeni kot sodišče in pa organa, ki jih uredba natančno določa. My thesis {{deals with}} {{individual}} {{rules of the}} Regulation no. 1215 / 2012 of the European parliament and the council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgements in <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>commercial</b> matters. These rules are decisive for understanding {{the decision of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union in the case Pula Parking. In this case the Court of Justice of the European Union summarized the most important rules concerning interpretation of “civil <b>and</b> <b>commercial</b> matters” <b>and</b> for the first time dealt with meaning of the “court”. The Court of Justice of the European Union provided important guidance in deciding whether the body is considered a court within the meaning of the Regulation no. 1215 / 2012. One of the most important principles of interpretation of Regulation no. 1215 / 2012 is the necessity of autonomous interpretation, which means that the concepts used in Regulation no. 1215 / 2012 must be interpreted by reference, first, to the general principles and objectives of European law and, second, to the objectives and scheme of the Regulation no. 1215 / 2012. Accordingly, in the case Pula Parking the Court of Justice of the European Union decided {{that it is necessary to}} identify the legal relationship between the parties to the dispute and to examine the basis and the rules governing the bringing of the action to determine whether the matter is <b>civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>commercial.</b> The <b>Court</b> of Justice of the European Union decided that one of the main objectives of Regulation is facilitating access to justice. In accordance with this objective, bodies which are defined as courts by national rules and bodies that are determined as courts by the regulation, are considered as courts within the meaning of the Regulation no. 1215 / 2012...|$|R

That ID card also serves as voter’s registration card [...] The officers seized her birth certificate and refused to issue her the requested document. The reason given for the rejection was that she had Haitian surnames. She appealed before the <b>Civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Court</b> of the First Instance of the Judicial District of Monte Plata. She was rejected. The court justified rejecting her appeal on the basis that she did not supply the original version of her birth certificate but provided photocopies instead.

40|$|The Rt Hon The Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers KG PC, President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ambition and excellence. Those {{two words}} epitomize Qatar. Under the {{leadership}} of his Highness the Emir, this small State has {{set out to make}} an impact on the world that belies its size. Ambitious was the plan to have an international broadcasting station. Ambitious was the plan to build from scratch a Museum of Islamic Art. Ambitious was the bid – the successful bid to host the World Cup in 2022. Ambitious is the bid to stage the Olympic Games in 2020. Qatar not merely has ambitions, it realizes its ambitions. And when it does so {{it is not enough to}} say that the result is ‘world class’, for Qatar sets out to be a world leader in whatever it puts its hand to. Excellence is the norm. Al Jazeera has established itself as the broadcasting station of choice for many throughout the world. The Doha Museum of Islamic Art is recognized as being second to none. In addition, the scale and standard of development in Doha itself is setting new standards of excellence in the fields of architecture and civil engineering. Thus when Qatar focuses its energies on education and the law, high achievements are expected. I shall have the honour of helping to achieve those expectations when I succeed Lord Woolf as President of Qatar’s new and impressive <b>Civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Court.</b> The College of Law at Qatar University is already achieving excellence in the field of legal education. So, naturally, all expect great things of this new International Review of Law and I am delighted to have been invited to welcome it by this foreword. The range of the first edition is both international and topical. Those countries that have experienced the turbulence of the Arab Spring are settling new constitutions, and other countries are bent on constitutional reform designed to avoid such turbulence. So an erudite article on constitution-making could not come at a better time. For a country about to embark on a $ 200 billion construction program, an article on identifying and managing risk in international construction projects is tailor made. Cross-border sales and the corporate opportunity doctrine are two further topics that will be of interest to a wide range of commercial lawyers. All these are weighty articles of obvious contemporary relevance. For those who seek a little light relief, Carol Tan’s article on Colonial Cleansing is a delightful and fascinating historical excursion into the efforts of British colonial rule to clean up a holiday resort in the leased territory of Weihaiwei in China. The College of Law’s new project is ambitious and this is a splendid start to the excellence that must be its aim...|$|E
40|$|I am {{delighted to}} be invited to attend upon this launch of the International Review of Law, {{conceived}} and now delivered into the world by the College of Law of the University of Qatar under Dr. Jon Truby’s leadership. This new and most welcome contribution to global academic writing and contemporary legal criticism, should be of the greatest interest outside Qatar, if only for its provenance. The State of Qatar has become widely known and respected for its vision, its progressive outlook, and its determination to look beyond Arab culture and traditions for new ways of working {{with the rest of the}} world for the good of the region as a whole. It has made a bold commitment to engage with the accepted legal principles and processes that have served the needs of global mercantile and commercial activity so well over the last two centuries. his is demonstrated by the generous support given by His Highness the Emir to the Qatar Law Forum 2009, to be repeated in May this year, in which jurists and lawyers of great eminence are brought together in Doha to expound, explain and exchange ideas upon the importance of the rule of law, the universal key to principled and effective government, and the protection of individual freedom and dignity. One may also cite the recently established <b>Civil</b> <b>and</b> <b>Commercial</b> <b>Court,</b> served by appointed judges of international repute from many jurisdictions, that has opened its doors in Doha for dispute resolution and adjudication. I am privileged to chair the Regulatory Tribunal, an independent statuy body composed of lawyers from overseas with specialist experience in market regulation, to which incoming investors can appeal any disputes they make with Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) Institutions such as the QFC Regulatory Authority and QFC Authority In the same way, the founding of Qatar University College of Law in 2006 has shown Qatar’s determination to train future generations of Qataris to build on the best of legal precedents and thought in a unique legal market in which ideas drawn from Islamic law, civil law and common law can intermingle and blend. It is not surprising therefore to see that this new publication will be dedicated to the subject of international law, both public and private. Its laudable aim is to promote legal discourse around the world, and to promote a wider international understanding of contemporary legal issues for the common benefit. As an open access, bilingual journal, addressing topics concerning any jurisdiction, I hope it will reach a wide audience, and fulfil its aim of promoting understanding between different cultures. I am sure that the journal will not only benefit Qatar’s legal community by advancing academic and practice-based legal discussion. I am also confident that it will stimulate thought in the global legal community at large. May I wish it every success and a long life. Michael Thomas CMG Q...|$|E
