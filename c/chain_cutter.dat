50|$|Mining in Portland is done {{by using}} a room and pillar method. The mine is {{advanced}} by extracting the stone using an abrasive tool <b>chain</b> <b>cutter</b> mounted on a machine. Slots are cut into the top, bottom, sides and middle of the stone. A flat steel pillow is inserted into the middle cut and slowly inflated with water. The stones are gently broken off at the back without placing any stress on the resulting blocks. The method of extraction is significantly more expensive than blasting, but results in a higher yield thereby saving valuable reserves for future generations. The environmental benefits are substantial as mining significantly reduces the impact on wildlife and the local community with reduced noise and dust.|$|E

40|$|A {{comparative}} study of shoot development in deciduous trees after cleaning of railway verges was carried out during the period 1999 - 2001. The trials were located in Långsele (Västernorrland County), Garsås (Dalarna County), Herrljunga (Västra Götaland County) and Tockarp (Skåne County). The methods of cleaning compared in the study were: motor-manual cleaning with normal stump height; motor-manual cleaning with low stump height; mechanical cleaning with a <b>chain</b> <b>cutter</b> once; mechanical cleaning with <b>chain</b> <b>cutter</b> annual three times (1999, 2000, 2001) and mechanical cleaning with a blade cutter. Cleaning operations were carried out April-June, 1999 - 2001. Tree species {{included in the study}} were pubescent birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh), pendula birch (Betula pendula Roth), aspen (Populus tremula L.), goat willow (Salix caprea L.) and common alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.). Shoot density, shoot height and shoot diameter were estimated before cleaning. The effects of cleaning were evaluated by calculating annually for three years: the number of living stumps per m 2, the number of shoots per stump and the height of the shoots. The study had two objectives, namely to evaluate the biological effects of various vegetation cleaning methods and to act as a demonstration project for the Swedish Rail Authority and the Swedish Roads Authority, who commissioned the work. There were differences in stump height after cleaning using the different methods. In the four trials, stump height was 2 - 25 cm after mechanical cleaning with a <b>chain</b> <b>cutter.</b> After repeated mechanical cleaning of pubescent birch on peat soil (Herrljunga) with a <b>chain</b> <b>cutter</b> to leave 2 cm high stumps, there was a greater {{reduction in the number of}} shoots and a smaller number of living stumps compared with the other cleaning methods. The reason for this was that greater numbers of the stumps were totally destroyed or that higher placed sprouts were cut away. After repeated cleaning of clumps with several generations of stumps, there was also a tendency for the number of main stumps with sprouts to be reduced. After a single cleaning of birch, the choice of cleaning method had no effect on sprout development. The number and length of aspen suckers decreased after repeated mechanical cleaning in Långsele and a similar trend was observed in Tockarp. Grasses and herbaceous vegetation grew quickly and inhibited sucker development, particularly in Långsele. Aspen is very susceptible to fungal attack after repeated grazing and cleaning, which may explain this result. Goat willow was included in the study and was favoured in areas which had drainage water in the ditch below the railway embankment. Access on sloping embankments was often poor, which resulted in the stump height after mechanical cleaning being two to three times higher than on flat ground. In the Herrljunga trial, willow had many high placed spruts on the stump. Repeated cleaning or grazing gave rise to a bushy thicket. It could be seen in a number of sites that willow was particularly attractive to wild animals. Motor-manual cleaning with low stump height (average 8 - 18 cm) left a smaller number of uncleaned fast-growing sprouts remaining on the stump than mechanical cleaning with normal stump height (average 15 - 20 cm). It is easier to cut the main stump under a wide clump with a mechanical <b>chain</b> <b>cutter</b> than with a brush saw. The view from the track is affected by the density of the thicket (stems) and its maximum height. After three years growth in Garsås, the average height of the highest shoots per birch stump was 112 cm and the sprout (stem) density was 18. 2 sprouts per m 2. After seven years, the corresponding sprout height and density were 441 cm and 2. 9 sprouts per m 2. There were differences in height between treatments. Differences in shoot height were a result of the tree species, the site and the position in the country. Mechanical cleaning with a cutter chain thrashes the thicket apart completely. However, when the thicket is cut with a mechanical circular saw or by motor-manual cleaning, the cut brushwood can be collected. In Garsås, the production of birch biomass in track areas which were not cleared for seven years was 22 tonnes d. w. (dry weight) per ha along a kilometre of track with a 5 metre strip on each side. On the Herrljunga trial on peat soil, the total biomass production on a similar area with less dense thicket was 5. 6 tonnes d. w. per ha from six-year old sprouts of pubescent birch. The corresponding production from six-year aspen suckers was 6. 2 tonnes d. w. per ha in Långsele and 9. 7 tonnes d. w. per ha in Tockarp. The removal of the biomass probably prevented embankments being set on fire and reduced the green manure effect. There is also the advantage that the woody biomass removed can be utilised as a mulch or as a biofuel. Selective motor-manual cleaning of previously identified tree specimens was also included in the study. Two variants of selective motor-manual cleaning were tested, either sparing selected specimens or cleaning half the normal treatment area. Specimens that were spared were located at appropriate safety distances from the tracks and often had characteristic growth patterns and attractive flowering. Selective cleaning was carried out at all four sites, but was more successful in open landscape (Tockarp, Långsele) where the light allowed in helped to stimulate the undergrowth, which competed with suckers and stump sprouts from cleared trees. The effects of shoot formation and growth after different forms of repeated cleaning should be investigated further under more controlled conditions. The practicality and cost of selective mechanical cleaning should also be investigated...|$|E

40|$|Exposure to fine {{particles}} and noise {{has been linked}} to cardiovascular diseases and elevated cardiovascular mortality affecting the worldwide population. Residence and/or work in proximity to emission sources as for example road traffic leads to an elevated exposure and a higher risk for adverse health effects. Highway maintenance workers spend most of their work time in traffic and are exposed regularly to particles and noise. The aims of this thesis were to provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' mixed exposure to particles and noise and to assess cardiopulmonary short term health effects in relation to this exposure. Exposure and health data were collected in collaboration with 8 maintenance centers of the Swiss Road Maintenance Services located in the cantons Bern, Fribourg and Vaud in western Switzerland. Repeated measurements with 18 subjects were conducted during 50 non-consecutive work shifts between Mai 2010 and February 2012, equally distributed over all seasons. In the first part of this thesis we tested and validated measurements of ultra{{fine particles}} with a miniature diffusion size classifier (miniDiSC) - a novel particle counting device that was used for the exposure assessment during highway maintenance work. We found that particle numbers and average particle size measured by the miniDiSC were highly correlated with data from the P-TRAK, a condensation particle counter (CPC), as well as from a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). However, the miniDiSC measured significantly more particles than the P-TRAK and significantly less than the SMPS in its full size range. Our data suggests that the instrument specific cutoffs were the main reason for the different particle counts. The first main objective of this thesis was to investigate the exposure of highway maintenance workers to air pollutants and noise, in relation to the different maintenance activities. We have seen that the workers are regularly exposed to high particle and noise levels. This was a consequence of close proximity to highway traffic and the use of motorized working equipment such as brush <b>cutters,</b> <b>chain</b> saws, generators and pneumatic hammers during which the highest exposure levels occurred. Although exposure to air pollutants were not critical if compared to occupational exposure limits, the elevated exposure to particles and noise may lead to a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in this worker population. The second main objective was to investigate cardiopulmonary short-term health effects in relation to the particle and noise exposure during highway maintenance work. We observed a PM 2. 5 related increase of the acute-phase inflammation markers C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A and a decrease of TNFa. Heart rate variability increased as a consequence of particle as well as noise exposure. Increased high frequency power indicated a stronger parasympathetic influence on the heart. Elevated noise levels during recreational time, after work, were related to increased blood pressure. Our data confirmed that highway maintenance workers are exposed to elevated levels of particles and noise as compared to the average population. This exposure poses a cardiovascular health risk and it is therefore important to make efforts to better protect the workers health. The use of cleaner machines during maintenance work would be a major step to improve the workers' situation. Furthermore, regulatory policies with the aim of reducing combustion and non-combustion emissions from road traffic are important for the protection of workers in traffic environments and the entire population...|$|R
