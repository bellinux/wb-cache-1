40|$|ABSTRACT The {{indirect}} {{closed circuit}} calorimeter, constructed of Perspex, {{can hold a}} single fowl of up to 3 kg. or six chickens from 10 to 24 days of age. Heat production is measured {{over a period of}} 24 hr. A decrease in pressure within <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> occurs through absorption of expired CO 2 in a KOH solution. A solenoid valve is activated and O 2 flows into <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> from a cylinder holding 200 1. of O 2 which is weighed at the start and finish of a 24 hr. deter-mination of heat production. Samples of chamber air are withdrawn at the start and finish of each determination and heat production is calculated from <b>the</b> quantitative recovery <b>of</b> car-bonate and from <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> O 2 cylinder, after first correcting for any changes in <b>the</b> <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chamber</b> air that occur during the 24 hr. period of measurement. Three chickens (each weighing about 1 kg.) taken from a group of 10 cross-bred cockerels, were placed one in each of three calorimeters and given a commercial cereal-based diet. The remaining 7 cockerels were killed to give initial values <b>of</b> body <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 experimental fowl. Heat productions were measured over a period of 12 - 18 days; the 3 fowl were then killed and body composition determined. Heat production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockerels, estimated from gaseous ex-change was, on average, within 1 % of values derived from the carbon and nitrogen balances. Fasting heat productions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 fowl were 71, 72 and 71 kcal. /kg. 3 / 4 /day and net availability (%) of metabolizable energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diet was 70, 70 and 61 respectively. <b>Composition</b> <b>of</b> weight gain <b>of</b> two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockerels agreed with values estimated from carbon and nitrogen balance, but for the third cockerel nitrogen retention was much higher when estimated from nitrogen balance than from carcass analysis.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The {{temporal}} and spatial characteristics of a laser microprobe plume were investigated using <b>the</b> spectroscopic methods <b>of</b> emission, absorption and fluorescence. The plume was produced by rapid vaporization of a small quantity (1 μg) of a solid sample using a focussed pulsed dye laser (110 MW/cm²). For absorption and fluorescence experiments, a wavelength calibrated narrow band tunable dye laser {{was used as the}} excitation source. All microprobe experiments were performed with a metal sample (Al or Zr) placed in a sample <b>chamber</b> with <b>the</b> pressure and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampling atmosphere controlled. Sample chamber pressures of 25 torr to 300 torr were used. <b>The</b> chemical <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample <b>chamber</b> atmosphere was varied from pure argon to pure oxygen. Most spectroscopic observations were made on binary molecules formed by rapid reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vaporized sample material with oxygen gas. For sample chamber atmospheres rich in oxygen, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> reaction was found to be significantly greater near <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plume than that observed for the central region. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> these experiments indicate that the plume material forces the sampling atmosphere out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region into which it expands. Transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampling atmosphere back into <b>the</b> region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plume was observed to be radial in nature. Complete mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plume material with the sampling atmosphere takes more than 100 μs. Significant quantities of sample oxide (A 10 and ZrO) were also observed in sampling atmospheres containing only trace levels of oxygen. These oxides were found to be at their peak concentration near <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plume, indicating the sample itself may be a significant source of oxygen. A unique method for accurate wavelength calibration of an etalon tuned dye laser, such as the one used in the laser microprobe experiments, is also reported.
