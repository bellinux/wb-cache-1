5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle.

5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{believe that}} much of the low {{northern}} plains of the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean might have been the size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E

5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> the sky is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{evidence}} based guideline {{produced by}} the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons assigned various grades of recommendation to physiotherapy (also called physical therapy) and other nonsurgical treatments. One of the primary issues with physiotherapy is that it attempts to reverse (often) years of pathology inside the carpal tunnel. Practitioners <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> any physiotherapy such as myofascial release may take weeks of persistent application to effectively manage carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Heterosexual {{transmission}} of HIV {{is the primary}} mode of spread in Nigeria, and infections appear to be as numerous in rural areas as in the cities. In other words, HIV is endemic in the general population. The reported rate of infection apparently varies significantly by region, with the lowest reported rate found generally in the predominantly Muslim northern parts of the country. Infections are most numerous among men ages 20 through 24, but some experts <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> infection rates are rising quickly in young women.|$|E
25|$|On December 4, 2003, {{new owners}} Great South RFDC LLC cited ongoing {{technical}} {{issues related to}} new broadcast tower construction and requested {{an extension of the}} previous authority to remain silent. The extension was granted on December 11, 2003, with a <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> the station's license was subject to forfeiture if they did not resume broadcast operations by May 8, 2004—one year after the station fell silent. With another application pending and a new tower array under construction, the new owners had the FCC change the station's call letters to WSMO on May 25, 2004.|$|E

25|$|Epidemiological {{studies are}} {{underway}} to identify health effects {{associated with the}} high radiation levels in Ramsar.

However, the recent statistical analyses discussed that there is no correlation between the risk of negative health effects and elevated level of natural background radiation.|$|E
25|$|In 2013 Franchitti {{improved}} on his 2012 season. At the Indy 500, Franchitti {{was running}} in the top ten for the final restart, but got loose in turn 1 and scraped across the turn 1 wall in a similar style to Takuma Sato's 2012 accident on the final lap. This brought out a final <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> found one of Franchitti's closest friends off the track, Tony Kanaan winning his first Indy 500 and his first win in a few years. After climbing out of his car, Franchitti was led to the infield hospital. Franchitti was cleared uninjured; and he walked to victory lane to hug Kanaan just before the broadcasting ended.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the station}} {{went off the}} air once again on December 16, 2005. While silent, the station swapped callsigns with then-sister station WEZZ-FM on January 26, 2006.

The FCC granted this latest request on February 28, 2006, with an expiration date of May 28, 2006. With WEZZ-FM still off the air, Great South RFDC LLC applied for an extension on May 26, 2006.

25|$|Why We Want You to Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors <b>caution</b> <b>that</b> individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{the level}} of non-revenue water was {{estimated}} to be 32% in Sana'a, 33% in Aden, 22% in Taiz and 35% in Mukalla. This is an improvement compared to previous levels.
