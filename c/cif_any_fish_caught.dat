5000|$|The lagoon is too salty {{to support}} marine life, but fish are {{abundant}} around the fringing reef and offshore waters. H.E. Maude, in his 1937 report: Colonization of the Phoenix Islands, indicated that {{visitors to the}} island refused to eat <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> there because of ciguatera poisoning. Bryan, on the other hand, insisted that the reef contains other fish species that made [...] "excellent eating".|$|R
40|$|The present Galata Bridge {{was built}} in 1992, {{replacing}} a 19 th-century pontoon bridge. Like its predecessor, it houses cafés and restaurants on the lower level, acknowledging its function as a social space. Fishing off the Galata Bridge is a newer tradition in Istanbul. People eagerly went fishing there even {{in the days when}} water pollution was at its worst. Still today <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> here are probably dangerous to eat...|$|R
50|$|Tidal fish traps must {{be located}} close to {{settlements}} or camps {{so that they}} can be monitored. Because as the tide ebbs, <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> in the shallows fall easy prey to scavenging seabirds. The Freestone Cove traps are located a considerable distance from the nearest early European settlement of Alexandria, but were close to known Aboriginal campsites and several middens have been located along the shoreline nearby.|$|R
25|$|Fishing {{is allowed}} in the river, {{although}} the state Department of Health recommends eating no <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> from the South Glens Falls Dam to the Federal Dam at Troy. Women under 50 and children under 15 are not advised to eat <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> south of the Palmer Falls Dam in Corinth, while others are advised to eat anywhere from one to four meals per month of Hudson River fish, depending on species and location caught. The Department of Health cites mercury, PCBs, dioxin, and cadmium as the chemicals impacting fish in these areas.|$|R
50|$|In 2000 a 76-year-old {{pensioner}} using {{a fishing}} rod {{for the first}} time landed the largest tuna caught off the British Isles for nearly 50 years. Off the north-west coast of Ireland Alan Glanville caught a 353 lb fish and next day caught one of 529 lb. In 2001 a 968 lb bluefin tuna was caught off the Irish coast at Donegal - a European record for <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> on rod and line.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the line}} is set, the angler need only check the line {{periodically}} throughout the day to see if <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> have been <b>caught.</b> While checking the line, one can also replace bait, untangle drop lines, and retrieve <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> on the line. Care is needed when checking or setting the line {{to make sure that}} no one is accidentally hooked in any part of the process.|$|R
5000|$|The {{forerunners}} {{of pleasure}} punts, fishing punts, usually had an additional compartment, called a [...] "well," [...] which extended across {{the width of}} the punt a little way in front of the till. This compartment was made water-tight, and had holes in the bottom or sides so that it could be flooded with water. It was used for keeping <b>any</b> <b>caught</b> <b>fish.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1926, as {{the tension}} {{continued}} at home, Snow decided to escape by joining a fishing schooner {{where he served}} as a [...] "flunky" [...] or cabin boy. The job did not pay any wages. Snow, however, was allowed to cut out cod tongues and sell them later along with <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> he <b>caught</b> from the deck. After one trip, he sold his tongues and fish for around $58 and feeling rich, he ordered a guitar and chord book for $5.95 from the T. Eaton mail-order catalogue. In 1927 or 1928, Snow remembers hearing radio broadcasts while at sea. The one-hour broadcasts featured recordings by such country artists as Vernon Dalhart and Carson Robison. [...] "I still remember Dalhart singing 'The Prisoner's Song,' and 'The Wreck of the Old 97,'" [...] Snow recalls. [...] "These songs gave me a great lift." [...] He adds that he tried to sing the songs exactly as the artists had, entertaining his fellow crew members by singing and dancing while accompanying himself on a mouth organ.|$|R

5000|$|Check local {{advisories}} {{about the}} safety of <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but don't consume <b>any</b> other <b>fish</b> during that week.|$|R
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> which is <b>caught</b> outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 the law will be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|R

50|$|Bait {{fish are}} small <b>fish</b> <b>caught</b> {{for use as}} bait to attract large predatory fish, {{particularly}} game fish. Species used are typically those that are common and breed rapidly, making them easy to catch and in regular supply. Examples of marine bait fish are anchovies, gudgeon, halfbeaks such as ballyhoo, and scad. Some larger fish such as menhaden, flying fish, or ladyfish may be considered bait fish in some circles, {{depending on the size}} of the gamefish being pursued.Freshwater bait <b>fish</b> include <b>any</b> <b>fish</b> of the minnow or carp family (Cyprinidae), sucker family (Catostomidae), top minnows or killifish family (Cyprinodontidae), shad family (Clupeidae), sculpin of the order Osteichthyes and sunfish family (Centrarchidae), excluding black basses and crappies.|$|R
