The purpose of the deal was to move Dow Chemical further into specialty chemicals, which offer higher profit margins than the <b>commodities</b> <b>market</b> and {{are more difficult to}} enter for the competition. The purchase has been criticized by many on Wall Street who believe Dow Chemical overpaid (about a 75 percent premium on the previous day's market capital) to acquire the company; however, the high bid was needed to ward off competing bids from BASF.

40|$|Purpose: Analysis of reasons, {{correlations}} {{and consequences}} following {{from the impact}} that financial investors have on <b>commodity</b> <b>markets</b> – {{both before and after}} the crisis. Methodology: The research on the tremendous impact that the financial sector exerts on price formation in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> defined as the financialization of <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> was based on a narrative approach. This approach makes use of available historical documents and attempts to reconstruct factors causing structural changes in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets.</b> As a result of these factors, <b>commodity</b> and financial <b>markets</b> (and particularly capital market) have become similar to a great extent. Findings: Drawing upon the research, it can be stated that the global financial crisis has contributed not only to a major change in the involvement of investors in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets,</b> but also to a structural change of this involvement, which is accompanied by a number of negative consequences. Originality: The research enables to draw certain conclusions, e. g. that the financialization of <b>commodity</b> <b>markets</b> is reflected in a radical price fluctuation in these markets due to which the prices are isolated from fair value. Structural changes are also discussed. They entail the attempt to counteract such negative consequences, e. g. regulations imposed to provide a greater transparency of the activity undertaken by investors in <b>commodity</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R

25|$|Goldman Sachs' {{entry into}} the <b>commodities</b> <b>market</b> via the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has been implicated by some in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman accused Goldman Sachs of {{profiting}} while many people went hungry or even starved. He argued that Goldman's large purchases of long-options on wheat futures created a demand shock in the wheat market, which disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand and price levels. He argues that {{the result was a}} 'contango' wheat market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caused prices of wheat to rise much higher than normal, defeating the purpose of the exchanges (price stabilization) in the first place. however, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – using data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – showed tracking funds (of which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was one) did not cause the bubble. For example, the report points out that even commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period. Some commodities without futures markets saw their prices rise {{as a consequence of the}} rising prices of commodities with futures markets: the World Development Movement states there is strong evidence that the rising price of wheat caused the price of rice to subsequently rise as well.|$|E
