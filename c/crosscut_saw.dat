Tradesmen at this time mostly supplied their own tools, so a shipyard needed {{little more than a}} waterfront property large enough to hold a timber yard and a slipway or two, a derrick to lift heavy components, a large <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> and a few other tools.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, {{a letter}} to the editor of the Register asking about the origin of the name Waterloo Bay sparked a lively {{exchange}} between a Register journalist and west coast local Archie Beviss and others. According to Foster et al., Beviss was relying on local hearsay about the massacre, and he is now associated with the [...] "most bloodthirsty versions of the legend". Beviss claimed to have been told about the massacre by several people, including Hamp's son, as well as James Geharty, one of the police officers involved in investigating the murders. Beviss stated that Hamp's son was a 16-year-old shepherd at the time of his father's murder, and that he had found his father's head in a camp oven, having been cut off with a <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw.</b> According to Beviss, after the murder of Easton, Geharty urged the government to take action, and after approval was given, a force of 160 men was raised. The force then drove about 260 Aboriginal people over the cliffs. Finally, Beviss stated that Geharty named Waterloo Bay after the massacre. Foster et al. have identified several inconsistencies in Beviss' account. Firstly, Geharty did not name Waterloo Bay. Beviss named Easton's husband as being involved in the drive against the Aboriginal people, but James Easton went to Adelaide after his wife's murder and never returned. There is also no evidence that the government sanctioned the raising of a force. Finally, if 160 men participated in the drive, the authors question why no first-hand accounts of the massacre exist.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> {{have been}} in use around the world since {{historic}} times, with {{the design of the}} saws (the cutting surfaces, the bow and shape of the saw, and the handles) changing over time to accommodate differences in the types of trees being cut, changes in metallurgy technology, and the application of experience. Records exist of <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> in use during the Roman Empire although not widely. [...] They came into wide usage in Europe {{in the middle of the}} 15th century. Early saws had a plain tooth pattern until the M tooth pattern was developed in 15th century south Germany. Prior to about 1880 <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> were primarily used for bucking, with axes used to fell trees. Starting in Pennsylvania about 1880, loggers began using the saws for felling trees as well. Despite the modern chainsaw, they are still in wide use around the world, not only in competition matches against chainsaws but also in regular, real-life usage since they afford certain advantages over gasoline-powered saws.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{maintenance}} {{carried out}} on <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> is sharpening, which requires a shop and a highly skilled filer. The primary maintenance on chainsaws is engine tuning, chain tensioning, and chain replacement.|$|R
50|$|Many <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> have {{a wooden}} handle {{with the return}} edge {{at right angles to}} the un-toothed edge of the saw blade, {{allowing}} the saw to serve as a square for marking material to be cut at a right angle.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{his return}} to the house, he went around on the valley side, so as to see the place by light of day.

60|$|Riding {{along with}} busy mind, Jean almost crossed a well-beaten trail, leading through a pine thicket and {{down over the}} Rim. Jean's pack mule led the way without being driven. And when Jean reached {{the edge of the}} bluff one look down was enough to fetch him off his horse. That trail was steep, narrow, clogged with stones, and as full of sharp corners as a <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw.</b> Once on the descent with a packed mule and a {{spirited}} horse, Jean had no time for mind wanderings and very little for occasional glimpses out over the cedar tops to the vast blue hollow asleep under a westering sun.|$|E

5000|$|Two-man saws {{were known}} to the ancient Romans, but first became common in Europe in the mid-15th century. In America, <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> were used {{as early as the}} mid-17th century, but felling saws only began to replace axes for felling trees in the late 19th century.|$|R
25|$|In the United States Forest Service {{the use of}} {{chainsaws}} and <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> requires training and certification.

60|$|Then {{the boys}} sawed off {{half a dozen}} four-foot sections, which served as fine, solid, flat tables for comfort around camp. The method of using a <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> was for two men {{to take a stand}} {{opposite}} one another, with the log between. The handles of the saw stood upright. Each man should pull easily and steadily toward himself, but should not push back nor bear down. It looked a rhythmic, manly exercise, and not arduous. But what an illusion! Nielsen and Copple were the only ones that day who could saw wholly through the thick log without resting. Later Takahashi turned out to be as good, if not better, than either of them, but we had that, as well as many other wonderful facts, to learn about the Jap.|$|E
60|$|The men set to work, two {{or three}} of them running {{recklessly}} along the rounded top of the slippery trunk, which rolled a little as it hammered upon the rock. Mattawa, with a big <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw,</b> crouched on the half-submerged pile of stone, and a comrade, who seized its opposite handle, held himself somehow on the second trunk by his knees. It was difficult to understand how they could work at all, but they were accustomed to toiling under embarrassing conditions. The saw had hardly bitten through the bark when another log drove grinding against the rest, and Mattawa's companion, who let the handle go, fell forward on his face. He was up again in a moment, and after that stuck fast while log after log drove smashing upon the growing mass. Sometimes the one he clung to rose up under him, and sometimes it sank until he crouched in the water while another great butt crept up upon it, and it seemed that he must be crushed between them. Still, the saw rasped steadily through the heaving, grinding timber. It was perilous work, but it was clear to all of them {{that it had to be}} done.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a week}} later, and a hot afternoon, when Muller {{laid the}} big <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> down on the log he was {{severing}} and slowly straightened his back. Then he stood up, red and very damp in face, a burly, square-shouldered man, and, having mislaid his spectacles, blinked about him. On three sides of him the prairie, swelling in billowy rises, {{ran back to the}} horizon; but on the fourth a dusky wall of foliage followed the crest of a ravine, and the murmur of water came up faintly from the creek in the hollow. Between himself and its slender birches lay piled amidst the parched and dusty grass, and the first courses of a wooden building, rank with the smell of sappy timber, already stood in front of him. There was no notch in the framing that had not been made and pinned with an exact precision. In its scanty shadow his daughter sat knitting beside a smouldering fire over which somebody had suspended a big blackened kettle. The crash of the last falling trunk had died away, and there was silence in the bluff; but a drumming of hoofs rose in a sharp staccato from the prairie.|$|E
50|$|For {{dead trees}} which are {{considered}} too hazardous to remove utilizing <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> or chainsaws, {{one or two}} wraps of Tovex {{around the base of}} the trunk is often enough to fell the tree safely so that the remains may be safely bucked and removed from hiking trails, parks, or other places where people recreate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> {{are used}} within Designated Wildernesses where {{chainsaws}} are banned {{due to the}} prohibited use of motorized or mechanized tools and equipment, requiring that crosscut training also include {{the proper use of}} non-petroleum based lubricants as well as training in techniques which leave a minimal impact both ecologically as well as visually after trails are cleared of downed trees.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{over the}} past 250 years the use of <b>crosscut</b> <b>saws</b> in the many forests of the United States lacked the use of safety {{clothing}} and equipment. However, safety training in contemporary usage in the United States dictates the mandatory use of gloves, eye protectors, chainsaw boots with hard tops and high-top ankle protectors, Kevlar chaps, and long sleeved shirts.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{and one of}} {{his comrades}} took up a big <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw,</b> while the other swung a gleaming axe. Nasmyth walked back wearily through the silent Bush towards the camp. His back ached, his head ached, and he felt a trifle dazed. The {{strength}} seemed to have gone out of him, and he fancied that he was not very far from a physical collapse. He was glad when he reached the shanty, where, after he had shaken the snow from his dilapidated boots, he sat down by the glowing stove, and smiled wryly as he looked about him. The shed was rudely built of logs, and a row of bunks packed with swamp-grass and spruce-twigs, from some of which there hung portions of greasy blankets, ran down one side of it. It smelt horribly of acrid tobacco and cookery, but at least, it was warm, which counted for much, and, during the last few months, Nasmyth had grown to look on it as home. He knew, also, that it would cost him something to leave it now, especially as he had nowhere else to go.|$|E
60|$|Pride goes {{before a}} fall! I {{knew that in}} my {{condition}} I could do little with the saw, but I had to try. R.C. was still fresh when I had to rest. Perhaps no one except myself realized the weakness of my back, {{but the truth was}} a couple of dozen pulls on that saw almost made me collapse. Wherefore I grew furious with myself and swore I would do it or die. I sawed till I fell over--then I rested and went back at it. Half an hour of this kind of exercise gave me a stab in my left side infinitely sharper than the pain in my back. Also it made me wringing wet, hot as fire, and as breathless as if I had run a mile up hill. That experience determined me to stick to crosscut sawing every day. Next morning I approached it with enthusiasm, yet with misgivings. I could not keep my breath. Pain I could and did bear without letting on. But to have to stop was humiliating. If I tried {{to keep up with the}} sturdy Haught boys, or with the brawny Copple or the giant Nielsen, soon I would be compelled to keel over. In the sawing through a four-foot section of log I had to rest eight times. They all had a great deal of fun out of it, and I pretended to be good natured, but to me who had always been so vigorous and active and enduring it was not fun. It was tragic. But all was not gloom for me. This very afternoon Nielsen, the giant, showed that a stiff climb out of the canyon, at that eight thousand feet altitude, completely floored him. Yet I accomplished that with comparative ease. I could climb, which seemed proof that I was gaining. A man becomes used to certain labors and exercises. I thought the <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> a wonderful tool to train a man, but it must require time. It harked back to pioneer days when men were men. Nielsen said he had lived among Mexican boys who sawed logs for nineteen cents apiece and earned seven dollars a day. Copple said three minutes was good time to saw a four-foot log in two pieces. So much for physical condition! As for firewood, for which our <b>crosscut</b> <b>saw</b> was intended, pitch pine and yellow pine and spruce were all odorous and inflammable woods, but they did not make good firewood. Dead aspen was good; dead oak the best. It burned to red hot coals with little smoke. As for camp-fires, any kind of dry wood pleased, smoke or no smoke. In fact I loved the smell and color of wood-smoke, in spite of the fact that it made my eyes smart.|$|E
