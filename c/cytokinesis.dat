5|$|Most sexually {{reproducing}} {{organisms are}} diploid, with paired chromosomes, but doubling of their chromosome number may occur due to errors in <b>cytokinesis.</b> This can occur early in development {{to produce an}} autopolyploid or partly autopolyploid organism, or during normal processes of cellular differentiation to produce some cell types that are polyploid (endopolyploidy), or during gamete formation. An allopolyploid plant may result from a hybridisation event between two different species. Both autopolyploid and allopolyploid plants can often reproduce normally, but {{may be unable to}} cross-breed successfully with the parent population because there is a mismatch in chromosome numbers. These plants that are reproductively isolated from the parent species but live within the same geographical area, may be sufficiently successful to form a new species. Some otherwise sterile plant polyploids can still reproduce vegetatively or by seed apomixis, forming clonal populations of identical individuals. Durum wheat is a fertile tetraploid allopolyploid, while bread wheat is a fertile hexaploid. The commercial banana {{is an example of a}} sterile, seedless triploid hybrid. Common dandelion is a triploid that produces viable seeds by apomictic seed.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane to sites within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of <b>cytokinesis,</b> after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E
25|$|Interphase {{proceeds}} {{in three}} stages, G1, S, and G2, {{followed by the}} cycle of mitosis and <b>cytokinesis.</b> The cell's nuclear DNA contents are duplicated during S phase.|$|E
25|$|Cytoplasmic dynein {{positions}} {{the spindle}} {{at the site}} of <b>cytokinesis</b> by anchoring to the cell cortex and pulling on astral microtubules emanating from centrosome. Budding yeast have been a powerful model organism to study this process and has shown that dynein is targeted to plus ends of astral microtubules and delivered to the cell cortex via an offloading mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytoskeleton}} acts {{to organize}} and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during endocytosis, the uptake of external materials by a cell, and <b>cytokinesis,</b> the separation of daughter cells after cell division; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments, intermediate filaments and microtubules. There are {{a great number of}} proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments. The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, polarity and <b>cytokinesis.</b> The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called actin. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called tubulin. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include vimentin, desmin, lamin (lamins A, B and C), keratin (multiple acidic and basic keratins), neurofilament proteins (NF - L, NF - M).|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called microsporogenesis, four haploid microspores are {{produced}} from each diploid sporogenous cell (microsporocyte, pollen mother cell or meiocyte), after meiotic division. After {{the formation of the}} four microspores, which are contained by callose walls, the development of the pollen grain walls begins. The callose wall is broken down by an enzyme called callase and the freed pollen grains grow in size and develop their characteristic shape and form a resistant outer wall called the exine and an inner wall called the intine. The exine is what is preserved in the fossil record. Two basic types of microsporogenesis are recognised, simultaneous and successive. In simultaneous microsporogenesis meiotic steps I and II are completed prior to <b>cytokinesis,</b> whereas in successive microsporogenesis <b>cytokinesis</b> follows. While there may be a continuum with intermediate forms, the type of microsporogenesis has systematic significance. The predominant form amongst the monocots is successive, but there are important exceptions.|$|E
25|$|Actin’s {{cytoskeleton}} {{is key to}} {{the processes}} of endocytosis, <b>cytokinesis,</b> determination of cell polarity and morphogenesis in yeasts. In addition to relying on actin these processes involve 20 or 30 associated proteins, which all have a high degree of evolutionary conservation, along with many signalling molecules. Together these elements allow a spatially and temporally modulated assembly that defines a cell’s response to both internal and external stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Mitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, {{which are}} {{synthesized}} but inactivated during S and G2 phases, promote {{the initiation of}} mitosis by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and mitotic spindle assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a ubiquitin ligase known as the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal kinetochore. APC also targets the mitotic cyclins for degradation, ensuring that telophase and <b>cytokinesis</b> can proceed.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} mitosis {{is complex and}} highly regulated. The {{sequence}} of events is divided into phases, corresponding to the completion of one set of activities {{and the start of}} the next. These stages are prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase. During the process of mitosis the pairs of chromosomes condense and attach to fibers that pull the sister chromatids to opposite sides of the cell. The cell then divides in <b>cytokinesis,</b> to produce two identical daughter cells.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{division}} {{involves a}} single cell (called a mother cell) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue) and to procreation (vegetative reproduction) in unicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells usually undergo {{a process of}} nuclear division, called mitosis, followed by division of the cell, called <b>cytokinesis.</b> A diploid cell may also undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells, usually four. Haploid cells serve as gametes in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{cell cycle}} {{consists}} of four distinct phases: G1 phase, S phase (synthesis), G2 phase (collectively known as interphase) and M phase (mitosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's chromosomes are divided, and <b>cytokinesis,</b> in which the cell's cytoplasm divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase {{is dependent on the}} proper progression and completion of the previous one. Cells that have temporarily or reversibly stopped dividing are said to have entered a state of quiescence called G0 phase.|$|E
25|$|Actin {{participates in}} many {{important}} cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and <b>cytokinesis,</b> vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, {{and the establishment}} and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape. Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes. In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified. The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility. It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments.|$|E
25|$|The {{middle lamella}} is laid down first, formed from the cell plate during <b>cytokinesis,</b> {{and the primary}} cell wall is then {{deposited}} inside the middle lamella. The actual structure of the cell wall is not clearly defined and several models exist - the covalently linked cross model, the tether model, the diffuse layer model and the stratified layer model. However, the primary cell wall, {{can be defined as}} composed of cellulose microfibrils aligned at all angles. Cellulose microfibrils are produced at the plasma membrane by the cellulose synthase complex, which is proposed to be made of a hexameric rosette that contains three cellulose synthase catalytic subunits for each of the six units. Microfibrils are held together by hydrogen bonds to provide a high tensile strength. The cells are held together and share the gelatinous membrane called the middle lamella, which contains magnesium and calcium pectates (salts of pectic acid). Cells interact though plasmodesmata, which are inter-connecting channels of cytoplasm that connect to the protoplasts of adjacent cells across the cell wall.|$|E
500|$|In {{interphase}} cells, {{the majority}} of NEDD9 localizes to focal adhesions. [...] However, some of the protein is also cytoplasmic, and small pools localize to the centrosome [...] and the basal body of cilia. At mitotic entry NEDD9 moves along mitotic spindle, eventually localizing at midbody at <b>cytokinesis.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{complex is}} found in {{cellular}} regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity: in macropinocytic cups, in {{the leading edge of}} motile cells (lamellipodia), and in motile actin patches in yeast. In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum [...] it is required for phagocytosis. The complex has also been shown {{to be involved in the}} establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound-healing model. In mammalian oocytes, the Arp2/3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission, which result from the failure of spindle migration (a unique feature of oocyte division) and <b>cytokinesis.</b> Moreover, enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2/3 complex for actin-polymerization- dependent rocketing movements. The Arp2/3 complex also regulates the intracellular motility [...] of endosomes, lysosomes, pinocytic vesicles, and mitochondria. Moreover, recent studies show that the Arp2/3 complex is essential for proper polar cell expansion in plants. Arp2/3 mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana result in abnormal filament organization, which in turn affects the expansion of trichomes, pavement cells, hypocotyl cells, and root hair cells.|$|E
500|$|Cytokinins are a {{class of}} plant hormones named for their control of cell {{division}} or <b>cytokinesis.</b> The natural cytokinin zeatin was discovered in corn, Zea mays, and is a derivative of the purine adenine. Zeatin is produced in roots and transported to shoots in the xylem where it promotes cell division, bud development, and the greening of chloroplasts. The gibberelins, such as Gibberelic acid are diterpenes synthesised from acetyl CoA via the mevalonate pathway. They {{are involved in the}} promotion of germination and dormancy-breaking in seeds, in regulation of plant height by controlling stem elongation and the control of flowering. Abscisic acid (ABA) occurs in all land plants except liverworts, and is synthesised from carotenoids in the chloroplasts and other plastids. It inhibits cell division, promotes seed maturation, and dormancy, and promotes stomatal closure. It was so named because it was originally thought to control abscission. Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is produced in all higher plant tissues from methionine. It is now known to be the hormone that stimulates or regulates fruit ripening and abscission, and it, or the synthetic growth regulator ethephon which is rapidly metabolised to produce ethylene, are used on industrial scale to promote ripening of cotton, pineapples and other climacteric crops.|$|E
500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient <b>cytokinesis</b> resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in tumor invasion. NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E
2500|$|Because <b>cytokinesis</b> usually {{occurs in}} {{conjunction}} with mitosis, [...] "mitosis" [...] is often used interchangeably with [...] "M phase". However, there are many cells where mitosis and <b>cytokinesis</b> occur separately, forming single cells with multiple nuclei in a process called endoreplication. This occurs most notably among the fungi and slime moulds, but is found in various groups. Even in animals, <b>cytokinesis</b> and mitosis may occur independently, for instance during certain stages of fruit fly embryonic development. Errors in mitosis can either kill a cell through apoptosis or cause mutations {{that may lead to}} cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The fourth phase, M phase, {{consists}} of nuclear division (karyokinesis) and cytoplasmic division (<b>cytokinesis),</b> {{accompanied by the}} formation of a new cell membrane. This is the physical division of [...] "mother" [...] and [...] "daughter" [...] cells. The M phase has been broken down into several distinct phases, sequentially known as prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase leading to <b>cytokinesis.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mitosis is {{immediately}} followed by <b>cytokinesis,</b> which divides the nuclei, cytoplasm, organelles and cell membrane into two cells containing roughly equal shares of these cellular components. Mitosis and <b>cytokinesis</b> together define [...] {{the division of}} the mother cell into two daughter cells, genetically identical {{to each other and to}} their parent cell. This accounts for approximately 10% of the cell cycle.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Cytokinesis.</b> Cell {{division}} in animal cells and yeasts normally involves {{the separation of}} the parent cell into two daughter cells through the constriction of the central circumference. This process involves a constricting ring composed of actin, myosin, and α-actinin. In the [...] "fission yeast” Schizosaccharomyces pombe, actin is actively formed in the constricting ring with the participation of Arp3, the formin Cdc12, profilin, and WASp, along with preformed microfilaments. Once the ring has been constructed the structure is maintained by a continual assembly and disassembly that, aided by the Arp2/3 complex and formins, is key to one of the central processes of <b>cytokinesis.</b> The totality of the contractile ring, the spindle apparatus, microtubules and the dense peripheral material is called the [...] "Fleming body» or [...] "intermediate body».|$|E
2500|$|The {{cell cycle}} or cell-{{division}} cycle is [...] {{the series of}} events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells. In bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus, the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods. The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication. [...] DNA replication occurs during the C period. [...] The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells. [...] In cells with a nucleus, as in eukaryotes, the cell cycle is also divided into three periods: interphase, the mitotic (M) phase, and <b>cytokinesis.</b> During interphase, the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis, preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA. During the mitotic phase, the chromosomes separate. During the final stage, <b>cytokinesis,</b> the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells. To ensure the proper division of the cell, there are control mechanisms known as cell cycle checkpoints.|$|E
2500|$|A {{postulated}} {{model for}} mammalian size control situates mass as {{the driving force}} of the cell cycle. [...] A cell is unable to grow to an abnormally large size because at a certain cell size or cell mass, the S phase is initiated. [...] The S phase starts the sequence of events leading to mitosis and <b>cytokinesis.</b> [...] A cell is unable to get too small because the later cell cycle events, such as S, G2, and M, are delayed until mass increases sufficiently to begin S phase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{protein kinase}} Cdr2 (which {{negatively}} regulates Wee1) and the Cdr2-related kinase Cdr1 (which directly phosphorylates and inhibits Wee1 in vitro) are localized to {{a band of}} cortical nodes {{in the middle of}} interphase cells. [...] After entry into mitosis, <b>cytokinesis</b> factors such as myosin II are recruited to similar nodes; these nodes eventually condense to form the cytokinetic ring. [...] A previously uncharacterized protein, Blt1, was found to colocalize with Cdr2 in the medial interphase nodes. [...] Blt1 knockout cells had increased length at division, which is consistent with a delay in mitotic entry. [...] This finding connects a physical location, a band of cortical nodes, with factors that have been shown to directly regulate mitotic entry, namely Cdr1, Cdr2, and Blt1.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contractile}} bundles, the actin-bundling protein alpha-actinin separates each thin filament by ~35nm. This {{increase in}} distance allows thick filaments {{to fit in}} between and interact, enabling deformation or contraction. In deformation, one end of myosin is bound to the plasma membrane, while the other end [...] "walks" [...] toward the plus end of the actin filament. This pulls the membrane into a different shape relative to the cell cortex. For contraction, the myosin molecule is usually bound to two separate filaments and both ends simultaneously [...] "walk" [...] toward their filament's plus end, sliding the actin filaments closer to each other. This results in the shortening, or contraction, of the actin bundle (but not the filament). This mechanism is responsible for muscle contraction and <b>cytokinesis,</b> the division of one cell into two.|$|E
2500|$|Cell {{division}} {{is more complex}} in eukaryotes than in other organisms. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells reproduce by binary fission, a process that includes DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and <b>cytokinesis.</b> Eukaryotic cell division either involves mitosis or a more complex process called meiosis. Mitosis and meiosis are sometimes called the two [...] "nuclear division" [...] processes. Binary fission is similar to eukaryote cell reproduction that involves mitosis. Both lead {{to the production of}} two daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Meiosis is used for a special cell reproduction process of diploid organisms. It produces four special daughter cells (gametes) which have half the normal cellular amount of DNA. A male and a female gamete can then combine to produce a zygote, a cell which again has the normal amount of chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|A cell’s {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} form microfilaments provides the scaffolding that {{allows it to}} rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to the organism’s internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane absorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue. Other enzymes or organelles such as cilia can be anchored to this scaffolding {{in order to control}} the deformation of the external cell membrane, which allows endocytosis and <b>cytokinesis.</b> [...] It can also produce movement either by itself or with the help of molecular motors. Actin therefore contributes to processes such as the intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles as well as muscular contraction and cellular migration. It therefore {{plays an important role in}} embryogenesis, the healing of wounds and the invasivity of cancer cells. The evolutionary origin of actin can be traced to prokaryotic cells, which have equivalent proteins. Actin homologs from prokaryotes and archaea polymerize into different helical or linear filaments consisting of one or multiple strands. However the in-strand contacts and nucleotide binding sites are preserved in prokaryotes and in archaea. Lastly, actin plays an important role in the control of gene expression.|$|E
2500|$|... p38α MAPK {{constitutes}} the main p38 MAPK activity in heart. [...] During cardiomyocyte maturation in new born mouse heart, p38α MAPK activity can regulate myocyte <b>cytokinesis</b> and promote cell cycle exit. while inhibition of p38 MAPK activity leads to induction of mitosis in both adult and fetal cardiomyocyte. Therefore, p38 MAPK {{is associated with}} cell-cycle arrest in mammalian cardiomyocytes and its inhibition may represent a strategy to promote cardiac regeneration in response to injury. [...] In addition, p38α MAPK induction promotes myocyte apoptosis. via downstream targets STAT1, CHOP, FAK, SMAD, cytochrome c, NF-κB, PTEN, and p53. p38 MAPK can also target IRS-1 mediated AKT signaling and promotes myocyte death under chronic insulin stimulation. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity confers cardioprotection against ischemia reperfusion injury in heart However, some reports demonstrated that p38 MAPK also involves in anti-apoptotic effect via phosphorylation of αβ-Crystallin or induction of Pim-3 during early response to oxidative stress or anoxic preconditioning respectively [...] More interestingly, p38α MAPK and p38β MAPK appear to have an opposite role in apoptosis. Whereas p38α MAPK has a pro-apoptotic role via p53 activation, p38β MAPK has a pro-survival role via inhibition of ROS formation. [...] In general, chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity is viewed as pathological and pro-apoptotic, and inhibition of p38 MAPK activity is in clinical evaluation as a potential therapy to mitigate acute injury in ischemic heart failure. [...] p38 MAPK activity is also implicated in cardiac hypertrophy which is a significant feature of pathological remodeling in the diseased hearts and a major risk factor for heart failure and advert outcome. [...] Most in vitro evidence supports that p38 MAPK activation promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. [...] However, in vivo evidence suggest that chronic activation of p38 MAPK activity triggers restrictive cardiomyopathy with limited hypertrophy, while genetic inactivation p38α MAPK in mouse heart results in an elevated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pressure overload [...] or swimming exercise. [...] Therefore, the functional role of p38 MAPK in cardiac hypertrophy remains controversial and yet to be further elucidated.|$|E
50|$|The {{processes}} of karyokinesis (mitosis) and <b>cytokinesis</b> {{work together to}} result in cleavage. The mitotic apparatus {{is made up of}} a central spindle and polar asters made up of polymers of tubulin protein called microtubules.
