25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and had brought me a gift.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] I cried eagerly, {{putting in}} my share now; for I had {{a part in}} the history. [...] "He WASN'T alone, Jack, though you thought him so at the time. I {{remember}} all, at last. It <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like a flash.

2500|$|Although she {{received}} {{criticism from the}} judges during the show’s finals, Velasco’s track on the American Idol Season 3 CD, Until You <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> (That's What I'm Gonna Do), was praised by music reviewers in New York and LA, and identified as the best track on the album by several major publications. [...] It seemed to highlight her potential as a recording artist.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Urban (born May 1, 1989 in Tacoma, Washington, 20 {{years at}} the time of the show) is from Duncanville, Texas and auditioned in Dallas, Texas with Matt Nathanson's Bulletproof Week. [...] He {{performed}} David Cook's <b>Come</b> <b>Back</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> during the Hollywood round. [...] He did not qualify initially for the semi-finals but was chosen as a replacement for Chris Golightly who was disqualified for having a prior record deal. [...] He finished at seventh place on April 21.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Jackson left the foster home, his dad said, [...] "Look, {{every day with}} me can be a day of heaven on earth. Or every day, I will tear your behind all to pieces.

2500|$|Malcolm arrives, having {{decided to}} join the Highlanders (Mura felici, ove il mio ben si aggira! / Dopo più lune io vi riveggo / [...] "Happy walls, that shelter my beloved. After so long I will see her again!"). Alone, he recalls fond {{memories}} of Elena: (Aria: Elena! oh tu, che chiamo!, Deh vola a me un istante / [...] "Elena! you whom I call!, Ah!, fly back {{to me for a}} moment, <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and say I love you"). Then he swears he will take her away from the strongest man or die in the attempt. Unseen, Malcolm then watches Elena and her father discussing her upcoming marriage to Rodrigo. She is reluctant, but Douglas orders her to obey his command: (Aria: Taci, lo voglio, e basti / [...] "Be quiet! [...] It is my wish...Show me that you're a daughter worthy of her father"). As he leaves, trumpets announce Rodrigo; Douglas [...] orders Elena to follow him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls {{going out on a}} flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste so that it would last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
