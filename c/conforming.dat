5000|$|While gender {{does not}} {{significantly}} affect a person's likelihood to <b>conform,</b> {{under certain conditions}} gender roles do affect such a likelihood. Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that {{women were more likely}} to <b>conform</b> than men. But a 1971 study found that experimenter bias was involved; all of the researchers were male, while all of the research participants were female. Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to <b>conform</b> almost equal between the genders. Furthermore, men <b>conformed</b> more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics, and women <b>conformed</b> more often when presented with masculine topics.

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} the method and tool <b>CONFORM</b> (Conflict regocnition by image processing methods). <b>CONFORM</b> will be integrated {{as a driver}} model into the ibeo test vehicle during the project phase of EU–project HoliDes. The aim of <b>CONFORM</b> is to support the system designer to properly parameterize the default behavior of a highly automated vehicle to guarantee a high system acceptance. Thereby <b>CONFORM</b> addresses intra and inter individual differences in the driving behavior. <b>CONFORM</b> measures {{the difference between the}} default system behavior and the natural driving behavior of a human driver situation-dependent to determine the necessity of an adaptation. Based on a driving simulator study the paper describes how <b>CONFORM</b> is able to visualize and to cluster certain driving patterns/styles in a vehicle following/vehicle approaching scenario. We use the study results to derive recommendations for the design of the system behavior of highly automated vehicles...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{an incentive}} for workers to <b>conform</b> to the opinion of their supervisors when firms use subjective performance evaluation. This desire to <b>conform</b> arises endogenously from the firm's need to induce the worker to exert effort. The author shows that firms may optimally eschew the use of incentive contracts to retain workers' incentives for honesty. The author illustrates that the incentive to <b>conform</b> implies inefficiencies, even when workers are risk-neutral, {{and is likely to}} lead to more centralized decision-making than {{in the absence of the}} desire to <b>conform.</b> Copyright 1993 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R

Other scholars are ambivalent on the matter; Lopez would always insist {{that he was a}} Christian. Roderigo and Sarah had four sons and two daughters, of whom at least the eldest five—Ellyn (Elinor), Ambrose, Douglas, William and Ann—were baptised within the hospital precincts at St Bartholomew-the-Less between 1564 and 1579. Lopez's brother Lewis lived with them in Holborn; a second brother, Diego Lopes Aleman, became a merchant in Antwerp and Venice.|$|E

5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a <b>conforming</b> member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, {{there were still}} huge numbers of Roman Catholics. Some conformed, bending with the times, hoping {{that there would be}} a fresh reverse. Vestments were still hidden, golden candlesticks bequeathed, chalices kept. The Mass was still celebrated in some places {{alongside}} the new Communion service but was more difficult than before. Both Roman Catholic priests and laity lived a double life, apparently <b>conforming,</b> but avoiding taking the oath of conformity. Only as time passed did recusancy—refusal to attend Protestant services—became more common. Jesuits and seminary priests, trained in Douai and Rome to make good the losses of English priests, encouraged this.|$|E
