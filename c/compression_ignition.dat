25|$|Homogeneous charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (HCCI) {{involves}} the use of a pre-mixed lean air-fuel mixture being compressed to the point of auto-ignition, so electronic spark ignition is eliminated. Gasoline engines combine homogeneous charge (HC) with spark ignition (SI), abbreviated as HCSI. Diesel engines combine stratified charge (SC) with <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (CI), abbreviated as SCCI. HCCI engines achieve gasoline engine-like emissions with <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine-like efficiency, and low levels of nitrogen oxide emissions (NO x) without a catalytic converter. However, unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions still require treatment to conform with automotive emission regulations.|$|E
25|$|Car {{propulsion}} {{technologies that are}} under development include gasoline/electric and plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, hydrogen cars, biofuels, and various alternative fuels. Research into future alternative forms of power include the development of fuel cells, Homogeneous charge <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (HCCI), stirling engines, and even using the stored energy of compressed air or liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Compression</b> <b>ignition</b> Diesel engines {{ignite the}} {{fuel-air}} mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that preheat the combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|E

50|$|This engine {{used the}} Hesselman engine low {{compression}} combustion system where oils of varying grades were sprayed into the cylinder during <b>compression</b> but <b>ignition</b> was initiated and assisted by a spark plug. Overhead inlet and exhaust valves, water cooling and a magneto for ignition were standard features.|$|R

Diesel's first engines used an air blast atomization system that was very similar to Brayton's [...] Unlike Diesel's engine Brayton's engine was fairly low <b>compression.</b> The <b>ignition</b> source was a constantly glowing mesh of platinum.|$|R
25|$|The {{third and}} fourth bytes are to be {{interpreted}} differently depending on if the engine is spark ignition (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines) or <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> (e.g. Diesel engines). In the second (B) byte, bit 3 indicates how to interpret the C and D bytes, with 0 being spark (Otto or Wankel) and 1 (set) being compression (Diesel).|$|E
25|$|Steam engines also {{required}} {{large quantities of}} coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs. Further, the thermal efficiency of steam was considerably {{less than that of}} diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine of 36% (compared with 6–10% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{conceived}} by German engineer Felix Wankel. Wankel received his first patent for the engine in 1929. He began {{development in the}} early 1950s at NSU, and completed a working prototype in 1957. NSU subsequently licensed the design to companies around the world, who have continually added improvements. The engines produced are of spark ignition, with <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engines only in research projects.|$|E
50|$|Most {{truck and}} {{automotive}} diesel engines use a cycle {{reminiscent of a}} four-stroke cycle, but with a <b>compression</b> heating <b>ignition</b> system, rather than needing a separate ignition system. This variation is called the diesel cycle. In the diesel cycle, diesel fuel is injected directly into the cylinder so that combustion occurs at constant pressure, as the piston moves.|$|R

Copper layer of only 0. 001 to 0. 005 inch (0. 0254 to 0. 127 mm) ensures heat away from hotspots thereby discouraging ignition. Copper layer increases oxygen ignition threshold of pipe by 5 to 20 times...|$|R
50|$|Two-stroke {{diesel engine}} {{operation}} {{is similar to}} that of petrol counterparts, except that fuel is not mixed with air before induction, and the crankcase does not take an active role in the cycle. The traditional two-stroke design relies upon a mechanically driven positive displacement blower to charge the cylinders with air before <b>compression</b> and <b>ignition.</b> The charging process also assists in expelling (scavenging) combustion gases remaining from the previous power stroke.|$|R
25|$|The {{viscosity}} {{requirement of}} diesel fuel is usually specified at 40°C. A disadvantage of diesel {{as a vehicle}} fuel in cold climates is that its viscosity increases as the temperature decreases, changing it into a gel (see <b>Compression</b> <b>Ignition</b> – Gelling) that cannot flow in fuel systems. Special low-temperature diesel contains additives to keep it liquid at lower temperatures, but starting a diesel engine in very cold weather may still pose considerable difficulties. Another disadvantage of diesel engines compared to petrol/gasoline engines {{is the possibility of}} diesel engine runaway failure. Since diesel engines do not need spark ignition, they can run as long as diesel fuel is supplied. Fuel is typically supplied via a fuel pump. If the pump breaks down in an open position, the supply of fuel will be unrestricted, and the engine will run away and risk terminal failure.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per rotor revolution compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual output shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, <b>compression,</b> <b>ignition,</b> and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per rotor revolution. The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E

40|$|Variable {{compression}} {{engines are}} a mean {{to meet the}} demand on lower fuel consumption. A high compression ratio results in high engine efficiency, but also increases the knock tendency. On conventional engines with fixed compression ratio, knock is avoided by retarding the ignition angle. The variable compression engine offers an extra dimension in knock control, since both <b>ignition</b> angle and <b>compression</b> ratio can be adjusted. The central question is thus for what combination of <b>compression</b> ratio and <b>ignition</b> angle the maximum efficiency is achieved, considering the set of <b>compression</b> ratios and <b>ignition</b> angles that give a sufficiently low knock intensity. Four knock detection methods are proposed, compared and evaluated with respect to robustness for noise and choices of parameter values. Three of the knock detectors are categorised as on-line, and are designed for giving feedback about knock occurrence to the engine control unit. The methods can determine both whether or not knock is present and the crank angle at knock onset. A study of the relationship between knock oscillation properties and knock-onset is performed. It is concluded that the logarithm of the normalised knock energy depends almost linearly on the rate of knock occurrence. A new formulation of multi-zone engine models is presented. The formulation makes it easy to increase or decrease the number of zones during the simulation. One of many possible applications is the investigation of engine efficiency. An analysis of experimental data shows how the engine efficiency changes with <b>compression</b> ratio and <b>ignition</b> angle. An engine torque model is developed and validated, from which the optimal choice of <b>compression</b> ratio and <b>ignition</b> angle can be calculated with high accuracy...|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} piston engines, by definition, are converter {{devices to}} transform energy in intermittent combustion into energy in mechanical motion. A slider-crank mechanism {{is used in}} creating a chemical reaction on fuel with air (<b>compression</b> and <b>ignition),</b> and converting the energy into rotation (expansion). The intermittent energy source combined {{with the nature of}} this mechanism make the engine naturally vibration-prone. Multi-cylinder configuration and many of the engine design elements are reflections of the effort to reduce vibrations through the act of balancing.|$|R
50|$|Diesel engines rely {{solely on}} the heat of <b>compression</b> for <b>ignition.</b> In the case of Schnuerle ported and loop-{{scavenge}}d engines, intake and exhaust happens via piston-controlled ports. A uniflow diesel engine takes in air via scavenge ports, and exhaust gases exit through an overhead poppet valve. Two-stroke diesels are all scavenged by forced induction. Some designs use a mechanically driven Roots blower, whilst marine diesel engines normally use exhaust-driven turbochargers, with electrically driven auxiliary blowers for low-speed operation when exhaust turbochargers are unable to deliver enough air.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{internal}} combustion engine-powered locomotives and railmotors used gasoline as their fuel. Soon after Dr. Rudolf Diesel patented his first <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine in 1898, {{it was considered}} for railway propulsion.

2500|$|Single-cylinder {{development}} {{began in}} 1937 under project engineer Harry Wood using a test unit designed by Ricardo. [...] Although originally {{conceived as a}} <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine, by the time Rolls-Royce started serious development, {{in conjunction with the}} Ricardo company, the decision had been taken by the Air Ministry to revert to a more conventional spark-ignition layout, although still retaining fuel injection.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{research}} into <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engines and {{the burning of}} diesel heavy fuel in rotaries using spark ignition. The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio higher than 15:1 or 17:1 in a practical engine, but attempts are continuously being made to produce a compression-ignition Wankel. The Rolls-Royce and Yanmar compression-ignition [...] approach was to use a two-stage unit, with one rotor acting as compressor, while combustion {{takes place in the}} other. Conversion of an standard 294 cc per chamber spark-ignition unit to use heavy fuel was described in SAE paper 930682, by L. Louthan. SAE paper 930683, by D. Eiermann, resulted in the Wankel SuperTec line of compression-ignition rotary engines.|$|E

Transporting the energy to ignite a target involves the physics of light-driven relativistic plasmas; a subject which is not well understood. A concept exploration effort to understand the energy transport physics, and also to clarify the merits of a FI IFE power plant could justify a proof-of-principle program on the National Ignition Facility. 1...|$|R

40|$|Alcohol fuels {{have some}} {{significant}} advantages over other alternative fuels, including {{the ability to}} work in existing engines as well as the capability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper analyses the performance and emissions of <b>compression</b> and spark <b>ignition</b> engine using of alcohol fuels from the first aliphatic alcohol family; methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol. The literature relevant to methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol was reviewed and summarized to demonstrate its viability as an alternative fuel. The fuel properties of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol present the most important properties that allow such fuels as suitable candidates as an alternative fuel for <b>compression</b> and spark <b>ignition</b> engines. The performance and engine emissions indicators such as brake torque, brake power, BTE, BSFC NOx, PM, CO, CO 2, HC and soot have been evaluated regarding tone at diesel and gasoline fuels. The results showed that alcohol fuels give different results to engine performance and emissions. Surprisingly, some research yield favorable results to the alcohol as compared to neat diesel and gasoline fuels. It can be concluded that methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol are capable of reducing harmful engine exhaust emissions, however,at the expense of lower engine performance characteristics...|$|R
2500|$|As a fuel, {{methanol}} and ethanol {{both have}} {{advantages and disadvantages}} over fuels such as petrol (gasoline) and diesel fuel. In spark ignition engines, both alcohols can run {{at a much higher}} exhaust gas recirculation rates and with higher compression ratios. [...] Both alcohols have a high octane rating, with ethanol at 109 RON (Research Octane Number), 90 MON (Motor Octane Number), (which equates to 99.5 AKI) and methanol at 109 RON, 89 MON (which equates to 99 AKI). Note that AKI refers to 'Anti-Knock Index' which averages the RON and MON ratings (RON+MON)/2, and is used on U.S. gas station pumps. [...] Ordinary European petrol is typically 95 RON, 85 MON, equal to 90 AKI. [...] As a <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> engine fuel, both alcohols create very little particulates, but their low cetane number means that an ignition improver like glycol must be mixed into the fuel with approx. 5%.|$|E
2500|$|Tractors {{and heavy}} {{equipment}} were often multifuel in the 1920s through 1940s, running spark-ignition and low-compression engines. Thus many farm tractors {{of the era}} could burn gasoline, alcohol, kerosene, and any light grade of fuel oil such as diesel fuel, heating oil, or tractor vaporising oil, according to whichever was most affordable in any region at any given time. On U.S. farms during this era, the name [...] "distillate" [...] often referred {{to any of the}} aforementioned light fuel oils. The engines did not start as well on distillate, so typically a small auxiliary gasoline tank was used for cold starting, and the fuel valves were adjusted several minutes later, after warm-up, to switch to distillate. Engine accessories such as vaporizers and radiator shrouds were also used, both with the aim of capturing heat, because when such an engine was run on distillate, it ran better when both it and the air it inhaled were warmer rather than at ambient temperature. Dieselization with dedicated diesel engines (high-compression with mechanical fuel injection and <b>compression</b> <b>ignition)</b> replaced such systems and made more efficient use of the diesel fuel being burned.|$|E
2500|$|Fiat's {{interest}} in Diesel engines dated from 1907, initially focused on slow turning factory engines then moving to higher speed marine and railway motors. [...] The AN.1 {{was their first}} foray into Diesel aero-engines. To shorten its development time and {{to concentrate on the}} higher combustion chamber pressures, different burning temperatures and fuel supply systems of the Diesel cycle, they based its design on the Fiat A.12. [...] This was a petrol engine first run in 1916 and produced in large numbers during World War I, a water-cooled, upright, overhead camshaft straight six. The AN.1 kept the external dimensions and the lower section, crankshaft, crankcase, sump, plus the lubrication and water-cooling supplies of the older engine but required new cylinders, pistons, valve gear and fuel delivery systems to replace carburettors and magnetos. The cylinder barrels had to be stronger to withstand the greater combustion pressures (2-300 atmospheres) required by the <b>compression</b> <b>ignition</b> Diesel. The swept volume of the Diesel engine was reduced by 23.4% as the cylinders had a bore of 140mm (5.51in), compared with the A.12's 160mm (6.30in). Two camshafts were fitted to operate the four valves per cylinder, though they were driven via the same tall vertical rod used for the single camshaft of the A.12, at its top, and the water pump of both models at its bottom.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the engine}} is running, the heat of <b>compression</b> and <b>ignition</b> {{maintains}} the hot bulb at the necessary temperature, and the blow-lamp or other heat source can be removed. Thereafter, the engine requires no external heat and requires only a supply of air, fuel oil and lubricating oil to run. However, under low power the bulb could cool off too much, and a throttle can cut down the cold fresh air supply. Also, as the engine's load is increased, so does {{the temperature of the}} bulb, causing the ignition period to advance; to counteract pre-ignition, water is dripped into the air intake. Equally, if the load on {{the engine is}} low, combustion temperatures may not be sufficient to maintain the temperature of the hot bulb. Many hot-bulb engines cannot be run off-load without auxiliary heating for this reason.|$|R
