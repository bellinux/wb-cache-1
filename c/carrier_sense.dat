40|$|Abstract—In the {{majority}} of studies on CSMA wireless net-works, a contention graph is used to model the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> relationships among links. This is a 0 - 1 model in which two links can either sense each other completely or not. In real experiments, we observed that this is generally not the case: the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> relationship between the links are often probabilistic and can vary dynamically over time. This is the case even if {{the distance between the}} links is fixed and there is no drastic change in the environment. Furthermore, this “partial <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> ” relationship is prevalent and occurs over a wide range of distances between the links. This observation is not consistent with the 0 - 1 contention graph and implies that many results and conclusions drawn from previous theoretical studies need to be re-examined. This paper establishes a more accurate <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> model with the objective of laying down a foundation for future theoretical studies that reflect reality. Towards that end, we set up detailed experiments to investigate the partial <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> phenomenon.

We argue that the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range is a tunable parameter that can significantly affect the MAC performance in multihop ad hoc networks.

Placement of flow Bb within the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range of flow Aa is possible within a large area of <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range. Therefore, the distances d(A,B),d(a,B),d(A,b), and d(a,b) can be as small as slightly greater than transmission range and as large as exactly equal to <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range (which is ≈ 2.7 times the transmission range) or even outside <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range. The throughput of the two flows under this category is driven by the fact that frames transmitted by an interferer from closer location within <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range are sensed as busy periods. On the other hand, the frames transmitted by the interferer at relatively distant location within <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range may cause errors but otherwise can be rejected as interference, without making the channel busy. Keeping this in view, the MAC behavior can be divided into two parts. The first part comprises of region where a node can sense the frame transmission from other node as busy period.

40|$|Abstract — Physical <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> is an {{effective}} mechanism of medium access control (MAC) protocols to reduce collisions in wireless networks, {{and the size of}} the <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range has a great impact on the system performance. Previous studies have shown that the MAC layer overhead plays an important role in determining the optimal <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range. However, vari-able transmission ranges and receiver sensitivities for different channel rates and the impact of multihop forwarding have been ignored. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of these factors as well as several other important factors, such as SINR (signal to interference plus noise ratio), node topology, hidden/exposed terminal problems and bidirectional handshakes, on determining the optimum <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> range to maximize the throughput through both analysis and simulations. The results show that if any one of these factors is not addressed properly, the system performance may suffer a significant degradation. Furthermore, considering both multirate capability and <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> ranges, we propose to use bandwidth distance product as a routing metric, which improves end-to-end throughput by up to 27 % in the simulated scenario.

In multi-hop networks such as wireless mesh networks, due to the hidden terminal problem, limiting the effects of collisions and interference is a key in achieving high performance. Typical wireless medium access control protocols perform <b>carrier</b> <b>sensing</b> to avoid collisions.
