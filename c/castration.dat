5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male <b>castration</b> would prevent this. Halotus may have been required to submit to <b>castration</b> in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|Neutering or spaying, which {{involves}} removing {{some of the}} reproductive organs, is often carried out {{as a method of}} birth control in household pets. Many animal shelters require these procedures as part of adoption agreements. In large animals the surgery is known as <b>castration.</b>|$|E
5|$|For Reich, {{character}} {{structure was}} the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of <b>castration</b> and Oedipal anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family. Les Greenberg and Jeremy Safran write that Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and tension in the body, or what he called character (or muscular/body) armour (Charakterpanzer).|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after dehorning and 12 out of 25 bulls died after <b>castration.</b> All of these animals had bled to death.|$|E
5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{comments}} that the episode in Gylfaginning detailing Loki's antics with a goat may have associations with <b>castration</b> and a ritual involving making a goddess laugh. Lindow notes that Loki and Skaði {{appear to have}} had a special relationship, an example being Skaði's placement of the snake over Loki's face in Lokasenna and Gylfaginning.|$|E
5|$|After lambs {{are several}} weeks old, lamb marking (ear tagging, docking, and castrating) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually {{carried out at}} this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later {{identification}} of sheep. <b>Castration</b> is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and <b>castration</b> are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum {{is expected to have}} fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.|$|E

5|$|Bahuchara Mata is {{a patron}} goddess of the Hirja. In popular {{iconography}} she is often shown riding a rooster {{and carrying a}} sword, trident and a book. Various stories link Bahuchara to <b>castration</b> or other changes in physical sexual characteristics, sometimes {{as the result of}} her aiming curses against men. Bahuchara is believed to have originated as a mortal woman who became martyred. In one story, Bahuchara is attacked by a bandit who attempts to rape her, but she takes his sword, cuts off her breasts and dies. In another story, Bahuchara curses her husband when she catches him sneaking to the woods to engage in homoerotic behavior, causing his genitals to fall off and forcing him to dress as a woman.|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical <b>castration.</b> They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{revealed}} that the army had tortured suspects, utilizing <b>castration</b> and the gouging out of eyes; the judges agreed to investigate these crimes, embarrassing the army, which tried unsuccessfully to prevent Castro from testifying any further, claiming he was too ill to leave his cell. The trial ended on October 5, with the acquittal of most defendants; 55 were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 months and 13 years. Castro was sentenced separately, on October 16, during which he delivered a speech that would be printed under the title of History Will Absolve Me. Although the maximum penalty for leading an uprising was a 20 years, Castro was sentenced to 15, being imprisoned in the hospital wing of the Model Prison (Presidio Modelo), a relatively comfortable and modern institution on the Isla de Pinos, 60 miles off of Cuba's southwest coast.|$|E

5|$|Solomon was born, {{probably}} circa 480/490, in {{the fortress}} of Idriphthon {{in the district}} of Solachon, near Dara in the province of Mesopotamia. He was a eunuch {{as a result of an}} accident during his infancy, not from deliberate <b>castration.</b> Solomon had a brother, Bacchus, who became a priest. Bacchus fathered three sons, Cyrus, Sergius and Solomon, who later became military officers in Africa under their uncle; Sergius also succeeded Solomon as governor of Africa after the latter's death. Little is known of Solomon's early career, except that he served under the dux Mesopotamiae Felicissimus, perhaps as early as the latter's installment to the post in 505/506. Certainly by 527, when he came to the service of General Belisarius, Solomon was considered an experienced officer. It is perhaps at this time that he was named Belisarius's domesticus, or chief-of-staff, the post with which he is mentioned by the historian Procopius in 533, before the onset of the campaign against the Vandal Kingdom of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes criminals {{were beaten}} with the bastinado to gain confessions, but Han {{scholars}} argued that torture {{was not the}} best means of gaining confession, while court conferences were called into session to decide how many strokes should be given and what size the stick should be {{so as not to}} cause permanent injury. Imprisonment was an unheard of form of punishment during Han; common punishments were the death penalty by beheading, periods of forced hard labor for convicts, exile, or monetary fines. Mutilating punishments also existed in early Han, borrowed from previous practice in Qin. This included tattooing the face, cutting off the nose, <b>castration,</b> and amputation of one or both feet, yet by 167 BCE these were abolished in favor of lengthy floggings with the bastinado. Further reforms were implemented by the first year of Emperor Jing's (r. 154141 BCE) reign which decreased the amount of strokes a prisoner could receive from the bastinado. Starting in 195 BCE, those aged seventy and older were exempt from mutilating punishments. Further reforms exempted those aged seventy and older from harsh interrogation methods in cases other than false accusation and murder.|$|E

Men punished with <b>castration</b> during the Han dynasty were also used as slave labor.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{initiated}} by a veterinarian, that at stallion performance tests for breeding during {{a number of}} years, noted breed differences in various types of testicular disorders. Therefore it was of interests to examine the proportion of testicular disorders within certain breeds. The aim with the project was in a first part to study cryptorchidism in common horse breeds in Sweden. Information about <b>castrations</b> of stallions performed during a 10 year period (2000 - 2009) was collected from computerized case records at five animal hospitals. The case records showed the numbers of <b>castrations,</b> normal cases and cases preformed on stallions with cryptorchidism, abdominal respectively inguinal. In a {{second part of the}} study information was collected considering testicular disorders from records of stallion performance tests, performed in Sweden during a five-year period. The summary of the case information from animal hospitals showed breed differences in Sweden regarding cryptorchidism. Cross breed horses (58 %), Icelandic horse (43 %) and Haflinger (33 %) had the highest proportions of cryptorchism. The stallion performance test records showed also breed differences in testicular disorders. Generally, pony breeds had a higher frequency of testicular disorders than horse breeds. The fact that testicular disorders was more common among certain horse breeds than others indicate a genetic predisposition regarding stallion testicular disorders. It was not possible however to calculate incidences regarding testicular disorders for different horse breeds in Sweden. In order to get a better material for such an evaluation, improved control of the number of horses in Sweden is needed and also the possibility to collect information regarding the number of normal <b>castrations</b> that is carried out in Sweden in veterinary field practices...|$|R

50|$|Women {{in general}} were not {{involved}} in the decision making, even when it most often was directly carried out on them. Sterilizations and abortions (almost no <b>castrations)</b> were common responses to deviancy.

The men making the decisions were often much more sympathetic to the plights of other men.|$|R

25|$|Historically, {{surgical}} <b>castration</b> {{was used}} to lower sex drive by reducing testosterone. The emergence of pharmacological methods of adjusting testosterone has made it largely obsolete, because they are similarly effective and less invasive. It is still occasionally performed in Germany, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, and a few U.S. states. Non-randomized studies have reported that surgical <b>castration</b> reduces recidivism in contact sex offenders. The Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers opposes surgical <b>castration</b> and the Council of Europe works to bring the practice {{to an end in}} Eastern European countries where it is still applied through the courts.|$|E

25|$|<b>Castration</b> before puberty (or in {{its early}} stages) {{prevents}} a boy's larynx from being transformed by the normal physiological events of puberty. As a result, the vocal range of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent <b>castration</b> for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in Italy in 1870.|$|E
