40|$|We {{consider}} a single-period distribution system with one supplier and two retailers. The supplier may have infinite or finite capacity. The demand at each retailer is random. When a stockout occurs at one retailer the customer {{may go to}} the other retailer. We study both the decentralized and centralized inventory control problems. For the decentralized problem we show that a unique Nash equilibrium exists when the capacity at the supplier is infinite. However, when the capacity is finite, only under certain conditions does the Nash equilibrium exist. For centralized inventory control we obtain the optimal allocation that maximizes the expected profit of the entire supply chain. For the case of decentralized controls we also design channel coordination mechanisms, i. e., a decentralized cost structure resulting in a Nash equilibrium with chain-wide profits equal to those achieved under a fully centralized system. We compare the performance of two retailers in the decentralized and <b>centralized</b> <b>controls</b> and analyze the impact of channel coordination on the whole supply chain.

This embedding is particularly useful for the manufacturing of smart structures, enabling improvement of their characteristics thanks to the embedded sensors and actuators.

This method provides a properly weighted average of the outputs of a distributed array of sensors generating spatial ???lters on a broad range of undesired resonance modes without adversely affecting phase and amplitude.

The authors discuss the strong tendency toward overemployment and wage drift in socialist systems. They {{focuses on the}} market-based transitional economy, exemplified by Poland since 1990, setting {{up a series of}} models capturing the behavior of worker-controlled firms. They develop a simple policy game in which government policy is conditioned on output, through a subsidy instrument. This reflects the problem typically faced by reforming governments of whether to enforce a hard budget constraint or whether to resort to subsidies and associated departments from fiscal targets. Finally, they emphasize the way wage tax rules can affect employment and wage and how critical is their design. The authors conclude that because of the inherited ownership structure and the uncertainty associated with reform, market-based regimes will continue to need <b>centralized</b> <b>controls</b> over wages in worker-controlled firms (the socialized sector).

The demand for the mentioned installation is going to increase rapidly in near future. The crux of providing such systems is the occupancy map of interested areas. The occupancy map will overlook the status of the protected areas. Hence, most of the security systems nowadays have the tendency of providing occupancy map of the designated areas. In most of the security systems, presence detectors are used to achieve a secured home or office. Passive infrared detector is widely used in the presence detector as a mean of human detection.

Therefore, mobile platforms provide rating policies to label the maturity levels of Apps {{and the reasons}} why an App has a given maturity level, which enables parents to select maturity-appropriate Apps for their children. However, existing approaches to im-plement these maturity rating policies are either costly (be-cause of expensive manual labeling) or inaccurate (because of no <b>centralized</b> <b>controls).</b> In this work, we aim to design and build a machine learning framework to automatically predict maturity levels for mobile Apps and the associated reasons with a high accuracy and a low cost. To this end, we take a multi-label classification approach to predict the mature contents in a given App and then label the maturity level according to a rating policy. Specifically, we extract novel features from App descriptions by leverag-ing deep learning techniques to automatically capture the semantic similarity between words and adapt Support Vec-tor Machine to capture label correlations with pearson cor-relation in a multi-label classification setting. Moreover, we evaluate our approach and various baseline methods using datasets that we collected from both App Store and Google Play. We demonstrate that, with only App descriptions, our approach already achieves 85 % Precision for predicting mature contents and 79 % Precision for predicting maturity levels, which substantially outperforms baseline methods...|$|E
40|$|Modem network {{control plane}} that {{supports}} versatile communication services (e. g. performance differentiation, access control, virtualization, etc.) is highly complex. Different control components such as routing protocols, security policy enforcers, resource allocation planners, {{quality of service}} modules, and more, are interacting {{with each other in}} the control plane to realize complicated control objectives. These different control components need to coordinate their actions, and sometimes they could even have conflicting goals which require careful handling. Furthermore, a lot of these existing components are distributed protocols running on large number of network devices. Because protocol state is distributed in the network, {{it is very difficult to}} tightly coordinate the actions of these distributed control components, thus inconsistent control actions could create serious problems in the network. As a result, such complexity makes it really difficult to ensure the optimality and consistency among all different components. Trying to address the complexity problem in the network control plane, researchers have proposed different approaches, and among these the centralized control plane architecture has become widely accepted as a key to solve the problem. By centralizing the control functionality into a single management station, we can minimize the state distributed in the network, thus have better control over the consistency of such state. However, the centralized architecture has fundamental limitations. First, the centralized architecture is more difficult to scale up to large network size or high requests rate. In addition, it is equally important to fairly service requests and maintain low request-handling latency, while at the same time having highly scalable throughput. Second, the centralized routing control is neither as responsive nor as robust to failures as distributed routing protocols. In order to enhance the responsiveness and robustness, one approach is to achieve the coordination between the centralized control plane and distributed routing protocols. In this thesis, we develop a centralized network control system, called Maestro, to solve the fundamental limitations of centralized network control plane. First we use Maestro as the central controller for a flow-based routing network, in which large number of requests are being sent to the controller at very high rate for processing. Such a network requires the central controller to be extremely scalable. Using Maestro, we systematically explore and study multiple design choices to optimally utilize modern multi-core processors, to fairly distribute computation resource, and to efficiently amortize unavoidable overhead. We show a Maestro design based on the abstraction that each individual thread services switches in a round-robin manner, can achieve excellent throughput scalability while maintaining far superior and near optimal max-min fairness. At the same time, low latency even at high throughput is achieved by Maestro's workload-adaptive request batching. Second, we use Maestro to achieve the coordination between <b>centralized</b> <b>controls</b> and distributed routing protocols in a network, to realize a hybrid control plane framework which is more responsive and robust than a pure centralized control plane, and more globally optimized and consistent than a pure distributed control plane. Effectively we get the advantages of both the centralized and the distributed solutions. Through experimental evaluations, we show that such coordination between the <b>centralized</b> <b>controls</b> and distributed routing protocols can improve the SLA compliance of the entire network...|$|E
