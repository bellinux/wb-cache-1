2500|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the auction}} system was piloted in 2015 for ground-mounted photovoltaic facilities. [...] As {{a result of}} this trial, the Economics and Energy Ministry (BMWi) abandoned 'uniform pricing' in favor of 'pay-as-bid'. [...] The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) will call for tenders for renewable projects and set the capacity to correspond to the trajectory needed for a 40–45% share in 2025. [...] Starting in 2017, there will be between three and four auctions per year for photovoltaics and onshore wind. [...] Participants will submit single sealed bids and will have to provide a substantial security deposit to ensure good faith. [...] Bids are tied to projects and locations and cannot normally be transferred. [...] The lowest bids will win until the capacity under auction is met. [...] A <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is to be notified in advance. [...] Successful projects will receive the funding rate with which they won for a period of 20years. [...] Special rules apply for citizen energy projects: small projects are exempt from the auction system altogether and larger projects will receive the highest offer accepted in their round rather than their own possibly lower bid.|$|E

50|$|A <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> is a government-imposed {{price control}} or limit on how high a price is charged for a product. Governments intend <b>price</b> <b>ceilings</b> to protect {{consumers}} from conditions {{that could make}} commodities prohibitively expensive.

In spite of these goals, a <b>price</b> <b>ceiling</b> can cause problems if imposed {{for a long period}} without controlled rationing, and can lead to shortages.

50|$|The {{point of}} total {{assumption}} (PTA) {{is a point}} on the cost line of the profit-cost curve determined by the contract elements associated with a fixed price plus incentive-Firm Target (FPI) contract above which the seller effectively bears all the costs of a cost overrun.

In addition, once the costs on an FPI contract reach PTA, the maximum amount the buyer will pay is the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price.</b> Note, however, that between the cost at PTA and when the cost equals the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> the seller is still in a profitable position; only after costs exceed the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is the seller in a loss position.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reason to}} {{calculate}} PTA {{is that when}} executing the contract, actual cost is the only finance measurement. Compare this measurement with the cost base line to calculate Cost Performance Index (CPI), then we can estimate (forecast) the cost at Completion ('EAC' - Estimate at Completion - according to PMBOK, or 'FAC' - Forecast at Completion - in Ms Project). If EAC exceeds PTA, the buyer is expected to pay the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> and any more overruns beyond PTA will cause a dollar for dollar decrease in profit for the seller. The profit decrease rate become higher, and once actual cost exceeds <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> the seller will start losing money(and then might stop working for the contract).|$|E

5000|$|The IMF’s Fact Sheet {{states that}} “Cap-and-trade systems are another option, but {{generally}} {{they should be}} designed to look like taxes through revenue-raising and price stability provisions." [...] Such designs are {{often referred to as}} hybrid designs. The stability provisions referred to are typically floor and ceiling prices (a <b>ceiling</b> <b>price</b> is also known as a safety valve), which are implemented as follows. When permits are auctioned, there is a floor (reserve) price below which permits are not sold, and permits for immediate use are always made available at the <b>ceiling</b> <b>price,</b> even if sales have already reached the permit cap. To the extent the price is controlled by these limits, it is a tax. So if the floor is set equal to the ceiling, cap-and-trade becomes a pure carbon tax.|$|E

5000|$|Findings: (1) In June 2005, 14 {{percent of}} total {{purchases}} by 340B entities exceeded 340B ceiling prices, resulting in total overpayments of $3.9 million.

(3) Low-volume entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers were associated with higher rates of overpayments. (4) Inaccuracies in HRSA's ceiling prices limit HRSA's ability to monitor 340B program compliance.Recommendations: (1) HRSA should improve its oversight of the 340B program to ensure that entities are charged at or below the 340B <b>ceiling</b> <b>price.</b> (2) HRSA should provide technical assistance regarding 340B program implementation to all participating entities, manufacturers, and wholesalers. (3) HRSA should publish guidelines regarding its penny price policy. (4) To accurately calculate 340B ceiling prices, HRSA should obtain data on consistent unit of measure and package size.|$|E
