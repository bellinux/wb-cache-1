40|$|Abstract—We {{address the}} problem of joint {{beamforming}} and multipath channel parameters estimation in Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) communication systems that employ Multiple-Access Interference (MAI) suppression techniques in the uplink (from mobile to base station). Most of the existing schemes rely on time multiplex a training sequence with the user data. In WCDMA, the channel parameters can also be estimated from a code multiplexed common pilot channel (CPICH) that could be corrupted by strong interference resulting in a bad estimate. In this paper, we present new methods to combine interference suppression together with channel estimation when using multiple receiving antennas by using adaptive signal processing techniques. Computer simulation is used to compare between the proposed methods and the existing conventional estimation techniques.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{introduce}} {{a novel approach}} to interference <b>cancellation</b> for code <b>division</b> multiple access uplink transmission. Several models combining principles of serial and parallel interference cancellation are discussed. The proposed scheme {{is derived from the}} analysis of these hybrid models and applies a user configuration algorithm (termed "trickle") in order to provide an improved bit-error-rate performance. The algorithm utilizes an adaptive matrix to compute the required configuration to be used for the subsequent interference cancellation stage. Bit-streaming, pipelined multiuser detection is employed and channel estimates are obtained using sample pilot data known at the receiver. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements can by achieved over various hybrid schemes. A reduced-complexity version of the trickle algorithm is also introduced where the processing delay is greatly reduced while maintaining similar performance. We present several numerical examples through which we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms relative to existing interference cancellation algorithms...|$|R
30|$|We {{propose to}} {{integrate}} delay tracking into a successive interference <b>cancellation</b> (SIC) code <b>division</b> multiple access (CDMA) multiuser detector. Delay-robust SIC was initially proposed for CDMA multiuser detection when there exist time delay estimation errors. When the delay error is small, the true user signature vector can be approximately expanded around the estimated time delay as a linear combination {{of an estimated}} signature vector and an error vector. The amplitude of the error signal can be recursively estimated and cancelled in the multistage SIC iterations by using the tentative feedback decisions. Since the relative amplitude of the error signal provides information about the delay error, we propose the application of error signal feedback to improve the delay estimation. In a sliding window implementation, the delay-robust SIC is used to track multiple time varying user delays. For constant or slowly varying channels, a soft-decision function {{can be used to}} improve the delay-robust SIC. For fast fading channels, a linear decision function is used. Delay-tracking results for both rectangular chip pulses and band-limited chip pulses are shown.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an advanced mean field method {{to correct the}} inherent bias of conventional subtractive interference <b>cancellation</b> in Code <b>Division</b> Multiple Access (CDMA). In simulations, we get a performance quite close {{to that of the}} individual optimal exponential complexity detector and significant improvements over current state-of-the-art subtractive interference cancellation in all setups tested, for example in one case doubling the number of user at a bit error rate of. To obtain such a good performance for finite size systems, where the performance is normally degraded by the presence of suboptimal fix-point solutions, it is crucial to use the method in conjunction with mean field annealing, i. e. solving the fixed point equations at decreasing temperatures (noise levels). In the limit of infinite large system size, the new subtractive interference cancellation scheme is expected to be identical to the individual optimal detector. The computational complexity is cubic in the number of users whereas conventional (naive mean field) subtractive interference cancellation is quadratic. We also present a quadratic complexity approximation to our new method that also gives performance improvements, but in addition requires knowledge of the spreading code statistics. The proposed methodology is quite general and is expected to be applicable to other digital communication problems...|$|R
