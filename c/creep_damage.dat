50|$|When exposed {{for long}} times to high {{temperatures}} and moderate stresses, metals exhibit premature and low-ductility creep fracture, {{arising from the}} formation and growth of cavities. Those defects coalesce into cracks which ultimately cause macroscopic failure. Self-healing of early stage damage is thus a promising new approach to extend the lifetime of the metallic components. In metals, self-healing is intrinsically more difficult to achieve than in most other material classes, due to their high melting point and, as a result, low atom mobility. Generally, defects in the metals are healed by the formation of precipitates at the defect sites that immobilize further crack growth.Improved creep and fatigue properties have been reported for underaged aluminium alloys compared to the peak hardening Al alloys, {{which is due to}} the heterogeneous precipitation at the crack tip and its plastic zone. The first attempts to heal <b>creep</b> <b>damage</b> in steels were focused on the dynamic precipitation of either Cu or BN at the creep-cavity surface. Cu precipitation has only a weak preference for deformation-induced defects as a large fraction of spherical Cu precipitates is simultaneously formed with the matrix. Recently, gold atoms were recognized as a highly efficient healing agents in Fe-based alloys. A defect-induced mechanism is indicated for the Au precipitation, i.e. the Au solute remains dissolved until defects are formed. Autonomous repair of high-temperature <b>creep</b> <b>damage</b> was reported by alloying {{with a small amount of}} Au. Healing agents selectively precipitate at the free surface of a creep cavity, resulting in pore filling. For the lower stress levels up to 80% filling of the creep cavities with Au precipitates is achieved resulting in a substantial increase in creep life time. Work to translate the concept of <b>creep</b> <b>damage</b> healing in simple binary or ternary model systems to real multicomponent creep steels is ongoing.|$|E

McNulty (U.S. radio engineer) of Automation Industries, Inc., then, in El Segundo, California, {{an early}} {{improver}} {{of the many}} foibles and limits of this and other nondestructive testing methods, teaches in further detail on ultrasonic testing in his U.S. Patent 3,260,105 (application filed December 21, 1962, granted July 12, 1966, titled “Ultrasonic Testing Apparatus and Method”) that “Basically ultrasonic testing is performed by applying to a piezoelectric crystal transducer periodic electrical pulses of ultrasonic frequency. The crystal vibrates at the ultrasonic frequency and is mechanically coupled {{to the surface of}} the specimen to be tested. This coupling may be effected by immersion of both the transducer and the specimen in a body of liquid or by actual contact through a thin film of liquid such as oil. The ultrasonic vibrations pass through the specimen and are reflected by any discontinuities which may be encountered. The echo pulses that are reflected are received by the same or by a different transducer and are converted into electrical signals which indicate the presence of the defect.” To characterize micro-structural features in the early stages of fatigue or <b>creep</b> <b>damage,</b> more advanced nonlinear ultrasonic tests should be employed. These nonlinear methods are based on the fact that an intensive ultrasonic wave is getting distorted as it faces micro damages in the material. The intensity of distortion is correlated with the level of damage. This intensity can be quantified by acoustic non-linearity parameter (β). β is related to first and second harmonic amplitudes. These amplitudes can be measured by harmonic decomposition of the ultrasonic signal through fast Fourier transformation or wavelet transformation.|$|E

40|$|Excavated {{rooms in}} natural bedded salt {{formations}} are {{being considered for}} use as repositories for nuclear waste. It is presumed that deformation of the rooms by creep will lead to loss of structural integrity and affect room life history and seal efficiency. At projected repository temperatures, two possible fracture mechanisms in salt are creep-induced microcracking in triaxial compression and cleavage in tension. Thus, an accurate prediction of room life and seal degradation requires a reliable description of the <b>creep</b> and <b>damage</b> processes. While several constitutive models that treat either creep or fracture in salt {{are available in the}} literature, very few models have considered <b>creep</b> and <b>damage</b> in a coupled manner. Previously, Munson and Dawson formulated a set of creep equations for salt based on the consideration of dislocation mechanisms in the creep process.
