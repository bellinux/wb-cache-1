5|$|Animals such as chameleon, frog, {{flatfish}} such as {{the peacock}} flounder, squid and octopus actively change their skin patterns and colours using special chromatophore cells to resemble their current background, or, as in most chameleons, for signalling. However, Smith's dwarf chameleon does use active <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> for camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The skin colour of {{amphibians}} {{is produced}} by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores. These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, {{there is no direct}} control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{have been documented}} that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.|$|E

5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but {{can usually}} be distinguished by a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> of the stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use <b>colour</b> <b>change,</b> in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it to approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In fish, the change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E

5|$|The {{principle}} of varying coloration either rapidly {{or with the}} changing seasons has military applications. Active camouflage could in theory make use of both dynamic <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> and counterillumination. Simple techniques such as changing uniforms and repainting vehicles for winter have been in use since the Second World War. In 2011, BAE Systems announced their Adaptiv infrared camouflage technology. It uses about 1000 hexagonal panels to cover the sides of a tank. The Peltier plate panels are heated and cooled to match either the vehicle's surroundings (crypsis), or an object such as a car (mimesis), when viewed in infrared.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} the temporal dynamics in {{the processing of}} object salience and object presence by using a temporal-order-judgment task. In two experiments, observers were presented with displays containing one or two orientation singletons embedded in a background of homo- geneously oriented lines. Observers had the task to indicate the temporal order of two <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> which occurred either at two singleton locations differing in salience (experiment 1) or at two locations differing in singleton presence (experiment 2). Singleton displays were presented for a short or a long duration prior to the <b>colour</b> <b>changes.</b> The results demonstrated that salience affects the perceived temporal order of two <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> more strongly after a short than after a long presentation duration (experiment 1). Singleton presence affects the perceived temporal order of two <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> equally after a short and a long presentation duration (experiment 2).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to compare <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> of {{chemically}} pre-treated dried apple discs. Changes were observed by chromameter in L*a*b* colour model by using Minolta chromameter CR- 400 and by image analysis system in RGB colour model. Apple discs variety "Gold Rush" were pre-treated and dried in laboratory tray drier at drying temperature 70 °C and at airflow velocity of 1. 5 ms- 1. Different chemical pre-treatments were applied on apple discs (dipping in 0. 5 % ascorbic acid solution; 0. 3 % L–cysteine solution; 0. 1 % 4 –hexyl resorcinol solution and 1 % sodium metabisulphite solution). Mean values of <b>colour</b> parameters, <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> and correlation coefficients for apple discs were calculated for both colour models. The analysis showed statistically significant influence of pre-treatment method on total <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> for both chosen colour models of dried apples. Calculated correlation coefficient between <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> for used models was found to be 0. 894. According to colour characteristics the best results were achieved when samples were pre-treated with 0. 5 % ascorbic acid solution. According to calculated results it was found that image analysis method as well as colorimetric method can be used to observe the <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> on dried apple discs...|$|R
25|$|<b>Colour</b> <b>change</b> permits {{camouflage}} against different backgrounds. In {{the context}} of deception, this {{can be used as}} a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and mating. <b>Colour</b> <b>change</b> is made possible by chromatophores; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Inside the chromatophore cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.|$|E
25|$|Octopuses {{and most}} {{cuttlefish}} can operate chromatophores in complex, undulating chromatic displays, {{resulting in a}} variety of rapidly changing colour schemata. The nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern isomorphic to that of the chromatophores they each control. This means the pattern of <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> functionally matches the pattern of neuronal activation. This may explain why, as the neurons are activated in iterative signal cascade, we may observe waves of colour changing. Like chameleons, cephalopods use physiological <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> for social interaction. They are also among the most skilled at camouflage, having the ability to match both the colour distribution and the texture of their local environment with remarkable accuracy.|$|E

25|$|Most fish, {{reptiles}} and amphibians {{undergo a}} limited physiological <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> {{in response to a}} change in environment. This type of camouflage, known as background adaptation, most commonly appears as a slight darkening or lightening of skin tone to approximately mimic the hue of the immediate environment. It has been demonstrated that the background adaptation process is vision-dependent (it appears the animal {{needs to be able to}} see the environment to adapt to it), and that melanin translocation in melanophores is the major factor in <b>colour</b> <b>change.</b> Some animals, such as chameleons and anoles, have a highly developed background adaptation response capable of generating a number of different colours very rapidly. They have adapted the capability to change colour in response to temperature, mood, stress levels, and social cues, rather than to simply mimic their environment.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species are}} able to {{translocate}} the pigment inside their chromatophores, resulting in an apparent change in body colour. This process, known as physiological <b>colour</b> <b>change,</b> is most widely studied in melanophores, since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment. In most species with a relatively thin dermis, the dermal melanophores tend to be flat and cover a large surface area. However, in animals with thick dermal layers, such as adult reptiles, dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores. These dermal chromatophore units (DCU) consist of an uppermost xanthophore or erythrophore layer, then an iridophore layer, and finally a basket-like melanophore layer with processes covering the iridophores.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on our vision of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E

25|$|Both {{types of}} {{melanophore}} {{are important in}} physiological <b>colour</b> <b>change.</b> Flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores, so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark. When the pigment is aggregated toward {{the centre of the}} cell, the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue. Likewise, after melanin aggregation in DCUs, the skin appears green through xanthophore (yellow) filtering of scattered light from the iridophore layer. On the dispersion of melanin, the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark. As the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation, animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} months the grubs moult and reach their second instar phase, by early autumn they are usually fully grown and have reached their third instar phase, this is when {{they are the most}} {{detrimental}} to pastures as it is the final feeding phase before winter.

25|$|Some {{grades of}} {{titanium}} based pigments {{as used in}} sparkly paints, plastics, finishes and pearlescent cosmetics are man-made pigments whose particles have two or more layers of various oxides – often titanium dioxide, iron oxide or alumina – {{in order to have}} glittering, iridescent and or pearlescent effects similar to crushed mica or guanine-based products. In addition to these effects a limited <b>colour</b> <b>change</b> is possible in certain formulations depending on how and at which angle the finished product is illuminated and the thickness of the oxide layer in the pigment particle; one or more colours appear by reflection while the other tones appear due to interference of the transparent titanium dioxide layers. In some products, the layer of titanium dioxide is grown in conjunction with iron oxide by calcination of titanium salts (sulfates, chlorates) around 800°C or other industrial deposition methods such as chemical vapour deposition on substrates such as mica platelets or even silicon dioxide crystal platelets of no more than 50µm in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Surface <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> and {{specular}} reflections are {{two major}} problems in 3 D modelling using shape-from-shading (SFS). This paper proposes to pre-process the input image for a typical SFS algorithm, so that the resultant image has no <b>colour</b> <b>changes</b> and specular reflection. First, a chromaticity-based specular reflection removal algorithm is applied to achieve a pure diffuse (Lambertian) reflected image. Then, a novel chromaticity-based colour adjustment approach is proposed to generate an image without surface <b>colour</b> <b>changes.</b> The standard SFS algorithms can then be applied successfully onto the processed images to produce plausible 3 D models. In experiments, the proposed approach was tested on standard SFS datasets with complex surface colours. The experimental results show it’s promising to facilitate SFS algorithms to handle SFS problems with more complex surface properties and illumination conditions. 1...|$|R
