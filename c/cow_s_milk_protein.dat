40|$|Introduction: Allergy to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> is {{the most}} common food allergy in {{children}} under the age of three years. A diet without milk or dairy products is potentially low in many nutrients and could put the child at risk of malnutrition and compromised growth. Dairy products are a major source of iodine in the Norwegian diet, and excluding dairy products may negatively affect iodine status. Insufficient iodine status during childhood could potentially be detrimental and put the child at risk for delays in mental development and poor growth. Objectives: The main objectives of this study was to investigate iodine intake and status along with growth in infants and young children under two years of age who were on a <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> free diet and to identify factors affecting iodine status and growth in these children. Methods: Fifty-seven infants and children under two years of age where included in a larger cross-sectional study on the nutritional status of children on <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> free diets (MILKID study). Two spot urine samples from were collected and analysed for iodine, together with a three day food record and a food frequency questionnaire on dietary sources of iodine. Urine iodine concentrations were compared to the WHO cut-off values for iodine deficiency. Weight, length and head circumference were recorded at birth and at inclusion in the study and compared to the Norwegian growth standard. Sub-group analyses were done on different feeding patterns, according to weaning status. Results: One third of the children had iodine deficiency according to urine iodine concentration (UIC). Children who were mainly breastfed were at highest risk and 58 % was classified as deficient. Dietary factors associated with iodine were intake of enriched baby cereals (r = 0. 230, p = 0. 02) and reaching RDI for iodine through diet (r= 0. 313, p = 0. 03). Children of mothers who took supplement with iodine had higher urinary iodine concentrations, though this was not significant. Growth in length was compromised in boys, 11 % of the infants had weight for age z-score (WAZ) and BMI for age z-score (BMIZ) of ≤ - 2 and 5 % length for age z-scores (LAZ) of ≤ - 2 at inclusion and this was associated with food refusal and low appetite, but not associated with iodine deficiency. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the exclusion of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> puts the child at risk of deficiency of iodine and poor growth, however the two conditions were not related. Infants reliant on breast milk as their main iodine source are at increased risk of iodine deficiency. Boys with feeding problems were at highest risk of growth failure...|$|E
40|$|Cow s milk allergy (CMA) affects about 2 - 6 % {{of infants}} and young children. Environmental factors during early life are {{suggested}} {{to play a}} role in the development of allergic diseases. One of these factors is likely to be maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation. The association between maternal diet and development of CMA in offspring is not well known, but diet could contain factors that facilitate development of tolerance. After an established food allergy, another issue is gaining tolerance towards an antigen that causes symptoms. The strictness of the elimination depends on the individual level of tolerance. This study aimed at validating a questionnaire used to inquire about food allergies in children, at researching associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and subsequent development of cow s milk allergy in the offspring, and at evaluating the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet of children with CMA and factors associated with the adherence and age of recovery. These research questions were addressed in a prospective birth cohort born between 1997 and 2004 at the Tampere and Oulu University Hospitals. Altogether 6753 children of the Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Nutrition cohort were investigated. Questionnaires regarding allergic diseases are often used in studies without validation. High-quality valid tools are therefore needed. Two validation studies were conducted here: one by comparing parentally reported food allergies with information gathered from patient records of 1122 children, and the other one by comparing parentally reported CMA with information in the reimbursement records of special infant formulae in the registers of the Social Insurance Institution for 6753 children. Both of these studies showed that the questionnaire works well and is a valid tool for measuring food allergies in children. In the first validation study, Cohen s kappa values were within 0. 71 - 0. 88 for CMA, 0. 74 - 0. 82 for cereal allergy, and 0. 66 - 0. 86 for any reported food allergy. In the second validation study, the kappa value was 0. 79, sensitivity 0. 958, and specificity 0. 965 for reported and diagnosed CMA. To investigate the associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and CMA in offspring, 6288 children were studied. Maternal diet during pregnancy (8 th month) and lactation (3 rd month) was assessed by a validated, 181 -item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and as an endpoint register-based information on diagnosed CMA was obtained from the Social Insurance Institution and complemented with parental reports of CMA in their children. The associations between maternal food consumption and CMA in offspring were analyzed by logistic regression comparing the highest and lowest quarters with two middle quarters of consumption and adjusted for several potential confounding factors. High maternal intake of milk products (OR 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 86 p = 0. 002) was associated with a lower risk of CMA in offspring. When stratified according to maternal allergic rhinitis or asthma, a protective association of high use of milk products with CMA was seen in children of allergy-free mothers (OR 0. 30, 95 % CI 0. 13 - 0. 69, p < 0. 001), but not in children of allergic mothers. Moreover, low maternal consumption of fish during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of CMA in children of mothers with allergic rhinitis or asthma (OR 1. 47, 95 % CI 0. 96 - 2. 27 for the lowest quarter, p = 0. 043). In children of nonallergic mothers, this association was not seen. Maternal diet during lactation was not associated with CMA in offspring, apart from an inverse association between citrus and kiwi fruit consumption and CMA. These results imply that maternal diet during pregnancy may contain factors protective against CMA in offspring, more so than maternal diet during lactation. These results need to be confirmed in other studies before giving recommendations to the public. To evaluate the degree of adherence to a therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA, food records of 267 children were studied. Subsequent food records were examined to assess the age at reintroduction of milk products to the child s diet. Nine of ten families adhered to the elimination diet of the child with extreme accuracy. Older and monosensitized children had more often small amounts of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> in their diet (p < 0. 001 for both). Adherence to the diet was not related to any other sociodemographic factor studied or to the age at reintroduction of milk products to the diet. Low intakes of vitamin D, calcium, and riboflavin are of concern in children following a cow s milk-free diet. In summary, we found that the questionnaires used in the DIPP study are valid in investigating CMA in young children; that there are associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and lactation and the development of CMA in offspring; and that the therapeutic elimination diet in children with diagnosed CMA is rigorously adhered to. Maitoallergia koskettaa n. 2 - 6 % lapsista. Varhaisilla ympäristötekijöillä voi olla vaikutuksia allergisten sairauksien kehittymiseen. Tässä tutkimuksessa selvitettiin kyselykaavakkeen luotettavuutta ruoka-allergioiden tutkimisessa, äidin raskauden ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion yhteyttä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin sekä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuutta ja sen yhteyttä taustatekijöihin ja ruokavalion päättymisikään. Näitä tutkimuskysymyksiä selvitettiin vuosien 1997 ja 2004 välisenä aikana Tampereen ja Oulun yliopistollisissa sairaaloissa tehdyssä tutkimuksessa (Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Ravintotutkimus). Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuutta selvitettiin vertaamalla vanhempien ilmoittamia ruoka-allergioita sairaalan potilaskertomustietoihin sekä KELA:n rekisteritietoon imeväisten erityisvalmisteiden erityiskorvattavuuspäätöksistä. Kyselykaavakkeiden luotettavuus todettiin hyväksi: vanhemmat raportoivat lastensa ruoka-allergiat yhdenmukaisesti lääkärin tekemän diagnoosin kanssa. Äidin raskauden- ja imetyksen aikaisen ruokavalion ja lapsen maitoallergian riskin välisten yhteyksien selvittämiseksi äitien ruokavaliota kartoitettiin ruoankäytön frekvenssikyselyllä kahdeksannella raskauskuulla sekä imetyksen aikana lapsen ollessa kolmen kuukauden ikäinen. Tieto lapsen maitoallergiasta perustui KELA:n rekisteritietoihin sekä vanhempien raportoimaan. Äidin runsas maitovalmisteiden käyttö oli yhteydessä matalaan maitoallergian riskiin. Tutkittaessa allergisia ja ei-allergisia äitejä ja heidän lapsiaan erikseen, suojaava yhteys näkyi ainoastaan ei-allergisten äitien ja heidän lastensa kohdalla. Toisaalta allergisten äitien vähäinen kalan käyttö oli yhteydessä suurempaan maitoallergian riskiin. Äidin imetyksen aikainen ruokavalio ei ollut yhteydessä lapsen maitoallergian riskiin. Maitoallergisten lasten ruokapäiväkirjoja tutkittiin välttämisruokavalion noudattamistarkkuuden ja päättymisen selvittämiseksi. Yhdeksän kymmenestä perheestä noudatti ruokavaliota hyvin tarkasti. Pieniä määriä maitoproteiinia oli useammin yksinomaan maidolle allergisten ja vanhempien lasten ruokavaliossa. Ruokavalion noudattamistarkkuus ja maitotuotteiden palautus ruokavalioon ei riippunut muista taustatekijöistä, kuten vanhempien iästä tai koulutustasosta. Maitoallergisten lasten D-vitamiinin, kalsiumin ja B 2 vitamiinin (riboflaviini) saanti ei aina ole riittävää välttämisruokavalion aikana, eikä sen jälkeen. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että DIPP-ravintotutkimuksessa ruoka-allergian tutkimiseen käytettävät lomakkeet toimivat luotettavasti; että äidin raskauden aikaisella ruokavaliolla on yhteys lapsen maitoallergian kehittymiseen; ja että suomalaisperheissä maitoallergisten lasten välttämisruokavalio toteutuu tarkasti...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{different}} factors {{point to}} {{the significance of the}} role of non-genetic causes in the etiology of type 1 diabetes. Some studies have suggested a positive correlation between early exposure to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> in infancy and increased later risk of developing the disease, while other studies have not found such a correlation. The issue is still unresolved, and in this systematic review I will investigate the most relevant literature on the subject. Methods: I conducted a systematic literature search in Medline and Embase databases, using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All studies comparing infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure with type 1 diabetes risk were included in the review. A total of 19 studies were included, most of them being retrospective case-control designed studies. Results: The included studies were categorized in terms of whether they showed a positive, negative or no correlation between infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure and risk of type 1 diabetes, and with regard {{to the quality of the}} studies. Six of the studies results were considered to be positive and convincing for increased risk of type 1 diabetes with early infant exposure, four were positive and plausible or positive and lacking, and 12 showed no effect. Conclusions: Divergent results could be seen between the different studies included in this review with regards to whether early infant <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> exposure increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes or not. On the basis of the findings in this review, one can therefore not conclude with a positive, negative or a non-existing relationship between the respective exposure and the disease...|$|R
40|$|People talk {{of having}} an allergy to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> but such allergies are in fact quite rare. People are {{normally}} referring to an intolerance of <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk,</b> through the body s reaction to lactose, the natural sugar of milk. It is a double sugar {{that has to be}} divided into two separate sugars for the body {{to be able to use}} them. This division usually takes place in the small intestine, mediated by an enzyme known as lactase. After birth and during infancy, most people produce enough lactase to digest the <b>milk</b> <b>s</b> lactose. It is at a later age that some adults do not secrete enough lactase, particularly when they have stopped drinking milk regularly. In such cases, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria. This intolerance is quite frequent in adults in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America; it is rarer in Europe and North America. People suffering from this ailment can nonetheless consume milk in small amounts, as well as unlimited amounts of butter, cheese and yoghurt as these products contain very little lactose. An alternative to <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> is soya milk, which is also a complementary foodstuff.

40|$|Milk {{contains}} {{different types}} of colloidal or coarsely dispersed particles, such as casein micelles, membrane fragments, fat globules and cells. The fat globules are composed of subpopulations of differently sized particles. In contrast to <b>COW</b> 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk,</b> the overall average diameter (dys), increases with advancing lactation from about 1. 8 ~min colostrum to 4. 0 ~min mature milk. Membrane materials originating from the milk fat globule membrane, plasma membrane, secretory vesicles and other sources {{can be found in}} milk serum. These particles have also been called lipoprotein particles. Their size ranges from about 10 - 400 nm. New results concerning the structure of human milk casein particles show that their average size is considerably smaller than in cows milk and that their average diameter tends t~ increase with advancing lactation. dvs in human milk ranges from about 11 - 55 nm, in <b>COW</b> 1 <b>S</b> <b>milk</b> from approximately 90 - 100 nm.

40|$|Human milk is {{generally}} {{recognized as the}} gold standard in neonatal nutrition. The structure andcomposition of human milk are better mimicked in infant formulas that include <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> lipids andmilk fat membrane extracts, which could also improve physiological properties. Nevertheless, very fewinfant formulas use cow' <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> lipids that are more expensive than vegetable lipids. The potential impactof milk lipid structure and composition on neonatal digestive hydrolysis, intestinal physiology, and gutmicrobiota was recently underlined by several scientific teams. In this context, {{the purpose of the}} presentreview was to summarize the specificity of composition and structure of human milk and to highlight therecent results on the modulation of infant formula interfacial composition and fat source on neonataldigestive hydrolysis, intestinal physiology, and gut microbiota. More specifically, the interfacialcomposition of model emulsions stabilized with milk polar lipids will be unraveled as well as the additionof apolar milk fat extracts in replacement to vegetable lipids in infant formulas. The impact of partiallyreplacing vegetable lipids by milk lipids stabilized by milk fat membranes was investigated in the piglets. This replacement in fluenced the neonatal intestinal physiology through the release of immune-modulatory lipids, the modulation of proteolysis, and the modification of gut microbiota.

40|$|During 1996 - 2000, U. <b>S.</b> {{imports of}} <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> {{concentrate}} (MPC) increased rapidly. At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. <b>S.</b> <b>milk</b> producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. <b>S.</b> <b>milk</b> producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. <b>S.</b> internal <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created economic rents for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U. S. imports of MPC, these economic rents, which were not directly observable, were estimated by combing a set of identifiable variables: (1) the CCC purchase price, (2) the EU export refund, (3) EU casein production aid, and (4) the world price of NFDM as expressed by the Western Europe export price. A vector autoregression model was then estimated using monthly U. S. imports of MPC and the estimate of economic rents. This estimation showed that nearly 40 percent of the variability in U. S. MPC imports was attributable to the estimate of economic rents. These results demonstrate that U. S. and EU policies can not be analyzed in isolation when evaluating the impact of dairy policies on U. S. MPC imports. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

We can able determine whether residue of antibiotics making any difference on these selected properties. Thermo-physical properties were measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), (TA Instruments, USA) and chemical properties were determined by using Lactostar (Funke Gerber Inc., Berlin, Germany). Antibiotic residues were detected by Copan Milk Test, Penzyme Test and ROSA Test and by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for confirmation of screening tests. Due to some drawbacks of screening tests, liquid chromatography was required for confirmation of antibiotic residues in milk. HPLC method showed that average recoveries of spiked Penicillin G at 2, 4, 8 ppb, spiked Ampicillin at 2, 4, 8 ppb and spiked Tetracycline at 100, 250, 500 ppb were ranged from 44. 67 % to 66. 00 %, from 62. 50 % to 87. 52 % and from 92. 86 % to 94. 35 %, respectively. We found that the acidity, pH and density of milk were independent of Penicillin G, Ampicillin and Tetracycline concentrations.

40|$|Organic milk {{has been}} popularly {{developed}} in western dairy industry. This milk {{was believed to}} bring better health benefits than conventional milk and thus, receiving high attention from consumers in recent years. The chemical composition of organic milk versus conventional milk remains an attractive research direction {{in order to improve}} knowledge using advanced techniques such as metabolic profiling. On the other hand, milk constituents could vary with other production factors as well as processing parameters. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of production types together with other factors, such as season, geographical regions and fat content, on <b>cow</b> <b>s</b> <b>milk</b> composition, nutritional and potential sensory quality of the milk. The study included two phases of experiment. In Phase 1, organic and conventional semi-skimmed milk (1. 2 1. 8 % fat) was collected during 5 periods from December 2012 to October 2013 from Norway, Germany, Sweden and Denmark. In Phase 2, organic and conventional whole milk (3. 5 4 % fat) and low fat milk (1. 2 1. 5 % fat) were collected from June to October 2014 in Middle Norway. Lipid compounds and multi-elements were investigated in Phase 1 using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), respectively. In Phase 2, antioxidant activity and metabolites were detected and measured based on ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP assay) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The results indicated that production types had no significant influence on lipid compounds distribution, major metabolites, minerals as well as antioxidant activity. Concentration of a few metabolites (xylose, tryptophan, gluconic acid, capric acid and lauric acid) and copper (Cu) were found significantly different between organic and conventional milk. Besides, season had strong effect on distribution of lipid compounds as shown by principal component analysis (PCA). Level of major elements, except Selenium (Se), were significantly changed within a year with a remarkable drop in August. In addition, selenium level in milk was strongly affected by geographical regions. Whole milk had significantly higher antioxidant activity compared to low fat milk. Concentration of capric acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid and cholesterol were significantly different between the whole and the low fat milk.

Ruminal, postruminal and total tract digestibilities of DM on HQ and LQ diets did not differ, while postruminal digestibility of CP was higher for HQ than LQ. The pattern of EAA flowing to the duodenum was not affected by diets; however, after 24 h incubation in the rumen, residual Lys tended to be higher, but Leu and Phe lower for HQ than LQ. Rumen bypass of Lys is increased by feeding diets high in UIP and Lys, resulting in increased milk yields. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{can change}} <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition {{to improve the}} manufacturing properties of milk. However, the effects of such breeding strategies on other economically important traits should be investigated before implementation. The objectives {{of this study were}} to examine the association between cow fertility traits and (1) <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition and (2) <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> variants (ß-lactoglobulin, ß-casein, ¿-casein, and ß-¿-casein) in commercial Dutch Holstein-Friesian cattle. Data on 1, 644 first-lactation cows were analyzed by fitting linear mixed models. Greater relative concentration of aS 1 -casein within total <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> had a positive phenotypic relationship with nonreturn rates and calving rate after first insemination. Furthermore, results showed virtually no significant relationship between cow fertility and concentration of other <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> or <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> variants. Results of this study can be used to assess the correlated effects of breeding for improved <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition on reproduction, thereby allowing for better evaluation of breeding programs before implementation.

40|$|For {{dairy cattle}} on pasture in {{temperate}} regions, {{it is largely}} unknown to what degree hot summer conditions impact energy metabolism, milk yield and milk composition and how effective shade is in reducing these negative effects. During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80 % reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for <b>S</b> <b>cows</b> than for NS cows (by 0. 02 degrees C and 0. 03 degrees C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl-), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for <b>S</b> <b>cows.</b> The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between <b>S</b> and NS <b>cows.</b> For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For <b>S</b> <b>cows,</b> the <b>milk</b> yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> content was remediated by shade. In conclusion, access to shade tempered {{the negative effects of}} high HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and a blood plasma indicator of changing energy metabolism (generally) as well as prevented the decrease in milk yield observed in cows without access to shade...|$|R

Several dairy products such as raw milk, traditionally fermented cheese (produced without the use of commercial starter cultures), and kefir which are produced in country are good sources of novel lactic acid bacterial strains. These lactic acid bacterial strains may have potential for the production of new fermented dairy products with characteristic aroma and flavour. Therefore, the isolation of lactic acid bacteria from natural products and their identification are important. For many years, several phenotypic methods have been used to identify lactic acid bacteria, but they are not often capable of effectively differentiating subspecies and strains within a genus. New methods based on the genotypic properties have been developed and used for the proper classification of bacteria The aim of this research was the isolation of lactic acid bacteria from raw milk and the identification of the lactic acid bacterial isolates by biochemical tests, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from <b>cow.</b> <b>s</b> raw <b>milk</b> and identified by biochemical reactions. Two PCR based methods, ITS-PCR (Internal Transcribed Spacer-PCR) and PCR-RFLP (PCR- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) were then used for the differentiation of reference strains of lactic acid bacteria. PCR-RFLP method, based on the amplification and restriction digestion of 16 S rRNA gene, was found to be useful for the identification. Thirteen raw milk isolates were identified as Lactococcus lactis, 24 as Enterococcus spp., and 2 as Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris by PCR-RFLP method. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis was also optimized for the identification of reference strains. Restriction profiles obtained by digesting the genomic DNA with Sma I enabled differentiation of the reference strains of Lactococcus, Enterococcus, and Streptococus thermophilus...|$|R

40|$|Associations between <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genotypes and <b>milk</b> {{production}} traits were estimated from 6803 first lactation records. Exact tests of associated hypotheses and unbiased estimates of genotype effects were from an animal model. <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> genotype effects were estimated using {{a model in}} which each <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> gene was analyzed separately (single-gene analysis) and a model in which all <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genes were analyzed simultaneously (multigene analysis). The results of the two models indicate that some effects ascribed to certain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> genes in the single-gene analysis are not effects of the <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> gene itself but of linked genes. Results from this study and from literature indicate that the K-casein gene or a very closely linked gene affects protein percentage, and the ß-lactoglobulin gene or a very closely linked gene affects fat percentage. Furthermore, effects of ß-casein genotypes on milk production, fat percentage, and protein yield were significant, and ß-lactoglobulin genotypes had significant effects on <b>milk</b> production and <b>protein</b> yield.

40|$|AIM: To {{study the}} {{association}} between serum levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA antibodies and milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms in adults. METHODS: <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA antibodies were determined in serum samples of 400 subjects from five outpatient clinics in Southern Finland. Subjects {{were randomly selected from}} a total of 1900 adults undergoing laboratory investigations in primary care. All 400 participants had completed a questionnaire on abdominal symptoms and dairy consumption while waiting for the laboratory visit. The questionnaire covered the nature and frequency of gastrointestinal problems, the provoking food items, family history and allergies. Twelve serum samples were disqualified due to insufficient amount of sera. The levels of specific <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG and IgA were measured by using the ELISA technique. The association of the milk protein-specific antibody level was studied in relation to the milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms and dairy consumption. RESULTS: Subjects drinking milk (n = 265) had higher levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG in their sera than non-milk drinkers (n = 123, P < 0. 001). Subjects with gastrointestinal problems related to milk drinking (n = 119) consumed less milk but had higher <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels than those with no milk-related gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 198, P = 0. 02). Among the symptomatic subjects, those reporting dyspeptic symptoms had lower <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels than non-dyspeptics (P < 0. 05). However, dyspepsia was not associated with milk drinking (P = 0. 5). The association of high <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG levels with constipation was close to the level of statistical significance. Diarrhea had no association with <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG level (P = 0. 5). With regard to minor symptoms, flatulence and bloating (P = 0. 8), were not associated with <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgG level. <b>Milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgA levels did not show any association with milk drinking or abdominal symptoms. The levels of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> IgA and IgG declined as the age of the subjects increased (P < 0. 004).

40|$|In {{drawing the}} {{polarographic}} curves of catalytic wave of protein and reductive wave of arsenic after adding arsenic acid to various milk solutions, by {{variation in the}} concentration of arsenic acid or proteins, changes occurred {{in the shape of}} these waves due to the action of surface activity of <b>milk</b> <b>proteins.</b> On comparing the action of surface activity of human <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> with that of cow's <b>milk</b> <b>protein,</b> the following results were obtained. 1. As for human milk and cow's milk, when the concentration of cow's <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> is adjusted so as to contain the same concentration of <b>protein</b> in human <b>milk,</b> it has been found that human <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> possesses a superior action of surface activity than that of cow's <b>milk</b> <b>protein.</b> 2.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{determine}} the role of insulin in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production in pasture-fed lactating ruminants (ewes and cows), using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp (HEC) technique. Three experiments were carried out. In the first 2 experiments, the response of pasture-fed ewes and dairy cows to the HEC were established and compared to concentrate-fed ruminants (dairy cows and goats). Use of the HEC technique in pasture-fed ruminants did not result in an increase in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield or concentration. However, a reduction in feed intake along with maintenance of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield resulted in a change in efficiency of utilisation of dietary crude <b>protein</b> for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. This indicated that changes in blood insulin could result in changes in nutrient partitioning to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. In Experiment 3, mechanisms were examined that could maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production despite a reduction in feed intake. The arterio-venous concentration difference technique and a leucine tracer infusion were used to measure amino acid (AA) uptake and subsequent metabolism for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production under conditions imposed by the HEC. This experiment demonstrated that the HEC reduced AA supply to the mammary gland and there was a decrease in the uptake of some AA. There was no increase in mammary blood flow to compensate for this. The deficit in the ratio of AA uptake to their secretion in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> suggests the use of plasma free AA concentrations underestimates uptake of AA by the mammary gland and there are contributions by alternative sources such as peptide AA and erythrocytes. There was no decrease in leucine oxidation in the mammary gland, indicating that AA were not conserved for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production through an alteration in this mechanism. These results support the theory that the mammary gland has the ability to respond to modified precursor supply to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> output...|$|R
40|$|The {{control of}} <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> {{production}} was investigated utilising two different approaches. The first model {{is one of}} intravenous infusion of atropine. Atropine, which decreases <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield, has been theorised to act either by decreasing blood somatotropin (ST) concentration or by decreasing blood amino acid (AA) concentration. Thus, the first experiment was designed to test which mechanism, or both, {{is responsible for the}} effects on <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield. Five lactating dairy cows were assigned to the following treatments which were administered intravenously: Saline (CONT), atropine (ATR), ATR + ST, ATR + AAs, and ATR + ST + AAs. Atropine treatment failed to decrease plasma ST concentration but did decrease plasma alpha-amino nitrogen concentration. Atropine treatment decreased <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield but neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs were able to maintain <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield at the CONT level when infused with ATR. It is clear that the treatments tested are not directly responsible for the decrease in <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> yield due to ATR. Therefore, neither ST, AAs, nor ST + AAs appear to have direct control of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> production. Plasma insulin (INS) concentration was decreased and plasma IGF-I concentration was not decreased by ATR treatment. Insulin, therefore, presents itself as a candidate for direct control over <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. The second model is one of monitoring endocrine response to abomasal infusion of AAs mimicking the profile of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> with selective deletion of certain AAs. Six lactating dairy cows were subjected to the following treatments: Saline (negative control, NC), AAs (positive control, PC), PC minus methionine (PC-Met), PC minus lysine (PC-Lys), PC minus histidine (PC-His), and PC minus the branched-chain AAs (PC-BCAAs). All endocrine factors studied (ST, INS, glucagon & IGF-I) were affected by treatment.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of the Dutch Milk Genomics Initiative, and the general aim was to obtain more insight into the genetic {{background}} of bovine <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition. Morning <b>milk</b> samples from roughly 2000 cows were analyzed for the six major <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> (αS 1 -casein, αS 2 -casein, β-casein, κ-casein, α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin) using capillary zone electrophoresis. The estimated genetic parameters for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition showed that there was considerable genetic variation for <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition and that the genetic correlations among the six major <b>milk</b> <b>proteins</b> were low. There was a strong negative genetic correlation between β-lactoglobulin and total casein in milk. The presence of genetic variation justified the performance of in-depth genetic analyses such as linkage and association mapping. A linkage study was performed to screen the whole bovine genome to identify chromosomal regions affecting <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition. This study resulted in ten chromosomal regions, of which regions on BTA 6, 11 and 14 showed the largest effect on <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition. The confidence intervals of these regions were large, in general. Therefore, an association study was performed to narrow down these chromosomal regions and to detect new chromosomal regions affecting <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition. The association study resulted in four main regions on BTA 5, 6, 11 and 14, and also new regions were detected. These new regions may, in addition to the four main regions, {{play a role in the}} genetic regulation of <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis. The <b>milk</b> <b>protein</b> composition is important for technological properties of milk. An increase in casein index is preferable for the cheese production. Therefore, four scenario’s, to increase casein index in milk, were discussed. The first scenario has been termed genetic differentiation, the second scenario was genetic selection based on estimated breeding values, the third scenario was genetic selection based on genotypes, and the last scenario was genomic selection.
