40|$|The {{importance}} of social networks on the Internet is constantly increasing, thus {{more and more}} <b>consumers</b> and companies make use of them. In order to reach their goals and communicate with <b>consumers,</b> companies employ social media, which includes platforms such as blogs, social networks like Facebook and many more. The use of these means depends on the company’s financial resources. Social media is unique: <b>consumers</b> {{can use it to}} communicate to one another, which supplements traditional communication, which is conducted by word of mouth. There is no doubt that communication among <b>consumers</b> highly determines consumers’ ability to receive and react to the information provided by the company – this is how consumers’ decisions are conditioned. When assessing the influence that social media has on changes in communication, the profound {{importance of}} social media cannot be ignored, since this type of media is based on <b>consumers,</b> who share their information on goods and services; therefore, it becomes an inherent part of marketing. Research object of the thesis: the impact that communication among <b>consumers</b> has on the individual <b>consumer’s</b> behaviour in the virtual environment. Aim of the thesis: to theoretically and empirically substantiate the impact of communication among <b>consumers</b> on individual <b>consumer’s</b> behaviour in the virtual environment. Tasks of the thesis: 1. To review the issues related to the impact of communication among <b>consumers</b> on individual <b>consumer’s</b> behaviour. 2. To analyse consumers’ behaviour in virtual environment. 3. To analyse theoretical aspects of the role of <b>consumers</b> in communication of companies. 4. To carry out theoretical studies of factors that determine the involvement of <b>consumers</b> in communication among themselves. 5. To prepare a conceptual model of the impact of communication among <b>consumers</b> on individual <b>consumer’s</b> behaviour in virtual environment. 5 6. To carry out an empirical assessment of the conceptual model of the impact of communication among <b>consumers</b> on individual <b>consumer’s</b> behaviour in virtual environment. The five hypotheses formulated in the research were confirmed after carrying out a consumers’ survey. It was proven that the factor of the social agent mostly effects <b>consumer’s</b> inclination to communicate with other <b>consumers,</b> while <b>consumer’s</b> intent of buying is strongly affected by the attitude that is influenced by consumers’ communication among themselves. Information communication among <b>consumers</b> has a greater impact on <b>consumer’s</b> approach towards the item and also strongly effects <b>consumer’s</b> intent of buying it. It was determined that informative communication among <b>consumers</b> has a greater impact on <b>consumer’s</b> intent of buying an item compared to normative communication...|$|R
40|$|Are young <b>consumers</b> {{easier to}} attract? We {{shed some light}} on the {{presumption}} that younger <b>consumers</b> are less loyal to brands and more willing than older <b>consumers</b> to try new brands. Analysis of 230 brands from 12 categories revealed a tendency for new and growing brands to skew towards younger <b>consumers.</b> This suggests that younger <b>consumers</b> are slightly easier for brands to attract. The most plausible explanation is that younger <b>consumers</b> {{are more likely to be}} new buyers of the category. We therefore caution that our results do not support a marketing strategy strongly targeting younger <b>consumers.</b> If a brand grows, then it is likely to attract a slightly disproportionate number of younger <b>consumers.</b> However, it does not follow that, if it seeks largely to attract younger <b>consumers,</b> it will grow. ...|$|R

Promotion-focused <b>consumers</b> are also found to have larger consideration sets than prevention-focused <b>consumers.</b> Finally, {{it is found that}} aligning the decision environment with the search and consideration inclinations of promotion- and prevention-focused <b>consumers</b> produces an experience of regulatory fit that increases the subjective value that the <b>consumers</b> attach to the offer...|$|R

This outcome was not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 <b>consumer</b> goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods.

Apple addressed the latter by hiding the display of estimated battery time remaining entirely in a macOS update. <b>Consumer</b> Reports did not initially recommend the 2016 MacBook Pro models, citing inconsistent and unpredictable battery life in its lab testing (which involves the consecutive loading of multiple websites). However, Apple and <b>Consumer</b> Reports found that the results had been affected by a bug caused by disabling caching in Safari's developer tools. <b>Consumer</b> Reports performed the tests again with a patched macOS, and retracted its original assessment.|$|E

While liberal groups and <b>consumer</b> advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions and by Republican members of Congress who believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E
30|$|The {{power of}} locally framed {{messages}} is reported in multiple studies.

Grinstein and Riefler (2015) analyzed the effectiveness of global and local framing messages in Israel, and categorized <b>consumers</b> into three groups; high-, middle- and low-cosmopolitan <b>consumers.</b> High-cosmopolitan <b>consumers</b> are interested in global issues and willingly join the global movement. Global framing message is more effective on high-cosmopolitan <b>consumers</b> than low-cosmopolitan <b>consumers.</b> On low-cosmopolitan <b>consumers,</b> namely general <b>consumers,</b> local framing messages are effective because <b>consumers</b> can easily evaluate {{the impact of their}} purchasing behavior (Grinstein and Riefler 2015).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a novel explanation why firms sometimes use nontargeted advertising. <b>Consumers</b> value social status, which {{depends on what}} other <b>consumers</b> believe about their wealth. Advertising transmits information that allows <b>consumers</b> to buy the good, but also to recognize it when others buy. In equilibrium, the firm uses non-targeted advertising to help <b>consumers</b> signal to each other through their purchases. It advertises to wealthy <b>consumers</b> who will buy, but also to poorer <b>consumers</b> who will not. Doing so ensures they understand what the goods signals, which increases the status and willingness to pay of <b>consumers</b> who buy. Trade may decrease social welfare, and in particular tends to make poorer <b>consumers</b> worse off. The mechanism shows effects often associated with persuasive advertising may instead result from informative advertising. ...|$|R

Optimal decisions move their willingness to accept to the equilibrium price level. Suboptimal decisions of <b>consumers</b> with positive search costs result in willingness to accept below the lowest willingness to pay of <b>consumers</b> with zero search costs and arbitrage takes place.
