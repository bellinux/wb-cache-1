5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft <b>contrails</b> (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic during the three days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of <b>contrails.</b> During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft <b>contrails</b> may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor <b>contrails.</b> Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating <b>contrails,</b> varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|<b>Contrails</b> are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent <b>contrails</b> can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor <b>contrails.</b>|$|E
25|$|Airplane <b>contrails</b> {{have also}} been {{observed}} to influence lightning to a small degree. The water vapor-dense <b>contrails</b> of airplanes may provide a lower resistance pathway through the atmosphere having some influence upon {{the establishment of an}} ionic pathway for a lightning flash to follow.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{persistence}} of the conspiracy theory and questions about government involvement, scientists and government agencies around the world have repeatedly explained that supposed chemtrails are in fact normal <b>contrails.</b>|$|E
25|$|Albedo {{and climate}} {{in some areas}} are {{affected}} by artificial clouds, such as those created by the <b>contrails</b> of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s many {{aerospace}} industry observers {{believed that the}} U.S. had the technological capability to build a Mach 5 (hypersonic speed) replacement for the aging Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Detailed examinations of the U.S. defense budget claimed to have found money missing or channeled into black projects. By the mid-1990s reports surfaced of sightings of unidentified aircraft flying over California and the United Kingdom involving odd-shaped <b>contrails,</b> sonic booms, and related phenomena that suggested the US had developed such an aircraft. Nothing ever linked any of these observations to any program or aircraft type, but the name Aurora was often tagged on these {{as a way of}} explaining the observations.|$|E
500|$|In Project Sylpheed, starfighters and {{missiles}} leave colorful <b>contrails</b> {{in their wake}} as they move through the void of space, and explode into fireballs when destroyed. [...] The graphics impressed several critics; in his article for Play magazine, Dave Halverson called the game [...] "by far the prettiest free-roaming shooter ever created". [...] Other reviewers felt the effects were not outstanding; IGN's Erik Brudvig said the explosions looked like [...] "bloody snot". [...] Finding the maelstrom of color <b>contrails</b> distracting, Justin Hoeger wrote in his article for The Sacramento Bee that he was dogfighting [...] "garish, neon-colored contrails" [...] instead of enemy fighters, a sentiment shared by several others. [...] Will Freeman of Videogamer.com, however, appreciated the <b>contrails</b> for filling the emptiness of space with [...] "tangled webs of gently shimmering blue and red" [...] and found them useful as [...] "a way of tracking [...] enemies".|$|E

It is also her second digital-only single after [...] "Damage" [...] (2012), and Amuro's second single released from her own label Dimension Point. The artwork to [...] "Contrail" [...] features a birds-eye view of two <b>contrails</b> above a cityscape. Amuro had contemplated in releasing the single as a CD single, but later scrapped the idea because she felt the digital release and promotion through the television series would be enough. In 2014, Amuro re-recorded the song for her 2014 compilation album Ballada.|$|E

He saw nine Hawker Hurricanes below and in mid-Channel but also noticed <b>contrails</b> above and climbed up to investigate. The {{aircraft}} were Bf 110s, with Messerschmitt Bf 109s providing top cover. Dundas led an attack, but lost the other Spitfires and attacked alone. He shot down a Bf 110 but received hits from German rear gunners. It {{is likely that the}} Bf 110 was from I./Zerstörergeschwader 2 ("destroyer wing 2").|$|E

500|$|His final World War II aerial kill {{occurred}} on April 7, 1945, when Olds in Scat VI led the 479th Fighter Group {{on a mission}} escorting B-24s bombing an ammunition dump in Lüneburg, Germany. The engagement marked the only combat appearance of Sonderkommando Elbe, a German Air Force Squadron formed to ram Allied bombers. [...] South of Bremen, Olds noticed <b>contrails</b> popping up above a bank of cirrus clouds, of aircraft flying above {{and to the left}} of the bombers. For five minutes these bogeys paralleled the bomber stream while the 479th held station. Turning to investigate, Olds saw pairs of Me 262s turn towards and dive on the Liberators. After damaging one of the jets in a chase meant to lure the fighter escort away from the bombers, the Mustangs returned to the bomber stream. Olds observed a Bf 109 of Sonderkommando Elbe attack the bombers and shoot down a B-24. Olds pursued the Bf 109 through the [...] formation, and shot it down.|$|E
500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Unknown Pleasures in April 1979 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, {{a fact that}} greatly displeased the band at the time. Hook said in 2006 that the album [...] "definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it But now I can see that Martin {{did a good job}} on it There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with <b>contrails</b> for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E

2500|$|The chemtrail {{conspiracy}} theory is {{the claim that}} long-lasting trails, so-called [...] "chemtrails", are left in the sky by high-flying aircraft and that they consist of chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed for unknown purposes undisclosed to the general public. Believers in the theory argue that normal <b>contrails</b> dissipate relatively quickly and that <b>contrails</b> that do not dissipate must contain additional substances. These arguments have been dismissed by the scientific community: such trails are normal water-based <b>contrails</b> (condensation trails) that are routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. Although proponents have attempted {{to prove that the}} claimed chemical spraying does take place, their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions.|$|E
2500|$|Under certain ambient conditions, {{plumes of}} water vapor (fog) {{can be seen}} {{rising out of the}} {{discharge}} from a cooling tower, and can be mistaken as smoke from a fire. [...] If the outdoor air is at or near saturation, and the tower adds more water to the air, saturated air with liquid water droplets can be discharged, which is seen as fog. [...] This phenomenon typically occurs on cool, humid days, but is rare in many climates. Fog and clouds associated with cooling towers can be described as homogenitus, as with other clouds of man-made origin, such as <b>contrails</b> and ship tracks.|$|E
2500|$|J. Murray Mitchell showed {{as early}} as 1963 a multidecadal cooling since about 1940. At a conference on climate change held in Boulder, Colorado in 1965, {{evidence}} supporting Milankovitch cycles triggered speculation on how the calculated small changes in sunlight might somehow trigger ice ages. In 1966 Cesare Emiliani predicted that [...] "a new glaciation will begin within a few thousand years." [...] In his 1968 book The Population Bomb, Paul R. Ehrlich wrote [...] "The greenhouse effect is being enhanced now by the greatly increased level of carbon dioxide... is being countered by low-level clouds generated by <b>contrails,</b> dust, and other contaminants... At the moment we cannot predict what the overall climatic results will be of our using the atmosphere as a garbage dump." ...|$|E
2500|$|The genitus and mutatus {{categories}} {{have been}} {{expanded to include}} certain types that do not originate from pre-existing clouds. The term flammagenitus (Latin for 'fire-made') applies to cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus that are formed by large scale fires or volcanic eruptions. Smaller low-level [...] "pyrocumulus" [...] or [...] "fumulus" [...] clouds formed by contained industrial activity are now classified as cumulus homogenitus (Latin for 'man-made'). <b>Contrails</b> formed from the exhaust of aircraft flying in the upper level of the troposphere can persist and spread into formations resembling any of the high cloud genus-types and are now officially designated as cirrus, cirrostratus, or cirrocumulus homogenitus. If a homogenitus cloud of one genus changes to another genus type, it is then termed a homomutatus cloud. Stratus cataractagenitus (Latin for 'cataract-made') are generated by the spray from waterfalls. [...] Silvagenitus (Latin for 'forest-made') is a stratus cloud that forms as water vapor {{is added to the}} air above a forest canopy.|$|E

The red border that rings the ship's seal {{is similar to the}} distinctive red rim that defines the White House china designed for the Reagans during their White House years. Four gold stars represent President Reagan's 40thpresidency and his four pillars of freedom: individual liberty, economic opportunity, global democracy, and national pride. [...] "Peace through Strength" [...] was a recurring theme of the President's life in public service. The aircraft carrier is positioned by the West Coast, representing President Reagan's two terms as Governor of California and the ship's homeport in the Pacific Fleet. The three aircraft with their patriotic <b>contrails</b> symbolize the three major military operations the President directed during his tenure: Operation Urgent Fury (Grenada/1983), Operation El Dorado Canyon (Libya/1986), and Operation Praying Mantis (Iran/1988). The view of the globe signifies the President's vision of global democracy, and the center is the United States representing the country's national pride. Colors of red, white, and blue dominate the seal reflecting the American flag.|$|E
5000|$|It is well {{established}} by atmospheric scientists that <b>contrails</b> can persist for hours, {{and that it is}} a perfectly normal characteristic for them to spread out into cirrus sheets. The different-sized ice crystals in <b>contrails</b> descend at different rates, which spreads the contrail vertically. Then the differential in wind speeds between altitudes (wind shear) results in the spreading of the contrail across many miles/kilometers in the sky. This mechanism is similar to the formation of cirrus uncinus clouds. <b>Contrails</b> between 25000 and 40000 ft can often merge into an [...] "almost solid" [...] interlaced sheet. <b>Contrails</b> can have a lateral spread of several kilometers, and given sufficient air traffic, it is possible for <b>contrails</b> to create an entirely overcast sky that increases the ice budget of individual <b>contrails</b> and persists for hours.|$|E
5000|$|Proponents of the chemtrail {{conspiracy}} theory say that chemtrails {{can be distinguished}} from <b>contrails</b> by their long duration, asserting that the chemtrails are those trails left by aircraft that persist {{for as much as}} a half day or transform into cirrus-like clouds.

50|$|One of the {{products}} of burning hydrocarbons in oxygen is water vapour, a greenhouse gas.
