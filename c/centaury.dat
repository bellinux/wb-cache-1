5|$|Grasses such as sea {{couch grass}} and sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser <b>centaury</b> and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found.

5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass. Where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marshes contains glassworts and common cord grass in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The uncommon spiral tasselweed and long-bracted sedge are other lower salt marsh specialists. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh, although they are uncommon in the UK away from this coast. They may occur alongside scarce species including lesser <b>centaury,</b> curved hard-grass and sea pearlwort, with soft hornwort in the dykes.|$|E

50|$|Zeltnera is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} gentian family. It was erected in 2004 when the genus Centaurium (the <b>centauries)</b> was split. Genetic analysis revealed that Centaurium was polyphyletic, made up of plants that could be grouped into four clades. Each became a genus. Centaurium remained, but it is now limited to the Eurasian species. The Mexican species now belong to genus Gyrandra, and the Mediterranean and Australian plants are in genus Schenkia. The new name Zeltnera was given to this genus, which contains most of the North American <b>centauries.</b> There are about 25 species.|$|R
50|$|The {{percentage}} of people speaking tribal language in Koraput district has reduced from 37 percent in 1931 census to 22.86 percent in 1971 census. Thus, {{a large number of}} tribals of the district have adopted non-tribal languages during the past four decades. Most of the people speak Desia Oriya, but the manner and the accent with which tills is spoken in Koraput is very different from other parts of Orissa. Most aborigine tribals have their own dialects. The intermixing of Telugu and Oriya is spoken in Jeypore sub division. Since some Telugu speaking people from Srikakulum and Vijayanagar areas have migrated to these areas <b>centauries</b> back and other come for business. Languages include Bhatri, which falls within the Odia language group but only shares about 60% lexical similarity with Oriya, spoken by about 600 000; and Bhunjia, spoken by approximately 7000 Bhunjia Adivasis.|$|R

(US Census Bureau 2000) Historical/Background The name Cohasset comes from a Native American word “Quonahasset ” meaning “long rocky place”. It was originally part of Hingham and was an agriculture community from 1670 until 1770 when it was incorporated. In the 18 th and 19 th <b>centauries</b> the major industries were shipbuilding, trading, and fishing. The mackerel industry was lucrative in the mid- 1800 s and in the late 1800 s Cohasset began to develop into a summer area for wealthy families in Boston who built large estates along the shoreline (Cohasset Historical Society 2006). Minot Light is a wellknown lighthouse off Cohasset; the first lighthouse was built here in 1850 (D’Entremont 2007). Cohasset is also home to the first official lifesaving station built in the United States. In 1807, 1 These community profiles have been created to serve as port descriptions in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) for fisheries management actions.

500|$|The SSSI is {{designated}} as a Special Protection Area for birds because its variety of coastal habitats give it year-round importance {{for a number of}} species. The breeding colonies of Sandwich terns and little terns, especially those at Blakeney and Scolt Head Island, are of [...] European importance, and the coast is of national significance for common terns, pied avocets and reed bed specialists like western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings. The SSSI also holds large numbers of wintering ducks and geese, the endangered water vole, and scarce species like natterjack toad, starlet sea anemone, lesser <b>centaury,</b> sea barley and bee orchid.|$|E

Nor was the garden dull, though meant for use.

[...] All dreams, as in old Galen I have read, [...] 140 [...] Are from repletion and complexion bred; [...] From rising fumes of indigested food, [...] And noxious humours that infect the blood: [...] And sure, my lord, if I {{can read}} aright, [...] These foolish fancies {{you have had}} to-night [...] Are certain symptoms (in the canting style) [...] Of boiling choler, and abounding bile; [...] This yellow gall, that in your stomach floats, [...] Engenders all these visionary thoughts. [...] When choler overflows, then dreams are bred [...] 150 [...] Of flames, and all the family of red; [...] Red dragons, and red beasts, in sleep we view, [...] For humours are distinguish'd by their hue. [...] From hence we dream of wars and warlike things, [...] And wasps and hornets with their double wings. [...] Choler adust congeals our blood with fear, [...] Then black bulls toss us, and black devils tear. [...] In sanguine airy dreams, aloft we bound; [...] With rheums oppress'd, we sink in rivers drown'd. [...] More I could say, but thus conclude my theme, [...] 160 [...] The dominating humour makes the dream. [...] Cato was in his time accounted wise, [...] And he condemns them all for empty lies. [...] Take my advice, and when we fly to ground, [...] With laxatives preserve your body sound, [...] And purge the peccant humours that abound.

[...] Since hot and dry in your complexion join, [...] Beware the sun when in a vernal sign; [...] For when he mounts exalted in the Ram, [...] If then he finds your body in a flame, [...] 180 [...] Replete with choler, I dare lay a groat, [...] A tertian ague is at least your lot. [...] Perhaps a fever (which the gods forefend!) [...] May bring your youth to some untimely end: [...] And therefore, sir, as you desire to live, [...] A day or two before your laxative, [...] Take just three worms, nor under nor above, [...] Because the gods unequal numbers love, [...] These digestives prepare you for your purge; [...] Of fumetory, <b>centaury,</b> and spurge, [...] 190 [...] And of ground ivy add a leaf or two,-- [...] All which within our yard or garden grow. [...] Eat these, and be, my lord, of better cheer; [...] Your father's son was never born to fear.|$|E
