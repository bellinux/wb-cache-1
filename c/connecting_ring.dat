5000|$|Adnatoceras is a genus of mid Devonian to Pennsylvanian orthoconic nautiloid {{cephalopods}} {{included in}} the pseudorthocerid family Spyroceratidae, characterized by tubular, straight-sided, siphuncle segments that expand abruptly at the septal foremena. In some species the siphuncle segments become more ovoid in the later grow stages. The name Adnatoceas comes from the wide area of contact, or adnation, between the <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> and flared out brim of the cyrtochaoanitic septal neck.|$|E
50|$|The siphuncle in the Bassleroceratidae is {{composed}} of thick <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> as found in the ancestral Ellesmerocerida and in primitive Tarphycerida. <b>Connecting</b> <b>rings</b> in the derived Graciloceratidae are thin, as found in the Oncocerida.|$|R
50|$|Although {{in basic}} form Leonardoceras resembles Bassleroceras, it differs in the siphuncle. bassleroceratids have thick <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> {{inherited}} from their ellesmeroceratid ancestors, which were {{passed on to}} the Tarphycerida. Leonardoceras has a poorly preserved, narrow siphuncle, apparently with thin <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> characteristic of the Oncocerida and later Nautilida.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{differences}} in the siphuncular structures, the subclass Nautiloidea {{is divided into two}} new superorders: Nautilosiphonata and Calciosiphonata. The first superorder is characterized by the nautilus-type of <b>connecting</b> <b>rings,</b> and the second superorder by calcified-perforate type of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings.</b> A new order Cyrtocerinida is erected for the families Bathmoceratidae, Cyrtocerinidae and Eothinoceratidae, previously included in the order Ellesmeroceratida. The siphuncular structure in the Ordovician nautiloid Bathmocerasholmi n. sp. is described. It is characterized by (1) <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> that are composed of an outer, calcareous, spherulitic–prismatic layer and an inner, fibrous, chitinous layer, and (2) prominent siphuncular ridges that originate from the inner surfaces of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings.</b> The structure of the siphuncular ridges in Bathmoceras is compared with that of the actinosiphonate lamellae in the Silurian oncocerid nautiloid Octamerella.

50|$|The Granfoss Tunnel are two tunnels on Ring 3 in Oslo, Norway. The tunnels are 2.1 km {{long and}} {{they are part of}} the Granfoss Line, a 2.9 km stretch of {{motorway}} which was opened in 1992 <b>connecting</b> <b>Ring</b> 3 with the European route E18. The name comes from the Granfossen waterfall on the Lysakerelva river which passes nearby. The two tunnels run from Lysaker to Mustad, and from Mustad to Ullern Church, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Reudemannoceratids are {{characterized}} by having short septal necks in the juvenile portion of the siphuncle, toward {{the apex of the}} shell, which later in life grow folded back along {{the back side of the}} septa in the characteristic fashion of the Discosorida. The <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> is bowed out into the camerae and is divided into the characteristic zones, the vinculum, granular zone, conchiolinous (or chitinous) zone offset by amorphous bands, and the layered bullette attached to the previous septal neck.

50|$|Acanthonautilus, like Solenochilus, has an involute, {{globular}} {{shell of}} few volutions that enlargens with fair rapidity, with prominent lateral spines {{extending from the}} umbilical area at maturity. The siphuncle in Acanthonautilus is narrower than in Solenochilus and not as sinuous. As with Solenochilus, septal necks on the outer, or ventral, side are straight, but those on the inner, or dosal, side rather than being recumbent are simply curved, cytochoanitic. Most of the siphuncle is thin <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> which from the outside is slightly ventrally concave and slightly dorsally convex between septa.|$|E
50|$|Plectolites is {{included}} in the Trocholitidae. The shell is strongly costate. Costae (ribs) slope back from the umbilical shoulder to the venter where they become sharply elevated. Whorls are slightly eccentric, the siphuncle dorsal of the center with thick <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> characteristic of the order. Plectolites has a ventral siphuncle with thin <b>connecting</b> <b>rings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wutinoceratidae are {{a family}} of early actinocerids defined by Shimazu and Obata in 1938 for actinocerids with thick <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> and a complex {{irregular}} canal system. Actinocerids are generally straight shelled nautiloid cephalopods with a siphuncle composed of expanded segments, typically with thin <b>connecting</b> <b>rings,</b> in which the internal deposits are penetrated by a system of canals.|$|R
50|$|The siphuncle is ventral. Segments are subquadrate in outline and {{are longer}} than broad. <b>Connecting</b> <b>rings</b> are thick.|$|R
50|$|The Actinocerida {{comprise}} {{an order}} of generally straight, medium to large cephalopods that lived during the early and middle Paleozoic, distinguished by a siphuncle composed of expanded segments that extend into the adjacent chambers, in which deposits formed within contain a system of radial canals and a narrow space along the inner side of the <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> known as a paraspatium. (Teichert 1964) Septal necks are generally short and cyrtochoanitic, some being recumbent, some hook shaped. Most grew to lengths of about 60 to 90 cm but some, like the Huroniidae of the Silurian grew significantly larger.|$|E
5000|$|The Discosorida are {{an order}} of {{cephalopods}} that lived {{from the beginning of}} the Middle Ordovician, through the Silurian, and into the Devonian. Discosorids are unique in the structure and formation of the siphuncle, the tube that runs through and connects the camerae (chambers) in cephalopods, which unlike those in other orders is zoned longitudinally along the segments rather than laterally. Siphuncle structure indicated that the Discosorida evolved directly from the Plectronoceratida rather than through the more developed Ellesmerocerida, as did the other orders. Finally and most diagnostic, discosorids developed a reinforcing, grommet-like structure in the septal opening of the siphuncle known as the bullette, formed by a thickening of the <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> as it draped around the folded back septal neck.|$|E
5000|$|Shells of geisonoceratids are orthoconic or cyrtoconic, that is {{long and}} either {{straight}} or curved, with a subcircular cross section. The siphuncle, which varies in position from central to subventral, is composed of generally short, straight to slightly curved, orthochoanitic to subchoanitic, septal necks and thin connecting rings that may expand slightly into the chambers. Organic deposits that are formed within consist of either ring-like annuli restricted to the septal openings or which extend toward the front along the next <b>connecting</b> <b>ring.</b> In advanced species these may form a continuous lining. Cameral deposits, which are generally well developed, are formed along the front and backside of the septa, referred to as episeptal and hyposeptal. Surface modifications found in some include transverse annulations or transverse and sometimes also longitudinal striae and/or lirae.|$|E
50|$|Bajkaloceras is {{characterized}} by an orthonic shell with an elliptical cross section and short camerae and a large, central to subctral siphuncle composed of moderately concave segments with short septal necks and apparently thin <b>connecting</b> <b>rings.</b> In the early growth stage, {{the interior of the}} siphuncle, is lined with calcareous deposits that seem to be outgrowths of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings,</b> which are divided into numerous cells by longitudinal and transverse partitions.|$|R
5000|$|The Baltoceratidae and Orthoceratidae {{both have}} a spherical apex that lacks a cicatrix, and similar, two-layered thin <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> which clearly places the Baltoceratidae in the Orthocerida as well. Furthermore, the Baltoceratidae are {{restricted}} to forms with a siphuncle that is tubular or slightly expanded within the chambers, excluding genera with a more ellesmeroceratid aspect in which <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> thicken inwardly, such as Amsleroceras, Cyptendoceras, and Rioceras [...]|$|R
50|$|Armenoceras {{is derived}} from Wutinoceras through a {{thinning}} of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> and a simplification of the endosiphuncular canal system.|$|R
5000|$|Rayonnoceras is {{characterized}} by large straight shells with a large subcentral siphuncle composed of subglobular segments, as for the family. The endosiphuncular canal system is well developed and most chambers are filled with organic deposits. Some shells have transverse striae, others are smooth. As with earlier actinocerids, Rayonnoceras has a canal system within the siphuncle that includes a narrow opening, the parispatium, between the internal deposits and inner wall of the <b>connecting</b> <b>ring.</b> It differs from the earlier actinocerids in having a bullet-like apex with a cicatrix and a long first chamber, characteristic of pseuorthocerids, rather than a blunt apex and short first chamber characteristic of true actinocerids. [...] Orientation during life was horizontal. Cameral deposits, more concentrated in the apical part of the shell, {{are thought to have}} acted as ballast that compensated for the weight of the animal in the forward part. In life Rayonnoceras was probably a bottom dweller that spent most of its time stationary, waiting in ambush for prey.|$|E
40|$|The {{shell wall}} in Spirula is {{composed}} of prismatic layers, whereas the septa consist of lamello-fibrillar nacre. The septal neck is holochoanitic and consists of two calcareous layers: the outer lamello-fibrillar nacreous layer that continues from the septum, and the inner pillar layer that covers the inner surface of the septal neck. The pillar layer probably is a structurally modified simple prisma layer that covers the inner surface of the septal neck in Nautilus. The pillars have a complicated crystalline structure and contain high amount of chitinous substance. The interspaces between the pillars probably are traversed horizontally by numerous chitinous membranes like in the cuttlebone chambers in Sepia. The <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> {{is composed of}} similar two layers as that in the extant Nautilus: the outer spherulitic–prismatic layer and the inner chitinous layer. The spherulitic–prismatic layer takes its origin on the outer surface of the septal neck, whereas the inner chitinous layer is the non-calcified continuation of the lamello-fibrillar nacreous layer of the septal neck. The siphuncular structure in Spirula is compared with that in the extant Nautilus, fossil nautilosiphonate nautiloids, and five taxa of coleoids. No funding indicated. </p...|$|E

50|$|Bathmoceras is {{most likely}} derived from Eothinoceras through {{lengthening}} of the septal necks and of the inward projections of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> in a forward direction. Eothinoceras differs in that the septal necks are vestigial rather than being somewhat long as in Bathmoceras and that the inward projections of the <b>connecting</b> <b>rings</b> point straight in rather than projecting forward.

40|$|Two synaptonemal {{complexes}} (SCs) {{were present}} in the pachytene nuclei of Ascaris megalocephala. The SC was tripartite and comprised of two lateral elements (25 nm) with a striated central element (25 nm) and a central region of 65 nm. Spherical recombination nodules were observed to be associated only with the central element, although they are non-existent in the related A. lumbricoides var. suum (Goldstein, 1977). The SCs were attached to the nuclear envelope at only one end, while the other end was free in the nucleoplasm. This lack of bouquet formation of the chromosomes is consistent with all other nematodes studied. Morphologically distinct sex chromosomes were not observed, which differs from the presence of five Y-chromosomes present in A. lumbricoides var. suum (Goldstein and Moens, 1976). Centrioles (0. 2 µm wide) reproduced by budding off the parental centriole. The centrioles consisted of nine singlet microtubules connected by an electron-dense proteinaceous ring. This structure is consistent with centrioles described in other nematodes, yet distinctly different from the centriole structure observed in most organisms in which it consists of nine triplet microtubules without any <b>connecting</b> <b>ring.</b> Multiple synaptonemal complexes, or polycomplexes, are found in A. megalocephala and A. lumbriocoides var. suum.

Today, the information and telecommunication technology has revolutionized basic structures of human life. Changes are from the whole to the parts and vice versa, which include family and society too. Family lost its former structure {{in the information age}} and differentiated from patriarchy family. Societies have been formed based on logic of networking and new network societies are predominant form of our societies with their advantages and flaws comparing with the traditional societies. Basic concepts of the life i. e. space and time also have been transformed and living in space of flows and concurrency of functions require a special structure or body. Architecture constitutes the body of our societies which must meet physical and mental needs of humankind. In a transforming world, architecture is <b>connecting</b> <b>ring</b> between society and surrounding environment, previous traditions and future world, which its borders between reality and virtuality are very close. Architecture with a global-local approach can assist human who is wondering in the virtual world to redefine its own identity and finds its position in labyrinth of global networks and also safeguards his survival via respecting nature and paying attention to sense of place as one of the principles of vernacular and traditional architecture.
