5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E
25|$|In theory it is {{possible}} for a lowly local amateur club to rise to the pinnacle of the English game and become champions of the Premier League. While this may be unlikely in practice (at the very least, in the short run), there <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> significant movement within the pyramid.|$|E

25|$|This minute {{land snail}} lives at series of localities of mainly between 1000 and 1500 m a.s.l. in Malawi south of about 11°S. Bruggen (2007) presumed, that this almost <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not a Malawi endemic. Many localities are {{sufficiently}} {{close to the}} borders of at least Zambia and Mozambique to predict occurrence in those countries, particularly as suitable habitat is available there.|$|E
25|$|Also {{much like}} Williams is the {{theological}} and philosophical subtext. Ms. Carl takes {{the ideas of}} good vs. evil quite seriously and probes deeply into the idea of redemption. She does not, however, take her themes lightly, instead giving them a vigorous shaking down before she's done, resulting in a gripping spiritual thriller. One could easily call this 'in the tradition of Charles Williams' — which it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> — but it more importantly moves beyond that master of the spiritual thriller.|$|E
25|$|In 1666, {{a project}} for the main altar by Malta's {{greatest}} sculptor, Melchiorre Cafà, was approved and begun. Cafà intended a large sculpture group in bronze depicting the Baptism of Christ. Following Cafà's tragical death in 1667 in a foundry accident while working on this work in Rome, the plans were abandoned. Only in 1703, Giuseppe Mazzuoli, Cafà's only pupil, finished a marble group of the Baptism of Christ {{which might have been}} influenced by his master's undocumented designs but <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> strongly dependent on a small baptism group by Alessandro Algardi.|$|E

25|$|Is it {{necessary}} for sisters to be set apart to officiate in the sacred ordinances of washing, anointing, and laying on of hands in administering to the sick? It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not. Any and all sisters who honor their holy endowments, not only have right, but should feel it a duty, whenever called upon to administer to our sisters in these ordinances, which God has graciously committed to His daughters {{as well as to}} His sons; and we testify that when administered and received in faith and humility they are accompanied with almighty power.|$|E
25|$|The {{library was}} a major {{reference}} and research resource, but there were detractors. An editorial in The New York Times complained, “Popular it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> not, and, so greatly is it lacking in the essentials of a public library, that its stores might almost as well be under lock and key, for any access the masses of the people can get thereto.” An article in The Sun of March 4, 1873, reported problems with the mutilation {{of some of the}} library's volumes. This was apparently done mostly for convenience: Instead of writing down extracts, readers cut out the sections with the information they needed.|$|E
25|$|Three {{widespread}} {{units are}} recognized within the Victoria quadrangle. These are, from oldest to youngest, intercrater plains material, intermediate plains material, and smooth plains material. In addition, central peak, floor, rim, and ejecta materials {{related to the}} numerous craters and basins larger than about 20km in diameter are mapped. The simplicity of the stratigraphic scheme is {{at least in part}} due to deficiencies in the data base; the history of plains formation almost <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> more complex than our threefold division indicates, but {{we were not able to}} define consistent criteria of albedo, texture, and cratering for more than three plains units because of the highly variable quality of available pictures.|$|E

25|$|The {{quality of}} the {{finished}} transcriptions is a concern. Many outsourced transcriptionists simply {{do not have the}} requisite basic education to do the job with reasonable accuracy, as well as additional, occupation-specific training in medical transcription. Many foreign MTs who can speak English are not familiar with American expressions and/or the slang doctors often use, and can be unfamiliar with American names and places. An MT editor, <b>certainly,</b> <b>is</b> then responsible for all work transcribed from these countries and under these conditions. These outsourced transcriptionists often work for a fraction of what transcriptionists are paid in the United States, even with the US MTs daily accepting lower and lower rates. However, some firms choose to employ American transcriptionists as they believe the quality of work is better.|$|E
25|$|We assume in {{accordance}} with that case that the corrective process supplied by the State may be so adequate that interference by habeas corpus {{ought not to be}} allowed. It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> true that mere mistakes of law {{in the course of a}} trial are not to be corrected in that way. But if the case is that the whole proceeding is a mask—that counsel, jury and judge were swept to the fatal end by an irresistible wave of public passion, and that the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, neither perfection in the machinery for correction nor the possibility that the trial court and counsel saw no other way of avoiding an immediate outbreak of the mob can prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.|$|E
500|$|There are {{multiple}} examples of joint kingship in Anglo-Saxon history, {{and this may}} be another: {{it is not clear what}} Cutha's relationship to Ceawlin is, but it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> possible he was also a king. [...] The annal for 577, below, is another possible example.|$|E

Robert King, the conductor of The King's Consort, notes: [...] "It <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> solennelle, for it is a heartfelt religious work which shows the extraordinary compositional capabilities of this astonishing man of the theatre: {{it is full of}} drama, pathos, colour and intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{or before}} 1327 Salisbury married Catherine, {{daughter}} of William de Grandison, 1st Baron Grandison. Two anecdotal stories revolve around Catherine Montagu; in one she {{is identified as}} the [...] "Countess of Salisbury" [...] from whose dropped garter Edward III named the Order of the Garter. In the other, Edward III {{falls in love with}} the countess, and arranges to be alone with her so he can rape her. Neither story is supported by contemporary evidence, and the latter almost <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a product of French propaganda.|$|E

Drowned In Sound writer Pieter Macmillan commented positively on their use of vocals on the album saying [...] "having male and female vocals {{and the ability to}} switch from singing to screaming and back again immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world if it’s done well, as it <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> here." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she {{suffered}} from her disillusionment with Mormonism [...] "had {{to do with the}} pain I caused my family. [...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man Knows My History was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, {{and the fact that we}} come out on somewhat different roads <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> no reflection on you."

This particular journey back in time is very grounded in story." [...] He added that he believed that the setting for the episode was chosen because the production values were [...] "easily accomplished" [...] and that [...] "because the episode deals with germ warfare, and that <b>certainly</b> <b>is</b> a relevant topic today." ...|$|E
