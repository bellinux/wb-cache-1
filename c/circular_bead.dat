40|$|Using Monte Carlo {{simulation}} technique, we have {{calculated the}} distribution of ion current extracted from low-temperature plasmas and deposited onto the substrate covered with a nanotube array. We have shown that a free-standing carbon nanotube is enclosed in a <b>circular</b> <b>bead</b> of the ion current, whereas in square and hexagonal nanotube patterns, the ion current is mainly concentrated along the lines connecting the nearest nanotubes. In a very dense array (with the distance between nanotubes/nanotube-height ratio less than 0. 05), the ions do not penetrate to the substrate surface and deposit on side surfaces of the nanotubes...|$|E

The second is the Cranmer abacus which has <b>circular</b> <b>beads,</b> longer rods, and a leather backcover so the beads do not slide around when in use.|$|R
40|$|The {{inherent}} {{property of}} gellan gum to gel and form <b>circular</b> <b>beads</b> {{through a process}} of ionotropic gelation in the presence of cations was utilized in the formulation of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The prepared beads exhibited good drug entrapment efficiency, content uniformity, and sustained release potential. The gelatin-HCTZ beads could be utilized in the delivery of HCTZ, by which reduced frequency of the drug administration could be achieved...|$|R
5000|$|Beads for {{barbells}} {{can vary}} widely {{in design and}} appearance, although {{the vast majority of}} beads are simply spherical in design. That being said, any shape that threads can be tapped into {{can be used as a}} bead. Cubes, triangles, cylinders, cones, disks, and other basic shapes are common alternative bead designs. Some large gauge barbells, especially those used in tongue piercings, use [...] "smartie beads", flattened <b>circular</b> <b>beads,</b> to prevent the jewelry from damaging the gums and teeth and allowing free movement of the tongue. There also exist [...] "bondage" [...] beads, which are dimpled to accept a captive bead ring, or the [...] "koosh" [...] bead which is a bead made of a rubbery material textured like a French tickler threaded to fit the tip of a barbell. Miniature vibrators also exist, in a variety of hard or soft materials on the exterior of the bead.|$|R

5000|$|The shell most {{valued by}} the Native American tribes of the Pacific Coast from Alaska to {{northwest}} California was Dentalium shell, {{a species of}} long narrow marine shelled mollusk, a tusk shell or scaphopod. The tusk shell is naturally open at both ends, and can easily be strung on a thread. This shell money was valued by its length rather than {{the exact number of}} shells; the [...] "ligua", the highest denomination in their currency, was a length of about 6 inches.Farther south, in central California and southern California, the shell of the olive snail Olivella biplicata was used to make beads for at least 9,000 years. The small numbers recovered in older archaeological site components suggest that they were initially used as ornamentation, rather than as money. Beginning shortly before 1,000 years ago, Chumash specialists on the islands of California's Santa Barbara Channel began chipping beads from olive shells in such quantities that they left meter-deep piles of manufacturing residue in their wake; the resulting <b>circular</b> <b>beads</b> were used as money throughout the area that is now southern California. Starting at about AD 1500, and continuing into the late nineteenth century, the Coast Miwok, Ohlone, Patwin, Pomo, and Wappo peoples of central California used the marine bivalve Saxidomus sp. to make shell money.|$|R
50|$|The archaeologists {{carefully}} {{lifted the}} lid of the sarcophogus by twenty centimeters, a laborious process which took fourteen hours. Inside they found the remains of a woman lying on her back. Her skeleton was covered and surrounded by a large collection of jade and pearl objects, bone needles and shells, which were originally pieces of necklaces, earspools and wristlets. Around the skull was a diadem made of flat <b>circular</b> jade <b>beads,</b> and the malachite pieces of what had been a funeral mask. In the chest area of the skeleton were more flat jade beads and four obsidian blades. In addition, there was a tiny limestone figurine inside a seashell.|$|R

Beads on the Great Plains date back to at least to 8800 BCE, when a <b>circular,</b> incised lignite <b>bead</b> was left at the Lindenmeier Site in Colorado. Shells such as marginella and olivella shells were traded from the Gulf of Mexico and the coasts of California into the Plains since 100 CE. Mussel shell gorgets, dentalia, and abalone were prized trade items for jewelry.|$|R
50|$|Navel jewelry {{has become}} more {{extensive}} in recent years. Many new designs, such as the ancient Bali jewelry designs, {{have been added to}} everyday navel cultures. Barbells remain the most common. The world's first belly huggy was designed and patented by TummyToys navel rings. Vogue fashion published an article in 2015 about the <b>circular</b> captive <b>bead</b> belly rings and TummyToys snap lock clasps becoming the current trend for navel piercings. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing. Navels are most often pierced with a 14g curved barbell, which is recommended to be worn until the piercing has fully healed, the healing time is typically anywhere between 6 - 12 months. A wide variety of decorative jewelry is available for navels - simple curved barbells, captives, TummyToys belly huggies, flexible PTFE and fancy long length styles with dangling pendants. Currently, real diamond and solid gold belly rings are also available {{in a wide range of}} styles. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing, both for top and bottom piercings.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a microstructural and mechanical characterisation of laser-welded lap joints in {{low carbon steel}} thin sheets. Different combinations of steel types (DC 05, S 355 MC) and thickness values are used to assemble welded specimens with linear and <b>circular</b> weld <b>bead.</b> Metallurgical observations and micro-hardness tests are used to characterise the weld microstructure. Mechanical response in tensile test is then {{used to evaluate the}} static strength, rotation angle of weld bead and failure mode of welded specimens. Lap-joints with circular weld showed a lower rotation angle compared to linear welds. The fracture in all tested specimens occurred at the base metal, far away from the weld. A simplified mechanical model is finally proposed to derive theoretical formulae for estimating the tensile strength of welded joints as a function of material properties and weld geometry. The analytical results are in good agreement with experimental findings and they estimate an increased strength for circular welds, compared to linear weld with same lateral width. A design chart is also derived to allow a design of laser-welded joints with virtually equal strength of base metal and weld zone...|$|R
40|$|Dress of navy wool {{gabardine}} in two parts. The {{main body}} of the tubular-shaped dress is full-length, sleeveless, with a round neckline. It has decorative bead-work at upper bust, on back at shoulders and down spine, in a line from right hip down to hem, and around hem. The bead-work includes lines of red and clear beads, spirals and "bursts" of clear and red <b>beads,</b> <b>circular</b> ornaments of red beads, and a roundel at front to bottom right at hem of a scene of a wine jug against a blue, clear and green background. The dress has an opening from left shoulder to waist which is secured with a line of hidden snaps, and is decorated with nine cloth and plastic circular non-functioning buttons arranged in groups of three. The dress is unlined. The dress has with it a detachable cropped camisole of white cotton with center front hook-and-eyes closure and white elastic waistband. The sleeves of the camisole are of navy wool gabardine, bell-shaped, and match the dress. They are decorated with the same style bead-work as the dress, including lines of red and clear beads running from shoulders to wrist, clear and red beaded spirals and "bursts", and roundels with designs in blue, red, and green. When worn, the camisole sleeves blend in with the dress and look like one garment...|$|R
60|$|Peduncle.--The most {{remarkable}} fact concerning this part, {{is that the}} outer tunic, together with the calcareous scales with which it is covered, is moulted at each successive period of exuviation and growth. I demonstrated this fact in L. dorsalis and L. truncata, by removing the old tunic and finding a new membrane with perfect calcified scales beneath; and as these two species, (I obtained, also, pretty good evidence in L. Nicobarica,) are at the opposite extremes of the genus, no doubt this fact is common to the whole genus. I know of no other instance, amongst Cirripedia, in which calcified valves or scales are moulted. I am not certain that the whole skin of the peduncle is thrown off in a single piece; though this almost certainly {{is the case with}} the uppermost and lowest portions. The animal's body is partly lodged within the peduncle, which is generally from one to three times as long as the capitulum, and in the upper part is fully as broad as it. The scales with which it is clothed, extend up in the triangular interspaces between the basal margins of the valves. The scales of the upper whorl, or of the two or three upper whorls (Pl. VIII, figs. 1 b´ and 3 d) are larger than those below; and these latter rapidly decrease in size, so as to become low down on the peduncle, almost or quite invisible to the naked eye. The scales in each whorl, are placed alternately with those in the whorls, above and below. All the upper scales are packed rather closely together; those in the uppermost row are generally nearly quadrilateral; those in the few next succeeding whorls, are triangular, with their basal margins protuberant and arched; the scales, low down on the peduncle, stand some way apart from each other, and generally consist of simple rounded calcareous beads, of which some of the smallest in L. dorsalis were only 1/400th of an inch in diameter. In the lowest part of the peduncle these scales, after each fresh exuviation, are apparently soon worn entirely away by the friction against the sides of the cavity; hence in most specimens this part of the peduncle is quite naked. This same part, however, is furnished with nail- or rather star-headed little projections of hard, yellow, horny chitine (fig. 3 e). The star on the summit seems generally to have about five irregular points; one star which I measured was 7/6000th of an inch in total width, the footstalk being only 2/6000th of an inch in diameter; the whole projected 10/6000ths of an inch above the surface of the peduncle; from the footstalk a fine tubulus runs through the membrane to the underlying corium. These star-headed little points are often much worn down; in one specimen which was on the point of exuviation, there remained, in the lower part, close above the basal calcareous cup, only some hard, smooth, yellow, little discs, on a level with the general surface of the membrane,--these being the intersected or worn down footstalks, with every trace of the calcareous beads gone. But in this same specimen, under the old peduncular membrane, there was a new one, studded with the usual <b>circular</b> calcareous <b>beads,</b> slightly unequal in size, generally about 1/400th of an inch in diameter, and each furnished with a tubulus; but as yet none of the star-headed points of chitine had been formed. I believe that these latter are developed from the tubuli leading to the calcified beads, and, therefore, are formed directly under them. In L. cauta the lowest scales on the peduncle are a little larger than in L. dorsalis, giving a frosted appearance to it, and all of them are serrated (fig. 3 d) round their entire margins. Generally only the scales in the uppermost, or in the three or four upper rows are serrated, and this only on their arched and protuberant lower margins. The state of the serrated edge varies extremely in the same species, from elongated conical teeth to mere notches, according to the amount of wear and tear the individual has suffered since the last period of exuviation; so also do the teeth or serrated margins on the valves of the capitulum. Each scale has a fine tubulus passing from the corium through the membrane of the peduncle to its bluntly-pointed imbedded fang or base. The membrane is transparent, thin, and tender, to a degree I have not seen equalled in the other Lepadidæ, except, perhaps, in Ibla. It is much wrinkled transversely.|$|R
