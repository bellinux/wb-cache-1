5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid.

Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium).

5|$|Separation {{procedure}} of einsteinium {{depends on the}} synthesis method. In the case of light-ion bombardment inside a cyclotron, the heavy ion target {{is attached to a}} thin foil, and the generated einsteinium is simply washed off the foil after the irradiation. However, the produced amounts in such experiments are relatively low. The yields are much higher for reactor irradiation, but there, the product is a mixture of various actinide isotopes, as well as lanthanides produced in the nuclear fission decays. In this case, isolation of einsteinium is a tedious procedure which involves several repeating steps of <b>cation</b> <b>exchange,</b> at elevated temperature and pressure, and chromatography. Separation from berkelium is important, because the most common einsteinium isotope produced in nuclear reactors, 253Es, decays with a half-life of only 20 days to 249Bk, which is fast on the timescale of most experiments. Such separation relies on the fact that berkelium easily oxidizes to the solid +4 state and precipitates, whereas other actinides, including einsteinium, remain in their +3 state in solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E

In general TX 100 exhibited a high affinity for the different clay surfaces although the maximum amount adsorbed varied with both clay type, layer charge density and resident <b>exchange</b> <b>cation.</b> XRD and variable temperature XRD showed that TX 100 was adsorbed into the interlamellar region, and that the thermal stability of the clay/TX 100 composite was dependent upon the exchangeable cation present. For monovalent <b>cation</b> <b>exchanged</b> clays (M+-clay/TX 100) the TX 100 decomposed between 220 and 300 degrees C, and the d(001) spacing decreased from 15. 2 to 9. 6 Angstrom.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of domestic waste disposals, the in-situ compaction of soil is usually used to obtain engineered clay barriers with suitable confining properties. Permeability and pollutant retention are the major properties which should be investigated in this context for barrier evaluation. Considering clay barriers in contact with waste leachates, they may be saturated by solutes of various chemical compositions, including in particular toxic heavy metals. In this context, the expansive Fo-Ca clay, a natural Ca-smectite from the Paris basin of Ypersian (Sparnacian) age, was chosen because of its very low permeability and ability for pollutant retention through cationic exchanges. The clay mineral is associated with kaolinite (up to 20 %), and minor quartz, calcite, goethite and gypsum. An experimental work was performed to analyse the Fo-Ca performances when submitted to coupled chemo-hydro-mechanical effects produced by soaking the clay with a polluted solute. For this purpose, copper {{was chosen as the}} pollutant and tests were performed using copper solutions of concentrations, varying from 10 - 3 up to 10 - 1 mol/l. The evolution of the chemical composition of the leachate was carried out as a function of duration for each test in order to characterise the ability of the clay to copper retention. The results highlight that: 1. <b>cation</b> <b>exchanges</b> occur between copper and compensating cations of the clay, 2. an increase of macroscopic porosity and of the permeability, due to two simultaneous chemical processes: calcite dissolution and <b>cation</b> <b>exchanges,</b> 3. the initial water saturation stage plays an important role on the chemical kinetics and copper diffusion through the Fo-Ca clay, 4. the copper concentration in the porous phase is not significantly influenced by the initial water saturation stage. All these results show that the good exchange properties of Fo-Ca allow to restrain pollutant transport, such as copper cations, which lead to modify the clay microstructure, the porous volume, and also the macroscopic behaviour. These <b>cation</b> <b>exchanges</b> also produce changes of the Fo-Ca rheological behaviour without eliminating swelling ability and without producing an unacceptable increase of permeability...|$|R

25|$|<b>Cation</b> <b>exchange</b> {{processes}} {{have previously}} been investigated {{as a potential}} treatment for acid mine drainage. The principle is that an ion exchange resin can remove potentially toxic metals (cationic resins), or chlorides, sulfates and uranyl sulfate complexes (anionic resins) from mine water. Once the contaminants are adsorbed, the exchange sites on resins must be regenerated, which typically requires acidic and basic reagents and generates a brine that contains the pollutants in a concentrated form. A South African company that won the 2013 IChemE (ww.icheme.org) award for water management and supply (treating AMD) have developed a patented ion-exchange process that treats mine effluents (and AMD) economically.|$|E

25|$|Laterite soils {{have a high}} clay content, which {{mean they}} have higher <b>Cation</b> <b>Exchange</b> Capacity and water-holding {{capacity}} than sandy soils. However, if the structure of lateritic soils becomes degraded, a hard crust can form on the surface, which hinders water infiltration, the emergence of seedlings, and leads to increased runoff. It is possible to rehabilitate such soils, using a system called the 'bio-reclamation of degraded lands'. This involves using indigenous water-harvesting methods (such as planting pits and trenches), applying animal and plant residues, and planting high-value fruit trees and indigenous vegetable crops that are tolerant of drought conditions. They are good for tea, coffee and cashew cultivation. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) has employed this system to rehabilitate degraded laterite soils in Niger and increase smallholder farmers' incomes.|$|E

25|$|Pyridine {{might also}} have minor neurotoxic, genotoxic, and clastogenic effects. Exposure to {{pyridine}} would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by N-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine N-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine N-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated {{by the action of}} monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into N-methylpyridiniumhydroxide. Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable N-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, <b>cation</b> <b>exchange,</b> and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.|$|E
25|$|Glycated {{hemoglobin}} (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c, A1C, or Hb1c; sometimes {{also referred}} to as being Hb1c or HGBA1C) is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the three-month average plasma glucose concentration. The test is limited to a three-month average because the lifespan of a red blood cell is four months (120 days). However, since RBCs do not all undergo lysis at the same time, HbA1C is taken as a limited measure of 3 months. It is formed in a non-enzymatic glycation pathway by hemoglobin's exposure to plasma glucose. HbA1c {{is a measure of the}} beta-N-1-deoxy fructosyl component of hemoglobin. The origin of the naming derives from Hemoglobin type A being separated on <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography. The first fraction to separate, probably considered to be pure Hemoglobin A, was designated HbA0, the following fractions were designated HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA1c, respective of their order of elution. There have subsequently been many more sub fractions as separation techniques have improved. Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycated hemoglobin. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way. This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous three months before the measurement as this is the lifespan of red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Most of the charged {{impurities}} {{are usually}} anions such as nucleic acids and endotoxins. These can be separated by ion exchange chromatography. Either <b>cation</b> <b>exchange</b> chromatography is used {{at a low}} enough pH that the desired antibody binds to the column while anions flow through, or anion exchange chromatography is used at a high enough pH that the desired antibody flows through the column while anions bind to it. Various proteins can also be separated along with the anions based on their isoelectric point (pI). In proteins, the isoelectric point (pI) {{is defined as the}} pH at which a protein has no net charge. When the pH > pI, a protein has a net negative charge and when the pH < pI, a protein has a net positive charge. For example, albumin has a pI of 4.8, which is significantly lower than that of most monoclonal antibodies, which have a pI of 6.1. Thus, at a pH between 4.8 and 6.1, the average charge of albumin molecules is likely to be more negative, while mAbs molecules are positively charged and hence it is possible to separate them. Transferrin, on the other hand, has a pI of 5.9, so it cannot be easily separated by this method. A difference in pI of at least 1 is necessary for a good separation.|$|E
