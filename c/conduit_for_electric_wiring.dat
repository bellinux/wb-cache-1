There was more foliage when Dick reached the foot of a projecting spur, for a dark belt of forest rolled down the hill; and by and by he saw a big tent, that gleamed with a softened radiance like a paper lantern, among a clump of palms.

40|$|Achieving NASAs {{aggressive}} {{fuel burn}} and emission reduction for N-plus- 3 aircraft will require hybrid electric propulsion {{system in which}} electric motors driven by either power generated from turbine or energy storage system will power the fan for propulsion. Motors designed <b>for</b> hybrid <b>electric</b> aircraft are expected to operate at medium to high voltages over long durations in a high altitude service environment. Such conditions have driven research toward the development of wire insulation with improved mechanical strength, thermal stability and increased breakdown voltage. The silicone class of materials has been considered <b>for</b> <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> insulation due to its inherent thermal stability, dielectric strength and mechanical integrity. This paper evaluates the dependence of these properties on the cure conditions of a polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) elastomer; where both cure temperature and base-to-catalyst ratio were varied. The PDMS elastomer was evaluated as a bulk material and an impregnation matrix within a lightweight glass veil support. The E-glass support was selected for mechanical stiffness and dielectric strength. This work has shown a correlation between cure conditions and material physical properties. Tensile strength increased with cure temperature whereas breakdown voltage tended to be independent of process variations. The results {{will be used to}} direct material formulation based on specific insulation requirements...|$|R

50|$|Electric street {{lighting}} {{came to the}} District of Columbia on October 15, 1881, when the Edison Electric Light Company installed lamps at 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and at 7th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW. When the White House grounds and the inaugural ball of President James Buchanan were both lit by electric light, the new technology took off in the city. The Heisler Company, the city's first electric utility, formed {{in the summer of}} 1882 and successfully illuminated F Street NW between 9th and 15th Streets. The United States Electric Lighting Company of the District of Columbia was formed in October 1882, took over the Heisler firm, and quickly began laying underground <b>conduits</b> <b>for</b> <b>electric</b> cables throughout the downtown area. But although the firm, at its own expense, erected and supplied power to {{street lighting}} along Pennsylvania Avenue, F Street, and a few other roads in the area, the city was slow to adopt the technology. It was not until 1891 that Congress agreed to pay for public lighting, which was installed on Pennysylvania Avenue SE, between 2nd Street SE and the Eastern Branch Bridge. In 1896, the Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO) formed in Virginia. It quickly sought to light homes and streets in the District of Columbia. After much legal wrangling, PEPCO won a contract in December 1896 to light streets east of Rock Creek. The two companies merged in 1889.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In long-period {{running of}} switch cabinet, the {{temperature}} of contact points will be rose by the big contact resistance, poor contact and longtime overloading. Overheat can cause oxidation of contact points and the increasing of contact resistance, and then the contact may be generated the spark and arc discharge. That is a bad circle. So {{the temperature of}} contact points can affect the reliability of switch cabinet. For detecting the temperature of contacts and the switch cabinet’s environment in Yanjin transformer substation, we design an Insulated FBG temperature sensor. The surveys of upper reaches indicate that the temperature of moving contact A gets the maximum 32. 98 ℃ Aug. 20, 2011, the temperature of stationary contact A gets the minimum 5. 75 ℃, and the change temperature between contacts and environment gets the maximum 2. 82 ℃.
