40|$|With the {{diminishing}} {{supply of the}} human fetal lung WI- 38 cell strain, a replacement for viral isolation is needed. Two candidates are the human fetal lung strains MRC- 5 and IMR- 90. A comparison of WI- 38, MRC- 5, and IMR- 90 was performed to evaluate efficiency and speed of viral isolation, clarity of <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect,</b> and ease of growing the cells. The inocula were clinical specimens rather than tissue culture-adapted isolates. Frozen samples of 46 specimens that had previously yielded an isolate on WI- 38 were thawed and inoculated onto WI- 38, MRC- 5, and IMR- 90 cells. In addition, 95 freshly taken clinical specimens uf undetermined infectivity were inoculated onto the cell strains. Viral recovery rates were similar on all three strains, as were the appearance and speed of onset of the <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect.</b> MRC- 5 and WI- 38 cells remained healthy until generation 36, whereas IMR- 90 cells went into crisis by generation 20. The longer life span of the MRC- 5 cells makes them more suitable than IMR- 90 cells to replace the WI- 38 strain for routine use in viral diagnosis...|$|E

There is currently no treatment or vaccine available for dengue infection. This study employed a whole-cell organism model or in vitro methods to study the inhibitory property of the flavanoid-derived compounds against DENV 2 activity. Results showed that at concentration not exceeding the maximum non-toxic dose (MNTD), these compounds completely prevented DENV 2 infection in HepG 2 cells as indicated by the absence of <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effects.</b> The in vitro antiviral activity assessed in HepG 2 cells employing virus inhibition assay showed high inhibitory activity in a dose dependent manner.

40|$|Free-living amoebae of {{the genus}} Acanthamoeba are the agents of both {{opportunistic}} and non-opportunistic infections and are frequently isolated from the environment. Of the 17 genotypes (T 1 -T 17) identified thus far, 4 (T 7, T 8, T 9, and T 17) accommodate the rarely investigated species of morphological group I, those that form large, star-shaped cysts. We report the isolation and characterization of 7 new Brazilian environmental Acanthamoeba isolates, all assigned to group I. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial (similar to 1200 bp) SSU rRNA gene sequences placed the new isolates in the robustly supported clade composed of the species of morphological group I. One of the Brazilian isolates {{is closely related to}} A. comandoni (genotype T 9), while the other 6, together with 2 isolates recently assigned to genotype T 17, form a homogeneous, well-supported group (2 - 0 % sequence divergence) that likely represents a new Acanthamoeba species. Thermotolerance, osmotolerance, and <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effects,</b> features often associated with pathogenic potential, were also examined. The results indicated that all 7 Brazilian isolates grow at temperatures up to 40 degrees C, and resist under hvperosmotic conditions.

40|$|Macrophages (M/M) are {{identified}} as the second cellular target of HIV and a crucial virus reservoir. M/M are persistently infected cells and not susceptible to the HIV <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effects</b> typical of infected CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. HIV replication in M/M is a crucial pathogenetic event during the whole course of the disease. Moreover, the dynamics of HIV- 1 replication and cumulative virus production is quite different in M/M and CD 4 + T-lymphocytes in the presence or {{in the absence of}} antiviral drugs. Thus, for their unique cellular characteristics, the activity of anti-HIV compounds could be different in M/M than in CD 4 + T-lymphocytes. Indeed, nucleoside analogues inhibitors of HIV-reverse transcriptase (NRTIs) show potent antiviral activity in macrophages, although the limited penetration of these compounds in sequestered body compartments and the scarce phosphorylation ability of macrophages, suggest that a phosphate group linked to NRTIs may confer a greater anti-HIV activity in such cells. The antiviral activity of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) in macrophages is similar to that found in CD 4 -lymphocytes. Interestingly, protease inhibitors (PIs), acting at post-integrational stages of virus replication, are the only drugs able to interfere with virus production and release from macrophages with established and persistent HIV infection. For these reasons, a careful analysis of the distribution of antiviral drugs, and the assessment of their activity in cells of macrophage lineage, represent key factors in the development of therapeutic strategies aimed to the treatment of the HIV-infected patients.

40|$|Abstract Background Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is an aquatic orthomyxovirus and the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISA), {{a disease of}} great importance in the Atlantic salmon farming industry. In vitro, ISAV infection causes <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> (CPE) in cell lines from Atlantic salmon, leading to rounding and finally detachment of the cells from the substratum. In this study, we investigated the mode of cell death during in vitro ISAV infection in different Atlantic salmon cell lines, using four ISAV strains causing different mortality in vivo. Results The results show that caspase 3 / 7 activity increased {{during the course of}} infection in ASK and SHK- 1 cells, infected cells showed increased surface expression of phosphatidylserine and increased PI uptake, compared to mock infected cells; and morphological alterations of the mitochondria were observed. Expression analysis of immune relevant genes revealed no correlation between in vivo mortality and expression, but good correlation in expression of interferon genes. Conclusion Results from this study indicate that there is both strain and cell type dependent differences in the virus-host interaction during ISAV infection. This is important to bear in mind when extrapolating in vitro findings to the in vivo situation. </p...|$|E

Probes for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human Parvovirus B 19 (B 19) and human adenovirus type 2 (HAd 2), were labeled with biotin- 11 -dUTP by nick-translation reaction. Streptavidin-alkaline-phosphatase (SAP) was used to detect biotin, followed by 4 -nitroblue tetrazolium/ 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) solution. Positive reaction was observed in nucleus of glandular ephitelium cells of decidua either in positive or in negative control at first and second gestational trimester. The reaction was not inhibited with blocking solution for alkaline phosphatase endogenous activity and it persisted even with probes omission.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that the bacterium Waddlia chondrophila, a novel member of the Chlamydiales order, is an agent of miscarriage in humans and abortion in ruminants. We thus investigated the permissivity of three epithelial cell lines, primate Vero kidney cells, human A 549 pneumocytes and human Ishikawa endometrial cells to this strict intracellular bacteria. Bacterial growth kinetics in these cell lines was assessed by quantitative PCR and immunofluorescence and our results demonstrated that W. chondrophila enters and efficiently multiplies in these epithelial cell lines. Additionally, confocal and electron microscopy indicated that the bacteria co-localize with host cell mitochondria. Within Vero and A 549 cells, intracellular growth of W. chondrophila was associated with a significant decrease in host cell viability while no such <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> was detected in Ishikawa cells. Bacterial cell growth in this endometrial cell line stopped 48 h after infection. This stop in the replication of W. chondrophila coincided with the appearance of large aberrant bodies, a form of the bacteria also observed in Chlamydiaceae and associated with persistence.

It is expected {{that in addition to}} direct oncolytic effect their action will also help eliciting a solid antitumor immunity. In presented series of experiments we have employed two HPV 16 - transformed mouse cell lines, TC- 1 and MK 16, and reovirus type 3, strain Dearing (RV). Both cell lines are highly susceptible to RV and produce large amounts of infectious virus in vitro. Still, some differences were encountered. When inoculating high doses of infected cells into syngeneic animals their oncogenic activity was strongly suppressed, nearly completely in the case of MK 16 cells but less efficiently in the case of more oncogenic TC- 1 cells. When immunized animals were challenged with TC- 1 cells, the irradiated cells proved to be a much better immunogen that the infected cells. However, when challenged with MK 16 cells the opposite was true. In another study we demonstrate that RV replicates preferentially in tumor cells and that the virus is able to overcome cellular adaptation to hypoxia (1 % O 2) and infect and kill hypoxic tumor cells.

To track the behavior of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in the infected cells in real time, we produced an infectious recombinant ASFV (B 54 GFP- 2) that expresses and incorporates into the virus particle a chimera of the p 54 envelope protein fused to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The incorporation of the fusion protein into the virus particle was confirmed immunologically and it was determined that p 54 -EGFP was fully functional by confirmation that the recombinant virus made normal-sized plaques and presented similar growth curves to the wild-type virus. The tagged virus was visualized as individual fluorescent particles during the first stages of infection and allowed to visualize the infection progression in living cells through the viral life cycle by confocal microscopy. In this work, diverse potential applications of B 54 GFP- 2 to study different aspects of ASFV infection are shown.

40|$|We {{describe}} an in vivo expression technology (IVET) - like approach, which uses antibiotic resistance for selection, to identify Shigella flexneri genes specifically activated in bacteria resident in host cell cytoplasm. This procedure required {{construction of a}} promoter-trap vector containing a synthetic operon between the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) and lacZ genes and construction of a library of plasmids carrying transcriptional fusions between S. flexneri genomic fragments and the cat–lacZ operon. Clones exhibiting low levels (< 10 μg ml− 1) of chloramphenicol (Cm) resistance on laboratory media were analysed {{for their ability to}} induce a <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> – plaque – on a cell monolayer, in the presence of Cm. These clones were assumed to carry a plasmid in which the cloned fragment acted as a promoter/gene which is poorly expressed under laboratory conditions. Therefore, only strains harbouring fusion-plasmids in which the cloned promoter was specifically activated within host cytoplasm could survive within the cell monolayer in the presence of Cm and give a positive result in the plaque assay. Pai (plaque assay induced) clones, selected following this procedure, were analysed for intracellular (i) b-galactosidase activity, (ii) proliferation in the presence of Cm, and (iii) Cm resistance.

40|$|Macrophages {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} HIV- 1 target cells. Unlike CD 4 (+) T cells, macrophages are resistant to the <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> of HIV- 1. They are able to produce and harbor the virus for long periods acting as a viral reservoir. Candida albicans (CA) is a commensal fungus that colonizes the portals of HIV- 1 entry, such as the vagina and the rectum, and becomes an aggressive pathogen in AIDS patients. In this study, we analyzed the ability of CA to modulate the course of HIV- 1 infection in human monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that CA abrogated HIV- 1 replication in macrophages when it was evaluated 7 days after virus inoculation. A similar inhibitory effect was observed in monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The analysis of the mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of HIV- 1 production in macrophages revealed that CA efficiently sequesters HIV- 1 particles avoiding its infectivity. Moreover, by acting on macrophages themselves, CA diminishes their permissibility to HIV- 1 infection by reducing the expression of CD 4, enhancing the production of the CCR 5 -interacting chemokines CCL 3 /MIP- 1 α, CCL 4 /MIP- 1 β, and CCL 5 /RANTES, and stimulating the production of interferon-α and the restriction factors APOBEC 3 G, APOBEC 3 F, and tetherin. Interestingly, abrogation of HIV- 1 replication was overcome when the infection of macrophages was evaluated 2 - 3 weeks after virus inoculation. However, this reactivation of HIV- 1 infection could be silenced by CA when added periodically to HIV- 1 -challenged macrophages. The induction of a silent HIV- 1 infection in macrophages at the periphery, where cells are continuously confronted with CA, might help HIV- 1 to evade the immune response and to promote resistance to antiretroviral therapy...|$|E

Fecha de lectura: 24 - 09 - 2004 This work {{is devoted}} {{to the study of the}} neutralization and evolution of the human immunodeficiency vims type- 1 (HN- 1) within patients. HN- 1 neutralizating antibodies are difficult to detect. The efficiency of a plaque assay (PA) in MT- 4 cells to detect the neutralization HiV- 1 was compared to the endpoint neutralization assay (ENA) in MT- 2 cells. Two T cell adapted strains (MN and LAI) were neutralized with a pool of positive sera, a patient serum or a human Fab antibody fragment. These results demonstrate a higher sensitivity of the PA method for the estimation of HIV- 1 neutdizing antibodies and that the pool of positive sera was the most neutralizing reagent. In our study, LA 1 strain was more resistant to neutralization than the MN. Sequence analysis showed genomic changes in sites of asparagines-linked glycans and a single amino acid change (S 244 P) in the gp 120 that could be responsible for the phenotypic neutralization difference. The PA offers an important advantage because it permits the selection of biologicai clones. We randomly picked 2 plaques with different <b>cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> and neutralization pattem. Clone sequence analysis showed genomic changes in a site of asparagines-linked glycans and a single amino acid change in the gp 120 could be responsible for the phenoiypic change of each MN clones. We analized the neutralization in a set of spanish patients. Different susceptibility of neutralization was found. Sera from a patient infected with a subtype F isolate, showed crossreactive neutralizing antibodies against subtype B virus. Those viruses best adapted to tissue culture conditions contained shortex variable loops than the majonty of those in the quasispecies of the primary isolates.

40|$|Introduction: Genital Herpes is {{the major}} cause of genito-ulcerative disease {{affecting}} {{a considerable number of}} individuals worldwide and is a chronic, life-long viral infection caused by both HSV 1 or HSV 2. Most cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by HSV 2, being the leading cause of genital ulcer disease in developing countries, but the proportion of anogenital herpetic infections attributed to HSV 1 are increasing, especially in young women and MSM. The prevalence in the general population ranges from 10 % to 80 % and depends on socio-economic factors. Seropositivity rates are higher in women than in men and increase with age. Reactivation and subclinical shedding is more frequent in genital infections caused by HSV 2 than by HSV 1, which reaffirm the importance of laboratory confirmation of clinical diagnosis. Aims: Retrospective study of the role of HSV 1 and HSV 2 infections in genital ulcerations from a population of a Sexually Transmitted Diseases Outpatient Clinic, according to epidemiological, laboratory and clinical data. Methodology: 56 ulcer genital/urethral swabs from patients suspected of HSV infection were sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH), in Lisbon, between April 2015 –April 2016. HSV 1 and HSV 2 were determined by a quantitative commercial real-time PCR kit, which targets a fragment of 162 bp of a region located in the US 7 gene for HSV 1 and a fragment of 177 bp of a region located in the US 2 gene for HSV 2. The 56 swabs were also inoculated in Vero cell cultures for determination of cytopathic effect. Results: HSV infection in genital/urethral swabs were detected in 30 (53. 6 %) of 56 samples. The symptoms of the positive cases were genital ulcerations in vulva or penis and/or perineum and the clinical diagnosis was genital herpes infection. In 7 of the 30 positive cases (23. 3 %) HSV 1 DNA was detected (2 man and 5 women with age ranges between 17 and 27 years old); and in 23 of the 30 positive cases (76. 7 %) HSV 2 DNA was detected (18 man and 5 women, with age ranges between 17 and 62 years old). Five of the 7 HSV 1 positive cases were primoinfections (71. 4 %) and in the 23 HSV 2 positive cases, 3 (13. 0 %) were primoinfections and 8 (34. 8 %) were the first ulcer episode but not primoinfections. HSV DNA viral load values varied between 21848 – 87474493 cop/ml in HSV 1 cases and between 1177 – 31160846336 cop/ml in HSV 2 cases. We didn’t find direct correlation between viral load and primary vs recurrent infection although the higher viral load was found in HSV 2 first episode cases. <b>Cytophatic</b> <b>effect</b> was observed in all positive PCR cases. All positive cases were treated with valacyclovir and resolved after treatment. Comments: To identify HSV genital infections is important for the specific treatment, for preventing the transmission of HSV to partners, and to prevent the risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV. In our study 53. 6 % cases were positive for HSV genital infection; because of social, demographic and migratory tendency, the population at risk for STI continues to grow and experience an increased burden of disease. We also observed in this population an increasing proportion of HSV 1 genital primoinfection, which is in accordance to the literature. In the present study we confirmed the usefulness of real-time PCR for HSV DNA detection in genital ulcerations. Concerning the correlation of viral load with subtype, the differences should be further evaluated with an increase number of clinical cases. N/...|$|E
