40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} Brigham Young 2 ̆ 7 s theology was his {{inclusion of a}} cosmology in his teachings. In his speeches as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Young juxtaposed cosmological pronouncements with practical advice. Young regularly opined on such topics as the eternal nature of matter and light and the interaction of gods and humans with these substances. Dovetailed to his cosmic musings was down-to-earth advice on raising children, avoiding the evils of the gold rush, and controlling one 2 ̆ 7 s temper. This paper argues that Young 2 ̆ 7 s mingling of the abstruse with the mundane functioned as a theodicy for the nineteenth-century Mormons. In order to justify an omnipotent God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon suffering and persecution, Young framed God and the human experience within a cosmology. He taught that humans exist with {{the express purpose of}} accumulating light and truth. This accumulation would continue after death throughout eternity. Young taught that an ineluctable factor in this progression was suffering and for this reason, Young condoned God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of Mormon hardship. By weaving these cosmological teachings with his pragmatic counsel, Young taught the Latter-day Saints to view their daily lives [...] full of struggles, pain, and fear [...] within a cosmological framework. Young believed that such a mindset would bolster the faith of the benighted Mormons...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{debates about}} the merits of {{one form or another}} of day care {{frequently}} miss some significant issues and hence some of the important policy options may be ruled out or in for the wrong reasons. Here, child day care is layed on a spectrum one end of which offers maximum market freedom in the form of income redistribution, a negative income tax, children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance,</b> or other transfer assistance, to be spent on the market if so desired for day care services, and {{on the other end of}} the spectrum a system of comprehensive child day care centers. In between are various mixtures of the two and various special blends like voucher systems. Hopefully, by so arraying the issues and discussing them certain similarities between antipoverty and child care policy become evident and certain problems of transfers in cash or provision in kind can be clarified. Various day care policy options are discussed in relationship to assumptions that they make about cost, theories of child development, definitions of universality, the preference of parents, returns to scale, economic rationality, market responsiveness, quality, consumer democracy, and citizen control. Finally three central issues which lie outside of this analysis, freedom, political environment, and the target group to whom day care should be directed are discussed. In this discussion the point is made that day care is best conceived of as directed toward mothers not toward children or families. It is the mother who is most in need of the benefit of day care policy most of the time and to whom reasonable policy of day care should be directed. This consideration quite alters what seem fairly reasonable conclusions in favor of market day care in favor of day care by voucher or by direct service...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores Toni Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s {{most prevalent}} motifs: the ghost, the orphan, and the outlaw. Each figure advances {{a critique of}} dominant narratives, specifically those that comprise history, family, and the law. In Chapter One, I argue that Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s ghost stories contrast two methods of memory, one that is authoritative and another that is imaginative, in order to counter the official renderings of history. Her ghosts signal forgotten aspects of American history and provide access to another storyline [...] one that lies {{in the shadows of}} the novel 2 ̆ 7 s principal narrative. This chapter compares the ghosts of Love and Home in order to show how Morrison uses ghosts as conduits of a subversive individual and communal memory. In my second chapter, I assert a reading of Morrison 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>orphans</b> as blues figures. They attest to the destructive effects of race, class, and gender oppression, which render her characters biologically and culturally orphaned. I conclude this chapter by comparing Paradise and A Mercy to show how Morrison 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>orphaned</b> characters posit an alternative model of kinship that is built from the shared project of liberation. In Chapter Three, I examine Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the law and its foil [...] the outlaw. I argue that Morrison foregrounds criminality in the absence of the law and its apparatuses (courts, police) in order to subvert the social institutions that give rise to the ghost and the orphan. I compare the crimes at the heart of Tar Baby and Jazz in order to posit another notion of justice operating in Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s fiction. When looked at together, Morrison 2 ̆ 7 s triptych threatens the coherence of governing ideologies and offers a meditation on the transformative possibilities of narrative...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} 10 years, much {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on the importance of breakfast for people of all ages. Nutritionists have pointed out that persons who eat a hearty breakfast show fewer signs of mid-morning fatigue, have or develop better work habits, and do not get as hungry as those who eat little or no breakfast. Many people do not realize the importance of starting the day with a good breakfast. The 12 to 13 hour fast which the body undergoes from the evening meal until breakfast time requires the consumption of an adequate breakfast. Many poor breakfasts may be attributed to either failure {{to take the time to}} eat, or to not understanding the necessity of an adequate breakfast. Nationwide surveys report that a large number of adolescents and adults fail to receive the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of their caloric and nutrient needs at breakfast. A basic breakfast pattern has been developed to aid in planning an adequate breakfast that will supply 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the calories and other nutrients needed each day. It includes fruit, cereal and/or egg, milk, bread and butter, yet it allows for a wide variation in menus. it is economical and can be easy to prepare. A breakfast of these foods insures one of less morning fatigue and better feeling during the morning and all day long. Studies show that breakfast is the most frequently missed meal. Many of the subjects who did not eat breakfast had a total day 2 ̆ 7 s intake that was classified as poor. Eating two meals a day failed to make up for the deficiency in nutrients. Breakfast consumption shows a direct relationship to the diet score, proof of the fact omitting breakfast is a poor start for the day. At the ages when an individual needs a larger intake of calories and nutrients, many times there is an actual decrease in the intake of nutritions food. The adolescents are noted for this inverse relationship between their nutritive needs and their actual intake. Galloway and Wilcox (1954), in a Utah study of school children, found that the breakfast meal did not furnish the recommended 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 of the day 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories and many of the other nutrients. The noon and evening meals furnished a larger percentage of most nutrients to their diets. The number of children in the study by Galloway, et al., (1954) was somewhat limited.

40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{governmental}} agencies have increasingly turned to market based {{cap and trade}} programs to control the emission of pollutants. Firms subject to cap and trade regulation are typically required to acquire emissions allowances via open auction markets. The cost to acquire allowances may impose a substantial financial burden on a firm. While emissions reduction efforts may eliminate some firm 2 ̆ 7 s need to acquire additional allowances, there are still numerous firms that need to purchase additional allowances on the open market. This study presents a new forward buying heuristic, designed for those firms that need to purchase emissions allowances via auctions, which reduces the impact of emissions allowance acquisitions on the firms 2 ̆ 7 financial performance. The heuristic, designated as the Newsvendor Production Planning with Emissions Allowance Forward Buying (NPPAFB) method, applies a forward buying algorithm {{to determine the number}} of periods for which to forward buy allowances, the current production order up to level, and the current and future emissions allowance requirements (which serves as the order up to level for allowance purchases).

These results indicate that heuristic can be readily adopted by any firm that is required to procure emissions allowances via open markets in an effort to improve the firm 2 ̆ 7 s profitability...|$|R

When including realistic concentrations for species not measured by ATMOS, i. e., the source gases CH 3 CCl 3, and C 2 F 3 Cl 3 below 25 km, and the reservoirs ClO, HOCl and COFCl between 15 and 40 km (five gases actually measured by other techniques), the 30 -degrees-N zonal 1985 mean total mixing ratio of chlorine, Cl, was found to be equal to (2. 58 +/- 0. 10) ppbv (parts per billion by volume) throughout the stratosphere, with no significant decrease near the stratopause. The results for total fluorine indicate a slight, but steady, decrease of its volume mixing ratio with increasing altitude, around a mean stratospheric value of (1. 15 +/- 0. 12) ppbv.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{two questions}} of consumers' motor vehicle purchase and utilization. Both {{are related to}} policy variation induced by the U. <b>S.</b> Car <b>Allowance</b> Rebate System, better known as "Cash for Clunkers. " First, we directly investigate the impact of Cash for Clunkers, which was an economic stimulus program aimed at increasing new vehicle spending by subsidizing the replacement of older vehicles. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show the increase in sales during the two month program was completely offset during the following seven to nine months, consistent with previous research. However, we also find the program's fuel efficiency restrictions induced the purchase of more fuel efficient but less expensive vehicles, thereby reducing industry revenues by three billion dollars over the entire nine to eleven month period. This highlights {{the conflict between the}} stimulus and environmental objectives of the policy. Second, we investigate a related topic. Due to the high political costs of raising the tax rate on gasoline, the United States government combats the negative externalities associated with gasoline consumption by regulating the fuel efficiency of new cars sold. However, the success of these Corporate Average Fuel Economy restrictions depends crucially on whether inducing households to drive more fuel efficient cars causes them to drive more miles, which would offset {{some or all of the}} reduction in gasoline consumption. We examine this question by applying a regression discontinuity design to exploit the increase in vehicle fuel efficiency induced among new car buyers in Texas during the Cash for Clunkers program in 2009. While new car buyers whose "clunker" was barely eligible for the subsidy drove a similar number of miles per year prior to the policy and are similar in other ways to barely ineligible new car buyers, they bought significantly more fuel efficient vehicles. However, they did not respond by driving more miles following the program. As a result, the increased fuel economy reduced gasoline consumption proportionally. This suggests that behavioral responses do not undermine the effectiveness of fuel efficiency standards...|$|R

40|$|Small firms {{often have}} {{inadequate}} {{access to the}} capital necessary for sucessful management. The Swedish Government introduced in the mid- 1990 <b>s</b> <b>allowance</b> rules that facilitate retention of profit for sole proprietorships and partnership firms. The tax credits arising from the allowances give certain benefits {{as a source of}} financing compared to traditional forms of credits. Among the more essential benefits are that the payment for some parts of the tax credit can be put on hold almost indefinitely, or alternatively never be paid. The firms are free to use these means, and the responsibility of future payment of the postponed tax debt stays with the individual firms. The comprehensive purpose of the dissertation may be stated as to increase the understanding of small Swedish firms, especially sole proprietorships, utilizing possibilities for allowances for income smoothing and internal financing. At the beginning the dissertation describes case studies, comprising a smaller selection of microfirms. With a starting-point from the accounted and reported income-tax returns, alternative calculations are made where additional positive tax and finance effects appear possible to obtain. One purpose of these studies is to increase the insight regarding the possibilities of income smoothing and internal financing that arise from utilizing these allowances. These studies also illuminate, to what extent and in what way they are being used in reality. Another objective of these studies is to give a more substantive insight into the technics behind the different allowances, appropriation to positive or negative interest rate allocation appropriation or dissolving of tax allocation reserve appropriation or dissolving of “expansion fund” Theories regarding the creation of resources, through building of capital, and theories on financial planning and strategy are studied. The purpose is to find support for the choice of theoretical grounded underlying independent variables {{that can be used in}} cross-sectional studies to explain the use of the possibilities of appropriations. Theories of finance that are of greatest interest, in the operationalisation of these variables, are theories that discuss the choices of different financing alternatives for small firms. The “pecking order theory”, describes the firm’s order of priority when choices of finance alternatives are made. The concept of “financial bootstrapping” expands the frame for different forms of financing choices that especially very small firms have at their disposal. The last part of the theoretical frame deals with the phenomenon of “income smoothing,” which can be translated as leveling out profits/losses. A number of financial and non-financial variables are supported by and operationalised from these financial theories e. g., return on sales, capital turnover, quick ratio and debt-to-equity ratio, respectively age, gender and line of business. Cross-sectional studies are implemented for the taxation years of 1996 and 1999, on databases that have been extracted from Statistics Sweden. The group of 87, 276 sole proprietorships included in the study were required to complete tax returns and pay taxes for the business activity according to the supporting schedule, N 2, information from the sole proprietorships’ income statement and balance sheet in an accounting statement that comes with the income tax return form. The possibilities of allowances are considered as dependent variables. The intention of the cross-sectional studies is to survey and describe the utilization of possible allowances, with the support of the financial and non-financial independent variables. The connection of these variables to the decision of sole proprietorships to appropriate to the tax allocation reserve is also summarized in a logistic regression model. A number of theoretically based propositions are made for the purpose of observing how the variables are connected to the chances that sole proprietorships actually appropriate to this form of allowance. Appropriation to the tax allocation reserve stands out as the most practiced form of allowance. The studies also clarify that utilization varies among different forms of allowances, but that not all firms that have the prerequisites to utilize the possibilities really do so to the full. A further utilization of the different possibilities of allowances is often conceivable. For the sole proprietorships that are not utilizing these possibilities, the allowances should be considered eligible as a contribution to internal financing and to increase access to capital...|$|R

40|$|Several {{programs}} have been proposed to improve incentives for research on vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV, and to help increase accessibility of vaccines once they are developed. For these programs to spur research, potential vaccine developers must believe that the sponsor will not renege on the commitment once research costs have been sunk. Given appropriate legal language, the key determinant of credibility will be eligibility and pricing rules, rather than whether funds are physically placed in separate accounts. Requiring candidate vaccines to meet basic technical requirements would help ensure that funds were spent only on effective vaccines. Requiring developing countries to contribute co-payments would help ensure that they felt that the vaccines were useful given the conditions in their countries. Purchases under a vaccine purchase program could be the conditions in their countries. Purchases under a vaccine purchase program could be governed by a market exclusivity provision {{similar to that in}} the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Orphan</b> Drug Act. A program could start by offering a modest price and increasing it if it proved inadequate to spur research. If donors pledge approximately $ 250 million per year for each vaccine for ten years, vaccine purchases would cost approximately $ 10 per year of life saved. No funds would be spent or pledges called unless a vaccine were developed. ...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{intake of}} ascorbic acid is {{essential}} for optimum health in human beings. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have an increased need for ascorbic acid, because of increased loss through dialysate, reduced intake owing to nausea and loss of appetite, and increased oxidative stress. However, optimum intake is still controversial. We studied 50 clinically stable patients to determine the relationship between oral ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid (SAA) level. Total oral intake ranged from 28 mg daily to 412 mg daily. Only one patient had an oral intake of ascorbic acid below 60 mg per day. The SAA levels ranged from 1 mg/L to 36. 17 mg/L. Although a strong correlation existed between intake and SAA (p < 0. 001, R 2 = 0. 47), the variation in SAA at any given intake level was wide. Of the studied patients, 62 % had an SAA < 8. 7 mg/L, 40 % had an SAA < 5. 1 mg/L (below the level in a healthy population), and 12 % had a level below 2 mg/L (scorbutic). None of the patients demonstrated clinical manifestations of scurvy. Our results show that, in CAPD patients, ascorbic acid deficiency can be reliably detected only with SAA measurements, and oral intake may influence SAA level. To maintain ascorbic acid in the normal range for healthy adults, daily oral intake needs to be increased above the U. <b>S.</b> recommended dietary <b>allowance</b> to 80 - 140 mg...|$|R
40|$|Solidago canadensis L., (Asteraceae) {{has been}} used in European {{phytotherapy}} as a urological and antiphlogistical remedy for centuries. The behaviour of dissolution of mineral elements into different tinctures and aqueous extracts obtained from Solidaginis herba was investigated in connection with their quercetin glycoside and organic acid amount. Commonly applied aqueous and alcoholic extracts were analysed for Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Ti, V and Zn content. The concentrations of the minerals examined were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Determination of the flavonoids in solidaginis herba and extracts was carried out by a spectrophotometric method, as required by the German Pharmacopoea. For the study of the flavonoid composition of crude drug, the HPLC technique was applied. To determine the relative nutrient contribution of these pharmaceuticals to the diet, data obtained were combined with flavonoid content particulars, then a comparison with U. <b>S</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances</b> (RDA) was made. For evaluation of the phytotherapeutic relevance, k/Na ratio was also calculated. It has been found that the pharmaceuticals examined are important sources of potassium, chromium, manganese, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and lower sources of iron and zinc, assuming a daily intake of 1 - 2 l aqueous extracts as recommended for urological diseases. Flavonoid content of the different Solidaginis herba extracts ranged from 62. 4 mg l- 1 to 305. 2 mg l- 1...|$|R
40|$|Similarity {{between the}} ligand binding {{profiles}} of enzymes may aid functional characterization and be of greater relevance to inhibitor development than sequence similarity or structural homology. Fragment screening is an efficient approach for {{characterization of the}} ligand binding profile of an enzyme and has been applied here to study the family of cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450 s) expressed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The Mtb P 450 s have important roles in bacterial virulence, survival, and pathogenicity. Comparing the fragment profiles of seven of these enzymes revealed that P 450 s which share a similar biological function have significantly similar fragment profiles, whereas functionally unrelated or <b>orphan</b> P 450 <b>s</b> exhibit distinct ligand binding properties, despite overall high structural homology. Chemical structures that exhibit promiscuous binding between enzymes have been identified, as have selective fragments that could provide leads for inhibitor development. The similarity between the fragment binding profiles of the orphan enzyme CYP 144 A 1 and CYP 121 A 1, a characterized enzyme that is important for Mtb viability, provides a case study illustrating the subsequent identification of novel CYP 144 A 1 ligands. The different binding modes of these compounds to CYP 144 A 1 provide insight into structural and dynamic aspects of the enzyme, possible biological function, and provide {{the opportunity to develop}} inhibitors. Expanding this fragment profiling approach to include a greater number of functionally characterized and orphan proteins may provide a valuable resource for understanding enzyme−ligand interactions...|$|R
40|$|A bilingual, {{multidisciplinary}} team {{of health}} professionals collaborated with a migrant health center in North Carolina {{to develop a}} model program to deliver primary health care services to migrant farmworker women and children. The program included case finding and outreach, coordination of {{maternal and child health}} services locally as well as interstate, and innovative health education programming. Data were collected on the health status of 359 pregnant migrant farmworker women and 560 children, ages birth to 5 years, the majority of Mexican descent, who received primary care services at the center. The mean age of the women was 23. 1 years and their mean gravidity was 2. 9. Dietary assessments showed that the protein intakes of most met or exceeded the U. <b>S.</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances,</b> but their consumption of foods in the milk-dairy group and the fruit-vegetable group was below recommended standards. Low hematocrit was a common problem among the women (43 percent) and, to a lesser extent, among the children (26 percent). Among the infants and children, 18 percent were obese. Black American women had the highest proportion of low birth weight infants. The project emphasized coordinated services for migrant farmworker mothers and children, such as transportation services, language translation, followup, and advocacy. An outreach strategy involved case finding, home visits, and services by lay health advisors. By the third year of the project, there were increases in the average number of prenatal visits, the proportion of women entering prenatal care in their first trimester, and in the use of well-child services.

40|$|We have {{recently}} completed a search of 6 years of archival BATSE data for gamma-ray bursts (GRBS) that were too faint to activate the real-time burst detection system running on board the spacecraft. These "nontriggered" bursts can be combined with the "triggered" bursts detected on board to produce a GRB intensity distribution that reaches peak fluxes a factor of approximately 2 lower than could be studied previously. The value of the statistic (in Euclidean space) for the bursts we detect is 0. 177 plus or minus 0. 006. This surprisingly low value is obtained because we detected very few bursts on the 4. 096 s and 8. 192 s timescales (where most bursts have their highest signal-to-noise ratio) that were not already detected on the 1. 024 <b>s</b> timescale. If <b>allowance</b> is made for a power-law distribution of intrinsic peak luminosities, the extended peak flux distribution is consistent with models in which the redshift distribution of the gamma-ray burst rate approximately traces the star formation history of the universe. We argue that this class of models is preferred over those in which the burst rate is independent of redshift. We use the peak flux distribution to derive a limit of 10 % (99 % confidence) on the {{fraction of the total}} burst rate that could be contributed by a spatially homogeneous (in Euclidean space) subpopulation of burst sources, such as type lb/c supernovae. These results lend support to the conclusions of previous studies predicting that relatively few faint "classical" GRBs will be found below the BATSE onboard detection threshold...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} dietary {{supplements}} (DS) are popularly taken by young individuals. We surveyed 1, 190 Korean {{senior high school}} third grade students for their DS use, motivational factors for this use, and potential dietary consequences of vitamin/mineral supplement (VMS) use. The use prevalence of DS—including VMS, tonic medicines, manufactured health food supplements, cordial food supplements, and drink rehabilitators—was 54 %. VMS were taken most frequently, followed by tonic medicines and manufactured health food supplements. VMS use was highest in individuals who had a significant concern for their overall health and in those from families with a high socioeconomic level and with parental use of DS. Total daily study time of DS users was only slightly longer than that of nonusers. The VMS most frequently used were vitamin C and multivitamins. More than 46 % of other DS users, and 58 % of VMS users, had increased their intake of supplements during third grade relative to the previous year. VMS users had a more positive view of the potential health benefit of VMS than did nonusers. Vitamin and mineral intakes from VMS occurred over a wide range, with mean intakes typically exceeding the Korean and Canadian-U. <b>S.</b> Recommended Dietary <b>Allowances.</b> For {{a significant number of}} individuals, intakes of vitamin A, niacin, folic acid, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and zinc exceeded the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. Given the widespread use of DS by older teenagers, the contribution of these supplements to their overall health and well-being is a subject that clearly merits additional study...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{tertiary}} structure is more conserved than amino acid sequence, {{leading to a}} diverse range of functions observed in the same fold. Despite CYP 199 A 2, a Class I P 450, accepts electrons from ferredoxins Pux and HaPux. Five orientation-dependent and one orientation-independent DEER measurements on paramagnetic HaPux and spin-labelled CYP 199 A 2 yielded vector restraints, which were applied to building {{a model of the}} CYP 199 A 2 :HaPux complex in silico. A different binding mode was observed compared to P 450 cam:Pdx and P 450 scc:Adx, both recently elucidated by X-ray crystallography. This protocol was also applied to the CYP 101 D 1 :Arx complex. The first three measurements indicate that this heterodimer does not have a similar orientation to CYP 199 A 2 :HaPux, P 450 cam:Pdx, or P 450 scc:Adx. P 450 cam was fused to putidatredoxin reductase (PdR) to explore the kinetic effects with a view to improving electron transfer to <b>orphan</b> P 450 <b>s.</b> Heme incorporation of this enzyme depends on linker length. In whole cells, the fusion was more active after longer incubations. In vitro kinetics of the fusion exhibited some co-operativity and enhanced kinetics over the unfused system under steady-state conditions. The putative iron-sulfur biosynthesis ferredoxin PuxB had been engineered by rational mutagenesis to support catalysis by CYP 199 A 2. It was confirmed this arose from improved protein-protein recognition. Engineering of E. coli ferredoxin based on these findings was carried out, resulting in electron-transfer to CYP 199 A 4 from a novel engineered alien ferredoxin.
