For fillet end-mill, because of its complexity geometry in flank and fillet parts, a free-form geometry model is needed for further analysis and optimization. Many research works have been conducted on building geometric model based on grinding tool path. In this thesis, a parametric and easy controlled method is proposed for design and modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface. First, the end and side clearance surface need to be established according to geometric parameters and constraints; Secondly, the fillet cutting edge is designed to achieve the machining requirement of the corner radius geometry, which is critical for the modeling of the fillet flank and the fillet rake surface face; Then, the surface of the fillet flank is supported by splines which derived from the customized two-dimensional corner.

To select {{reasonable}} cutting parameters, {{improve the}} processing surface quality, {{and extend the}} tool life, this paper uses four solid <b>carbide</b> <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> tools to process TC 4 titanium alloy, and analyses {{the influence of the}} difference cutting parameters and the geometric angles to chip shape. The experiment results indicate that the degree of serrated chip shape is increased by increasing the feed rate under the condition of certain spindle speed. But the degree of serrated chip shape may be decreased by the adoption of small axial and radial depth, or bigger rake angle and smaller helix angle. Select larger rake angle, cutting edge is sharp, the metal deformation of cutting layer is small, which can reduce the friction force when chip flowing through the tool rake face, so that the cutting force and cutting temperature decreases accordingly. The greater the helix angle is, the worse the chip removal conditions is, and the degree of serrated chip becomes larger, the blade is more sharp, easily crack, and the tool life decreases. So relatively small helix angle is better. The choice of angles is interrelated with each other, the selection of some angle separately cannot get the desired reasonable value...|$|R
