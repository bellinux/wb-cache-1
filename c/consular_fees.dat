60|$|Hotel de Louvre, January 12th.--This {{has been}} a bright day as regards weather; but I have done little or nothing worth recording. After breakfast, I set out in quest of the consul, and found him up a court, at 51 Rue Caumartin, in an office rather smaller, I think, than mine at Liverpool; but, to say the truth, a little better furnished. I was {{received}} in the outer apartment by an elderly, brisk-looking man, in whose air, respectful and subservient, and yet {{with a kind of}} authority in it, I recognized the vice-consul. He introduced me to Mr. ------, who sat writing in an inner room; a very gentlemanly, courteous, cool man of the world, whom I should take to be an excellent person for consul at Paris. He tells me that he has resided here some years, although his occupancy of the consulate dates only from November last. Consulting him respecting my passport, he gave me what appear good reasons why I should get all the necessary vises here; for example, that the vise of a minister carries more weight than that of a consul; and especially that an Austrian consul will never vise a passport unless he sees his minister's name upon it. Mr. ------ has travelled much in Italy, and {{ought to be able to}} give me sound advice. His opinion was, that at this season of the year I had better go by steamer to Civita Veechia, instead of landing at Leghorn, and thence journeying to Rome. On this point I shall decide when the time comes. As I left the office the vice-consul informed me that there was a charge of five francs and some sous for the consul's vise, a tax which surprised me,--the whole business of passports having been taken from consuls before I quitted office, and the <b>consular</b> <b>fee</b> having been annulled even earlier. However, no doubt Mr. ------ had a fair claim to my five francs; but, really, it is not half so pleasant to pay a <b>consular</b> <b>fee</b> as it used to be to receive it.|$|R
50|$|After the Kingdom {{was overthrown}} by a coup d'état led by Muammar Gaddafi in 1969, {{revenues}} of the Kingdom were overprinted L.A.R. in Arabic. A new design {{with a central}} octagon with rounded edges, surrounded by four rectangular panels was issued around 1970, and this design was reissued several times. A keytype with the country's coats of arms was issued for <b>Consular</b> Service, Passport <b>Fees</b> and War Tax between 1970 and 2002. There were various issues reflecting {{the changes in the}} coat of arms. Between 1974 and the 1990s there were also separate designs for Airport Tax, Medical Fee and Municipal Revenue issues.|$|R

60|$|It {{would seem}} from this {{that there had}} been a {{question}} of offering him a small diplomatic post; but the emoluments of the place were justly taken into account, and it is to be supposed that those of the consulate at Liverpool were at least as great as the salary of the American representative at Lisbon. Unfortunately, just after Hawthorne had taken possession of the former post, the salary attached to it was reduced by Congress, in an economical hour, to less than half the sum enjoyed by his predecessors. It was fixed at 7,500 dollars (£1,500); but the <b>consular</b> <b>fees,</b> which were often copious, were an added resource. At midsummer then, in 1853, Hawthorne was established in England.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the nature and}} the extent of use of customs fees and charges that affect imports at borders. It is part of a series of studies that analyse various types of non-tariff measures and the objective {{of this paper is to}} contribute to discussions in the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NAMA), the Council on Trade in Goods and elsewhere in the trade policy community. The analysis draws on data collected from WTO Trade Policy Reviews, non-tariff barrier notifications to NAMA, and the UNCTAD TRAINS database and country notes. The study reveals that most types of customs fees and charges on imports are applied ad valorem rather than with regard to the underlying costs of the services rendered. The use of customs fees and charges has also evolved over time: the use of both customs surcharges and <b>consular</b> invoice <b>fees</b> has markedly declined over the last two decades while more countries nowadays charge importers fees for the use of various customs-related services. custom fees, GATT article VIII, non-tariff measures, custom charges, non-tariff barriers...|$|R

The lawsuit exacerbated tensions within the increasingly partisan diplomatic corps in Paris. One of Skipwith's allies later reported Mountflorence to the French authorities. Mountflorence was tried for fraud. He was acquitted but nonetheless imprisoned for over a year.|$|E
