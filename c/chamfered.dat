5|$|The North-West and North-East towers {{behind the}} {{northern}} range are Norman in origin, from the 11th and early 12th century. When first built, {{they were created}} by pushing or folding {{the line of the}} curtain wall outwards to create the desired external shape, and then adding timber floors and a timber wall at the back, rather than being designed as individual buildings. The timber parts of the towers were later replaced in stone, and incorporated into the later range of buildings. The North-East Tower, also known as the Pendover Tower, was originally two-storeys high, with a third floor added on in the 14th century, followed by an extensive remodelling of the inside in the 16th century. It has <b>chamfered</b> angles on the external corners to make it harder to attack the stonework, although this has weakened the structural strength of the tower as a whole. The North-West Tower had similar <b>chamfered</b> corners, but the Closet Tower was built alongside it in the 13th century, altering the external appearance. Two more Norman towers survive in the innermost bailey, the West Tower, also known as the Postern Tower, because it contained a postern gate, and the South-West tower, also called the Oven Tower, on account of its cooking facilities. The Norman towers looked out towards Wales, probably to make a symbolic statement.|$|E
5|$|St Margaret's Church has a chancel, wide nave with {{a narrow}} {{clerestory}} above and narrow three-bay aisles on {{the north and south}} sides, a tall tower (topped with a spire) at the west end and a porch on the north side. The nave, chancel and chancel-arch all date from the 13th century. The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th-century origins: between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period, including <b>chamfered</b> arches, octagonal columns and squinch corners. Many of the windows also date from that century, while others are a century later; trefoil-headed designs predominate, but there are some larger square-headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well. Several other windows contain stained glass. The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched, with substantial king posts and tie-beams. It is also of medieval origin.|$|E

The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing.

5|$|Windows on {{the east}} façade are {{rectangular}} with eight windows at ground floor and five at first floor, all with gothic frames.

The west range is surmounted by a 17th-century clock turret relocated from the south range when that was rebuilt. The bell is dated 1647.|$|E
5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with <b>chamfered,</b> polished edges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Deburring is a {{critical}} step {{in the manufacture of}} a machined part. The two-pass control concept of this paper removes burrs and produces a consistent <b>chamfer,</b> even with fixture, part, and robot errors. The approach requires a robot for gross positioning of the cutter and an around-the-arm end effector capable of measuring orthogonal force between cutter and workpiece, measuring cutter position with respect to end-effector frame of reference, and actively controlling the cutter-applied orthogonal force. In the first pass, compliance control (orthogonal to workpiece) removes burrs by programming the cutter to act as a low-pass filter on the burrs, where the cutter bandwidth is less than burr time-frequency content, while complying to the fixture, part, and robot errors. In the second pass, <b>chamfer</b> depth variations are smoothed out using <b>chamfer</b> control, where <b>chamfer</b> depth is controlled by computing an estimated real-time <b>chamfer</b> depth, and using this estimate in a feedback loop that varies the cutter-workpiece force to maintain a commanded <b>chamfer</b> depth. The <b>chamfer</b> depth estimator removes repeatable fixture, part, and robot errors by using cutter position measurements from the first pass. Cutting experiments on edges with burrs show that compliance control improved on the force control approach in compensating for burrs, and <b>chamfer</b> control was able to produce a consistent <b>chamfer</b> depth. Key Words: Deburring, active control, robotic...|$|R
5|$|The {{date that}} the {{building}} was first constructed is uncertain, with best estimates putting the build date during the Georgian era around the late 17th century as a timber-framed house; this {{is determined by the}} <b>chamfered</b> beams and the rectangular lobby entrance with the front door centrally-located, opening to back-to-back fireplaces with main rooms to the left and right, known as a 'baffle-entry' layout. It transitioned into use as a public house by 1754, which is a common origin of country pubs. It was mentioned in the Melville's Directory of 1858, with Joseph Charlton as the licensee. In 1895 William Sayer, a former landlord of the pub, was killed in a collapse at a nearby chalk mine. It appears on historical maps from 1867, 1897 and various others since, and was labelled as the Royal Oak Public House on all but the first. A number of brickworks were located adjacent to the pub in the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|E
