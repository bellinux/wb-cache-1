5|$|Faced {{with these}} {{proposals}} to examine nuclear {{power as a}} possible response to climate change, anti-nuclear campaigners and scientists in Australia emphasised claims that nuclear power could not significantly substitute for other power sources, and that uranium mining itself <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Anti-nuclear campaigns were given added impetus by public concern about the sites for possible reactors: fears exploited by anti-nuclear power political parties in the lead-up to a national election in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Orphaned {{children}} {{were given the}} right to choose their own guardians at age 14. At 16, males became eligible for military duty and were also considered adults for legal purposes, such as standing trial for crimes. Age 21 was the youngest at which a male <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> freeman, though for practical purposes this occurred some time in a man's mid-twenties. Twenty-one was the assumed age of inheritance, as well, although the law respected the rights of the deceased to name an earlier age in his will.|$|E

5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of asymmetric warfare and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|In 1711, Franciscan missionary Francisco Hidalgo, who {{had served}} in the earlier Texas missions, wanted to {{reestablish}} missions with the Caddos. The Spanish government was unwilling to provide the funding and troops for the project, so Hidalgo approached the French governor of Louisiana, Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac for help. Cadillac was under orders to turn Louisiana into a profitable colony and believed that Spanish settlers closer to Louisiana could provide new trading opportunities. He sent Louis Juchereau de St. Denis, along with brothers Pierre and Robert Talon, who, as children, had been spared at the massacre of Fort Saint Louis, to find Hidalgo and offer assistance. In July 1714, the French delegation reached the Spanish frontier, at that time around the Rio Grande, where Hidalgo was located. Although St. Denis was arrested and questioned, he was ultimately released. The Spanish recognized that the French <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> threat to other Spanish areas, and ordered the reoccupation of Texas as a buffer between French settlements in Louisiana and New Spain.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing it <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 {{were taken from the}} Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E
