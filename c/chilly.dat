50|$|Chilli peppers are {{indispensable}} to Malaysian kitchens, and both fresh and dried chilies are used. <b>Chillies</b> come in several sizes, shapes and even colours. As a general rule, two type of chilli cultivars {{are the most}} commonly available: the bird's eye chili (cili padi), although small in size are extremely pungent and very hot, and longer varieties {{which tend to be}} a lot milder. Green <b>chillies</b> are more peppery in taste while red <b>chillies,</b> green <b>chillies</b> which have been left to ripen, have a slightly sweeter heat. If a milder flavour is preferred, the seeds and membranes would be removed from the chili pods before it is cut, or the <b>chillies</b> would be left whole and removed prior to serving. Some common uses include {{but are not limited to}} grinding the <b>chillies</b> into a paste or sambal, chopping fresh <b>chillies</b> as a condiment or garnish, and pickling whole or cut <b>chillies.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A natural {{convection}} solar tunnel dryer {{was designed and}} developed for carrying out the experimental and comparison studies of drying characteristics of red <b>chillies</b> {{during the month of}} April, 2014 in Negamam region of Pollachi, Tamil Nadu (India). About 50 kgs of red <b>chillies</b> were loaded into the dryer and is repeated for three trails. The drying parameters such as drying time and product quality were taken into account to find out the best drying method for red <b>chillies.</b> The red <b>chillies</b> which has an initial moisture content of 72. 98 % (w. b.) was reduced to a final moisture content of 7. 5 % (w. b.) over a time period of 56 hours in the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer whereas the open sun drying method took 122 hours for reducing the moisture content of red <b>chillies</b> to the same level.

5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar the influx of frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly <b>chilly</b> or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E

Confederate General Sterling Price failed to gain control of Missouri in his 1861 offensive and retreated into Arkansas, leaving only the guerrillas to challenge Union dominance. Quantrill was at the time the most prominent guerrilla in the Kansas–Missouri area. In early 1863, William and Jim Anderson traveled to Jackson County, Missouri, to join him.

40|$|Dried <b>chillies</b> arepotential to {{substitute}} fresh <b>chillies</b> {{when the price}} of fresh <b>chillies</b> significantly increases, and its purchases were expected to determine by the household consumer 2 ̆ 7 s attitude. The aims of this researchare 1) to examine the household attitudes on dried Chilies purchasing bythe Theory of Planned Behavior approach, 2) to determine the determinant factors ofdried chilli buying intention, and 3) to estimate the cross-elasticity of dried Chili againsts fresh chilli. The results showed that household consumer attitude towards the purchase of dried <b>chillies,</b> in term of subjective norms,perceived behavioral control, and purchase intention, are in medium category. The determinant factors on purchase intention of dried Chilies (α = 10 percent) are the subjective norms, attitudes towards the purchase of dried Chilies, and household income per month. The dried chilli cross-elasticity valueis very inelastic (0. 069). Due to that, the policy implications in encouraging the dried chilli purchasing are the socialization of the dried chilli 2 ̆ 7 s benefits and sustain the avaibility of dried <b>chillies</b> in traditional markets...|$|R
5000|$|Red ChilliesThis {{town was}} famous for the red <b>chillies</b> which were grown in nearby villages. <b>Chillies</b> are for Bhiwapur what oranges are for Nagpur. But as the time progressed more and more farmers turned up soybean farming rather than <b>chillies</b> because the tedious jobs {{involved}} in chilli pepper farming and low yield {{as compared to the}} former. Comparatively low fertility of land and weather added to the worries of chilli pepper growers. So the landmark Bhiwapuri Mirchi(Chilli)is very rare to spot today. But still Bhiwapur and nearby area get large amount of <b>chillies</b> from all over India for processing. This involves drying up the <b>chillies</b> under the Sun, separating the stem from the pod, packing in gunny bags and transporting to respective destinations for further processing of consumption. This is the main source of employment for the local people who don't own land for farming.In year 2015 the town is become a nagar panchayat. The 17 no of ward are created in this town.Art BY.

Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.|$|E
5|$|The area {{generally}} has warm summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to}} day as well as from season to season. Its latitude means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing unsettled and windy weather particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fine weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. The two dominant influences on the climate of the Whitby area are shelter against the worst of the moist westerly winds provided by the North York Moors and the proximity of the North Sea. Late, <b>chilly</b> springs and warm summers are a feature of the area but there are often spells of fine autumn weather. Onshore winds in spring and early summer bring mists or low stratus clouds (known locally as sea frets) to the coast and moors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{samples of}} red <b>chillies</b> were packed in High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) bags and {{irradiated}} using 2, 4 and 6 kGy gamma radiation. The irradiated samples were stored {{at room temperature}} and relative humidity along with control (0 kGy) for 90 days. The samples were evaluated for proximate composition, total phenolics and aflatoxin. Irradiation and storage showed non-significant effect on proximate composition and total phenolics whereas irradiation showed significant effect on aflatoxins as compared to control. There was gradual decrease in aflatoxin contents with the increase level of gamma rays. It was concluded that red <b>chillies</b> for better quality retention can be safely stored in polyethylene bags.
