5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
50|$|Running {{an engine}} under low loads causes low <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> and {{consequent}} poor piston ring sealing since this {{relies on the}} gas pressure to force them against the oil film on the bores to form the seal. Low <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> causes poor combustion and resultant low combustion pressures and temperatures.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was undertaken at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to determine a suitable method for measuring the maximum pressures occurring in aircraft engine cylinders. The study and development of instruments for the measurement of maximum <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> has been conducted in connection with carburetor and oil engine investigations on a single cylinder aircraft-type engine. Five maximum cylinder-pressure devices have been designed, and tested, {{in addition to the}} testing of three commercial indicators. Values of maximum <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> are given as obtained with various indicators for the same pressures and for various kinds and values of maximum <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures,</b> produced chiefly by variation of the injection advance angle in high-speed oil engine. The investigations indicate that the greatest accuracy in determining maximum <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressures</b> can be obtained with an electric, balanced-pressure, diaphragm or disk-type indicator so constructed as to have a diaphragm or disk of relatively large area and minimum seat width and mass...|$|R

25|$|Breathing gas {{regulators}} {{will work}} efficiently {{down to a}} <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> slightly above the designed interstage pressure. This pressure may be called minimum functional <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure.</b> It will vary with depth as the nominal interstage pressure is additional to the ambient pressure.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the diaphragm type or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator. A balanced regulator keeps about the same ease of breathing at all depths and pressures, by using the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> to also indirectly oppose {{the opening of the}} first stage valve.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a diving {{regulator}} where the energy released as the air expands from <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> to the surrounding pressure as the diver inhales, is used to power a propeller has been patented, but no product ever appeared on the market.|$|E

25|$|Some early twin hose {{regulators}} were of single-stage design. The {{first stage}} functions {{in a way}} similar to {{the second stage of}} two-stage demand valves, but would be connected directly to the cylinder valve and reduced high pressure air from the cylinder directly to ambient pressure on demand. This could be done by using a longer lever and larger diameter diaphragm to control the valve movement, but there was a tendency for cracking pressure, and thus work of breathing, to vary as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> dropped.|$|E
25|$|If the {{pressure}} in the train line is {{lower than that of}} the reservoir, the brake cylinder exhaust portal is closed and air from the car's reservoir is fed into the brake <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Pressure</b> increases in the cylinder, applying the brakes, while decreasing in the reservoir. This action continues until equilibrium between the brake pipe pressure and reservoir pressure is achieved. At that point, the airflow from the reservoir to the brake cylinder is lapped off and the cylinder is maintained at a constant pressure.|$|E
25|$|The flow {{simulated}} on a flow bench bears {{almost no}} similarity to the flow {{in a real}} exhaust port. Here even the coefficients measured on flow benches are inaccurate. This {{is due to the}} very high and wide-ranging pressures and temperatures. From the graph above {{it can be seen that}} the pressure in the port reaches 2.5 bar (250 kPa) and the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> at opening is 6 bar (600 kPa) and more. This is many times more than the capabilities of a typical flow bench of 0.06 bar (6 kPa).|$|E

50|$|Medical air is {{compressed}} air supplied {{by a special}} air compressor, through a dryer (in order to maintain correct dew point levels), and distributed to patient care areas. In smaller facilities, medical air may also be supplied via high-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Pressures</b> are maintained around 345-380 kPa (50-55 psi).|$|R
25|$|Most {{regulators}} have two stages. The first stage is a fixed-pressure regulator, which releases {{gas from the}} cylinder at a constant intermediate pressure, despite the pressure in the cylinder falling as the gas in it is consumed. This {{is similar to the}} first stage of a scuba-diving regulator. The adjustable second stage of the regulator controls the pressure reduction from the intermediate pressure to the low outlet pressure. The regulator has two pressure gauges, one indicating <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure,</b> the other indicating hose pressure. The adjustment knob of the regulator is sometimes roughly calibrated for pressure, but an accurate setting requires observation of the gauge.|$|E
25|$|The {{triple valve}} is {{described}} as being so named as it performs three functions: Charging air into an air tank ready to be used, applying the brakes, and releasing them. In so doing, it supports certain other actions (i.e. it 'holds' or maintains the application and it permits the exhaust of brake <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> and the recharging of the reservoir during the release). In his patent application, Westinghouse refers to his 'triple-valve device' because of the three component valvular parts comprising it: the diaphragm-operated poppet valve feeding reservoir air to the brake cylinder, the reservoir charging valve, and the brake cylinder release valve. When he soon improved the device by removing the poppet valve action, these three components became the piston valve, the slide valve, and the graduating valve.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that all the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver some of it less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger cracking pressure to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the interstage pressure decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, in at least one regulator design, once the interstage pressure has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the residual gas to escape until the <b>cylinder</b> <b>pressure</b> has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E
