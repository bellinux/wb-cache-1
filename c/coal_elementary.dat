From J.C. Penny catalog copy to counterintelligence manuals and autopsy reports, War Rug is a fierce yet unfortunate reminder of the absolute horrors of our age.”—Mark Nowak, author of <b>Coal</b> Mountain <b>Elementary</b> ...|$|R

It is also a tribute to miners and working people everywhere. It manages, in photos and in words, to portray an entire culture. And it is a stunning educational tool.|$|R

40|$|This essay {{discusses}} my {{attempts to}} meet the enigmatic character of Percy Grainger in writing-namely, through the intersection of poetry and biography, {{in the composition of}} an original work, Suite for Percy Grainger. This work extends from, and contributes to, the tradition of documentary poetry. To locate my work within this tradition, I will first look at three distinctly different works of documentary poetry-Charles Reznikoff&# 039;s Holocaust (1975), Mark Nowak&# 039;s <b>Coal</b> mountain <b>elementary</b> (2009) and Susan Howe&# 039;s The nonconformist&# 039;s memorial (1993) -each of which draws on, and utilises, historical/archival documents in order to explore real-world subjects and events through poetic frameworks. The first half of this essay will discuss how each of these three poets retrieves, selects, incorporates and adapts archival source material, in order to present Suite for Percy, {{in the second half of}} the essay, as a work that both draws on a varied tradition of documentary poetry, whilst also establishing its own pathways as a poetic exploration of the past...|$|R
40|$|A study {{examined}} whether cross-grade peer tutoring increased student performance on weekly spelling tests. Subjects, 7 sixth graders and 19 second graders attending <b>Coal</b> City <b>Elementary</b> School in Raleigh County, West Virginia, spent 10 minutes {{each day for}} 9 weeks working on spelling. The experimental group used cross-grade peer tutoring and the control group used the traditional method. Results indicated that weekly spelling test scores were substantially higher for those students using cross-grade peer tutoring for 6 of the 9 weeks. Both second and sixth graders appeared to enjoy the procedure, grades improved, and spelling class became a class students looked forward to each day.

40|$|In {{the latter}} part of the twentieth century, North American poets such as Tom Wayman and Jim Daniels began to {{practise}} and theorize a poetry of the workplace that Wayman called the ?New Work Writing?. 1 This writing emerged to meet a perceived lack in the majority of twentieth-century literature: namely, writing specifically from and about the industrial workplace. This new work writing defined itself, in part, against socialist realism and the tendency in the ?proletarian literature? of the 1930 s to privilege politics above descriptions of the actual experience of work. However, the ?New Work Writing?, as theorized by Wayman, was in many ways just as prescriptive as socialist realism, and similarly sceptical of experimental modernism and its inheritors. It is somewhat ironic, then, that arguably the most prominent North American work-related poems of the twenty-first century have been written (or aggregated) by Mark Nowak, a formally experimental poet. 2 Much of the previous scholarly criticism of Nowak?s work has focused on the documentary aspects of his work. 3 This article, however, will discuss Nowak?s texts within the context of ?work writing?, and his attempts to reimagine this mode of writing as a transformatory social practice, through experiments on the page ? Shut Up Shut Down (2004) and <b>Coal</b> Mountain <b>Elementary</b> (2009) ? and beyond it in his transnational poetry dialogues. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{fact that}} the {{phenomena}} of nature are multivariate, makes the study of multivariate statistics {{one of the most}} interesting topics, because with them we can construct models much more faithful to reality. The complexity of many problems advises us to make numerous registries of a set of variables; thus we will obtain a great volume of data that constitute a matrix. Statistics includes procedures to identify a population, select a sample, recognize its elements or units of observation and decide the measurements to be done and the applicable, treatments (provided they exist). It also includes carrying out and registering the measurements and correctly interpreting the resulting data, in such a form that is possible to illustrate a decision based on them. The problem of environmental contamination is a multivariate phenomenon, and therefore, the application of statistics to the data is important to be able to infer, conclude and model future situations (Ormeño 1999). In this work we study, as an example, the application of statistics to some of the factors that take part in the atmospheric contamination to see how they specially affect the <b>elementary</b> <b>coal</b> formation. The study is begun with a descriptive analysis of the variables, then a graphical analysis is made to provide fast information on the episodes of higher coal concentration an...|$|R
