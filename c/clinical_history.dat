5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

25|$|The {{role of the}} {{renal biopsy}} is to {{diagnose}} renal disease in which the etiology is not clear based upon noninvasive means (<b>clinical</b> <b>history,</b> past medical history, medication history, physical exam, laboratory studies, imaging studies). In general, a renal pathologist will perform a detailed morphological evaluation and integrate the morphologic findings with the <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> and laboratory data, ultimately arriving at a pathological diagnosis. A renal pathologist is a physician who has undergone general training in anatomic pathology and additional specially training {{in the interpretation of}} renal biopsy specimens.|$|E

25|$|Acute kidney {{injury is}} {{diagnosed}} {{on the basis}} of <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> and laboratory data. A diagnosis is made when there is a rapid reduction in kidney function, as measured by serum creatinine, or based on a rapid reduction in urine output, termed oliguria (less than 400 mLs of urine per 24 hours).|$|E
25|$|For {{incidentally}} discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound {{by their}} pathognomonic echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of patient age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, {{which have a}} crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on <b>clinical</b> <b>history.</b> Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.|$|E

25|$|A {{detailed}} <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> {{and physical}} remain {{the most reliable}} tool to recognize a potential periprosthetic infection.

In those cases diagnostic tests can be useful in confirming or excluding infection.|$|E
25|$|Many {{modern style}} guides in the U.S. {{recommend}} against using homosexual as a noun, instead using gay man or lesbian. Similarly, some recommend completely avoiding usage of homosexual {{as it has}} a negative, <b>clinical</b> <b>history</b> and because the word only refers to one's sexual behavior (as opposed to romantic feelings) and thus it has a negative connotation.

2500|$|Clinical {{assessment}} can {{be characterized}} as a prediction problem where the purpose of assessment is to make inferences (predictions) about past, present, or future behavior. For example, many therapy decisions are {{made on the basis of}} what a clinician expects will help a patient make therapeutic gains. Once observations have been collected (e.g., psychological test results, diagnostic impressions, <b>clinical</b> <b>history,</b> X-ray, etc.), there are two mutually exclusive ways to combine those sources of information to arrive at a decision, diagnosis, or prediction. One way is to combine the data in an algorithmic, or [...] "mechanical" [...] fashion. Mechanical prediction methods are simply a mode of combination of data to arrive at a decision/prediction of behavior (e.g., treatment response). Mechanical prediction does not preclude any type of data from being combined; it can incorporate clinical judgments, properly coded, in the algorithm. The defining characteristic is that, once the data to be combined is given, the mechanical approach will make a prediction that is 100% reliable. That is, it will make exactly the same prediction for exactly the same data every time. Clinical prediction, on the other hand, does not guarantee this, as it depends on the decision-making processes of the clinician making the judgment, their current state of mind, and knowledge base.|$|E

40|$|In most {{hereditary}} cancer syndromes, {{finding a}} correspondence between various genetic mutations within a gene (genotype) and a patient's <b>clinical</b> cancer <b>history</b> (phenotype) is challenging; to date {{there are few}} clinically meaningful correlations between specific DNA intragenic mutations and corresponding cancer types. To define possible genotype and phenotype correlations, we evaluated the application of data mining methodology whereby the <b>clinical</b> cancer <b>histories</b> of gene-mutation-positive patients were used to define valid or "true" patterns for a specific DNA intragenic mutation. The <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> of patients with their corresponding detailed attributes without the same oncologic intragenic mutation were labeled incorrect or "false" patterns. The results of data mining technology yielded characterizing rules for the true cases that constituted clinical features which predicted the intragenic mutation. Some of the initial results derived correlations already independently known in the literature, adding to the confidence of using this methodological approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background To reduce {{inappropriate}} {{admissions and}} stays with {{the application of}} an improvement cycle in patients admitted to a University Hospital. The secondary objective is to analyze the hospital cost saved by reducing inadequacy after the implementation of measures proposed by the group for improvement. Methods Pre- and post-analysis of a sample of <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> studied retrospectively, in which the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) was applied to a representative hospital sample of 1350 <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> in two phases. In the first phase the AEP was applied retrospectively to 725 admissions and 1350 stays. The factors associated with inappropriateness were analysed together with the causes, and specific measures were implemented {{in a bid to}} reduce inappropriateness. In the second phase the AEP was reapplied to a similar group of <b>clinical</b> <b>histories</b> and the results of the two groups were compared. The cost of inappropriate stays was calculated by cost accounting. Setting: General University Hospital with 426 beds serving a population of 320, 000 inhabitants in the centre of Murcia, a city in south-eastern Spain. Results Inappropriate admissions were reduced significantly: 7. 4 % in the control group and 3. 2 % in the intervention group. Likewise, inappropriate stays decreased significantly from 24. 6 % to 10. 4 %. The cost of inappropriateness in the study sample fell from 147, 044 euros to 66, 642 euros. The causes of inappropriateness for which corrective measures were adopted were those that showed the most significant decrease. Conclusions It is possible to reduce inadequacy by applying measures based on prior analysis of the situation in each hospital. </p...|$|R
