25|$|The {{screenplay}} was Hanák's {{joint project}} with the writer Dušan Dušek (b. 1946). A graduate in {{natural history and}} geology, Dušek later became professor of screenwriting at the University of Performing Arts in Bratislava. The two wrote the screenplay during 1974-1975. The authorities delayed the shooting of Rosy Dreams for a year, because Hanák and Dušek refused to rewrite it with a socially optimistic ending that would have the two main characters getting married. Both authors did research in Romani settlements and fashioned their script accordingly. They hired Professor of Romani Studies Milena Hübschmannová (1933-2005) as <b>consultant,</b> <b>who</b> also helped with the Romani dialogues. Parts of the film were shot on location at Trhovište, an actual Romani village between Michalovce and Trebišov in eastern Slovakia, with all-Romani extras.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{returned}} to TNA on the March 3, 2011 episode of Impact!, declaring {{himself as the}} new owner of TNA, having won the court battle against Dixie Carter. In April, he began hinting at a possible return to the ring to face the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Sting. On the May 12 episode of the newly renamed Impact Wrestling, Hogan {{lost control of the}} program to Mick Foley, who revealed himself as the Network <b>consultant</b> <b>who</b> had been causing problems for Immortal ever since Hogan and Bischoff took over the company; however, this angle was cut short just three weeks later, when Foley left the promotion. During the following months, Hogan continued to interfere in Sting's matches, costing him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship first at Hardcore Justice, recruiting Kurt Angle to Immortal in the process, on the September 1 episode of Impact Wrestling and finally at No Surrender. On the September 15 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sting defeated Immortal member Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory. On October 4, it was reported that Hogan had signed a contract extension with TNA. After feigning retirement from professional wrestling, Hogan accepted the match at Bound for Glory on the October 6 episode of Impact Wrestling, while also agreeing to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting win the match.|$|E

His family was Jewish, and his grandparents had emigrated from Poland and Russia. Frank’s father ran a truck stop in Jersey City—a place Frank has described as [...] "totally corrupt"—and when Frank was 6 or 7, his father served a year in prison for refusing to testify {{to a grand jury}} against Frank’s uncle. [...] Frank was educated at Harvard College, where he resided in Matthews Hall his first year and then in Kirkland House and Winthrop House. He graduated in 1962. One of his roommates was Hastings Wyman of Aiken, South Carolina, later a political <b>consultant</b> <b>who</b> in 1978 began publishing The Southern Political Report. When Wyman invited Frank to visit Aiken in the early 1960s, Frank made a point of drinking from the since-abolished [...] "colored-only" [...] water fountain then available to African Americans.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was {{appointed}} to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fundraising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fundraising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations <b>consultant</b> <b>who</b> worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: [...] "It was that [...] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [...]" [...] Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with [...] "heavily Jewish" [...] donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working on the Clinton campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.|$|E
