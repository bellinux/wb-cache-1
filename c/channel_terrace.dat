30|$|In {{association}} with the September 27, 2014, phreatic eruption at Ontake Volcano, one syn-eruptive lahar and two post-eruptive lahars (a rain-triggered lahar on October 5, 2014, and a ROS-triggered lahar on April 20, 2015) occurred on the southern flank of the volcano. The October lahar was triggered by the first rainstorm after the eruption having[*]>[*] 10  mm/h precipitation, which was the second post-eruptive storm. The lahar was a cohesive debris flow that travelled 11  km and formed very poorly sorted, massive clay-rich deposits (10 – 20  wt% of clay in matrix, 2.9 [*]×[*] 105 m 3 in volume). Most of the deposit originated from hydrothermally altered eruption material deposited near the vents, on slopes, and in valleys {{at the head of}} the catchment. The April lahar was caused by the last and largest ROS event during the snowmelt season. The lahar flow was erosional in upstream reaches, due to vigorous bank and channel erosion that exposed older pre-event deposits. The ROS-triggered lahar left hyperconcentrated flow deposits in the upstream areas and normal streamflow deposits in the lower downstream areas, suggesting flow transformation. The ROS-induced lahar deposits are fines-depleted sandy gravels and gravelly sands, derived from fluvial gravel in the river <b>channel,</b> <b>terrace</b> deposits, and October lahar deposits. The present contribution reveals that the deposits and samples of the syn-eruptive lahar in Sasaki et al. (2016) were incorrectly described as those obtained from the rain-triggered October lahar. Therefore, the volume, thickness of deposits, travel distance, sedimentary characteristics, and components of the syn-eruptive lahar as well as the October lahar in Sasaki et al. (2016) should be reconsidered and carefully cited. The recognition of the syn-eruptive lahar deposits must be difficult because they were nominal volume of deposits, and possibly, they could have been buried and eroded by the following two post-eruptive lahars.|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of clearing native vegetation (Caatinga) in contour strips at 25 cm vertical interval on evaporation losses in cleared strips, annual runoff efficiency and annuall soil loss on gently sloped micro-waterheds in the arid zones of Northeast Brazil are reported. The alternate native vegetation (Caatinga) strips function very effectively as windbreaks thus reducing evaporation losses substantially in the leeward cleared strips. The runoff {{measured at the}} micro-watershed with cleared strips was many-fold lower than the runoff obtained at a completely denuded watershed {{even when it was}} protected by narrow based <b>channel</b> <b>terraces.</b> However, the annual runoff efficiency can be significantly increased in a strip cleared watershed if narrow based <b>channel</b> <b>terraces</b> are provided on the lower side of cleared strips. The annual soil losses in strip cleared watersheds as well as completely denuded waterhed of gentle slopes were negligible. Thus clearing land in alternate contour strips on a micro-watersheds shall substantially improve crop water use efficiency without creating any significant erosion problems.

Adjacent to this channel along the Spanish and Moroccan margins, and near the Strait of Gibraltar, several submarine terraces developed at different depths suggest a pulsed flooding of the Alboran Basin. There could have been two major inflow phases of Atlantic water, one shortly before and another during the Zanclean flooding, the latter accompanied by periods of relative sea-level stillstands that enabled terrace development.

40|$|A {{study on}} flood water {{infiltration}} and ground water recharge of a shallow alluvial aquifer {{was conducted in}} the hyperarid section of the Kuiseb River, Namibia. The study site was selected to represent a typical desert ephemeral river. An instrumental setup allowed, for the first time, continuous monitoring of infiltration during a flood event through the channel bed and the entire vadose zone. The monitoring system included flexible time domain reflectometry probes that were designed to measure the temporal variation in vadose zone water content and instruments to concurrently measure the levels of flood and ground water. A sequence of five individual floods was monitored {{during the rainy season}} in early summer 2006. These newly generated data served to elucidate the dynamics of flood water infiltration. Each flood initiated an infiltration event which was expressed in wetting of the vadose zone followed by a measurable rise in the water table. The data enabled a direct calculation of the infiltration fluxes by various independent methods. The floods varied in their stages, peaks, and initial water contents. However, all floods produced very similar flux rates, suggesting that the recharge rates are less affected by the flood stages but rather controlled by flow duration and available aquifer storage under it. Large floods flood the stream <b>channel</b> <b>terraces</b> and promote the larger transmission losses. These, however, make only a negligible contribution to the recharge of the ground water.

40|$|During recent years, most open feedlot {{operators}} {{have found}} it desirable and, in some cases, necessary to install runoff control facilities. Even though {{the primary purpose of}} feedlot runoff control systems is the prevention of water pollution, many producers have found that good management of these systems also offers limited economic benefits in the form of fertilizer nutrients and supplemental irrigation water. Well managed runoff control systems also reduce weeds, odors, insects and muddy areas at or near feedlot edges. The runoff control system that has proved most satisfactory for all areas of the country is one consisting of clean water diversion, runoff collection, a solids settling facility (or debris basin), a runoff holding pond and pond dewatering equipment (Figure l). Management consists of cleaning solids from the settling facility and pumping out the holding pond when necessary. The amount of labor required for proper management of runoff control systems is not excessive, but this type task usually has a low priority in a general farming situation and, therefore, is often not accomplished when it should be. A lack of cattle lot maintenance can lead to undrained muddy areas and to nuisance conditions such as fly and odor problems. Such conditions have also been shown to decrease animal performance. If the settling basin is not cleaned when solids build-up reaches the design-full level, the outlet clogs and more solids carry through to the holding pond. Allowing solids to reach the holding pond reduces its capacity and shortens its useful life unless periodic sludge removal is practiced. Additionally, an excessive accumulation of solids and undrained liquids in the basin frequently results in odor and insect problems. Failure to pump out the holding pond on a timely basis may lead to overflows with dubsequent loss of crop nutrients, water pollution, and potentially to a lawsuit. Clean Water Diversion To minimize the amount of water which must be handled through a runoff-control system; diversion <b>terraces,</b> <b>channels</b> and roof gutters should be utilized and kept in good repair. Keeping clean water diverted away from feedlots decreases the quantity ofliquids to be separated in the settling basin and subsequently stored in the holding pond. Control of clean water effectively reduces the required size of the holding pond or can increase the time between dewatering operations. In· situations where clean water is to be collected for use as irrigation water, it should be diverted around the settling basin directly to the holding pond. Careful sizing and design of the holding pond is essential to ensure adequate capacity for storing both the diverted clean water and feedlot runoff. Runoff can be collected from feedlot areas and diverted to settling basins and holding ponds by using curbs, <b>channels,</b> <b>terraces,</b> pipes or combinations of these. All parts of the runoff control facilities need to be kept free of obstructions such as weeds, tree limbs, and accumulations of solids. Obstructions in runoff collection devices may cause overflows with resultant pollution or nuisance conditions due to unconfined feedlot runoff. Obstructions can also cause solids to settle in areas where removal may be difficult, or impossible. Routine moving and clean-up supplemented with periodic grading and shaping of earthen runoff collection devices will effectively minimize the development of erosive or low, soggy areas...|$|R

40|$|The Naval Auxiliary Air Station, Whiting Field, {{is to have}} a {{stormwater}} disposal {{system in}} which the existing pipes and terraces under and {{in the vicinity of the}} runways and building area will discharge into paved trapezoidal open channels. Many of the channels join other channels as they pass down the sides of the plateau on which the airfield is located. The grades of the main channels and of many of the lateral channels are such that water flows at supercritical velocities or at velocities greater than that of a gravity wave. The difficulties anticipated in joining two streams of water, one or more of which is flowing at supercritical velocities, led to the request for model studies of several of the channel junctions. The primary objectives in the present study include (1) the development of junction designs for specified operating conditions which would result in reasonably smooth flow downstream of the junction and (2) the determination of the necessary wall heights in the vicinity of the junction. Economic and structural considerations involved in the junction designs were considered in the final selection. Dependent upon the junction design, the discharges, velocities, and related phenomena of the flow in the vicinity of the junction, a hydraulic jump may form in one or both of the inlet channels. This may necessitate a large increase in the height of the sidewalls in the vicinity of the junction. On the other hand, if the flow passes through the junction at velocities greater than the critical, standing waves may form which have a height greatly in excess of a normal freeboard and which continue to oscillate back and forth across the channel for a considerable distance downstream from the junction before being damped by frictional forces. These standing waves necessitate higher sidewalls not only in the vicinity of the junction but for a considerable distance downstream. As available information on junctions of this type is almost nonexistent, it was necessary to resort to model studies in order to determine the flow conditions and the minimum sidewall heights. Two general types of junctions were studied. One type consists of the junction of two large channels in which the lateral and inlet main have comparable discharges. The other type, called terrace outlets, consists of a junction between a main <b>channel</b> and a <b>terrace</b> <b>channel</b> having a relatively small discharge.

During the Würm glacial maximum (MIS 2) rapid aggradation by deep-water Gilbert-type deltas and shallow-water fan deltas occurred {{at the margins of}} a 20 to 50 m deep proglacial lake. A temporal high-amplitude lake-level fall of 60 m resulted in gravel deposition by forced-regressive deltas, followed by rapid lake-level rise and fine-grained glaciolacustrine deposition. During the final deglaciation, a rapid base-level fall of 40 m resulted in a complex fluvial response. Knickpoint formation and headward incision of the highstand deltas and concomitant deposition of gravel sheets by forced-regressive deltas and braided systems occurred in several depocentres on the former glacial lake floor. Preservation of highstand and falling-stage deposits and terrace formation in the incised valley depended on vertical incision and lateral <b>channel</b> migration. <b>Terraces</b> are well developed in the former lake-floor depressions, whereas vertical incision was dominant in the higher lake-floor areas. The Ain terrace staircase was likely formed by autogenic processes during a single allogenic base-level fall.

During Oligocene time a plate/spreading ridge collision resulted in the extensive subaerial erosion and deposition, which occurred during this period of maximum uplift. In early Miocene time, deep sediment starved basins formed as the result of plate boundary readjustments. These basins received dominantly biogenic sediments (the Monterey Formation) until the end of Miocene time. Clastic deposition (the Sisquoc Formation) followed renewed deformation and uplift. Additional clastic facies occur in the ???Pico" and younger units in the study area. Pliocene to Recent depositional features include the large scale on-lap of the north margin of the Channel Islands Platform by units originating to the north. Other depositional features include buried and modern submarine <b>channels,</b> <b>terrace</b> deposits, and modern channel levee deposits. Structural features of the study area include: the major anticlinal fold belt and its associated faults, which trend approximately north 45 degrees west, the Ferrelo Fault zone with Cretaceous to late Miocene (or younger) offset, and the Santa Rosa Fault with Quaternary offset. Dip separation along the Ferrelo Fault zone is evidenced by uplift at the southwestern margin Channel Islands Platform in the study area. Strike-slip motion is evidenced on the Santa Rosa Island Fault where it offsets Quaternary units on Santa Rosa Island and the sea floor. Numerous unnamed faults occur in the region and can be placed in two major groups: those that do not cut the late Miocene unconformity and those that cut the unconformity and in some cases offset the sea floor. Geophysical profiles and dart core descriptions from the Miocene and younger units, particularly in the immediate vicinity of the northern Channel Islands Platform, permit the assignment of seismic reflectors to geologic formations. Unconformities between the Monterey, Sisquoc, and ???Pico" seismic stratigraphic units are well defined and may be correlative over a large portion of the study area. The investigation has shown that: 1) deformation in the study area was contemporaneous with known regional tectonic events and (2) that it is possible to correlate onshore formations to seismic stratigraphic units. The investigation has also shown that the northern portion of the Channel Islands Platform is structurally related to the Peninsular Ranges Province. The boundary of the Transverse Ranges and Peninsular Ranges Provinces may be along the north margin of the Channel Islands Platform in the study area...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1991 Studies are {{currently}} underway {{to determine the}} suitability of Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the nation's first high-level nuclear waste repository. Values of net infiltration are required to determine pre-waste emplacement groundwater travel times {{and the performance of}} the repository as a waste containment system. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a numerical model to perform water balance calculations and predict rates of net infiltration for the site. The model included processes of precipitation, runoff, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and redistribution of water within a soil profile. The watershed was divided into 477 grid cells 75. 7 x 75. 7 m. The elevation, slope, aspect, and hydrologic properties were assumed to be constant within a grid cell but varied from one cell to the next Water balance calculations were performed for each cell using a one-dimensional form of Richards equation. The solution was obtained using the finite difference method with Newton-Raphson iteration. The model was calibrated using water content data obtained from neutron-moisture meter measurements in boreholes located in Pagany Wash Watershed Measurements were made in <b>channel</b> and <b>terrace</b> alluvium and in tuffs. Computer simulations reproduced water content data for a major precipitation event that occurred in 1984. Simulations verified the importance of antecedent soil water content in controlling the occurrence of runoff. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the soil and alluvium grain-size distributions, which are used to calculate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, can greatly affect predicted rates of water movemen...|$|R
40|$|When {{looking for}} traces of past life on Mars, {{we have to}} look {{primarily}} for places where water was present, possibly for long time intervals. The Simud and Tiu Valles are two large outflow channels connected to the north with the Chryse Basin, Oxia Palus quadrangle. The area, carved by water during the Noachian/Early Hesperian is characterized by a complex geological evolution. The geomorphological analysis shows the presence of fluvial and alluvial structures, interpreted as fluvial <b>channels</b> and <b>terraces,</b> debris flow fronts and short-lasting small water flows coexisting with maar-diatremes and mud volcanoes. Several morphological features indicate a change in water flux direction after the main erosive phase. During this period water originated from the Masursky crater and flown southwards into the Hydraotes Chaos. This phenomenon caused the studied area to become a depocenter where fine-grained material deposition took place, possibly in association with ponding water. This setting is potentially quite valuable as traces of life may have been preserved. The presence of water at various times over a period of about 1 Ga in the area is corroborated by mineralogical analyses of different areas that indicate the possible presence of hydrated minerals mixtures, such as sulfate-bearing deposits. Given the uniqueness of the evolution of this region, the long term interactions between fluvial, volcanic, and tectonic processes and its extremely favorable landing parameters (elevation, slope, roughness, rock distribution, thermal inertia, albedo, etc.), we decided to propose this location as a possible landing site for the ESA ExoMars 2018, the NASA Mars 2020 and future on-site missions...|$|R

The Alboran Sea is a Neogene extensional basin {{developed}} in a convergence tectonic setting that generates a complex physiography. The SW-NE-trending Alboran Ridge separates three main basins, Western, Eastern and Southern. The filling of the Alboran Basin is composed of Early Miocene to Quaternary deposits (CAMPILLO et alii, 1992). The Plio-Quaternary deposits lies over a strongly erosive surface (the Messininan surface -M reflector-) with three major types of features: the Zanclean <b>Channel,</b> several <b>terraces,</b> and canyons (ESTRADA et alii, 2011). The Plio-Quaternary sedimentary evolution has been controlled mainly by the interplay of tectonics, sea-level changes, and a complex ocean circulation (ERCILLA et alii, 1994). Most of the geological studies done since the 80 ’s in the Alboran Sea suggested that downslope processes were dominant, (ERCILLA et alii, 1992). Locally, contourite features had been defined in the westernmost slope of the Moroccan margin (ERCILLA et alii, 2002). Critical reviews of the available seismic records and of our previous literature allowed us re-nterpreting themorphosedimentary features that characterize the Alboran Sea. We propose the dominance of alongslope processes in the Alboran Sea, that are locally modified by the downslope processes at the margins, submarine fans, and walls of the Alboran Ridge and seamounts.

40|$|Valley-floor-channel and alluvial-fan {{deposits}} and terraces {{in the southwestern}} US record multiple episodes of late-Quaternary fluvial-system aggradation and incision. Perhaps the most well-constrained of these episodes took place from the latest Pleistocene to the present in the Mojave Desert. One hypothesis for this episode – i. e., the paleovegetation-change hypothesis (PVCH) – posits that a reduction in hillslope vegetation cover associated with the transition from Pleistocene woodlands to Holocene desert scrub generated a pulse of sediment that triggered a primary phase of aggradation downstream, followed by <b>channel</b> incision, <b>terrace</b> abandonment, and initiation of a secondary phase of aggradation further downstream. A second hypothesis – i. e., the extreme-storm hypothesis – attributes episodes of aggradation and incision {{to changes in the}} frequency and/or intensity of extreme storms. In the past decade a growing number of studies has advocated the extreme-storm hypothesis and challenged the PVCH on the basis of inconsistencies in both timing and process. Here I show that in eight out of nine sites where the timing of fluvial-system aggradation in the Mojave Desert is reasonably well constrained, measured ages of primary aggradation are consistent with the predictions of the PVCH if the time-transgressive nature of paleovegetation changes with elevation is fully taken into account. I also present an alternative process model for PVCH that is more consistent with available data and produces sediment pulses primarily via an increase in drainage density (i. e., a transformation of hillslopes into low-order channels) rather than solely via an increase in sediment yield from hillslopes. This paper further documents the likely important role of changes in upland vegetation cover and drainage density in driving fluvial-system response during semiarid-to-arid climatic changes...|$|R
