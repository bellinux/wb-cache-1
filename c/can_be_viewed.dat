Human sustainability can be achieved by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E

5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> {{as a special}} case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell {{the idea of}} the telephone. The reeds <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>viewed</b> as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
