25|$|The {{potential}} for computer networking to facilitate newly improved forms of <b>computer-mediated</b> social interaction was suggested early on. Efforts to support social networks via <b>computer-mediated</b> communication {{were made in}} many early online services, including Usenet, ARPANET, LISTSERV, and bulletin board services (BBS). Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, ChatNet, and The WELL.|$|E
25|$|The United States Army Research Office budgeted $4nbsp&million in 2009 to {{researchers}} at the University of California, Irvine to develop EEG processing techniques to identify correlates of imagined speech and intended direction to enable soldiers on the battlefield to communicate via <b>computer-mediated</b> reconstruction of team members' EEG signals, {{in the form of}} understandable signals such as words.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{linguists}} {{agree that}} the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on corpus linguistics and computational linguistics, written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically transcribed and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of <b>computer-mediated</b> communication as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{linguistics}} is {{a domain}} of linguistics {{advocated by the}} English linguist David Crystal. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen {{under the influence of}} the Internet and other new media, such as Short Message Service (SMS) text messaging. Since the beginning of human-computer interaction (HCI) leading to <b>computer-mediated</b> communication (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. This study is intended to benefit both linguists and web users.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Internet {{linguistics}} can be effectively done through four main perspectives: sociolinguistics, education, stylistics and applied. Further dimensions have {{developed as a}} result of further technological advancements which include the development of the Web as Corpus and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the Mass Media and Literary Works. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined as new <b>computer-mediated</b> technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media. The Internet continues to {{play a significant role in}} both encouraging as well as diverting attention away from the usage of languages.|$|E
25|$|American {{researchers}} made fundamental {{advances in}} telecommunications and information technology. For example, AT's Bell Laboratories spearheaded the American technological revolution {{with a series}} of inventions including the light emitting diode (LED), the transistor, the C programming language, and the UNIX computer operating system. SRI International and Xerox PARC in Silicon Valley helped give birth to the personal computer industry, while ARPA and NASA funded the development of the ARPANET and the Internet. Companies like IBM and Apple Computer developed personal computers while Microsoft created operating systems and office productivity software to run on them. With the growth of information on the World Wide Web, search companies like Yahoo! and Google developed technologies to sort and rank web pages based on relevance. The web also has become a site for <b>computer-mediated</b> social interactions and web services like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter are used by millions to communicate. Miniaturization of computing technology and the increasing pervasiveness and speed of wireless networks had led to substantial adoption of mobile phones and increasingly powerful smartphones based on software platforms like Apple's iOS and Google's Android.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that the bystander effect may be present in <b>computer-mediated</b> communication situations. Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress. In the experiment, 400 online chat groups were observed. One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room: either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen. The purpose of the experiment {{was to determine whether}} or not the gender of the victim mattered, if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name would have any effect. Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim. Consistent with findings of Latané and Darley, the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect. The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups. However, this effect was nonexistent when the victim (Suzy or Jake) asked for help from a specific person in the chat group. The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was 36.38 seconds. The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was 51.53 seconds.|$|E

2500|$|Cyberbullying is a {{communication}} phenomenon {{in which a}} bully utilizes electronic media in order to harass peers. Adolescents favor texting or [...] <b>computer-mediated</b> communication {{as an alternative to}} the more directly combative face-to-face interactions because it takes advantage of evading imposed social norms such as [...] "school rules", which are likely to be especially repressive of aggression involving females. Online bullying has a lot in common with bullying in school: Both behaviors include harassment, humiliation, teasing and aggression. Cyberbullying presents unique challenges in the sense that the perpetrator can attempt to be anonymous, and attacks can happen at any time of day or night.|$|E
2500|$|LOL, ROFL, {{and other}} initialisms have crossed from <b>computer-mediated</b> {{communication}} to face-to-face communication. David Crystal—likening {{the introduction of}} LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century—states that this is [...] "a brand new variety of language evolving", invented by young people within five years, that [...] "extend {{the range of the}} language, the expressiveness [...] the richness of the language". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their [...] "total effect on language" [...] would be [...] "utterly trivial".|$|E
2500|$|LOL, or lol, is {{an acronym}} for laugh(ing) out loud or lots of laughs, and a popular element of Internet slang. It was first used almost {{exclusively}} on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of <b>computer-mediated</b> communication and even face-to-face communication. It {{is one of many}} initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO ("laugh(ing) my ass off") and ROFL (or its older form ROTFL; [...] "roll(ing) on the floor laughing").

[...] At {{the start of each}} session, each participant was assigned a color at random, either red or blue. [...] At each round, each player learned the color assigned to his or her opponent, but nothing else about the opponent. [...] Hargreaves-Heap and Varoufakis found that the players' behavior within a session frequently developed a discriminatory convention, giving a Nash equilibrium where players of one color (the [...] "advantaged" [...] color) consistently played the aggressive [...] "hawk" [...] strategy against players of the other, [...] "disadvantaged" [...] color, who played the acquiescent [...] "dove" [...] strategy against the advantaged color. [...] Players of both colors used a mixed strategy when playing against players assigned the same color as their own.|$|E
2500|$|An {{aspect of}} game design {{that has been}} {{identified}} as negatively impacting female interest is the degree of expertise with gaming conventions and familiarity with game controls required to play the game. In-game tutorials have been found to bring both sexes into games faster, and new controllers such as Nintendo's Wii Remote, Microsoft's Kinect, and the various rhythm game controllers have affected demographics by making games easier to pick up and by providing a level playing-field. This trend has continued through the efforts of Nintendo in its release of the Wii. Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity. In 2012, the developers of Borderlands 2 were criticized for referring to a reduced difficulty option as [...] "girlfriend mode". Yet, the perceived skill or performance gap between men and women may be fueled by other factors besides gender. In a 2016 study published in the Journal of <b>Computer-Mediated</b> Communication, researchers found that, after controlling for confounds such as the amount of play time and guild membership, women players advance at least as fast as men do in two MMOs, EverQuest II and [...]|$|E
50|$|<b>Computer-mediated</b> {{communication}}: <b>Computer-mediated</b> {{communication is}} defined as text, images, and other data received via computer without effective real-time voice or video images from collaborators.

5000|$|Based on his {{research}} into <b>computer-mediated</b> communication, Walther introduced social information processing theory in 1992. Social information processing theory {{finds that the}} development of relationships via <b>computer-mediated</b> communication depends on sufficient time and message exchanges, and on the application of available communicative cues by users. The lack of nonverbal cues means that <b>computer-mediated</b> communications contain less information than face-to-face communications, however social information processing theory finds that longer and/or more frequent communication [...] as well as the use of other cues (i.e. spelling ability) [...] while participating in <b>computer-mediated</b> communication help address the issue of information exchange.|$|E
50|$|Walther's {{research}} also {{led him to}} develop the hyperpersonal model of communication in 1996.

5000|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>computer-mediated</b> communication introduces {{a new type}} of communication and consequently {{a new type of}} [...] "affair". There are various kinds of <b>computer-mediated</b> communication that differ in some significant aspects: one-to-one or group communication formats, interrelating with anonymous or identified people, and communicating in synchronous or asynchronous formats. Online affairs combine features of close and remote relationships.|$|E
50|$|Later, Walther and {{his colleagues}} did {{follow-up}} research. Previous research on the interpersonal tone of <b>computer-mediated</b> communication shows different effects using longitudinal <b>computer-mediated</b> groups than are found in research using one-shot groups, even before the developmental aspects associated with time can accrue. One factor distinguishing these approaches is the anticipation of future interaction experienced by longitudinal groups. This research reports an experiment assessing the relative effects of anticipated future interaction and different communication media (<b>computer-mediated</b> versus face-to-face communication) on the communication of relational intimacy and composure. Asynchronous and synchronous computer conferencing and face-to-face groups were examined. Results show that the assignment of long-term versus short-term partnerships has a larger impact on anticipated future interaction reported by <b>computer-mediated,</b> rather than face-to-face, partners. Evidence also shows that anticipation is a more potent predictor of several relational communication dimensions than is communication condition. Implications for theory and practice are identified.|$|E
