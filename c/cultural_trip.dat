50|$|After a stay of 19 {{years in}} Austria, Dr. Abouleish {{returned}} to Egypt for a <b>cultural</b> <b>trip</b> in 1975. Touched by the deplorable {{economic and social}} situation of his country of origin, he decided to begin a project of cultural renewal {{on the basis of}} a synthesis of Islam and anthroposophy. Two years later he bought a plot of land in what was, at the time, desert bordering farmland of the Nile valley. The original goal was to develop the land and improve crop yields using biodynamic methods. A thick border of trees was planted to encircle the seventy hectares of land, and trees were planted along all the roads built; a forest was also planted on part of the land. (The initial planting included 120,000 casuarina, eucalyptus and Persian lilac seedlings.) The Bedouins who lived nearby, and sometimes on the land, were brought into the project, given work and helped with their living needs. Buildings were built using traditional adobe; some of these were designed by Hassan Fathy. The initial farm animals were Egyptian buffalo. The organization sold milk products produced from the buffalo milk and produce from the farm.|$|E

40|$|One {{third of}} United States adults (65. 9 million) took a {{historic}} or <b>cultural</b> <b>trip</b> in 1995. (Ohio Division of Travel and Tourism) Throughout the United States, communities and regions {{are losing their}} identity and their heritage due {{to a variety of}} different reasons from urban sprawl to lack of maintenance. Due to the disappearance of the cultural landscapes, today's generations and their future generations can lose the knowledge and the pride associated with their hometown or region. Through the celebration and representation of our history through heritage trails, regions and communities can retain their character and individuality for fixture generations. Heritage trails became part of the greenways idea when greenways started to link people to heritage areas and places. As a result, greenways became heritage trails. With the rich culture of the country, there is an increasing opportunity for designers to reach communities through their heritage and backgrounds. This study attempted to use the guidelines of greenways, interpretation, and education to design a heritage trail along a canal heritage corridor. Heritage corridors across the country are being used as models to demonstrate the guidelines and design techniques for the celebration and preservation of cultural landscapes in the United States. The models in this study included the Heritage Trail in Dubuque County, Iowa, the Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal National Historic Park, and Delaware & Hudson Heritage Corridor, Port Jervis, New York. The heritage trail is located along the Miami & Erie Canal between the towns of New Bremen and Minster, Ohio. New Bremen and Minster are located on the summit of the Miami & Erie Canal, which spanned from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. The canal was used for transportation, industry, and the settlement of interior parts of Ohio. This study incorporated the region's history including not only the canal but also the communities' history, and possible connections to city and rural residents through a heritage trail. Education and interpretation played a large role in connecting the area on the heritage trail. This study consisted of a master plan for a larger portion of the Miami & Erie Canal as well as a more detailed segment for New Bremen and Minster.
