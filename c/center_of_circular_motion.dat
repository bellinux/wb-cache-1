40|$|We report {{detailed}} {{evidence for}} multiple merger, extended massive star formation, galactic wind, and circular/noncircular motions in the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 3256, based on observations of highresolution imaging (Hubble Space Telescope, ESO NTT), and extensive spectroscopic data (more than 1000 spectra, collected at Estación Astrofísica de Bosque Alegre, Complejo Astronómico el Leoncito, Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory, and IUE observatories). We {{find in a}} detailed morphological study (resolution ~ 15 pc) that the extended massive star formation process detected previously in NGC 3256 shows extended triple asymmetrical spiral arms (r~ 5 kpc), emanating from three different nuclei. The main optical nucleus shows a small spiral disk (r~ 500 pc), which {{is a continuation of}} the external one and reaches the very nucleus. The core shows blue elongated structure (50 pc x 25 pc) and harbors a blue stellar cluster candidate (r~ 8 pc). We discuss this complex morphology in the framework of an extended massive star formation driven by a multiple merger process (models of Hernquist et al. and Taniguchi et al.). We study the kinematics of this system and present a detailed Hα velocity field for the central region (40 " x 40 "; rmax~ 30 "~ 5 kpc), with a spatial resolution of 1 " and errors of ± 15 km s-ˡ. The color and isovelocity maps show mainly (1) a kinematic <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> with "spider" shape, located between the main optical nucleus and the close (5 ") mid-IR nucleus and (2) noncircular motions in the external parts. We obtained three "sinusoidal rotation curves" (from the Hα velocity field) around position angle (P. A.) ~ 55 º, ~ 90 º, and ~ 130 º. In the main optical nucleus we found a clear "outflow component" associated with galactic winds plus an "inflow radial motion". The outflow component was also detected in the central and external regions (r≤ 5 − 6 kpc). The main axis of the inflow region (P. A. ~ 80 º) is practically perpendicular to the ouflow axis (at P. A. ~ 160 º). We analyze in detail the physical conditions in the giant H II regions located in the asymmetric spiral arms, the two main optical nuclei, and the outflow component (using long-slit spectroscopy, plus standard models of photoionization, shocks, and starbursts). We present four detailed emission-line ratios (N II/Hα, S II/Hα, S II/S II), and FWHM (Hα) maps for the central region (30 " x 30 "; rmax~ 22 "~ 4 kpc), with a spatial resolution of 1 ". In the central region (r~ 5 − 6 kpc) we detected that the nuclear starburst and the extended giant H II regions (in the spiral arms) have very similar properties, i. e., high metallicity and low-ionization spectra, with Teff= 35, 000 K, solar abundance, a range of Te~ 6000 − 7000 K, and Ne~ 100 − 1000 cm-³. The nuclear and extended outflow shows properties typical of galactic wind/ shocks, associated with the nuclear starburst. We suggest that the interaction between dynamical eects, the galactic wind (outflow), low-energy cosmic rays, and the molecular+ionized gas (probably in the inflow phase) could be the possible mechanism that generate the "similar extended properties in the massive star formation, at a scale of 5 − 6 kpc!" We have also studied the presence of the close merger/interacting systems NGC 3256 C (at~ 150 kpc, ΔV = − 100 km s-ˡ) and the possible association between the NGC 3256 and 3263 groups of galaxies. In conclusion, these results suggest that NGC 3256 {{is the product of a}} multiple merger, which generated an extended massive star formation process with an associated galactic wind plus a nuclear inflow. Therefore, NGC 3256 is another example in which the relation between mergers and extreme starburst (and the powerful galactic wind, "multiple" Type II supernova explosions) play an important role in the evolution of galaxies (the hypothesis of Rieke et al., Joseph et al., Terlevich et al., Heckman et al., and Lípari et al.) ...|$|E
30|$|Figure 7 a {{shows the}} {{measurement}} method of the rotational stream in 3 D space. In Fig.  7 b, the blue circle indicates the initial {{position of the}} microbead and the red circle shows {{the position of the}} microbead after one turn (after 0.16  s). Positions in the X-direction of the two circles are almost on the same axis, and the Y-direction is changed. In addition, the distances from the <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> (r_ 1 and r_ 2) are the same. From this trajectory of the microbead, we can verify the relationship between the flow velocity in three dimensions and the radius of the flow (Fig.  7 a). The angular velocities and the velocities toward the root of the end effector can be calculated by the movements of the 9.6 -μm microbeads and the time it takes for the object to traverse half a revolution. To be specific, we computed the radius of rotation described in Fig.  7 (r_ 1 and r_ 2) using the movement of the object in the X-direction after a half-turn. The angular velocity and the velocity toward the root of the end effector were calculated by the time it takes for the microbead to make a half-turn and the moving distance in the Y-direction, respectively. Experiments were conducted by changing the frequency and the amplitude of the end effector. In this experiment, we utilized a cone shape of a glass needle. Generally, the thicker the end effector is, the faster the velocity is [26]. Thus, to minimize this influence, we selected a specific region having similar diameter from 8 to 12  μm. The trapped region in Fig.  7 b shows the selected region. It is approximately from 80 to 250  μm from needle tip.|$|R

Experimental data have been obtained that reveal efficiency in application <b>of</b> blank <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> and improvement <b>of</b> its output cutting indices. A methodology has been developed for execution of comparative experimental investigations on cutting glass, nephrite and jasper specimens as under conventional conditions required for the operation so while transferring induced oscillations to boom suspension assembly that ensure specimen. The proposed methodology makes it possible to assess quantitatively intensity of specimen cutting and quality of its machined surface. The paper has shown that a positive impact <b>of</b> the specimen <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> on quality improvement of its cross-cut surface is related to peculiar kinematics features pertaining to relative motion of disc side surface with cross-cut portions of the specimen surface. It has been shown that the intensifying impact <b>of</b> the specimen <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> on the cutting process is primarily related to the changes in dynamic conditions of its interaction with the cutting edge of the disc. In contrast to conventional cutting when the process is going on under static pressure of contacting surfaces there is their periodical impact-frictional interaction due to transfer <b>of</b> <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> to the specimen along elliptical trajectory. In this case the rate of the positive impact <b>of</b> the specimen <b>circular</b> <b>motion</b> on its cross-cut surface becomes higher while increasing vertical velocity component that concerns its sliding relative to disc side surface that is ensured by increasing oscillation frequency which is transferred to the boom suspension assembly.
