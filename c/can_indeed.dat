5000|$|Apart {{from the}} Getaria of Gipuzkoa, {{there is another}} town 61 {{kilometers}} up the coast in Lapurdi (Labourd), the French Basque Country, which is called Guéthary. The Basque pronunciation and spelling of the two towns is the same. Both villages are located on the Basque coast, and throughout history, many have sought {{the origin of the}} towns' names. Based on archaeological findings, the most convincing hypothesis is that the name of Getaria comes from the Latin word [...] "cetaria". In the classic Latin, pronounced as ketaria, it means a place were fish is <b>canned.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> in both places, evidence of Roman installations for canning fish have been found.|$|R
25|$|Evidence {{supporting}} this claim identified that decreased m6A {{levels in the}} transcriptome lead to significantly reduced HNRNPC binding, thus alternative splicing is co-regulated by methylation and HNRNPC binding activity. However, the m6A modification does not directly cause protein binding. Rather, it alters the loop structure to regulate gene expression by acting as a switch that exposes the HNRNPC region. It is essentially a two-step, co-regulatory mechanism prevalent in biochemistry in controlling alternative splicing. Note that demethylase enzyme <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> “erase” the methyl group, thus inhibiting alternative splicing which is the reverse of the two-step regulation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes the place of a single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
25|$|Brazil {{witnessed}} minor protests {{associated with}} the Occupy Movement during 2011 and 2012, but then endogenous social events and discourses led to massive and widespread protest during June 2013. While not directly sparked by {{the events in the}} Arab world, a new generation of Brazilians saw themselves in a similar situation as the Arab youth: alienated and marginalized from government and other public institutions, suffering increasingly high costs of living and inaccessible social services, and finding fewer employment and other social opportunities. Most significantly, the media exposure of popular protests taking over streets and overthrowing governments provided a new generation of Brazilians with the idea that popular uprisings <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> be highly successful. The 2013 protests in Brazil are ongoing public demonstrations in several Brazilian cities, initiated mainly by the Movimento Passe Livre (Free Fare Movement), a local entity that advocates for free public transportation. The demonstrations were initially organized to protest against increases in bus, train, and metro ticket prices in some Brazilian cities, but grew to include other issues such as the high corruption in the government and police brutality used against some demonstrators. By the end of June 2013, the movement had grown to become Brazil's largest since the 1980s movement against the military dictatorship and for direct elections, called Diretas_Já. It is notable that popular and working class organizations established during the 1980s - such as the ruling Workers' Party (PT), the Unified Workers Central (CUT), and the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) - did not play any role leading these protests, and in fact most street protesters do not find themselves represented by the Workers' Party government.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was not as}} {{receptive}} to Rousseau’s ideas as she was to Locke’s; she appropriated the aesthetic of the sublime to challenge Rousseau's ideas regarding the education of women (discussed in more detail below). During the 18th century, [...] "the sublime" [...] was associated with awe, fear, strength and masculinity. As Myers writes, [...] "to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within, Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength, force, and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness, delicacy, and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood". [...] Unlike writers such as Rousseau and Burke, who portray women as innately weak and silly, Wollstonecraft argues that women <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime.|$|E

500|$|After the 1989 {{amendments}} to the Constitution and the ISA, there was academic discourse {{on the effect of}} section8B(1) on the future development of the common law. The amendments merely caused a time warp in the common law, taking it back to 1971. As they did not amount to a codifying or declaratory Act seeking to replace the common law of judicial review, there is uncertainty whether the courts may continue to develop the common law and move away from the legal position laid down in Lee Mau Seng. Michael Rutter has asserted that the common law <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> continue to change.

She also praised other elements such as the special effects such as the derelict ship, calling it [...] "creepy, vivid, [...] entirely believable." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", called the episode [...] "proof that action-centric Trek <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> work, and work well." [...] He thought it was a vast improvement on the previous episode and found the stronger version of Archer interesting. He praised the soundtrack by Jay Chattaway which he felt suggested that the typical Star Trek music was being revised. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.|$|E

500|$|According to folklore, brachial gland {{secretions}} {{are generally}} thought to contain venom because of apparent anaphylactic reactions by humans following their bites. Slow lorises <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> inflict painful bites. Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby {{so that in}} case of a bite, they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go. The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat dander, hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction, not toxicosis. Loris bites cause a painful swelling, [...] and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock. However, although the toxin is only produced when the brachial secretion and saliva are mixed, both the secretion and saliva may have unique chemical properties and may act separately. Furthermore, secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food, augmenting the toxicity. The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain batrachotoxins, which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year.|$|E

[...] Total Film praised the performances but complained that the twists and exposition {{made it hard to}} care for the characters. Edward Douglas liked the film but had issues with its pacing, while Blake Wright criticized the Davy Jones's Locker and Calypso segments. James Berardinelli found it the weakest of the trilogy as [...] "the last hour offers adventure as rousing as anything provided in either of the previous installments... which doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this gorged, self-indulgent, and uneven production." [...] Peter Travers praised Richards and Rush but felt [...] "there <b>can</b> <b>indeed</b> be {{too much of a good}} thing," [...] regarding Depp's character. Travers later declared the movie to be one of the worst films of the year. Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film was overall a disappointment and that [...] "the final showdown ... is a non-event and the repetitive swordplay and inane plot contrivances simply become boring by the end". Richard Roeper gave a positive review, saying [...] "Gore Verbinski and the stunt and special effects crews have created one of the most impressive blends of live-action work and CGI wizardry ever put on film," [...] and believing it [...] "rarely drags and is almost always entertaining."
