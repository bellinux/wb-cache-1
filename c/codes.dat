In conventional system, usually using channel <b>coding</b> such as BCH <b>Code</b> or Convolutional <b>Code.</b> But, performance BCH <b>Code</b> or Convolutional <b>Code</b> is {{not good}} in implementation of OFDM System. Error bits of OFDM system without channel <b>coding</b> is 5. 77 %. Then, we used convolutional <b>code</b> with <b>code</b> rate 1 / 2, it can reduce error bitsonly up to 3. 85 %. So, we proposed OFDM system with Modified Convolutional <b>Code.</b> In this implementation, we used Software Define Radio (SDR), namely Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) NI 2920 as the transmitter and receiver. The result of OFDM system using Modified Convolutional <b>Code</b> with <b>code</b> rate is able recover all character received so can decrease until 0 % error bit. Increasing performance of Modified Convolutional <b>Code</b> is about 1 dB in BER of 10 - 4 from BCH <b>Code</b> and Convolutional <b>Code.</b> So, performance of Modified Convolutional better than BCH <b>Code</b> or Convolutional <b>Code.</b> Keywords: OFDM, BCH <b>Code,</b> Convolutional <b>Code,</b> Modified Convolutional <b>Code,</b> SDR, USR...|$|R
