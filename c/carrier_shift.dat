40|$|Abstract — We address blind {{multiuser}} detection for a DS/CDMA {{satellite network}} employing path diversity. Diversity is realized by resorting to simultaneous transmission between users and multiple satellites which, in turn, retransmit the composite received signals to a fixed earth station. A blind decorrelating detector exploiting {{knowledge of the}} set of the N admissible spreading codes is proposed; it assumes knowledge of the <b>carrier</b> <b>shifts,</b> and of the code of the user of interest. The number and the identity of interferers, together with their channels are determined from the observables. The performance assessment of the proposed detector shows that it outperforms a plain subspace-based blind decorrelator for small sizes of the estimation sample, but also that it is very sensitive to possible mismatches between nominal and actual <b>carrier</b> <b>shifts.</b> Finally, {{a modified version of the}} proposed detector, capable to work with coarse estimates of the <b>carrier</b> <b>shifts,</b> is also introduced.

5000|$|Most modern amateur {{transceivers}} sample PEP {{to adjust}} power, using an ALC (automatic level control) system. Time {{delay in the}} ALC system and finite time of RF signals passing through multiple stages, in particular narrow filters, often gives rise to unusual envelope distortion. This distortion commonly appears as envelope power overshoot on leading edges, and sometimes causes negative <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> on AM. Some poorer designed transceivers have a short term envelope power overshoot several times the steady-state PEP setting. This envelope overshoot further complicates definitions of PEP and average power.|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically validates battery-less sensor {{activation}} via wireless {{energy transmission}} to release sensors from wires and batteries. To seamlessly extend the coverage and activate sensor nodes distributed in any indoor environment, we proposed multi-point wireless energy transmission with <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> diversity. In this scheme, multiple transmitters are employed to compensate path-loss attenuation and orthogonal frequencies are {{allocated to the}} multiple transmitters to avoid the destructive interference that occurs when the same frequency is used by all transmitters. In our previous works, {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed scheme was validated theoretically and also empirically by using just a spectrum analyzer to measure the received power. In this paper, we develop low-energy battery-less sensor nodes whose consumed power and required received power for activation are respectively 142 uW and 400 uW. In addition, we conduct indoor experiments in which the received power and activation of battery-less sensor node are simultaneously observed by using the developed battery-less sensor node and a spectrum analyzer. The results show that the coverage of single-point and multi-point wireless energy transmission without <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> diversity are, respectively, 84. 4 % and 83. 7 %, while the coverage of the proposed scheme is 100 %. It can be concluded that the effectiveness of the proposed scheme can be verified by our experiments using real battery-less sensor nodes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} seamlessly extend the coverage of energy supply field for wireless sensor networks in order to free sensors from wires and batteries, where the multi-point scheme is employed to overcome path-loss attenuation, while the <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> diversity is introduced {{to mitigate the effect}} of interference between multiple wave sources. As we focus on the energy transmission part, sensor or communication schemes are out of scope of this paper. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed wireless energy transmission, this paper conducts indoor experiments in which we compare the power distribution and the coverage performance of different energy transmission schemes including conventional single-point, simple multi-point and our proposed multi-point scheme. To easily observe the effect of the standing-wave caused by multipath and interference between multiple wave sources, 3 D measurements are performed in an empty room. The results of our experiments together with those of a simulation that assumes a similar antenna setting in free space environment show that the coverage of single-point and multi-point wireless energy transmission without <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> diversity are limited by path-loss, standing-wave created by multipath and interference between multiple wave sources. On the other hand, the proposed scheme can overcome power attenuation due to the path-loss as well as the effect of standing-wave created by multipath and interference between multiple wave sources.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral leída en la Universidad Rey Juan Carlos en 2014. Directores de la Tesis: Helena Cabal y Antonio Alonso-AyusoDuring last {{decades the}} {{environmental}} protection awareness has been growing considerably in the European Union. Specially, climate change concern {{has become one of}} the foremost problems to fight with. In 2003, the European Commission approved Directive 2003 / 87 /EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission allowance trading. The main objective of this Directive was to promote the reduction of GHG emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner to meet the Kyoto Protocol targets. After that, the European Commission approved Directive 2009 / 29 /EC extending the scope of the previous one and establishing a reduction of 20 % in the GHG emissions in 2020 respect to the 1990 level. Analogously, Directive 2001 / 81 /EC set national ceilings for acidification, eutrophication and tropospheric ozone gases. Cement production and electricity generation sectors are two of the main sources of pollutants in the European Union. This work has focused on the environmental consequences and the compliance of the emissions-related Directives in these sectors in Spain. The current work applies the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, an environmental management tool that evaluates the potential environmental impacts of a product or process throughout its entire life cycle, to the cement manufacture in Spain. As a result, main hotspots such as the combustion of fossil and alternative fuels at the kiln have been identified and assessed in detail. Moreover, various technology improvements such as Best Available Techniques (BAT), and material and fossil fuels substitution scenarios have been implemented. Results have revealed that changing the fossil fuels by alternative fuels derived from waste entails significant reductions in most of the impact categories except for eutrophication. In the same manner, to reduce the clinker content in cement diminishes most of the impacts. This measure shows more problems than fuel substitution because it requires substituting the clinker by secondary materials such as blast furnace slag, fly ashes and pozzolanas, at the same time that mechanical and chemical properties of the cement must be preserved. Going further, an exploratory analysis has been made including the CO 2 capture technology in the Spanish cement-making. Results have shown the effects of the post-combustion CO 2 capture. It has been observed that this technology is very expensive and most of the impact categories such as human toxicity, eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, acidification, photochemical ozone formation and land use change grow by several times. The main problem is the extremely high amount of heat required - the energy penalty - so natural gas and biomass cogeneration (CHP) plants have been proposed as alternatives to substitute the coal-fired CHP plant. Consequently, more research is needed to reduce costs and emissions. Along with the environmental assessment of the cement manufacture, a modelling analysis has been carried out in order to assess these Directives. TIMES-Spain energy optimisation model has been used. Previously, several calibrations, technology updates and other policies implementations have been made. In addition, measures analysed in the LCA study have been implemented in TIMES-Spain. Considering several scenarios related to CO 2 emissions, cement demands and investment costs, the effect of the Directives has been analysed from 2010 to the end of horizon, 2050. It has been concluded that Directive 2009 / 29 /EC involves great reductions in CO 2 emissions respect to a case without Directive, reaching almost 50 % in 2050. The application of Directive 2001 / 81 /EC is not significant from the point of view of the cement-making because NOx and SO 2 emissions are already low respect to the total amounts. The high share of the cement sector CO 2 emissions respect to the total has shown the difficulties of the cement industry respect to other industries in terms of emissions reduction efforts. Also, it has been observed that CO 2 capture technology does not appear except when high cement demands and stringent sectorial CO 2 limits are imposed. It has been recommended to reduce the CO 2 emissions limits to the cement manufacturing sector in Spain assuming that 2013 - 2020 allowances allocation does not force the cement producers to make new investments since the expected cement demands are too low. Besides, the application of the emissions-related Directives in the electricity production sector has been assessed. Several calibrations and developments have been implemented in TIMES-Spain. Emissions and fossil fuel prices scenarios have been included. Externalities of the electricity production have been internalised as well as taxes on CO 2, NOx and SO 2 have been evaluated to assess the Directives effects. As a result, a high contribution of natural gas in the electricity mix takes place when Directives are applied. The evolution of the electricity production system is mainly characterized by the coal phase-out in 2015, followed by the growth of natural gas combined cycle plants and the entrance of natural gas cogeneration plants in industry from 2030. Beyond 2030 renewable technologies are significantly implemented, in particular wind and solar. The contribution of solar photovoltaic plants is remarkable in the long-term. In addition, it has been observed the disappearance of the CO 2 emissions in 2035. Taxes on CO 2 have effect from 30 €/t CO 2 in 2030 and 50 €/t CO 2 in 2050. It has also been relevant the taxation on NOx, especially from 2030 with a considerable growth of natural gas cogeneration plants. Finally, it has been recommended to update Directive 2001 / 81 /EC for establishing a new ceiling for Spain. In particular, the SO 2 ceiling should be reduced below 450 - 500 kt SO 2 per year. On the other hand, it has been suggested to extend the target imposed by Directive 2009 / 29 /EC, to a 50 % reduction (in absolute CO 2) in 2050 respect to the 2005 level. Moreover, 80 % reduction target by 2050 has been proved to be achievable. In that case, an energy <b>carrier</b> <b>shift</b> takes place from electricity to heat in industry, residential and commercial sectors. The application of the previous methodologies shows the importance of considering integrated approaches which deal with more than one aspect. In the current work, environmental and prospective strategies have been merged. As a result, interesting conclusions and recommendations have been obtained not only relevant for the Spanish policymakers and industries but also for the Spanish society.

30|$|As briefly {{addressed}} in Section 2. and depicted in Figure  1, the transmitters waiting to send packets {{are required to}} transmit an RTS frame to the receiver. When the receiver detects and decodes the RTS frame signals received from the multiple transmitters, it estimates the received signal power levels and the carrier phase offsets that occur when the compound signals are transmitted on a wireless medium. Under {{the assumption that the}} training sequence of RTS frames is a form of pseudo-noise (PN) sequence which is orthogonal to each other, the receiver can estimate the received signal power levels and the carrier phase offsets without signal interference among multiple transmitters. Then, the receiver computes the optimal received power level and <b>carrier</b> phase <b>shift</b> so as to reduce the error probability, and returns the feedback information through a CTS frame which includes the optimal transmit power levels and <b>carrier</b> phase <b>shifts.</b> In this case, the optimal transmit power can be calculated from the optimal received power by using the known channel gain. The <b>carrier</b> phase <b>shift</b> is then the difference between the estimated carrier phase offset of the received signal and the optimal carrier phase offset. This feedback-based transmit power and carrier phase adjustment mechanism makes it possible for the receiver to separate the constellations of multiple signals, significantly reducing the error probability at the receiver side.|$|R
