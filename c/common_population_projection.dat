40|$|According to {{estimates}} from the 2006 Census, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (Indigenous) Australians made up 2. 5 % {{of the total}} Australian population. However, the focus of research and policy debate on Indigenous Australians far exceeds their population size for reasons of history, socio-economics, geography and demography. This {{has led to a}} need for accurate <b>population</b> <b>projections</b> of the <b>population.</b> In this paper, we outline a number of issues related to Indigenous <b>population</b> <b>projections.</b> These include the nature of self-identification; the impact of particular policy changes; significant differences in demographic parameters; and high rates of exogamy, especially in urban areas. We also document the relative accuracy of past and current <b>population</b> <b>projections.</b> In the final section of the paper we outline a research agenda that has the potential to lead to new and better Indigenous <b>population</b> <b>projections...</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{its fifth}} {{assessment}} report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change divided future scenario projections (2005 - 2100) into two groups: Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).

In order for these projections to be applicable in earth system models, SSP and RCP <b>population</b> <b>projections</b> must be at the same spatial scale. Thus, a gridded population dataset {{that takes into account}} both RCP-based urban fractions and SSP-based <b>population</b> <b>projection</b> is needed.
