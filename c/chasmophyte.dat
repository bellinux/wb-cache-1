40|$|Cliffs {{are among}} the environments with the most adverse {{conditions}} for living organisms because of the limited availability of soil, moisture, and nutrients, and owing to the harsh conditions of exposure. They constitute shelters for rare, endemic, and range-restricted plant taxa. A main database has been prepared which includes vascular plant taxa that are obligate or facultative <b>chasmophytes</b> and also contains information about their life form, chorology, protection status, occurrence in more than 135 places such as cliffs, gorges, or open rocky habitats, and their geographical distribution in the 13 phytogeographical regions of Greece based on available floristic, vegetation, and phytosociological literature and on the authors' own collections and observations. The paper presents {{an analysis of the}} total diversity of cliff plant species, as well as the diversity of obligate chasmophytic plant species, endemics, and range-restricted taxa, in addition to the results of studying the distribution patterns of different subsets of plant taxa in the different phytogeographical regions of Greece. Hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes are the dominant life forms of the chasmophytic taxa. Among 935 species and subspecies registered, 476 are obligate <b>chasmophytes,</b> of which the majority are Greek endemics. Hierarchical cluster analysis of different subsets of plant taxa revealed affinities of the cliff flora of different phytogeographical regions. Additionally, 15 chasmophytic taxa mentioned in Annexes II, IV, and V of EEC Directive 92 / 43 belong to the cliff flora, of which 10 are obligate <b>chasmophytes</b> and nine have a priority for protection. Eighteen taxa are included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, of which four are critically endangered (CR), seven are vulnerable (VU), and three are endangered (EN). The distinct correlation between endemism and chasmophytic ecology is emphasized, since a detailed understanding of the local distribution and specific habitats of rare plants provides an opportunity for local conservation efforts that can influence biodiversity conservation on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|Diversity is a {{property}} of community that can described, characterized, and understood {{according to the}} functioning of ecosystems. To study the richness and local abundance and species replacement between habitats around the Zapatosa?s wetland complex (El Cesar Department), I carried out four field trips between November of 2006 and October of 2007. A total of 640 sampling hours/man analyzed five habitat types <b>chasmophyte</b> forest, dry forest, riparian forest, palm-grove and tree-lined savanna; {{with the exception of}} the palm-grove sampled at its 75 %, the others were sampled up to their 80 %. I found 847 reptiles that were distributed in 48 species. The group with the highest number of species was Colubridae with 14, followed by Gekkonidae with five. Five endemic species and eight with some conservation threat grade at a national level are reported. The riparian forest was the richest and most abundant habitat with 34 species and 196 individuals. For each habitat, Colubridae had the highest number of species, followed by the families Polychrotidae, Gekkonidae and Teiidae, in that order. The reptile species composition was not different between the tree-lined savanna and the <b>chasmophyte</b> forest, but differed among the tree-lined savanna and the riparian forest, palm-grove and dry forest habitats. The most important differences in the species composition among almost all the habitats were influenced by the species Anolis tropidogaster and Gonatodes albogularis, and the higher occurrence of Stenocercus erythrogaster in the <b>chasmophyte</b> forest. The species replacement had an average value of 50 %; the biggest amounts of shared species were the lizards, while the snake Leptodeira septentrionalis was the only one present in all habitat types. The forest grows-among-rocks showed the biggest complementarity and number of unique species compared to the other habitats. The wetland complex provides two thirds of the reptile's species reported until now for the Caribbean region, and more than 80 % of those reported for the El Cesar department.

50|$|The {{islands are}} covered in Mediterranean {{coniferous}} forest and macchia vegetation such as the strawberry tree, phillyrea, the heather, rhamnus, the kermew oak, often {{in the form of}} treelike shrubs, and evergreen trees such as the maple, the wild olive, the Phoenician juniper and the rare tree Amelanchier chelmea. Phrygana is also common and consists of many species. Of particular interest are the <b>chasmophytes</b> with several endemic species such as Campanula reiseri, Linum gyaricum, Arenaria phitosiana and others. Underwater sea-grass beds of Posidonia oceanica, which is particularly important for the development of other organisms and the retention and cycling of suspended particles and various substances in the marine environment, are widely spread and in good condition.|$|R

The island of Piperi is in Zone A of the Alonnisos Marine Park, the core of the Park, and is {{strictly}} protected. Its approach by any vessel without special permission is forbidden. The restrictions protect important habitats of the monk seal and of the birds of prey which live and reproduce on the inaccessible rocks of the island, which are also home to some rare plant species. Piperi has precipitous, rocky shores and its vegetation is dominated by pine forests, although there are also some holly, frygana, and <b>chasmophytes</b> to be found on the cliffs. There are 33 species of birds and it is estimated that the island is home to about 350-400 pairs of Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae).|$|R
50|$|Typical {{species of}} {{this zone is}} Bosnian pine. This rare kind of pine occurs {{sporadically}} higher than 1,000 metres and gradually replaces the black pine, while over 1,400 metres it creates an almost unmixed forest. Οver 2,000 metres the forest becomes sparser, reaching to 2,750 metres, thus creating the highest forest limit (highest limit of forest growth) in the Balkans, or even in Europe. Another feature of this zone is that over 2,500 metres the trees appear in a crawling form. The region, where Bosnian pine grows, is mostly dry and its slopes are rocky. There are no springs or water streams. The vegetation growing there is adapted to specific local conditions and represented by typical shrubs, graminaceous, <b>chasmophytes</b> etc., while the flora includes many endemic species of the Balkans.|$|R
40|$|Telekia speciosissima is an endemic <b>chasmophyte</b> of {{limestone}} and dolomite boulders in the Lombardy Prealps. It {{is included in}} the Italian Red List as a low-risk species. Seed germination dynamics of this plant were studied with the aim of producing germination protocols to use in ex situ conservation and recovery projects. Cold stratification and light requirements were investigated as potential factors improving seed germination. Seed samples were therefore stratified at 6 – 108 C during 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 180 days and then tested at higher temperature in continuous darkness or in a light/dark regime. Germination tests showed that seed dormancy was broken by cold stratification, while light promoted germination itself. These two factors strongly influenced germination dynamics and parameters.

40|$|Campanula tommasiniana is {{a typical}} <b>chasmophyte</b> occupying {{calcareous}} rock crevices and cracks along {{a wide range of}} ecological gradients, demonstrating a high degree of ecological plasticity and stress tolerance with regards to abiotic factors. Generally, three ecologically and floristically distinct groups of stands were recognized and typified according to a sigmatistic approach: (a) Seslerio juncifoliae-Campanuletum tommasinianae ass. nov., with stands occupying higher elevated sites fully exposed to sun and strong winds; (b) Seslerio autumnalis-Campanuletum tommasinianae ass. nov., representing stands predominantly developed within thermophytic beech stands, semi- to fully- shaded by the tree canopy; (c) Cystopteri fragilis-Campanuletum tommasinianae, sciophytic, stands adapted to moisture and coldwith high frequency and coverage of bryophytes. Results of DCA analyses using a unimodal model suggest that Campanula tommasiniana is primarily a plant of open and exposed sites of higher elevation despite being most frequently found in rock crevices within thermophytic and altimontane beech forests...|$|E

50|$|Pollination is entomophile (basically by {{flies and}} wasps and bees, less often by beetles), except in Bocconia and Macleaya. In Papaveroideae, the reward is pollen {{as there is}} no nectar. The visual {{attractant}} is the petals that are usually brightly coloured and often have basal guides, sometimes the attractant can also be the androecium as the petals do not last long. Some species, mostly those from the arctic and alpine regions, reinforce their attraction with floral fragrance (for example, Papaver alpinum smells of cloves), which in the case of Romneya drugs the insects. The anthers and stigmas mature at the same time, but Bocconia is clearly protogynous, the stigmas emerge from the calyx that encloses them. Autopollination is common and in some cases (for example, Roemeria hybrida) it occurs before the bud opens (cleistogamy). The presence of an aril suggests dispersion of seeds by ants (myrmecochory), once they have been expelled by the fruit. In the case of Bocconia the seeds remain attached to the replums after the capsule’s valves have fallen leaving their brilliant red or orange arils exposed, which attract birds to feed on them, facilitating their dispersal (ornithochory). Seeds that lack an aril appear to be dispersed by the wind (anemochory) for capsules that open, in the other cases they are freed when the fruit decomposes. Many Fumarioideae species have explosive fruits (ballistic), while Rupicapnos and Sarcocapnos species are <b>chasmophytes,</b> growing on rocks, and their fruit’s peduncles and pedicles are geotropic and they lengthen so that the seeds bury into the base of the plant.|$|R
40|$|Brassica rupestris Raf. is a <b>chasmophyte</b> {{species that}} {{includes}} two subspecies both endemic to Central-Western Sicily (Italy).

40|$|Colymbada tauromenitana (Guss.) Holub (Asteraceae) {{is a rare}} paleoendemic, <b>chasmophyte</b> species, {{occurring}} on calcareous cliffs in {{the eastern}} part of Sicily (Italy). The aim of this work is to analyze the structure and floristic composition of the C. tauromenitana community, in order to characterize the diversity of populations in relation to different ecological data. In all, 61 plots were examined. For each plot, the floristic composition and the cover of the species were determined using the standard relevé method. Three vegetation types emerged from canonical components analysis (CCA), correlated to a gradient of environmental conditions ranging from the coast to inland areas. The first group with Lomelosia cretica and Dianthus rupicola subsp. rupicola was correlated to thermo-xerophilous conditions (lower thermo- editerranean belt), the second group with Silene fruticosa and Colymbada tauromenitana was linked to thermophilous conditions (upper thermo-Mediterranean belt) and the third with Dianthus siculus and Odontites bocconei was correlated to mesophilous conditions (meso-Mediterranean belt). Altitude is the main factor influencing both species richness and floristic composition. The density of C. tauromenitana is influenced mainly by rainfall. Finally, we propose a new risk status for this rare species...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the flora of the walls of Durham City over the period 2006 – 2008 {{indicated}} that the floristic diversity had increased by between 39 % and 42 % since a survey undertaken fifty years ago by Woodell & Rossiter (1959). In addition, the increased frequency of occurrence of twenty-four of the thirty-four key species from the first survey is apparent and there is group of seven species not recorded in the first survey that has become especially prevalent.

40|$|The {{phytosociology}} {{and ecology}} of puna vegetation in twelve localities {{at an altitude}} of 3750 - 4500 m in northern Moquegua (south Peru) have been studied. The study area has a pluviseasonal climate with summer rainfall. Using TWINSPAN, Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Farthest Neighbor Clustering, 157 phytosociological relevés were analyzed. For each community, the syntaxonomy, floristic diversity and relation with environmental variables are discussed. 210 vascular plant species belonging to 131 genera and 52 families were recorded. Three main vegetation types were distinguished: 1. <b>chasmophyte</b> vegetation composed of a great diversity of shrubs, dwarf shrubs, ferns and annuals, 2. Puya raimondii stands characterized by considerable species richness in shrubs, grasses and herbs, and 3. extensive puna grasslands influenced by grazing. The zonal vegetation of the supratropical and orotropical bioclimatic belts was represented by two phytosociological classes: Argyrochosmetea niveae (chasmophytes) and Calamagrostietea vicunarum (Puya raimondii and puna grasslands). Within the Argyrochosmetea niveae and Salpichroetalia glandulosae, the new alliances Argyrochosmo niveae-Neowerdermannion peruvianae and Hypochaerido mucidae-Loricarion graveolentis were distinguished, including six associations consisting of steep rock and crevice shrublands on lithosols.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the concept of}} the Iranian endemic Lactuca polyclada in the sense of both its {{original}} author Boissier and its current use actually admixes two entirely different species, as was first noted by Beauverd a hundred years ago but has been neglected by later workers. One is a putative relative of L. rosularis, the other was recognised by Beauverd {{as a member of the}} genus Cicerbita. The name L. polyclada Boiss. is lectotypified here, maintaining its use as established by Beauverd for the Cicerbita species. Both species are morphologically delimited and mature achenes of Cicerbita polyclada are illustrated for the first time. The putative relative of Lactuca rosularis, a rare local endemic of the summit area of Kuh e-Dena, which has remained without a valid name by now, is described as a new species, Lactuca denaensis N.

This new species has peculiar achenes representing a hitherto unknown variant: the body of the beaked achenes is divided into two segments by a transversal constriction in the distal third. The proximal segment contains the embryo, the distal segment is solid with a lipid-containing yellow tissue. The easily detachable pappus and the equally easily detachable beak potentially obstruct dispersal by wind. Since detachment of the beak also exposes the lipid-containing tissue of the distal segment, its potential as an elaiosome and myrmecochory as a possible mode of dispersal are discussed...|$|E
