5000|$|A <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> {{butterfly}} is {{very similar}} to a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor, except that the inner, long strikes are at the same strike. The resulting position requires the underlying's spot price to change less before there is a profit, but the trade is typically more expensive (larger net debit) than a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the premium}} earned on {{the sales of}} the written {{contracts}} {{is less than the}} premium paid for the purchased contracts, a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor is typically a net debit transaction. This debit represents the maximum potential loss for the <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor.|$|R

50|$|A trader {{who sells}} a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor speculates that the spot {{price of the}} {{underlying}} instrument will not be between the short strikes when the options expire.

50|$|The <b>short</b> <b>irons</b> are {{traditionally}} {{regarded as the}} easiest to hit; however they are typically used in situations requiring very high accuracy, and so it becomes critical to minimize any effect of mis-hits. <b>Short</b> <b>irons</b> are often constructed using steel shafts, even if lower-lofted irons in the set have graphite; the steel minimizes clubhead torquing, increasing the consistency and thus accuracy of shots made {{at the cost of}} reduced flex which reduces distance (a secondary concern in most situations where these irons are used).|$|R

5000|$|A {{straddle}} {{is effectively}} a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> butterfly without {{the wings and}} is constructed simply by purchasing an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put.

50|$|Hot <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> is brittle when hot. This was {{a serious}} problem as most iron used during the 17th and 18th century was bar or wrought iron. Wrought iron is shaped by {{repeated}} blows with a hammer while hot. A piece of hot <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> will crack if worked with a hammer. When a piece of hot iron or steel cracks the exposed surface immediately oxidizes. This layer of oxide prevents the mending of the crack by welding. Large cracks cause the iron or steel to break up. Smaller cracks can cause the object to fail during use. The degree of hot shortness is {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of sulfur present. Today iron with over 0.03% sulfur is avoided.|$|R
50|$|It may {{be argued}} that a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> shaft has very few confirmations from archaeology.

50|$|A <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> {{butterfly}} option {{strategy will}} attain maximum profit {{when the price}} of the underlying asset at expiration is equal to the strike price at which the call and put options are sold.

50|$|The {{potential}} {{profit for}} a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor {{is the difference}} between the strikes on either the call spread or the put spread (whichever is greater if it is not balanced) multiplied by the size of each contract (typically 100 or 1000 shares of the underlying instrument) less the net debit paid.|$|R
5000|$|The {{addition}} of phosphorus has a down side. At concentrations higher than 0.2% <b>iron</b> becomes increasingly <b>cold</b> <b>short,</b> or brittle at low temperatures. <b>Cold</b> <b>short</b> {{is especially important}} for bar iron. Although bar iron is usually worked hot, its uses often require it to be tough, bendable, and resistant to shock at room temperature. A nail that shattered when hit with a hammer or a carriage wheel that broke when it hit a rock would not sell well. High enough concentrations of phosphorus render any iron unusable [...] The effects of cold shortness are magnified by temperature. Thus, a piece of iron that is perfectly serviceable in summer, might become extremely brittle in winter. There is some evidence that during the Middle Ages the very wealthy may have had a high phosphorus sword for summer and a low phosphorus sword for winter [...]|$|R
5000|$|The 8 and 9 irons are {{commonly}} called the [...] "short irons". They have the highest-mass clubheads and the shortest shafts of the numbered irons, {{and are used}} for shots requiring high loft and/or moderate to short distance (typically between 130 and 150 yards with a full swing). Shots that must carry over tall and/or nearby obstacles such as a stand of trees, or approach shots from inside 140 yards of the pin, are common <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> situations. The <b>short</b> <b>irons</b> also make good [...] "bump and run" [...] clubs; used with a putting motion from the fringe around the green, the ball will carry in the air a few yards over the thick grass that would hamper a putt, then land softly on the green where it will then roll for a distance like a putt.|$|R

50|$|Hot <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> can {{be worked}}, {{but it has}} to be worked at low {{temperatures}}. Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman.

5000|$|A {{strangle}} {{is effectively}} a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor, {{but without the}} wings. It is constructed by purchasing an out-of-the-money put and an out-of-the money call. The strangle is a more expensive trade (higher net debit to be paid due {{to the absence of}} the outer strikes that typically reduce the net debit), but the Strangle does not restrict profit potential {{in the case of a}} dramatic change in the spot price of the underlying instrument.|$|R
5000|$|The iron condor is {{an option}} trading {{strategy}} utilizing two vertical spreads - a put spread and a call spread with the same expiration and four different strikes. A long iron condor is essentially selling {{both sides of the}} underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of calls and puts, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money call(s) and put(s) respectively. The converse produces a <b>short</b> <b>iron</b> condor.|$|R
5000|$|Other clubs, {{especially}} <b>short</b> <b>irons</b> {{and other}} wedges, now incorporate a small degree of bounce {{to assist in}} plays from the rough or other soft lies, but the sand wedge will typically have the highest amount of bounce of any club in a player's bag. There are however exceptions; Callaway Golf for instance markets a [...] "Big Bertha" [...] line of irons in which the lob wedge has significantly higher bounce than the sand wedge.|$|R
