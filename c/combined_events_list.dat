50|$|The {{stadium and}} the ski jump served as venues for the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 1937. The ski jump {{was not used}} in FIS Ski Jumping World Cup until the 1980-81 season when it was won by Norway's Roger Ruud. Its last World Cup event was in 1998 and was won by Finland's Janne Ahonen. A final ski jumping <b>event</b> <b>listed</b> was a Continental Cup in February 2001, but no results were listed. The last {{cross-country}} skiing event after the 1937 championships was a Continental Cup event in 1999. This was a women's 10 km event won by Germany's Steffi Völkel and a men's 15 km event won by Spain's Jordi Ribo. As for Nordic <b>combined,</b> two more <b>events</b> have taken place since the 1937 championships though they were World Cup B events. The last Nordic <b>combined</b> <b>event</b> held in Chamonix was a World Cup B event in 2000 and was won by France's Kevin Arnould.|$|R

50|$|In the FRM, the {{reaction}} whose time is minimum on the <b>event</b> <b>list</b> is advanced. In the <b>event</b> <b>list,</b> the tentative times for all possible reactions are stored. After {{the selection of}} one event, the system time is advanced to {{the reaction}} time, and the <b>event</b> <b>list</b> is recalculated. This method is efficient in computation time because the reaction always occurs in one event. On the other hand, it consumes a lot of computer memory because of the <b>event</b> <b>list.</b> Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} apply to large-scale systems.|$|R

40|$|Title: Trends in {{performance}} development in <b>combined</b> <b>events.</b> Objectives: The {{aim of this}} work was to investigate trends of the performance development in <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> during 2005 - 2014 based on results of top level competitions and interindividual variability of the point structure of individual <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> athletes. Methods: In this work we used the method of comparison {{and analysis of the}} performance development in <b>combined</b> <b>events.</b> Results: The trend of the performance in <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> did not change. <b>Combined</b> <b>events</b> are dominated by athletes with excellent sprint-jumping performances without significant weaknesses in throwing disciplines. The evenness of women opponents is more evident than among men. Slight progression in men's decathlon ocurred in the years 2012 - 2014 because of the high scores of Ashton Eaton's winning performances. Carolina Klüft dominated women heptathlon in the years 2005 - 2007, but the average score among heptathletes did not increase. In indoor pentathlon, the development was slightly progressive until 2012. Average scores of pentathletes were similar to the winning performances showing high evenness of opponents. Point structures of five selected male and female athletes (of top performance level) in the observed time period show understandable differences from [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Combined</b> <b>events</b> are {{competitions}} {{in which}} athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in each event, which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> are the men's decathlon and the women's heptathlon. Due to stadium limitations, indoor <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table. Other longer <b>combined</b> <b>events</b> do exist, such as the icosathlon (double decathlon) for men and the tetradecathlon for women. Indoors, both men and women compete in the tetradecathlon, with slightly different events to the women's outdoor version.|$|R
