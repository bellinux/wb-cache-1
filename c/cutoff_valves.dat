50|$|On December 6, Missile 6F {{suffered}} a leak in the sustainer hydraulic system at BECO, resulting in eventual loss of hydraulic pressure {{and failure to}} achieve the planned range. After this debacle, the Air Force relented and agreed to install <b>cutoff</b> <b>valves</b> for the RP-1 lines as well, and this failure mode did not repeat itself.|$|E
5000|$|McNaught {{became chief}} {{designer}} and superintendent at James Petrie's and designed a cutoff gear {{for use on}} a stationary steam engine. This was patented by James Petrie in 1844. Petrie started to build mill engines in 1819, McNaught joined in 1838 and remained until 1858, when he started his own company. Before this patent, there were problems with slide valves which suffered excessive wear. The Petrie and McNaught <b>cutoff</b> <b>valves</b> were circular with sloping faces that allowed a variable cut-off; they could be easily connected to the governor that McNaught patented in 1850.|$|E
50|$|Fred Key ran the Key Brothers Flying Service at Key Field {{until his}} death in 1971. The <b>cutoff</b> <b>valve</b> {{developed}} for the Keys by A.D. Hunter was an important innovation for national defense, being the precursor of those used by modern tanker airplanes, such as the KC-135 Stratotanker, that keep bombers and fighter aircraft in the air. Today, with only slight modifications, U.S. Air Force and Strategic Air Command airplanes use the valve that Hunter invented.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{emergency}} <b>cutoff</b> <b>valve</b> {{is widely}} used in gas pipelines to ensure operation safety. A proper type of solenoid valve was studied and selected for this application. A new state indicator was designed attached to it to give an off-state signal. The indicator was relative independence to the main body with a simpler structure. It was easy to remote control, easy to maintain and it worked properly. The response time was tested and it was shorter than 2 s. It was {{far less than the}} other types of motor-driven valve. The explosion-proof feature was also considered, the explosion- certified parts were used to ensure its safety as an easier and better way. The valve was reliable and cheaper for large-scale application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{developed}} and tested the effective gas {{safety management system}} by using wireless intelligent gas safety appliances to monitor gas flow and pressure, earthquake in a micom-gas-meter, to check combustible gas leaks and temperature (upper 100 ℃) in an automatic extinguisher and to measure smoke and CO gas. Then our system takes safety measures such as cutoff, warning and messages to protect a serious risk if results of event are abnormal, communicates with a wall-pad including a gateway with ZigBee network in buildings and to inform the event to user via the safety management program in our server. Also, the inner <b>cutoff</b> <b>valve</b> of intelligent gas meters and automatic extinguishers are operated automatically if irregular events are occurred. 1...|$|R
50|$|Ed Hujsak, {{assistant}} chief engineer of mechanical and propulsion {{systems for the}} Atlas program, believed that {{the location of the}} propellant lines on the E/F missiles was causing LOX and RP-1 ejected from the spent booster engines following staging to mix and explode, possibly damaging valves or plumbing. As evidence of this, he pointed to telemetry data from flights indicating a momentary pitching motion of the missile after booster jettison, which could be the result of the energy generated by exploding propellant. The conclusion was that such an event had ruptured low pressure ducting on Missile 26E and caused loss of fuel flow to the sustainer gas generator, or else propellant residue had obstructed the ducting. Hujsak proposed that additional <b>cutoff</b> <b>valves</b> be added to the propellant lines in the booster engines that would be closed just before jettison. This upgrade had to be retrofitted to missiles that had already been shipped, but Air Force officials argued that they only needed to add valves to the LOX lines {{on the grounds that the}} RP-1 could not detonate without oxidizer.|$|E

50|$|The {{first two}} Atlas F flights were Missile 2F on August 8, 1961 and Missile 4F on November 22, both from LC-11 at CCAS. Both tests were entirely successful, and on December 12, Missile 5F {{launched}} from LC-11. This test was a partial failure; an electrical short in the guidance system caused an early SECO command {{to be sent}} and the missile fell short of its planned range. On the 21st, Atlas 6F lifted off of LC-11 carrying a rhesus monkey named Scatback. This was the third launch of a primate on an Atlas {{in the past month}} - the first was Mercury-Atlas 5 which successfully lofted a chimpanzee on a three-orbit mission while the second, an Atlas E test, malfunctioned shortly after liftoff and had to be destroyed, claiming the life of the squirrel monkey it was carrying. Atlas 6F performed acceptably until after booster jettison when a hydraulic failure caused loss of sustainer thrust. The capsule separated and splashed down near Ascension Island in the South Atlantic, however the tracking beacon failed to operate and recovery crews could not locate it. They gave up the search and Scatback was officially lost at sea. The failure was traced to combustion of spent propellant following booster jettison which was damaging valves and/or ducting; it was solved by the installation of <b>cutoff</b> <b>valves</b> in the booster section.|$|E
5000|$|The Curlew {{was built}} in 1856 by the Harlan & Hollingsworth Iron Shipbuilding Company of Wilmington, Delaware. It was 135 ft long, 23 ft wide, 8 ft depth of hold, and listed at 236 tons. Its average draft was 5 ft, which suited the shallow waters of the North Carolina sounds. The {{steamboat}} had side paddle wheels that were 18 ft in diameter by 8 ft wide. The Curlew had no figurehead, a round stern, and no mast. A walking beam engine with a 29 in diameter cylinder and a 9 ft stroke powered the new steamer. This type of engine had a distinctive trapezoid-shaped rocker arm mounted between the paddle wheels, which transmitted power from the piston rod to the crank on the paddle wheel shaft. For improved efficiency, the Curlew's engine was equipped with Sickle's patented <b>cutoff</b> <b>valve.</b> Steam was provided by a two furnace return-flue boiler 18 ft long, 7 ft high, and 8 ft wide, and rated at 30 lbf/in² (210 kPa) of pressure. It started operating in North Carolina in July 1856. (Olson 1997:30ff) ...|$|R
50|$|Neither Watt nor Boulton had a {{solution}} to the engine's behaviour. Watt's experience with the Chacewater engine, a rebuilt Smeaton engine, at Wheal Busy, suggested that cutoff led to a violent action. In September he recommended throttling the steam supply to the engine. Boulton favoured further experimentation with <b>cutoff</b> (i.e. <b>valve</b> timing) and in 1779 suggested that a series of more scientific measurements be tried. With hindsight, Boulton's approach was the more thermodynamically efficient, although this lesson was not fully appreciated by locomotive drivers right to the end of steam power.|$|R
5000|$|A common {{feature of}} large Corliss engines is {{one or two}} sets of narrow gear teeth in {{the rim of the}} {{flywheel}}. These teeth allow the flywheel to be barred, that is, turned {{with the aid of a}} crowbar. [...] This may be needed during engine maintenance, for example, to set the <b>cutoff</b> and admission <b>valve</b> timing, and it may be needed during engine starting.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To prospectively analyse the clinical, {{biochemical}} and radiological {{characteristics of}} the mass lesions arising in a background of chronic calcific pancreatitis (CCP). METHODS: Eighty three patients, who presented with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and a mass lesion in the head of pancreas between February 2005 and December 2011, {{were included in the}} study. Patients who were identified to have malignancy underwent Whipple&#x 2019;s procedure and patients whose investigations were suggestive of a benign lesion underwent Frey&#x 2019;s procedure. Student t-test was used to compare the mean values of imaging findings [common bile duct (CBD), main pancreatic duct (MPD) size] and laboratory data [Serum bilirubin, carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 (CA 19 - 9) ] between the groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) analysis was done to calculate the <b>cutoff</b> <b>valves</b> of serum bilirubin, CA 19 - 9, MPD and CBD size. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive valve (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated using these cut off points. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression model. RESULTS: The study included 56 men (67. 5 %) and 27 women (32. 5 %). Sixty (72. 3 %) patients had tropical calcific pancreatitis and 23 (27. 7 %) had alcohol related CCP. Histologically, it was confirmed that 55 (66. 3 %) of the 83 patients had an inflammatory head mass and 28 (33. 7 %) had a malignant head mass. The mean age of individuals with benign inflammatory mass and those with malignant mass was 38. 4 years and 45 years respectively. Significant clinical features that predicted a malignant head mass in CP were presence of a head mass in CCP of tropics, old age, jaundice, sudden worsening abdominal pain, gastric outlet obstruction and significant weight loss (P &#x 2264; 0. 05). The ROC curve analysis showed a cut off value of 5. 8 mg/dL for serum bilirubin, 127 U/mL for CA 19 - 9, 11. 5 mm for MPD size and 14. 5 mm for CBD size. CONCLUSION: Elevated Serum bilirubin and CA 19 - 9, and dilated MPD and CBD were useful in predicting malignancy in patients with CCP and head mass...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntervention for valvular {{heart disease}} poses unique {{clinical}} challenges in cardiology because the diseases are of relatively low prevalence, the interventions do not lend themselves to randomized comparative trials, and important clinical end points are assessed only after decades of follow-up. In addition, continuing advances in prosthetic heart valve technology make follow-up a moving target because long-term data by definition are available only for older prostheses. Newer tissue and mechanical prostheses afford superior hemodynamics compared with their older counterparts, and data suggest that durability and patient mortality are superior with newer compared with older bioprostheses. Arbitrary <b>cutoffs</b> dictating <b>valve</b> choice based predominantly on patient age may not give appropriate weight to individual patient perspectives. In educating and counseling patients regarding choices in heart valve prostheses, the clinician should help the patient weigh the relative merits for the individual patient of projected mortality, valve durability, and requirement for anticoagulation, with associated freedom from re-operation, hemorrhagic and thromboembolic risk, and impact on lifestyle...|$|R
50|$|In the 1840s and 50s, {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to overcome this}} problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate, variable <b>cutoff</b> expansion <b>valve</b> riding {{on the back of}} the main slide valve; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff. The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.|$|R
