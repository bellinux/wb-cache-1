The application of water does not always result in effective fire control, {{and there is a}} general concern regarding conductivity and personnel safety. Class C fires can be effectively controlled by removing the oxygen. The removal of electricity as a <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> source is important to eliminate re-ignition.

These conditions include flight through moderate to heavy turbulence, rain, hail or sleet. The potentially hazardous circumstances are highlighted in the flight manual with a requirement to select <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition.</b> Alternatively, the FADEC engine controller will select ignition automatically if it detects specific changes in engine parameters. It will also perform a relight if necessary. A manual re-light attempt is made by following the procedure in the Flight Operations Manual.|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{forecasting}} is a top-echelon research domain, {{which has}} {{over the past}} several years experienced highly provocative research discussions. The scope of this research domain continues to expand due to the <b>continuous</b> knowledge <b>ignition</b> motivated by scholars in the area. So, more intelligent and intellectual contributions on current research issues in the accident domain will potentially spark more lively academic, value-added discussions that will be of practical significance to members of the safety community. In this communication, a new grey–fuzzy–Markov time series model, developed from nondifferential grey interval analytical framework has been presented for the first time. This instrument forecasts future accident occurrences under timeinvariance assumption. The actual contribution made in the article is to recognise accident occurrence patterns and decompose theminto grey state principal pattern components. The architectural framework of the developed grey–fuzzy– Markov pattern recognition (GFMAPR) model has four stages: fuzzification, smoothening, defuzzification and whitenisation. The results of application of the developed novel model signify that forecasting could be effectively carried out under uncertain conditions and hence, positions the model as a distinctly superior tool for accident forecasting investigations. The novelty of thework lies in the capability of the model inmaking highly accurate predictions and forecasts based on the availability of small or incomplete accident data...|$|R
40|$|Early {{research}} on combustion of metals {{was motivated by}} {{the knowledge of the}} large heat release and corresponding high temperatures associated with metal-oxygen reactions. The advent of space flight brought about an increased interest in the ignition and combustion of metallic particles as additives in solid rocket propellants. More recently, attention has been given to the flammability properties of bulk, structural metals due to the number of accidental explosions of metal components in high-pressure oxygen systems. The following work represents a preliminary study that is part of a broader research effort aimed at providing further insight into the phenomena of bulk metal combustion by looking at the effects of gravity on the ignition behavior of metals. The scope of this preliminary experimental study includes the use of a non-coherent, <b>continuous</b> radiation <b>ignition</b> source, the measurement of temperature profiles of a variety of metals and a qualitative observation of the ignition phenomena at normal gravity. The specific objectives of the investigation include: (1) a feasibility study of the use of a continuous radiation source for metal ignition; (2) testing and characterization of the ignition behavior of a variety of metals; and (3) building a preliminary experimental database on ignition of metals under normal gravity conditions...|$|R

40|$|The breakup {{behavior}} and flammability of antimisting turbine fuels subjected to aerodynamic shear are investigated. Fuels tested were Jet A containing 0. 3 % FM- 9 polymer {{at various levels}} of degradation ranging from virgin AMK to neat Jet A. The misting behavior of the fuels was quantified by droplet size distribution measurements. A technique based on high resolution laser photography and digital image processing of photographic records for rapid determination of droplet size distribution was developed. The flammability of flowing droplet-air mixtures was quantified by direct measurements of temperature rise in a flame established {{in the wake of}} a <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> source. The temperature rise measurements were correlated with droplet size measurements. The flame anchoring phenomenon associated with the breakup of a liquid fuel in the wake of bluff body was shown to be important in the context of a survivable crash scenario. A pass/fail criterion for flammability testing of antimisting fuels, based on this flame-anchoring phenomenon, was proposed. The role of various ignition sources and their intensity in ignition and post-ignition behavior of antimisting fuels was also investigated...|$|E
50|$|The fuel is the {{substance}} being oxidized or {{burned in the}} combustion process. The most common fuels contain carbon along with combinations of hydrogen and oxygen.

The resulting self-sustained chemical chain reaction is complex and requires fuel, an oxidizer, and heat energy to {{come together in a}} very specific way. An oxidizing agent is a material or substance that will release gases, including oxygen, when the proper conditions exist. It is crucial to the sustainment of a flame or fire.|$|R

The objective of the present work is to produce more data on the subject.

In particular a relationship between the standard ignition temperature of dust clouds and the temperature of the target at the minimum incident power at <b>ignition</b> (<b>continuous</b> irradiation) has been highlighted which seems to be similar to the one obtained for gases.

40|$|A {{total of}} 12 {{ventilation}} experiments with various combinations of hydrogen release rates and ventilation speeds were performed {{in order to}} study how ventilation speed and release rate effect the hydrogen concentration in a closed system. The experiential facility was constructed out of steel plates and beams {{in the shape of}} a rectangular enclosure. The volume of the test facility was about 60 m 3. The front face of the enclosure was covered by a plastic film in order to allow visible and infrared cameras to capture images of the flame. The inlet and outlet vents were located on the lower front face and the upper backside panel, respectively. Hydrogen gas was released toward the ceiling from the center of the floor. The hydrogen gas was released at constant rate in each test. The hydrogen release rate ranged from 0. 002 m 3 /s to 0. 02 m 3 /s. Ventilation speeds were 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 m 3 /s respectively. Ignition was attempted at the end of the hydrogen release by using multiple <b>continuous</b> spark <b>ignition</b> modules on the ceiling and next to the release point. Time evolution of hydrogen concentration was measured using evacuated sample bottles. Overpressure and impulse inside and outside the facility were also measured.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment is {{to better understand the}} combustion behavior of pulsed, turbulent diffusion flames by conducting experiments in microgravity. The fuel jet is fully-modulated (i. e., completely shut off between pulses) by an externally controlled valve system leading to enhanced fuel/air mixing compared to acoustically excited or partially-modulated jets. Experiments are conducted both in laboratories at UW and WPI and in the GRC 2. 2 s Drop Tower. A single fuel nozzle with diameter d = 2 mm is centered in a combustor 20 20 cm in cross section and 67 cm in height. The gaseous fuel flow (ethylene or a 50 / 50 ethylene/nitrogen mixture by volume) is fully-modulated by a fast-response solenoid valve with injection times from tau = 4 to tau = 300 ms. The nominal Reynolds number based on the fuel velocity during injection, U(sub jet), is 5, 000. A slow oxidizer co-flow properly ventilates the flame and an electrically heated wire loop serves as a <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> source.

40|$|Flames within combustors can be stabilised by {{creating}} recirculation of hot products {{to act as}} a heat source for the <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> of the fresh mixture. Swirling flows through sudden expansions is the most common solution adopted to induce recirculation zones. In addition to flame stabilisation, the swirling motion enhances the mixing between the fuel and the oxidant streams, promoting complete fuel combustion. Because of the close relation between flow field and combustor performance, swirling flows have been widely studied in the literature. Experimental analyses usually deal with high-swirling flows because they produce strong recirculation zones which provide a stable anchoring to the flame. By comparison, few studies in the literature focus on low-swirl flow fields. In this study, low-swirling flows generated by axial swirlers are analysed. Data taken from the literature of axial and tangential velocities measured on combustors of similar geometry and swirl number are compared in order to evaluate the effect of some design and operating parameters on the flow field. The literature database is extended considering original measurements performed by the authors on a laboratory combustor. The paper aims at providing a comprehensive insight of the flow field by considering the effect of parameters not yet systematically investigated in low-swirl combustors...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The vast majority of gas turbine combustor systems employ swirl injectors to produce a central toroidal recirculation zone (CTRZ) which entrains and recirculates {{a portion of the}} hot combustion gases to provide <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> to the incoming air-fuel mix. In addition to these primary functions, swirl injectors often generate multiple aerodynamic instability modes which are helical in nature with characteristic frequencies that can differ by many orders of magnitude. If any of these frequencies are consistent with prevalent acoustic modes within the combustor there is a potential for flow-acoustic coupling which may reinforce acoustic oscillations and drive combustion instabilities via the Rayleigh criterion. The aerodynamic performance of the swirl injector is thus of great practical importance to the design and development of combustion systems and there is a strong desire within industry for reliable computational methods that can predict this highly unsteady behaviour. This assessment can be made under isothermal conditions which avoids the complex interactions that occur in reacting flow. The goal of the present work was to compare and contrast the performance of Unsteady Reynolds- Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) and Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD methodologies for a combustion system equipped with a derivative of an industrial Turbomeca swirl injector as this exhibits similar unsteady aerodynamic behaviour under reacting and isothermal conditions.

5000|$|The Cleveland open-cup {{method is}} one of three main methods in {{chemistry}} for determining the flash point of a petroleum product using a Cleveland open-cup apparatus, also known as a Cleveland open-cup tester. [...] First, the test cup of the apparatus (usually brass) is filled to a certain level with a portion of the product. Then, the temperature of this chemical is increased rapidly and then at a slow, constant rate as it approaches the theoretical flash point. The increase in temperature will cause the chemical to begin to produce flammable vapor in increasing quantities and density. The lowest temperature at which a small test flame passing over the surface of the liquid causes the vapor to ignite is considered the chemical's flash point. This apparatus may also be used to determine the chemical's fire point which is considered to have been reached when the application of the test flame produces at least five <b>continuous</b> seconds of <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
40|$|Among the {{industrial}} sectors that {{are affected by}} dust explosions, the metal working industry {{is one of the}} most frequently involved. Metal dusts are often the by-products of mechanical workings. Dust producing machines are widely distributed, small in size and are generally located in workplaces. Abatement plants are also often located in the working area. The companies that are involved in these explosions are often small, and thus often have limited resources. These factors generally lead to difficulties in managing the risk of explosions. This paper has the aim of investigating the flammability of waste dust produced by metal workings, and to define the dust properties that are more likely to lead to an explosion. For this purpose, a simple and fast flammability test has been used as a cheap way of characterise the flammability of the samples. The test has been called the Speedy Esplosibility Test (SET), and it is similar to the procedure suggested in the new ISO/IEC standard (ISO/IEC 2016) that came into force recently. SET is composed of 4 different tests, derived from standard procedures, each of which represents a different ignition mechanism: • High voltage <b>continuous</b> arc <b>ignition</b> and glowing wire ignition in a Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); • Dust cloud ignition in a G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on a hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). The SET results are compared with the standard flammability classification obtained according to ISO, 2016 ISO/IEC 80079 : 2016, with the standard KSt measurement in the 20 -L Siwek Sphere, and with tests in the 20 -L sphere with 2 × 1 kJ igniters, respectively according to the UNI EN 14034 : 2011 part 2 and part 3. Moreover, the morphology and chemical nature of the dusts have also been determined and their effects on dust explosibility are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Combustible dusts {{explosion}} risk {{depends on a}} huge number of dust characteristics which allows the analyst to assess its behavior at different conditions. To characterize dust behavior {{a huge number of}} parameters can be measured according to several technical standards. In general, each standard describes how to measure a single parameter, which characterize a specific dust behavior. Nowadays there's no standard conceived to simply determine if the dust can cause an explosion. As available standard tests are often costly in terms of time and money for both laboratory analysts and customers, moreover the latter are sometimes in the condition to submit to expensive tests dust samples that could not explode. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a simplified and straightforward test that can assess whether a dust is explosible or not. The test is called Speditive Esplosibility Test (SET). It is composed of 4 different tests, each of them representing a different ignition mechanism derived from standards procedures. These are: -High voltage <b>continuous</b> arc <b>ignition</b> and glowing wire ignition in Hartman 1. 2 l tube (based on UNI EN 13821 : 2004); -Dust cloud ignition in G-G furnace and dust layer ignition on hot plate (based on UNI EN 50281 : 1999). In this context the 4 experimental procedures were slightly modified respect to standards procedures: the test conditions have to be "as worst as possible" in terms of energy transferred to the sample. This approach assure that also dusts that have relative weak tendency to ignite is considered and classified. The test classifies dusts in 3 categories: explosible at ambient temperature (in case of ignition in Hartmann tube tests), explosible at high temperature (in case of ignition in GG or hot plate tests), not explosible (in case of no ignition). Fundamentally, the test procedure is configured as a statistical investigation in which a defined number of tests is made. Screening test has been performed for several types of dusts and results compared with kst tests in 20 l Siwek Sphere for some of the samples. Results sees to confirm the hypothesis of the Screening Test and its reliability to assess explosibility of combustible dust...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of high-current {{low pressure gas}} discharge plasmas with electrode surfaces, and possibilities for optimization {{with the help of}} magnetic fields, is investigated. The dicharge geometries were operated in hydrogen at pressures around 20 Pa, voltages between 10 - 20 kV, current amplitudes of 50 to 100 kA and pulse durations of 3 and 28 #mu#s (FWHM). In order to optimize the plasma-electrode interaction in regard of low electrode erosion and long lifetime, transversal as well as axial magnetic fields relativ to the current flow direction in the plasma were superpositioned. In most cases, the magnetic fields were produced internally by the discharge current flow inside the electrodes. Transverse magnetic fields lead to arc velocities which are several orders of magnitude above those of similar atmospheric and vacuum arcs, and to arc current densities which are more than one order of magnitude lower than known comparable values. Therefore, a magnetically moved arc can effectively prevent the region of discharge ignition and even that of plasma stagnation from strong erosion. This was shown in an electrode configuration acting as a fast switch, which reached an integrated lifetime of more than 25 kC of transfered charge. The hydrodynamic {{interaction of}} the arc and the background gas is the limiting factor for the observed arc velocity. The cathodic emission processes can be described qualitatively and quantitatively by the <b>continuous</b> <b>ignition</b> {{of a large number of}} microscopic cathode spots by the moving plasma column. The plasma bulk is formed mainly from the filling gas, metal vapor is essential only in the near-cathode region. Axial magnetic fields of 200 mT and above are suitable to produce large area diffuse discharge plasmas in the low-pressure regime at currents as high as 50 to 100 kA, with corresponding low erosion rates. Radial expansion velocities and cathodic emission mechanism are similar to that of the transverse-magnetic-field low-pressure arc, and hence differ strongly from the properties of comparable vacuum arcs.

The influence of the level of swirl, SN = 0. 51 − 0. 8, was first investigated experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) by varying the inlet swirl vane angle. Based on a qualitative assessment of instantaneous velocity data, and a range of coherent structure eduction techniques, it was found that ® 1 = 30 ± (SN ¼ 0. 8) would be the most challenging test case for LES and URANS as this contained near and far-field instability modes that differ in frequency by around two orders of magnitude and the highest levels of normal Reynolds-stress anisotropy. Based on extensive simulations performed with both in-house (LULES and Delta) and commercial (Fluent) CFD codes it was found that, despite the relative modest computational cost of URANS which is between one-third (RST) to an order of magnitude (k−²) less than that demanded by LES, only LES captures the all-important frequency content in accordance with experimental evidence and, thus, only LES can be recommended for use in swirl injector flows. The increased cost is believed to be an absolutely worthwhile expense because of the high fidelity of the predicted results in the important area of flow instabilities.
