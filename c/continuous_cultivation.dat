50|$|Changestat is a <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{method that}} is used for {{acquiring}} quantitative data of a microorganism's metabolism at various environmental conditions within a single experiment. Every changestat always starts as a <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivation</b> experiment (chemostat, turbidostat), but after reaching steady state, smooth and slow change of an environmental parameter is applied. Two most common changestat techniqies are accelerostat (A-stat) and dilution rate stat (D-stat).In case of A-stat the changing environmental parameter is dilution rate (D, h−1) that causes the increase of specific growth rate (μ, h−1). When the acceleration of dilution (a) is chosen correctly then D = μ as in chemostat. The problem of choosing the correct acceleration of dilution has been studied with Escherichia coli and Lactococcus lactis resulting recommended range of 0.01-0.005 h−2.In D-stat dilution rate is always constant as in chemostat, but after reaching steady state environmental parameter other than dilution rate is changed. For instance temperature, pH or acetate concentration has been smoothly changed in bioreactor.Turbidostat type changestats are called Z-auxoaccelerostats (pH-auxoaccelerostat, CO2-auxoaccelerostat). In similar to D-stat after reaching steady state a selected environmental parameter is changed.|$|E

After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Israel began to displace the Bedouin of the Negev desert, and by 1953 had expelled 90% of the roughly 100,000 people in the northern Negev. According to Eyal Weizman, various methods, from streafing to massacres and tent burning were employed, and the refugees moved to Gaza and the West Bank. The survivors were swept into a more salinated area, into a reservation, known as Siyāj. The Bedouin who came from Al-Araqib ("Gentle Hills"), such as the al-Tūris and al-‘Uqbis have nonetheless persisted in returning to their ancestral lands, and their village lies precisely on the 200mm RPA (rainfall per annum) drawn by Israeli meteorologists {{on the basis of}} a schema developed by Wladimir Köppen to define cultivable land from the desert. Two archives have been established to document the local Bedouins rights to their land, one by Nūri al-‘Uqbi and another by Israeli geographer Oren Yiftachel.

50|$|Mangoes are a {{commercial}} fruit crop of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae) which {{are an important}} crop in many countries including India, China, Pakistan, Mexico and Thailand. There are many species of mango, but the only one raised for commercial fruit production is Mangifera indica, as the fruit it bears is the most appealing and edible. Originally cultivated in India beginning more than 5,000 years ago, mangoes currently represent up to 50% of international fruit production. Mangoes are susceptible to a large variety of pathogens, including root rot, anthracnose, die back, and leaf spot, among others. However, {{one of the most}} prevalent and damaging diseases of this crop is powdery mildew of mango, caused by Oidium mangiferae; crop losses between 20 and 90 percent have been reported from various regions due to powdery mildew infections. Most mango cultivars in use today were released from 1949-1967, with <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivation</b> since that time. Long term cultivation may affect disease resistance, and very little breeding for resistant varieties has been undertaken; due to this, almost all cultivars show susceptibility to O. mangiferae and it is extremely widespread. The most popular variety of mango, the Tommy Atkins, was developed in the 1920s in Florida and is favored because of its long shelf life and anthracnose resistance, though it is still somewhat susceptible to powdery mildew and control strategies must still be enacted. Diseases of perennial crops such as mango are devastating due to the long time period to maturity for the plants, as a tree grown from seed will not produce fruit until it has reached three to six years of age. In contrast, the mango tree may live and produce fruit for several hundred years if it remains healthy and is well cared for. In addition, perennial crops can allow for buildup of inoculum and widespread dispersal of pathogens such as powdery mildew because the host is present in all seasons and through multiple years.|$|E

Harsh conditions during pretreatment promote {{the formation of}} a number of inhibitory compounds, among which the furaldehydes furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) have shown to impede growth and limit ethanol productivity of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the present study, a recombinant xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae strain was challenged with sub-lethal concentrations of furfural and HMF in anaerobic <b>continuous</b> and batch <b>cultivations.</b> The inhibitors concentration was {{as close as possible to}} lethal, yet allowing steady state in <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivations.</b> For batch cultivations, the chosen concentration completely inhibited growth, yet allowing growth resumption. Analysis of the transcriptome and the levels of intracellular metabolites connected to energy and redox metabolism was performed in comparison with cells grown in the absence of inhibitors. Exposure to furaldehydes caused a significant alteration of the fermentation products, especially in batch cultivations. Transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in xenobiotic transporter activity were significantly enriched among the up-regulated genes upon inhibitors treatment. Furthermore, inhibitors treatment significantly decreased both catabolic and anabolic reduction charges, indicating that HMF and furfural are draining the cells of reductive power during growth. In addition, HMF and furfural caused a reduction in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in treated cells, suggesting that the energy metabolism was affected. The results from the present study provide valuable insights into how S. cerevisiae deals with stress imposed by HMF and furfural, which potentially can result in development of strategies to improve stress tolerance during fermentation of wood hydrolysate...|$|R

In the present study, a metabolic flux model was constructed for two recombinant S. cerevisiae strains: TMB 3001 and CPB. CR 4 which in addition to xylose metabolism have a modulated redox metabolism, i. e. ammonia assimilation was shifted from being NADPH to NADH dependent by deletion of gdh 1 and over-expression of GDH 2. The intracellular fluxes were estimated for both strains in anaerobic <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivations</b> when the growth limiting feed consisted of glucose (2. 5 g L- 1) and xylose (13 g L- 1). The metabolic network analysis with 13 C labelled glucose showed that there was a shift in the specific xylose reductase activity towards use of NADH as co-factor rather than NADPH. This shift is beneficial for solving the redox imbalance and it can therefore partly explain the 25 % increase in the ethanol yield observed for CPB. CR 4. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that the glyoxylate cycle was activated in CPB. CR 4. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{release of}} {{inhibitory}} concentrations of acetic acid from lignocellulosic raw materials during hydrolysis {{is one of}} the main concerns for 2 nd generation ethanol production. The undissociated form of acetic acid can enter the cell by diffusion through the plasma membrane and trigger several toxic effects, such as uncoupling and lowered intracellular pH. The effect of acetic acid on the ethanol production was investigated in <b>continuous</b> <b>cultivations</b> by adding medium containing 2. 5 to 20. 0 g·L− 1 acetic acid at pH 5. 0, at a dilution rate of 0. 5 h− 1. The cultivations were performed at both high (~ 25 g·L− 1) and very high (100 – 200 g·L− 1) yeast concentration by retaining the yeast cells inside the reactor by a cross-flow membrane in a membrane bioreactor. The yeast was able to steadily produce ethanol from 25 g·L− 1 sucrose, at volumetric rates of 5 – 6 g·L− 1 ·h− 1 at acetic acid concentrations up to 15. 0 g·L− 1. However, the yeast continued to produce ethanol also at a concentration of 20 g·L− 1 acetic acid but at a declining rate. The study thereby demonstrates the great potential of the membrane bioreactor for improving the robustness of the ethanol production based on lignocellulosic raw materials...|$|R
