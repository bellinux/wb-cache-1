25|$|In 1800 Sir Humphry Davy {{discovered}} the short pulsed electric arcs. Independently a Russian physicist Vasily Petrov {{discovered the}} continuous electric arc in 1802 and subsequently proposed its possible practical applications, including welding. Arc welding was first developed when Nikolai Benardos presented arc welding of metals using a carbon electrode at the International Exposition of Electricity, Paris in 1881, which was patented together with Stanisław Olszewski in 1887. In the same year, French electrical inventor Auguste de Méritens also invented a carbon arc welding method, patented in 1881, which was successfully used for welding {{lead in the}} manufacture of lead-acid batteries. The advances in arc welding continued with the invention of metal electrodes in the late 19th century by a Russian, Nikolai Slavyanov (1888), and an American, C. L. Coffin. Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger released in Britain a <b>coated</b> <b>metal</b> electrode which gave a more stable arc. In 1905 Russian scientist Vladimir Mitkevich proposed the usage of three-phase electric arc for welding. In 1919, alternating current welding was invented by C.J. Holslag but did not become popular for another decade.|$|E

500|$|In 1800, Sir Humphry Davy {{discovered}} the [...] "short-pulse" [...] electrical arc and presented his results in 1801. In 1802, Russian scientist Vasily Petrov created the continuous electric arc, and subsequently published [...] "News of Galvanic-Voltaic Experiments" [...] in 1803, {{in which he}} described experiments carried out in 1802. Of great importance in this work was the description of a stable arc discharge and the indication of its possible use for many applications, one being melting metals. In 1808, Davy, who was unaware of Petrov's work, re{{discovered the}} continuous electric arc. In 1881–82 inventors Nikolai Benardos (Russian) and Stanisław Olszewski (Polish) created the first electric arc welding method known as carbon arc welding using carbon electrodes.

40|$|In daily life, metals {{are used}} in {{everywhere}} {{and they are the}} main parts of technical and mechanical devices. They should be strength enough to endure the conditions in the environment such as pressure, forces, temperature and the hardest one corrosion. Metals have some processes to increase their endurance through such difficulties. One of the easiest ways to increase the <b>metal’s</b> endurance is <b>coating.</b> This method is used in almost all areas such as engineering, ships and electrical devices and even in mechanic industry for protection and endurance. One of the most important areas of <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> is to inhibit corrosion in metal surface. Metals react with oxygen in daily life. To prevent these oxidation reactions <b>metal</b> <b>coating</b> is used. Zinc, chrome, platinium, etc. Are commonly used in <b>coating</b> <b>metals</b> due to their low oxidation potential they have. In this study, the research was chosen to be “Would endurance for corrosion of different <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> in salt solution be different?” Zinc, chrome, iron, copper and nickel <b>coated</b> <b>metals,</b> made by same factory and by the same process, was used in the study. Salt solutions prepared and <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> were sink into these solutions to observe the corrosion or changes. Some changes such as colour change on the metal surfaces and salt solutions were observed {{at the end of the}} experiment. All changes were noted in 5 day interval and after a 30 day period, the metals were compared with each other respect to these changes. It is realised that the best metal which has best endurance to corrosion is chrome. Because, after the 30 day period there is no evidence which shows chrome corrodes. The endurance of metals to corrosion goes from most endurance to less one as copper, nickel, iron, zinc...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Literature {{consists}} a lot {{of information}} concerning the issues of the fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastics. However few studies explicitly explain, what mechanisms decide on the increased fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastics. Therefore an expression is a purpose of the work on what a way increasing this fatigue endurance permanence is taking a place. Design/methodology/approach: In hereby article they discussed issues concerning the fatigue endurance of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastic. Authors are putting the thesis on the basis of an analysis of literature and own examinations, that <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with material are characterized by an increased fatigue endurance. Findings: On the basis of results conclusions concerning raising the fatigue endurance permanence of some <b>coated</b> <b>metals</b> were deduced from an experiment with material. Research limitations/implications: Examinations were concentrated only on determining the influence of the electrode potential and power of adhesion on metal samples (steel 20 and 45) covered with different coatings.

Practical implications: Get results of research are broadening their knowledge of the scope of changes of the fatigue strength of <b>metals</b> <b>coated</b> with plastic.
