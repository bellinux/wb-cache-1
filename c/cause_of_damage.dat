The major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of Samar and Leyte, with a {{particular}} focus on Tacloban, because of its location between Samar and Leyte, and the large population in low lying areas. Philippine Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Mar Roxas said the scale of the relief operation that was now required was overwhelming, with some places described as a wasteland of mud and debris.|$|E
25|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum serves many general functions, including the folding of protein molecules in sacs called cisternae and {{the transport of}} synthesized proteins in vesicles to the Golgi apparatus. Correct folding of newly made proteins is made possible by several {{endoplasmic reticulum}} chaperone proteins, including protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp29, the Hsp70 family member BiP/Grp78, calnexin, calreticulin, and the peptidylpropyl isomerase family. Only properly folded proteins are transported from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus – unfolded proteins cause an unfolded protein response as a stress response in the ER. Disturbances in redox regulation, calcium regulation, glucose deprivation, and viral infection or the over-expression of proteins can lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress response (ER stress), a state in which the folding of proteins slows, leading {{to an increase in}} unfolded proteins. This stress is emerging as a potential <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> in hypoxia/ischemia, insulin resistance, and other disorders.|$|E

At Newport Beach, the Corps of Engineers were brought in to create a buffer with sand and rock to protect homes between 41st Street and 46th Street, and concern in West Newport Beach was that the hurricane would cause more damage to oceanfront homes that were weakened by swirling seas the previous week.

[...] The etiology of this disease is currently unknown, but hypotheses include infections, genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and neuropathy. [...] Among those who develop the disorder, unilateral paralysis of the facial muscles occurs {{in a day or}} two, but it is common for the patient to recover on their own over the span of a few weeks. [...] Even if the condition is resolved, the patient still stands a 20% chance of having lifelong weakness in their facial muscles, and 5% of these people will have permanent damage equivalent to a level of 4 or higher on the House-Brackmann scale.|$|E

50|$|The {{spectrum}} of core competence of phytomedicine is complemented by areas which concentrate on special classes of pathogens, e.g. agricultural entomology (concerned with animal pathogens, particularly insects and spiders and their adversaries, {{of which a}} number {{play a role in}} biological plant protection), agricultural mycology (fungal pathogens as a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> fungal disease), agricultural bacteriology (bacterial pathogens), agricultural virology (viruses as plant pathogens), nematology (threadworm pathogens) and malacology (snails and slugs). In addition there is agricultural herbologie (weeds in general as competitors of the crop). This aetiological, cause-oriented approach led on one hand to a marked increase in our knowledge of the many and various <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> plant <b>damage,</b> {{but on the other hand}} in some cases even the simplest factors affecting the <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> under production conditions remain unclear.
