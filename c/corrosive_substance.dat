5|$|Uranium hexfluoride is {{a highly}} <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance.</b> It is an oxidant and a Lewis acid which is able to bind to fluoride. It reacts with water to form a solid compound, and is very {{difficult}} to handle on an industrial scale.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to {{be overcome}} in the handling of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance).</b> William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
5|$|As Cochrane, Riker, and La Forge {{prepare to}} {{activate}} the warp drive on the Phoenix, Picard confronts the Borg Queen and discovers she has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him an array of new sensations. She has presented this modification {{as a gift to}} the android, hoping to obtain his encryption codes to the Enterprise computer. Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct sequence and fires torpedoes at the Phoenix, but they miss because Data has betrayed her. Data ruptures a coolant tank, and the <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance</b> fatally dissolves the Borg Queen's biological components.|$|E

25|$|Researchers {{are unable}} to predict who with {{heartburn}} will develop Barrett's esophagus. While no relationship exists between the severity of heartburn {{and the development of}} Barrett's esophagus, a relationship does exist between chronic heartburn and the development of Barrett's esophagus. Sometimes, people with Barrett's esophagus have no heartburn symptoms at all. In rare cases, damage to the esophagus may be caused by swallowing a <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance</b> such as lye.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, {{combustion}} converts {{less than}} half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. Some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance (giving off a soldier position, generating fog that hinders vision, etc.). Some of it ends up as a thick layer of soot inside the barrel, where it also is a nuisance for subsequent shots, and a cause of jamming an automatic weapon. Moreover this residue is hygroscopic, and with the addition of moisture absorbed from the air forms a <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance.</b> The soot contains potassium oxide or sodium oxide that turns into potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide, which corrodes wrought iron or steel gun barrels. Black powder arms must therefore be well cleaned after use, both inside and out, to remove the residue.|$|E
50|$|Tantalum {{has four}} main types of applications. Tantalum is added into objects exposed to high temperatures, in {{electronic}} devices, in surgical implants, and for handling <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{countries}} with large and prosperous pastel industries {{tried to block}} the use of indigo. The German government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577, describing it as a [...] "pernicious, deceitful and <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance,</b> the Devil's dye." [...] In France, Henry IV, in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of [...] "the false and pernicious Indian drug". It was forbidden in England until 1611, when British traders established their own indigo industry in India and began to import it into Europe.|$|E

40|$|Inadvertantly or purposely, an oral {{intake of}} <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> may cause {{life-threatening}} problems. Early {{admission to the}} hospital, clinical and endoscopic evaluation, and early surgery when required, may reduce morbidity and mortality. We report {{the case of a}} 49 -year-old male patient, who had attempted suicide, by drinking about 800 mL of 25 % hydrochloric acid, and who had severe intra-abdominal damage.

50|$|In 2016, the Metropolitan Police in London {{recorded}} 454 attacks involving corrosive fluids in the city, with 261 in {{the previous}} year, indicating a rise of 74%. A rise of 30% was also recorded in the UK as a whole. Between 2005/6 and 2011/12 the number of assaults involving acid throwing and other <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> tripled in England, official records show. NHS hospital figures record 144 assaults in 2011/12 involving <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances,</b> which can include petrol, bleach and kerosene. Six years earlier, 56 such episodes were noted. One British expert says she believes many of the cases involving acid are linked to communities of immigrants from Asia, with women attacked by their husbands or punished for refusing forced marriages.|$|R
40|$|Esophageal {{dilation}} is a non-surgical {{management for}} anatomic and functional abnormalities causing both benign and Malignant esophageal stricture. The basic goals of stricture dilation include safe and efficacious lumenal enlargement plus prevention of restenosis. These {{could be achieved}} using through- the-scope (TTS) balloon dilations, ranged in diameter of 4 to 40 mm, they will allow dilation of previously inaccessible strictures in the esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon. There are 5, 000 â€“ 15, 000 cases of stricture due to ingestion of <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> in United States every year. The following case would demonstrate a 28 -year-old male with depressive disorder who attempted a suicide by ingesting <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> two months before admission. Subsequently he started having difficulty in swallowing even soft foods. The complaint was gradually increasing until a month before admission he went through endoscopic examination and a corrosive esophageal stricture found. Hence after, he underwent dilation using Savary bouginage with fluoroscopy and through-the-scope (TTS) balloon dilations. The patient underwent a series of dilation treatment and demonstrated vigorous improvement. Problems raised as the patient was complicated with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation due to traumatic injury after ingesting <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances.</b> The consideration in management of esophageal stricture with complications will be discussed further in this article...|$|R

50|$|Caustic {{ingestion}} {{occurs when}} someone accidentally or deliberately ingests a caustic or <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance.</b> Depending {{on the nature}} of the substance, the duration of exposure and other factors it can lead to varying degrees of damage to the oral mucosa, the oesophagus, and the lining of the stomach.|$|E
5000|$|Lavage is {{contraindicated}} {{when patients}} have a compromised, unprotected airway and in patients {{at risk of}} gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation.

50|$|A low {{concentration}} of a <b>corrosive</b> <b>substance</b> is usually an irritant. Corrosion of non-living surfaces such as metals {{is a distinct}} process.

40|$|Background: Ingestion of <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> can be {{associated}} with severe damage to the esophagus, resulting in strictures.

40|$|Ingestion of <b>corrosive</b> <b>substances</b> {{may cause}} severe to serious {{injuries}} {{of the upper}} gastrointestinal tract and the poisoning can even result in death. Acute corrosive intoxications pose {{a major problem in}} clinical toxicology since the most commonly affected population are the young with psychic disorders, suicidal intent and alcohol addiction. The golden standard for determination of the grade and extent of the lesion is esophagogastro-duodenoscopy performed in the first 12 - 24 hours following corrosive ingestion. The most common late complications are esophageal stenosis, gastric stenosis of the antrum and pyloris, and rarely carcinoma of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Treatment of the acute corrosive intoxications include: neutralization of corrosive agents, antibiotics, anti-secretory therapy, nutritional support, collagen synthesis inhibitors, esophageal dilation and stent placement, and surgery.
