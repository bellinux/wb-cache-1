Verbs like this persist in modern English; for example sing, sang, sung is a strong verb, as are swim, swam, swum and <b>choose,</b> <b>chose,</b> <b>chosen.</b> The root portion of the word changes rather than its ending. In Old English, there were seven major classes of strong verb; each class has its own pattern of stem changes.
