5|$|Legislation {{was passed}} in 1988 that removed the need for {{veterans}} to prove a <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between certain forms of cancer and radiation exposure due to nuclear tests. Incidence of the main expected causes of this increased mortality, leukemia and other cancers, was not significantly higher than normal. Death by those diseases was tabulated {{on the assumption that}} if radiation exposure had a life-shortening effect it would likely show up there, but it did not. Not enough data were gathered on other causes of death to determine the reason for this increase in all-cause mortality, and it remains a mystery. The mortality increase was higher, 5.7%, for those who boarded target ships after the tests than for those who did not, whose mortality increase was only 4.3%.|$|E

As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843–1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one animal to another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy animal to become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2007, the National Institutes of Health deemed hexavalent chromium VI (chromium-6) to be a likely carcinogen in lab animals when consumed in large quantities in drinking water. Prior to the NIH study, a World Health Organization study found that chromium-6 was a likely cause of lung cancer when inhaled by humans. In 2010, test results released from a California non-profit group known as the Environmental Working Group showed that Norman's tap water has a chromium-6 concentration level of 12.90 parts per billion (ppb), which was the highest level detected among 35 U.S. cities sampled in the study. The group is studying chromium-6 levels in water supplies in an attempt to prove a <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between the element's ingestion and cancer in humans, and as a result improve the country's water standards.|$|E
5|$|Some anti-abortion {{activists have}} {{continued}} to advance a discredited <b>causal</b> <b>link</b> between abortion and breast cancer. In the United States, they have advanced state legislation that in several states requires health care providers to present abortion {{as a cause of}} breast cancer when counseling women who are seeking abortion. This political intervention culminated when the George W. Bush administration altered the National Cancer Institute website to suggest that abortion might cause breast cancer. In response to public concern over this intervention, the NCI convened a 2003 workshop bringing together over 100 experts on the issue. This workshop concluded that while some studies reported a statistical correlation between breast cancer and abortion, the strongest scientific evidence from large prospective cohort studies demonstrates that abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk, and that the positive findings were likely due to response bias.|$|E

40|$|An {{outstanding}} puzzle in the causal-based categorization {{literature is}} why an important phenomenon—the causal status effect—can vary in size by an order or magnitude across studies. Two hypotheses were tested. Studies showing a large causal status effect provided participants with probabilistic interfeature <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> and presented {{a small number}} of similar item on the subsequent classification test (e. g., Ahn et al., 2000). Studies with more deterministic <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> and a longer classification test showed a small causal status effect (e. g., Rehder, 2003 b; Rehder & Kim, 2006) An experiment manipulating these two factors confirmed that the causal status effect was larger with probabilistic <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> and few test items and smaller (indeed, absent) with deterministic links or more test items. Evidence was also found for coherence effects, extending the range of materials and procedure in which such effects have been found. These results are consistent with a generative model of classification and inconsistent with an alternative dependency model...|$|R

Using a four-quadrant behavior taxonomy, this study investigates different types of dysfunctional information system behaviors to determine if, among them, there are any differences in behavioral intentions and in the <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> between these intentions and their predictor variables.

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{relationship between}} money and output {{is one of}} the most studied issues in macroeconomics and a large literature have examined the <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> between monetary variables and output. One puzzle from this literature is that the results of causality tests appear to be sensitive with respect to the sample period that one considers. As a way of overcoming this problem, we propose a new method for analyzing <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> that allows for changes in these links over the sample period. Our method is based on a VAR model with time-varying parameters. We model the time-variation in the parameters as reflecting changes in causality, and assume that these changes are stochastic and governed by an unobservable finite Markov chain. One important advantage of our method relative to alternative methods is that it allows for arbitrarily many changes in <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> during the sample and enables the identification of sample points at which causality has changed. When applied to U. S. data, we obtain results that allow us to reconcile previous puzzling differences in the outcome of standard Granger causality tests...|$|R
40|$|Power modulations of {{oscillations}} in electro- and magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signals {{have been}} linked {{to a wide range of}} brain functions.

Here, we propose to identify causal relationships by the statistical concept of Granger causality, and we investigate which methods are bests suited to reveal Granger <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> between the power of brain oscillations and experimental variables. As an alternative to testing such <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> on the sensor level, we propose to linearly combine the information contained in each sensor in order to create virtual channels, corresponding to estimates of underlying brain oscillations, the Granger-causal relations of which may be assessed. Such linear combinations of sensor can be given by source separation methods such as, for example, Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or by the recently developed Source Power Correlation (SPoC) method.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{unidirectional}} <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> between two series in a multivariate autoregressive stationary framework. We {{emphasize that the}} usual characterization of the unidirectional Granger causality, {{which is based on}} the prediction improvement oneperiod ahead, is not sufficient to capture all direct and indirect <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> between two series, once there exists a third serie in the system. As a consequence, following Lütkepohl [1990], we consider the prediction improvement for every prediction horizon. But contrary to this author, we do not choose to analyse the unidirectional <b>causal</b> <b>links</b> according to the Sim's approach [1980], which is based on the study of impulse coefficients. Indeed, we prove a theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition to exclude any prediction improvement for every prediction horizon. According to this theorem, both characterizations of unidirectional causality appear to be complementary, because the necessary and sufficient condition is expressed as a constraint on the canonical autoregressive coefficients and the impulse coefficients respectively associated with the causal serie and the caused serie. ...|$|R
