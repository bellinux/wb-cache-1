50|$|An Organic field-effect {{transistor}} is a {{field-effect transistor}} utilizing organic molecules or polymers as the active semiconducting layer. A field-effect transistor (FET) is any semiconductor material that utilizes electric field {{to control the}} shape of a channel of one type of charge carrier, thereby changing its conductivity. Two major classes of FET are n-type and p-type semiconductor, classified according to the <b>charge</b> <b>type</b> carried. In the case of organic FETs (OFETs), p-type OFET compounds are generally more stable than n-type due to the susceptibility of the latter to oxidative damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{conformational}} {{behavior of}} both uncharged and charged hyperbranched polymers (HBPs) in dilute solutions {{has been studied}} using Brownian dynamics simulations. A distinction has been made between two types of architectures: type 1, which is characterized by its degree of polymerization (N) and its number of generations (gmax), and type 2, which is characterized by its degree of polymerization (N) and its degree of branching (DB). The radius of gyration (Rg) of both uncharged and <b>charged</b> <b>type</b> 1 HBPs is strongly influenced by variation of g. For uncharged type 2 HBPs Rg is relatively insensitive to variation of DB, whereas for <b>charged</b> <b>type</b> 2 HBPs Rg is a decreasing function of DB. The values of the radii of gyration as determined in the simulations are well reproduced in mean-field calculations. Scaling of Rg with the Wiener index and N has been investigated and compared to data from literature. The radial mass distribution of a <b>charged</b> <b>type</b> 1 HBP exhibits an ordering of the monomers that is highly dependent on g; the radial mass distribution of a <b>charged</b> <b>type</b> 2 HBPs shows an ordering that is only weakly dependent on DB. These orderings manifest themselves via oscillations of the static structure factor...|$|R

This study determined polyacrylamide <b>charge</b> <b>type</b> or charge density influences on furrow erosion. The study area was located near IGmberly, Idaho; soil was Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, mesic, Durixerollic Calciorthid); and slope was 1. 5 %. Polyacrylamides with contrasting <b>charge</b> <b>type</b> (neutral, anionic, cationic) and charge density (0, 8 - 10, 19 - 20, 30 - 35 %) were employed in the treatments.

Investigations including both spin-independent and spindependent dynamics reveal that there is no spin-flip process involved in charge relaxation.
