5|$|There is much {{interest}} in the <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> of neptunium, because its five oxidation states all exhibit their own distinctive chemical behavior, and the <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> of the actinides is heavily influenced by the actinide contraction (the greater-than-expected decrease in ionic radii across the actinide series, analogous to the lanthanide contraction).|$|E
5|$|The <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> of neptunium(V) {{has been}} {{extensively}} researched due {{to the presence of}} cation–cation interactions in the solid state, which had been already known for actinyl ions.

5|$|Complexes of vanadium(II) and (III) are {{relatively}} exchange inert and reducing. Those of V(IV) and V(V) are oxidants. Vanadium ion is rather large and some complexes achieve coordination numbers greater than 6, {{as is the}} case in 4−. Oxovanadium(V) also forms 7 coordinate coordination complexes with tetradentate ligands and peroxides and these complexes are used for oxidative brominations and thioether oxidations. The <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> of V4+ is dominated by the vanadyl center, VO2+, which binds four other ligands strongly and one weakly (the one trans to the vanadyl center). An example is vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(O)(O2C5H7)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small. Many 5-coordinate vanadyl complexes have a trigonal bypyramidal geometry, such as VOCl2(NMe3)2. The <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> of V5+ is dominated by the relatively stable dioxovanadium coordination complexes which are often formed by aerial oxidation of the vanadium(IV) precursors indicating the stability of the +5 oxidation state and ease of interconversion between the +4 and +5 states.|$|E

The rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy (e. g., wind and solar) demands low-cost and large-scale energy storage systems for smooth and reliable power output, where redox-flow batteries (RFBs) could find their niche. In this work, we introduce the first all-soluble all-iron RFB based on iron as the same redox-active element but with different <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistries</b> in alkaline aqueous system. The adoption of the same redox-active element largely alleviates the challenging problem of cross-contamination of metal ions in RFBs that use two redox-active elements. An all-soluble all-iron RFB is constructed by combining an iron triethanolamine redox pair (i. e., [Fe(TEOA) OH](-) /[Fe(TEOA) (OH) ](2 -)) and an iron cyanide redox pair (i. e., Fe(CN) (6) (3 -) /Fe(CN) (6) (4 -)), creating 1. 34 V of formal cell voltage. Good performance and stability have been demonstrated, after addressing some challenges, including the crossover of the ligand agent. As exemplified by the all-soluble all-iron flow battery, combining redox pairs of the same redox-active element with different <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistries</b> could extend the spectrum of RFBs.

5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} oxidising agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong oxidising agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common oxidising agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry</b> in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|The coinage metals were {{traditionally}} {{regarded as}} a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p6s1; group 11: d10s1). However, the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties. This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals. Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia, as well as having more covalent character in their compounds. Finally, the alkali metals {{are at the top}} of the electrochemical series, whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom. The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer <b>coordination</b> <b>chemistry,</b> thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character. Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au−) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury.|$|E

40|$|Oligogalacturonate lyases (OGLs; {{now also}} {{classified}} as pectate lyase family 22) are cytoplasmic enzymes found in pectinolytic members of Enterobacteriaceae, {{such as the}} enteropathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. OGLs utilize a β-elimination mechanism to preferentially catalyze the conversion of saturated and unsaturated digalacturonate into monogalacturonate and the 4, 5 -unsaturated monogalacturonate-like molecule, 5 -keto- 4 -deoxyuronate. To provide mechanistic insights into the specificity of this enzyme activity, we have characterized the OGL from Y. enterocolitica, YeOGL, on oligogalacturonides and determined its three-dimensional x-ray structure to 1. 65 Å. The model contains a Mn 2 + atom in the active site, which is coordinated by three histidines, one glutamine, and an acetate ion. The acetate mimics the binding of the uronate group of galactourono-configured substrates. These findings, in combination with enzyme kinetics and metal supplementation assays, {{provide a framework for}} modeling the active site architecture of OGL. This enzyme appears to contain a histidine for the abstraction of the α-proton in the − 1 subsite, a residue that is highly conserved throughout the OGL family and represents a unique catalytic base among pectic active lyases.

With long reaction times, the framework compound [Al(μ-OH) {AlPTC(μ-OH) (H 2 O) } 2]· 2 H 2 O (CAU- 16, compound 1) is obtained, the first example of a framework compound with a metal–organic cluster linker, and bearing the MIL- 53 network. Although the compound does not breathe, as other MIL- 53 compounds do, it has a maximum uptake of CO 2 of 1. 76 (2) mmol g– 1 at 196 K. With shorter reaction times, the molecular compound {Al(HPTC) (μ-OH) (H 2 O) } 2 (2) was prepared, leading to the proposal of a crystallization scheme for the Al 3 +-pyridine- 2, 4, 6,-tricarboxylic acid system. To determine whether further framework compounds bearing hybrid metal cluster linkers could be prepared, systematic high-throughput investigations of pyridine- 2, 4, 6 -tricarboxylic acid in water with Ga 3 + and In 3 + were undertaken.

However, in metallic thorium, the 5f16d17s2 configuration is a low-lying excited state and hence the 5f orbitals contribute, existing in a rather broad energy band.
