These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to <b>cows</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The hair is generally shorter on the body, but on the neck and head {{there is often a}} [...] "mane" [...] of curlier, wooly hair. Bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller, but because of the additional muscle and bone mass they often weigh far more.|$|E

40|$|Some {{production}} parameters of seropositive cows (age, first calving age, 305 day mature equivalent last milk yield production, lifetime mature equivalent milk yield production, lifetime total milk production, lifetime total milking period, lifetime monthly milk production, lifetime daily milk production, lifetime total days of milking, number of inseminations per pregnancy (for last pregnancy), {{number of calves}} and calving interval (for last pregnancy)) were analysed in the current study. The study population was clinically healthy Holstein cows from a commercial dairy herd in southern Turkey. Of 109 animals, 65 cows were seropositive by ELISA and the prevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection was 59. 6 %. The prevalence of seropositive cows in 2 nd (62. 8 %), 3 rd (64. 7 %), 4 th (61. 5 %), and 5 th (66. 6 %) lactations was slightly {{higher than that of}} cows in 1 st (52. 6 %) lactations.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} at the Asella Station in the Arsi Region of Ethiopia to investigate the dairy performance of purebred indigenous Arsi and Friesian x Arsi crosses under different pre- and post-partum supplementary feeding regimes. Lactational performance of both genotypes was not affected by prepartum supplementation. Postpartum supplementation significantly affected milk yield and butterfat percent of Arsi crosses. Arsi crosses produced more milk over a longer lactation period, but with a less proportion of butterfat in milk than purebred Arsi. Purebred Arsi showed considerably more variation in milk yield, lactation length and butterfat percent than Arsi crosses. First-crosses produced slightly more milk over a shorter lactation period and proportionally more butterfat in milk than backcrosses. It was observed {{that there is little}} benefit from pre-partum supplementation in terms of milk production. However, the conventional wisdom that prepartum supplementation might be beneficial for the viability of calves and <b>for</b> <b>cow</b> <b>reproduction</b> should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|In this bachelor's thesis with name Evaluation idicators {{reproduction}} in the breedeing of high-yield dairy cows, I {{deal with}} issues of reproduction in these cows. Good to know and evaluate reproduction indicators {{is the foundation of}} a good level of breeding. I deal with this one in first part, this are described biological and physiological patterns of reproductive cycle. In second part are described possible methods of detecting estrus. Timely retrieval and correct determination of the optimal time of estrus {{plays a major role in}} the success of conception. Also here I discuss how the <b>cows</b> are suitable <b>for</b> <b>reproduction,</b> methods and techniques of insemination. Much depends on the timely implementation of insemination that subsequently became pregnant cows. In third part are described the period from conception through birth until postnatal period. Their findings, control and treatment. Mastering of these will affect the lactation period and restoration of full-fledged ovarian cycle and expression of oestrus. In fourth part, I deal with influences affecting the level of reproduction, their causes, consequences and prevention. Among the most important influences include stabling technologies, thermal stress, nutrition and condition of the animal. In the last fifth section outlines the most widely used biotechnological methods in breeding cattle...|$|R
40|$|Infertility {{is a term}} which {{includes}} all reasons <b>for</b> <b>cows</b> not conceiving after breeding. Infertility results in either culling of the cow or increased calving interval which reduces overall production efficiency. Repeat breedings or anestrus {{are the most common}} signs ofinfertility. Causes of repeat breedings may include bull infertility, improper semen handling, poor estrus detection, a nutritional imbalance, incorrect timing of insemination, or a decreased fertility level in the cow. Nutritional imbalances are just one cause of infertility in dairy cattle, however, often more than one nutrient may be involved or other nonnutritional factors are partially to blame. These facts make it difficult to evaluate the effect of a single nutrient on infertility. Research previously indicated that nutrient requirements for high milk production was greater than that required <b>for</b> <b>reproduction,</b> (therefore <b>cows</b> fed <b>for</b> high milk production would receive adequate nutrients <b>for</b> <b>reproduction).</b> More recent research indicates slight deficiencies or imbalances of either major or minor nutrients may decrease fertility in apparently normal, cycling dairy cows. This paper will summarize the information available in the current literature about nutritional factors involved with infertility in dairy cows...|$|R
