Materials and methods: After extraction, the absorbance values were measured at 527 and 632 nm for <b>Carmoisine</b> and Brilliant blue FCF, respectively. The effects of different parameters such as, polyethylene glycol (type and amount), pH, salt (type and amount), and temperature were investigated and optimum conditions were established. Results: Linear calibration curves were obtained {{in the range of}} 0. 1 - 120 ng mL- 1 and 0. 2 - 260 ng mL- 1 for <b>Carmoisine</b> and Brilliant blue FCF, respectively. Under optimum conditions, detection limit based on three times the standard deviation of the blank (3 Sb) was 0. 014 ng mL- 1 for <b>Carmoisine</b> and 0. 017 ng mL- 1 for Brilliant blue FCF. At concentration level of 30 ng mL- 1, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was 3. 17 % and 1. 87 % for <b>Carmoisine</b> and Brilliant blue FCF, respectively.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of the food additive <b>carmoisine</b> with herring testes DNA was studied by multifaceted biophysical techniques. <b>Carmoisine</b> exhibited hypochromic effects in absorbance, whereas in fluorescence the intensity enhanced upon complexation with DNA. Energy transfer from the DNA base pairs to <b>carmoisine</b> molecules occurred upon complexation. A groove binding model of interaction was envisaged for carmoisine−DNA complexation from 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) and Hoechst displacement studies. The binding of <b>carmoisine</b> stabilized the DNA structure against thermal denaturation. The binding induced moderate conformational perturbations in the B-form structure of DNA. The binding affinity (104 M− 1) values, calculated from absorbance and fluorescence data, and calorimetry titrations were {{in close agreement with}} each other. The binding was characterized to be exothermic and favored by small negative enthalpic and large positive entropic contributions.

The extracts were filtered and passed through a column of Amberlite XAD- 7 resins after adjusting the pH to 2. 5. The adsorbed colour compounds were extracted from the resins by eluting the column with acidified alcohol.

40|$|Our histochemical and ultrastructural {{studies have}} identified, in human {{catecholamine}} locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, abundant and large spherical protein bodies (PB), containing histone-like, arginine-rich proteins, which originate as dense bodies in mitochondria. This species-specific phenotype in the neurons of man is highly intriguing. In the electron microscope PB are disrupted in LC neurons in depressed individuals, where noradrenaline {{is known to}} be reduced. This coincidence of ultrastructure and neurochemistry raises the question whether these bodies Could qualify as noradrenaline-storing organelles in the human LC. Our rationale was to examine, in known model tissues that contain catecholamines-sympathetic ganglia and tumors of the autonomic nervous system-if vesicles show the same fine structure and histochemistry as the PB of the human LC. Hence, we selected biopsy tissues of five ganglioneuromas and postmortem tissues of LC from 25 control subjects. Since dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) is a hallmark of noradrenaline identity and present in dense core vesicles, the investigation of DBH localization with the immunogold method constituted the experiment of choice for this study. Histochemical determinations of arginine with <b>Carmoisine</b> L, and of lipids with Rhodamine B complemented the study of similarities between the PB of the human LC and ganglioneuromas. Our results showed, with the colloidal gold method, that DBH immunogold labeling was localized in the core and in the double membranes of the PB, and also in the adjacent mitochondria.

40|$|In this study, 120 {{lactic acid}} {{bacterial}} strains from different fermented dairy products {{as well as}} 10 bacterial intestinal isolates were evaluated for in vitro and in vivo degradation of various food azo dyes. Of these isolates, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains 13 and 100 and the intestinal isolates Ent 2 and Eco 5 exhibited 96 – 98 % degradation of the tested food azo dyes within 5 – 6  hours. High performance liquid chromatography mass spectra of sunset yellow (E 110) and <b>carmoisine</b> (E 122) anaerobic degradation products by the intestinal isolates showed that they were structurally related to toxic aromatic amines. For an in vivo study, eight groups of rats were treated for 90  days with either the food azo dyes or their degradation products. All groups were kept for a further 30  days as recovery period and then dissected at 120  days. Hematological, histopathological, and protein markers were assessed. Rats treated with either E 110 /E 122 or their degradation products exhibited highly significant changes in red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, and white blood cell count. In addition, alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, amylase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, total protein, and globulins were significantly increased. Furthermore, marked histopathological alterations in the liver, kidney, spleen, and small intestine were observed. Significant decreases in inflammation and a noticeable improvement in the liver, kidney, spleen, and small intestine of rats treated with LAB and food azo dyes simultaneously were observed. Finally, these results provide a reliable basis for not only {{a better understanding of}} the histological and biochemical effects of food additives, but also for early diagnostics. In addition, LAB strains 13 and 100 may play an important role as potential probiotics in food and dairy technology as a probiotic lactic acid starter...|$|E
40|$|This {{guideline}} {{provides information}} on alternative colouring options for the reformulation of food and beverages, which currently contain {{one or more of}} the Southampton six colours (sunset yellow FCF (E 110), quinoline yellow (E 104), <b>carmoisine</b> (E 122), allura red (E 129), tartrazine (E 102), ponceau 4 R (E 124)). There is a selection of naturally derived colours and colouring foodstuffs available to manufacturers, which produce colours in the same red, orange and yellow range as the Southampton six colours. Unfortunately, colours derived from natural sources are less stable than the synthetic colours they are replacing and therefore an understanding of the properties and the stabilities of these colours is crucial for successful replacement. The guide gives an overview of the different colour options available and the different factors that should be considered when approaching colour reformulation in a food or beverage product. In some applications particularly those with a long shelf life which are heated and/or exposed to light and oxygen, it is more difficult to achieve the right colour, particularly if an exact match for an existing colour is needed. Some examples of colours used to replace some of the Southampton six colours in confectionery, beverages and processed meat and fish products are included within the review. Much help is available from food colour suppliers who are able to assist by not only offering samples of suitable colours but also technical advice as to which colours would be most suitable for a particular food application produced under particular manufacturing and packaging conditions with the required stability for the shelf life. It is recommended that food manufacturers work closely with colour suppliers, in order to get the optimum replacement colour for their product. page 1 1 Content...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} prolactin-producing tumours in human pituitary glands, 45 chromophobe adenomas, obtained from unselected necropsies, have been studied by various staining procedures including the immunoperoxidase technique for the demonstration of prolactin. The presence of immunoreactive prolactin was revealed in the cytoplasm of the tumour cells in six cases (13 %), indicating that the occurrence of prolactin-producing adenomas is not rare. No correlations were established between tumours and clinical history. Two adenomas were detected in female and four in male patients. The age of the patients at necropsy ranged from 28 to 75 years. Three adenomas were associated with disseminated carcinoma, two with fatal liver disease, and one with diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and pyelonephritis. Manifest endocrine symptoms were not disclosed, and endocrine investigations, including measurements of blood prolactin levels, were not undertaken. Thus, direct evidence is lacking {{as to whether or}} not these tumours were actively secreting prolactin. In the non-tumorous parts of the anterior lobes the number of prolactin cells was decreased in two cases, suggesting that prolactin released from the adenoma cells suppressed prolactin production in the non-tumorous pituitary. However, the number of prolactin cells of the non-tumorous adenohypophysis seemed to be unchanged in two and increased in another two cases. The present findings conclusively proved the existence of the prolactin-producing adenomas as a distinct entity. These tumours do not stain with acid or basic dyes, they are PAS or thionin negative, and do not contain immunoreactive growth hormone. Thus, by conventional staining procedures they are indistinguishable from other chromophobe adenoma types. Herlant's erythrosin and Brookes' <b>carmoisine</b> methods, claimed spedifically to stain prolactin cells, failed to provide reliable results, hence their use cannot be recommended in tumour identification. Immunoperoxidase staining of prolactin is the only technique which conclusively reveals the presence of immunoreactive prolactin in the cytoplasm of the tumour cells and permits diagnosis. It is proposed that this technique be introduced in pituitary morphological studies. Its application may lead to a better understanding of problems related to prolactin-producing tumours and their secretory activity...|$|E
30|$|According to {{the results}} {{presented}} in Table  2, the maximum and minimum removal efficiency of diazinon were 96 and 23 %, respectively. Results showed that the observed values of the removal efficiency of diazinon were {{in the range of}} 23 – 96 which was not different from the values predicted by the model (RSM). The findings of this study (using Eq.  2) showed that this treatment process was able to remove 96 % of diazinon from aquatic environments. This process underwent the main, interaction, and square effects. Each of these effects have coefficients with positive or negative signs that indicate positive or negative effects are on removal efficiency. The best model to fit the experimental data with independent variables was the quadratic model. ANOVA was used to determine the significance of the model (P values <  0.05). Overall, results showed that this process was significance (P values <  0.0001). Results presented in Table  3 showed that R 2, justified R 2, and adequacy precision were 0.931, 0.8665, and 14.842, respectively. Figure  3 indicated that with increasing the parameters from − 1 level (2.5  mg/L) to + 1 level (7.5  mg/L), the removal efficiency of diazinon reduced significantly. There is an inverse relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and its initial concentration, so that with increasing the diazinon concentration from − 1 level to + 1 level, its removal efficiency decreased 24.25 % while the reaction time, pH, and concentration of yeast were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). This is because with increasing the concentration of diazinon, adsorption sites on yeast walls are saturated and decrease the absorption capacity (Mahmoud 2016). Mahmoud (2016) confirmed that with the use of S. cerevisiae, the removal efficiency of reactive dye decreased with increasing the concentration of its pollutant (Mahmoud 2016). Studies show that numerous bacteria are involved in the degradation of diazinon (Kristina et al. 2008). The hydrolase enzyme in bacteria {{plays a major role in}} the biodegradation of diazinon. It can biodegrade alkyl and aryl bonds of P-O in organophosphates (Gunner and Zuckerman 1968; Kristina et al. 2008). Abasalt et al. (2014) showed that Pseudomonas plecoglossicida can use diazinon as a carbon and phosphorus source and biodegrade it. Mahiudddin et al. (2014) concluded that Pseudomonas peli, Burkholderia caryophylli and Brevundimonas diminuta can completely biodegrade diazinon in the concentration of 20  mg/L (Mahiudddin et al. 2014). According to Fig.  3, there is a direct relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and reaction time, so that with increasing the reaction time from − 1 level to + 1 level, removal efficiency increased 43.39 % while the initial concentrations of diazinon, pH, and the concentration of yeast were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). This positive effect (Eq.  2) has been shown by the coefficient of + 11.29 for parameter B. Mariusz et al. (2009) indicated that Serratia and Pseudomonas can successfully biodegrade diazinon (at the concentration of 50  mg/L for the period of 42  days) by 83 and 87 %, respectively (Mariusz 2009). Sadeghi et al. (2014) showed that S. cerevisiae can biodegrade <b>Carmoisine</b> and Reactive Black 5 Dyes within 24  h. Therefore, the maximum removal of <b>carmoisine</b> and Reactive Black 5 Dyes was 85 and 53 %, respectively (Sadeghi et al. 2014). Bumpus et al. (1993) reported the ability of Phanerochaete chrysosporium to degrade 27.5 % of chlorpyrifos during the 18 -day incubation (Bumpus et al. 1993). The results demonstrated a direct relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and the concentration of S. cerevisiae, so that the removal efficiency of diazinon (while the initial concentration of diazinon, pH, and reaction time were at the zero level) increased by 27.8 % over time from − 1 level to + 1 level (P value <  0.05). Zaharia et al. (2013) indicated that a 5 % concentration of S. cerevisiae can significantly biodegrade the DINOCAP and DNOC pesticides. The findings of this study (Fig.  3) suggest that there is an inverse relationship between the removal efficiency of diazinon and pH. Accordingly, with increasing the pH from − 1 level to + 1 level, the removal efficiency of diazinon decreases by 30 % while the reaction time, initial concentration of diazinon, and the concentration of S. cerevisiae were at the zero level (P value <  0.0001). pH is one of the important parameters influencing chemical reactions and biological aqueous solutions. It affects the surface charge of absorbents and the ionization degree of absorbate (Sadeghi et al. 2015). S. cerevisiae has carboxyl, phosphonate, and amine groups which include negative, negative, and positive charges, respectively. Amine groups are mainly found in proteins and bio-mass and are also more active than other groups in biosorption (Sadeghi et al. 2015). At a low pH, active sites (amino groups) of S. cerevisiae are protonated and the density of positive charge in the absorbent surface increases (Sadeghi et al. 2015). If the adsorption phenomenon is involved alone, a high adsorption must be observed in an alkaline pH, while a high adsorption must observed in an acidic pH (Konstantinos et al. 2012; Sadeghi et al. 2015). Kristina et al. (2008) showed that the removal efficiency of diazinon increases by microorganisms at a low pH (Kristina et al. 2008). Aksu (2003) demonstrated that the efficiency of S. cerevisiae in reactive dye removal increased significantly at a low pH.|$|E
30|$|The {{pollution}} {{of water resources}} by pesticides is considered an environmental concern. The use of pesticides in the agricultural sector has increased due to the population growth and increasing demand for agricultural products and foodstuffs (Khazaei et al. 2010; Arjmandi et al. 2010). Several applications of pesticides in agriculture can cause environmental issues such as contamination of water, soil, and the food. Pesticides include organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid, and the organophosphorus compounds are {{the largest and most}} diverse pesticides. Because of their effect {{on a wide range of}} pests and also their low cost, organophosphate pesticides are used by farmers more than other pesticides (Shayeghi et al. 2008). Different types of organophosphorus compounds inhibit the cholinesterase enzyme and therefore cause a range of toxic effects. These effects include headaches, vomiting, and respiratory tract problems. Depending on the chemical nature of organophosphorus compounds, inhibiting the cholinesterase may be reversible or irreversible (Hashemian et al. 2015). Diazinon is an organophosphate compound with the chemical formula of C 12 H 21 N 2 O 3 PS (Hunter et al. 1985; WHO 1998). According to the standard of the European Union, the maximum allowable concentration for the total pesticide residue and for each pesticide in drinking water sources is 0.5  μg/L and 0.0001  mg/L, respectively (Cai and Yun 2008). World Health Organization (WHO) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for the value of diazinon in drinking water are 0.1  μg/L and 9  ×  10 − 6  mg/L, respectively (Goodrich et al. 1989). The maximum allowable concentrations of diazinon in drinking water in Australia, Canada, Germany, England and America are 20, 10, 0, and 0.6  μg/L, respectively (Readman et al. 1992). Different methods such as filtration, ozonation, and adsorption using the granular activated carbon are used for the removal of pesticides from aqueous solutions, but these methods have been associated with problems such as high capital and operating costs, saturation of activated carbon, and production of toxic substances (Reynolds et al. 1989; Lai et al. 1995; Jiang and Adams 2006; Ormad et al. 2008). Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a single-cell and non-pathogenic yeast (Cabral et al. 2003; Teixeira et al. 2007). It is considered for the biological removal of diazinon due to advantages such as safety, low cost, simplicity, widespread distribution, rapid growth of cells, and easy cultivation. The main advantage of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is its selectivity in active transport and competitiveness in biological absorption (Goksungur et al. 2005; Peinado and Morenoa 2006; Yarke-Salkhori et al. 2011). Mutagenicity studies indicated that diazinon does not have negative effects on the metabolic system of S. cerevisiae (Mohn 1973; Fahrig 1974), and only at concentrations greater than 50, 000  ppm can it have negligible toxic effects on S. cerevisiae (Bianchi et al. 1994). Sadeghi et al. (2014) used S. cerevisiae for the biological removal of <b>carmoisine</b> and Reactive Black 5 dyes (Sadeghi et al. 2014). Fabrizio et al. (1983) demonstrated that this type of yeast can biologically remove the folpet and metalaxyl fungicides and the pyrethroid and deltametrin insecticides (Fabrizio et al. 1983). Also, Tijana and Rada (2015) reduced the chlorpyrifos-methyl pesticide with this method (Tijana and Rada 2015), and Cabras and Angioni (2000) and George et al. (2014) carried out a similar study (Cabras and Angioni 2000; George et al. 2014). The technique of experimental design is a useful tool that uses statistical models to optimize the interaction between different parameters. Using the response surface methodology (RSM), we can study the interaction between two or more parameters (Yi et al. 2012). The present study was conducted with the aim of optimizing diazinon biodegradation from aqueous solutions by Saccharomyces cerevisiae using RSM.|$|E
40|$|Anodic {{oxidation}} of {{a commercial}} dye, methylene blue (MB), from aqueous solutions using an electrochemical cell is reported. Data are provided {{on the effects of}} eight different types of supporting electrolytes, concentration of electrolytes, initial dye concentration, current and electrolytic time on the percentage removal of methylene blue. Anodic oxidation was found to be effective in achieving the removal of methylene blue from aqueous solutions. The optimised electrolytic conditions, for the removal of methylene blue (MB), were applied to the removal of azure A (AA), azure B (AB), azure C (AC), toluidine blue 0 (TBO), new methylene blue (NMB), dimethyl methylene blue (DMMB), thionine (TH), methylene green (MG), methyl violet (MV), Nile blue (NB), neutral red (NR), acridine orange (AO) and resorufin (RS) from aqueous solutions containing sodium chloride. Results indicated that between 84 to 100 % of each dye of phenothiazine was removed during 60 minutes of electrolysis. The percentage removals for the phenothiazine dyes followed the following decreasing order: (MG ≈ MV) > (DMMB ≈ AA) > (AB ≈ AC ≈ NMB) > TBO > TH. However, the azine, acridine and oxazine dyes showed between 98 to 99 % colour removal and the following decreasing order: NB ≈ NR > AO ≈ RS. Strongly electron withdrawing substituents such as nitro group or carbonyl group increases the degradation of the phenothiazine chromophore, whereas the electron donating groups such as amino and alkyl amino groups decrease the degradation. Anodic oxidation studies were extended to the destruction of eight permitted food colours, with azo and triarylmethane chromophore, from aqueous solution containing either sodium chloride or sodium sulphate as a supporting electrolyte. Again, sodium chloride was found to be the best supporting electrolyte and between 97 to 100 % colour removal was achieved after 60 minutes of electrolysis. The percentage removal for the single azo based colourants followed the following increasing order: <b>carmoisine</b> > sunset yellow FCF > amaranth > ponceau 411 > tartrazine. However, the binary and ternary mixtures of food colour showed the following increasing order: blue > green > yellow food colours. The extractions and applications of 54 different types of natural dyes (53 from plants and one from animal origin) are evaluated using simple techniques. The extracted natural dyes were applied in dyeing three types of textile fabrics viz: a) paj silk, b) brushed cotton twill and c) crystallized shimmering satin. The effects of two eco-friendly mordants (alum and iron) on the dyeing process were compared with the dyeing process without mordants. The colour fastness to wash and light (both natural and artificial sun light) of these natural dyes were also assessed. The results showed that out of the 54 dyestuffs studied, 32 plants are potentially able to produce marketable natural dyes. These dyes produced good colour and met minimal performance standards for colour fastness to light and washing. The addition of mordants generally increased the fastness properties. Silk gave the best performance of dyeing uptake and stability. Cotton gave the poorest fastness properties. The overall results showed that, considering molecular associations, the fastness properties were of the order: anthraquinones and tannins> indigoid > flavones> flavonols > flavanols> carotenoids> anthocyanins. Anodic oxidation studies were extended to the destruction of ten natural dyes from aqueous solutions containing either sodium chloride or sodium sulphate as a supporting electrolyte. Anodic oxidation was effective in achieving the removal of green tea (35 %), spinach (69 %), Langdale yellow and turmeric (95 %), carmine, saffron, henna (97 %), beetroot, karkade and sumac (98 %). However, TOC measurements and the UV analyses indicated that some organic intermediate compounds were formed in the presence of sodium chloride.
