Normally, the different dielectric materials {{will lead to the}} different losses and reflections for microwave frequencies. To evaluate the dielectric properties from the different materials plays an essential role in the microwave engineering. There are many approaches can be used to measure the dielectric materials, e. g. capacitor methods, transmission line <b>methods,</b> <b>cavity</b> resonator <b>methods,</b> open <b>cavity</b> <b>methods</b> and so on. The <b>cavity</b> resonator <b>method</b> {{is one of the most}} popular ways for measuring the dielectric materials.

50|$|In graph theory, a {{matching}} {{is a set}} of edges without common vertices. Liu et al. extended this definition to directed graph, where {{a matching}} {{is a set of}} directed edges that do not share start or end vertices. It is easy to check that a matching of a directed graph composes of a set of vertex-disjoint simple paths and cycles. The maximum matching of a directed network can be efficiently calculated by working in the bipartite representation using the classical Hopcroft-Karp algorithm, which runs in O(E√N) time in the worst case. For undirected graph, analytical solutions of the size and number of maximum matchings have been studied using the <b>cavity</b> <b>method</b> developed in statistical physics.

5000|$|In {{lighting}} design, the lumen method, (also called zonal <b>cavity</b> <b>method),</b> is {{a simplified}} method {{to calculate the}} light level in a room. The method {{is a series of}} calculations that uses horizontal illuminance criteria to establish a uniform luminaire layout in a space. In its simplest form, the lumen method is merely the total number of lumens available in a room divided by the area of the room. [...] In order to perform this calculation, many factors, coefficients, lamp lumen data and other quantities must be gathered. Despite the scientific impression of the lumen method equations, there are inaccuracies and assumptions built into the method. Therefore, the lumen method should not typically be used as a standalone, final solution; it should be used as a tool in particularly uniform settings of lighting design if a simple, rough technique of illuminance quantification is desired.|$|E
