If the subsoil is layered, and if some coarse layers are not appropriate filters for finer layers, there <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contact</b> erosion <b>at</b> {{the interface between}} fine and coarse soils. In order to study contact erosion threshold, some base-soil and coarse-soil combinations were submitted to a flow parallel to the interface between the coarse soil and the base soil. Critical velocities and critical hydraulic gradients were measured for various base soils. Using effective base-soil grain diameter, an empirical expression for critical velocity was proposed that is well adapted for silts or sand/clay mixtures {{as well as for}} sands. The mass of eroded soil was measured relative to the flow velocity for each base-soil/coarse-soil setup. The shear stress applied to the interface between base soil and coarse soil was derived from the hydraulic gradient. Using an empirical relationship between applied shear stress and measured eroded mass, erosion rate was estimated for each base-soil/coarse-soil setup...|$|R

50|$|The tap <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} sample {{in the whole}} {{measurement}} process, and this <b>is</b> called <b>contact</b> mode (or static mode), otherwise it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> oscillated and this is called tapping mode (or dynamic mode). <b>Contact</b> mode <b>is</b> commonly applied on hard sample, on which the tip cannot leave any sign of wear, such as scars and debris. For softer materials tapping mode is used to minimize the effects of friction. In this case the tip is vibrated by a piezo and taps the surface at the resonant frequency of the cantilever, i.e. 70-400 kHz, and with an amplitude of 20-100 nm, high enough to allow the tip to not get stuck to the sample because of the adhesion force.|$|R
50|$|This {{group was}} formed in late 2010 {{by a group of}} local {{residents}} and the resident station master with a view to enhancing the station; small groups of volunteers occasionally meet at the station to carry out these improvements which to date have included the erection of a station flagpole (a traditional sight on many Isle of Man Railway station platforms) some painting of the station including the platform benches, provision of traditional blackboard signage to the station, and most significantly, the reinstatement of the coal fire in the waiting room {{for the first time in}} many years. The group continue to have an input to the upkeep of the station and will be donating concrete cast planters in the future for addition to the station's platforms. The group have, to date, spent many hours attending to the small details around the station, that which would not ordinarily fall under the jurisdiction of the railway's full-time staff. In 2012 the station won the commercial category of Castletown in Bloom, an annual competition, and took place in the Hidden Gardens event. The seasonal station master co-ordinates all activities and he <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>contacted</b> <b>at</b> the office whenever trains are in operation or by telephoning the station directly. The group always welcome new members and suggestions for further enhancement of the area; a number of photographic material and ephemera relating to the station have been donated since the group's formation and these can be found on display in the waiting room which is open whenever trains are running. In 2014 the group held its first Summer Fayre on the site, raising funds for various projects including the proposed reinstatement of the station's advertisement hoarding and a replica cattle dock. This was followed by an Easter Fayre in 2015 to tie in with the railway's annual Rush Hour event with a further summer event taking place in August.|$|E

This unique design allows for the determination of tribological performance of advanced materials and coatings under conditions that simulate those encountered in small steam engines currently under development...|$|R

The behavior of TCP with and without cell level pacing is studied.

We also present results showing that TCP augmented by cell-level pacing addresses these problems and allows the full bandwidth capacity to be utilized.
