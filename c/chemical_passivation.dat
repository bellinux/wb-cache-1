A generalisation of the phenomenon, experimental verification and the estimated range of micro-element concentration is also introduced. The ability for inoculation of a particular alloy is determined by the differences between the formation energies of oxides, as well as their crystallographic similarity.

30|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} the dependence of the electronic band structure and density of states on the <b>chemical</b> surface <b>passivation</b> of cubic porous silicon carbide (pSiC) was performed using ab initio density functional theory and the supercell method. The effects of the porosity and the surface chemistry composition on the energetic stability of pSiC were also investigated. The porous structures were modeled by removing atoms in the [001] direction to produce two different surface chemistries: one fully composed of silicon atoms and one composed of only carbon atoms. The changes in the electronic states of the porous structures {{as a function of}} the oxygen (O) content at the surface were studied. Specifically, the oxygen content was increased by replacing pairs of hydrogen (H) atoms on the pore surface with O atoms attached to the surface via either a double bond (X[*]=[*]O) or a bridge bond (X-O-X, X[*]=[*]Si or C). The calculations show that for the fully H-passivated surfaces, the forbidden energy band is larger for the C-rich phase than for the Si-rich phase. For the partially oxygenated Si-rich surfaces, the band gap behavior depends on the O bond type. The energy gap increases as the number of O atoms increases in the supercell if the O atoms are bridge-bonded, whereas the band gap energy does not exhibit a clear trend if O is double-bonded to the surface. In all cases, the gradual oxygenation decreases the band gap of the C-rich surface due to the presence of trap-like states.|$|R

Recent results indicate that Al 2 O 3 can also provide a good passivation of certain phosphorus-diffused n + c-Si surfaces. In this work, we studied the recombination at Al 2 O 3 passivated n + surfaces theoretically with device simulations and experimentally for Al 2 O 3 deposited with atomic layer deposition. The simulation results indicate {{that there is a}} certain surface doping concentration, where the recombination is maximal due to depletion or weak inversion of the charge carriers at the c-Si/Al 2 O 3 interface. This pronounced maximum was also observed experimentally for n + surfaces passivated either with Al 2 O 3 single layers or stacks of Al 2 O 3 capped by SiNx, when activated with a low temperature anneal (425 [*]°C). In contrast, for Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stacks activated with a short high-temperature firing process (800 [*]°C) a significant lower surface recombination was observed for most n + diffusion profiles without such a pronounced maximum. Based on experimentally determined interface properties and simulation results, we attribute this superior passivation quality after firing to a better <b>chemical</b> surface <b>passivation,</b> quantified by a lower interface defect density, in combination with a lower density of negative fixed charges.
