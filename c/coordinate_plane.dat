50|$|The {{generalization}} {{applies to}} flat objects of any shape, regular or irregular. The multi-object animation illustrates {{the use of}} the generalization on a set of several different objects in different planes - in this case, a triangle and a circle on one plane, and a flat cat on a parallel plane (shown in blue). Projections of the set are shown in green on the <b>coordinate</b> <b>plane</b> subspaces. Objects shown initially upright in the yz-plane are subsequently tilted in parallel. Again, regardless of set orientation, the result remains the same. On each <b>coordinate</b> <b>plane</b> subspace, the areas of object projections are calculated individually (to avoid miscalculations due to projection overlap), then added together to produce the total projection area of the set on that plane. The projection set area is then squared for each <b>coordinate</b> <b>plane.</b> The sum of all projection set areas squared is always equal to the original set area squared.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an image adaptive linear filtering method for {{the reconstruction of}} the RGB (red, blue, green) color coordinates of a pixel from the lossy compressed luminance/chrominance color coordinates. In the absence of quantization noise, the RGB coordinates of a pixel can be perfectly reconstructed by employing a standard, fixed filter whose support includes only the luminance/chrominance coordinates at the spatial location of the pixel. However, in the presence of quantization noise, a filter with a larger support, that also spatially extends over the luminance/chrominance <b>coordinate</b> <b>planes,</b> is capable of exploiting the statistical dependence among the luminance/chrominance <b>coordinate</b> <b>planes,</b> and thereby yields more accurate reconstruction than the standard, fixed filter. We propose the optimal (in the minimum mean squared error sense) determination of the coefficients of this adaptive linear filter at the image encoder by solving a system of regression equations. When transmitted as side information to the image decoder, the filter coefficients need not incur significant overhead if they are quantized and compressed intelligently. Our simulation results demonstrate that the distortion of the decompressed color <b>coordinate</b> <b>planes</b> can be reduced by several tenths of a dB with negligible overhead rate by the application of our image adaptive linear filtering method.
