5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks by a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, leathery skin.

5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to convey the information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> verb ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E

5|$|After the {{disappointment}} of the Gaspart era, the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new young president, Joan Laporta, {{and a young}} new manager, former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard, saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including Ronaldinho, Deco, Henrik Larsson, Ludovic Giuly, Samuel Eto'o and Rafael Márquez, combined with homegrown Spanish players Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi and Víctor Valdés, led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05, and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards.|$|E
5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause was a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sharp frost {{in the morning and}} unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E

5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|Duke offers 46 {{arts and}} {{sciences}} majors, four engineering majors, 52 Minors (including two in engineering) and Program II, which allows students to design their own interdisciplinary major in arts & sciences, and IDEAS, which allows students to design their own engineering major. Twenty-four certificate programs also are available. Students pursue a major, and can pursue a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> total of up to three including minors, certificates, and/or a second major. Eighty-five percent of undergraduates enroll in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, while the rest are in the Pratt School of Engineering.|$|E

5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lack of {{vegetation}} {{and the consequences of}} phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low {{pituitary}} hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E
5|$|In 1501, Prince Arthur {{arrived in}} Ludlow for his honeymoon with his bride Catherine of Aragon, before dying the {{following}} year. The Council in the Marches of Wales continued to operate, however, {{under the guidance}} of its president, Bishop William Smyth.

5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in these foods determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E
