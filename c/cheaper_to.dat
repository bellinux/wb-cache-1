5|$|Between 21 and 24 November 2011, 23 of the RAAF's F-111C and F-111Gs {{which had}} not been {{selected}} for preservation were buried at the Swanbank landfill site outside of Ipswich, Queensland. The RAAF had considered scrapping these aircraft, but concluded {{that it would be}} <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> bury them. The remaining ex-RAAF F-111s will be placed on display.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would be <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, {{the transit}} agency {{announced}} that it had found a replacement manufacturer for SmarTrip cards to avoid shortages until a new payment system goes into place.

5|$|In later life, Sing {{reported}} chest, back, {{and heart}} pain. His final days were spent in relative poverty and obscurity. His elder sister or half-sister, Mary Ann Elizabeth, {{had died in}} childbirth in 1915. In 1942, Sing moved from Miclere to Brisbane, telling his surviving sister Beatrice that it was <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> live there. His final occupation was as a labourer.|$|E
5|$|Modular broaches are {{commonly}} used for large internal broaching applications. They are similar to shell broaches {{in that they are}} a multi-piece construction. This design is used because it is <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> build and resharpen and is more flexible than a solid design.|$|E
5|$|Storlien, {{just on the}} Swedish side of the {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had easy access to the Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around Scania.|$|E
5000|$|The Tipsy Nipper T.66 is an {{aerobatic}} light aircraft, {{developed in}} 1952 by Ernest Oscar Tips of Avions Fairey at Gosselies in Belgium. It {{was designed to}} be easy <b>to</b> fly, <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> buy and <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> maintain. It was designed for both factory production and homebuild.

5|$|The {{programme}} was cancelled {{on economic}} grounds, as the Ministry of Defence {{decided that it}} would be <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar payload capacity, for future launches. Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow, NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free; however, this offer was withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> implement.|$|E

5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> raise.|$|E
5|$|Because {{mechanical}} refrigeration is energy intensive, active collectors {{are typically}} restricted {{to places where}} there is no supply of water that can be desalinated or purified at a lower cost and that are sufficiently far from a supply of fresh water to make transport uneconomical. Such circumstances are uncommon, and even then large installations such as that tried in the 1930s at Cook in South Australia failed because of the cost of running the installation – it was <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> transport water over large distances.|$|E
5|$|In 1873 the Pekin duck was {{introduced}} to the United Kingdom. Although its meat was thought to have a poorer flavour than that of the Aylesbury duck, the Pekin was hardier and <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> raise. Many breeders switched to the Pekin duck or to Aylesbury-Pekin crosses. By the beginning of the 20th century competition from the Pekin duck, inbreeding, and disease in the pure-bred Aylesbury strain and the rising cost of duck food meant the Aylesbury duck industry was in decline.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed their {{decision}} to close down the tramway. The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which had made it <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> run hydroelectric-powered trams than diesel-powered buses. After no investment on the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg Tramway in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. The professors surmised {{that it would be}} <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E

The vehicle is very basic by modern standards, but this made it <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> build, <b>cheap</b> <b>to</b> run and hard to break.|$|R

5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS {{decided it would be}} <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards was due to both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline was due to further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} of fossil fuels are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus often referred to as externalities. A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming <b>cheaper</b> <b>to</b> the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E
