25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo <b>charged</b> <b>version</b> of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E

The funk song, [...] "I Offer You Nothing But Love", was transformed into [...] "In Our Lifetime", which included chants from one of Gaye's musicians ("come let's all get funky if you dig the right/come let's all get funky if you dig the wrong"), with the lyrics talking about a possible Armageddon approaching. The mild disco sound of [...] "Lover's Plea" [...] again was altered for more gospel influences in the song [...] "Praise", even praising Stevie Wonder for the inspired riff for the song ("Stevie, we really dig you/hope you don't mind this riff from you"). [...] "Life is For Learning" [...] didn't change from the original song much except for the song's original title with the singer focusing on how he approached his music ("the artist pays the price/so you won't have to pay/if we would listen to what he has to say"). [...] "Funk Me" [...] was altered from the more sexually <b>charged</b> <b>version</b> from Love Man (its original title chanted [...] "funk me" [...] three times) and [...] "Heavy Love Affair", his one song in which he discusses his fallout with Janis, was originally [...] "Life's a Game of Give and Take", ironically doing the reverse of his other songs in which the original song discussed personal issues with his own life and flipping them around to focus on his fallout with Janis. [...] "Far Cry" [...] was the only newer song from the sessions in London to be featured along with the instrumental [...] "Nuclear Juice".

40|$|Most of {{our current}} {{knowledge}} on condensed matters contains a default assumption: the matters are neutral charged. On the other hand, the two-dimension(2 D) vortex-Coulomb gas charge analogy is a very successful theoretical tool in explaining superfluid, type-II superconductor and fractional quantum Hall effect(FQHE), because the interaction among vortices show similarity with 2 D Coulomb potential.
