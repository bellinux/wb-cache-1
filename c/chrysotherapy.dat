Skin discoloration occurs when gold salts are taken {{on a regular basis}} {{over a long period of}} time [...] Excessive intake of gold salts while undergoing <b>chrysotherapy</b> results - through complex redox processes - in the saturation by relatively stable gold compounds of skin tissue and organs (as well as teeth and ocular tissue in extreme cases) in a condition known as chrysiasis. This condition is similar to argyria, which is caused by exposure to silver salts and colloidal silver. Chrysiasis can ultimately lead to acute renal failure (such as tubular necrosis, nephrosis, glomerulitis [...] ), severe heart conditions, and hematologic complications (leukopenia, anemia). While some effects can be healed with moderate success, the skin discoloration is considered permanent.|$|E

During active <b>chrysotherapy</b> gold was abundant in synovial lining cells except where a fibrin layer was present on the surface; after stopping <b>chrysotherapy,</b> gold disappeared from the synovial lining cells. Gold accumulated progressively in the subsynovial connective tissues during <b>chrysotherapy,</b> but was not uniformly distributed, and bore no relationship to fluctuations in serum gold levels. Gold deposition was not confined to joint tissue, but was found within the macrophages of many organs, renal tubular epithelium, and, after recent <b>chrysotherapy,</b> in seminiferous tubules, hepatocytes, and adrenal cortical cells.

40|$|Intramuscular <b>chrysotherapy</b> is a {{well-established}} treatment for rheumatoid arthritis. Its therapeutic use {{has been limited}} by {{the high incidence of}} dermatological side-eects. The pathogenic mechanisms of these are unknown, but could include allergic reactions to gold or to nickel contaminating the gold. In order to investigate these mechanisms further, 15 patients, who developed cutaneous eruptions after <b>chrysotherapy,</b> were assessed using skin biopsy and lymphocyte transformation stimulated by gold and nickel salts in vitro. <b>Chrysotherapy</b> induced two main cutaneous eruptions: lichenoid reactions and non-specific dermatitis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with lichenoid reaction proliferated to gold salts in vitro, while those who developed non-specific dermatitis responded mainly to nickel. Nickel was a significant contaminant of the gold preparation (sodium aurothiomalate, Myocrisin 1, Rhone-Poulenc Ltd), amounting to a total of 650 ng after 6 months treatment.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{deposition}} {{of gold in}} the cornea-ocular chrysiasis-is a normal event during <b>chrysotherapy.</b> It may reflect tissue {{deposition of}} gold and be of value in predicting clinical improve-ment or toxic reactions. We studied 21 patients with rheumatoid arthritis on <b>chrysotherapy</b> but could find no relationship between the appearance of ocular chrysiasis, clinical improvement, and toxicity. Gold salts {{have been used in}} rheumatoid arthritis since 1927, 1 although their efficacy was not con-clusively demonstrated until 1961. 2 Since 1961 there has been continuous change in the regimens used for <b>chrysotherapy</b> and in the selection of patients. Careful monitoring of therapy has reduced the risk of serious toxicity, and gold tends to be given more frequently and much earlier {{in the course of the}} disease. In the days of the 1000 mg course of gold given as 50 mg weekly cutaneous and mucocutaneous toxicity was relatively common after 600 mg had been given. Y 5 With a higher proportion of 'early' patients being treated with gold, toxicity as a dose-related problem is likely to increase, as 'early' patients seem to require a smaller total dose to induce a remission. 5 Attempts to predict impending toxicity by measuring gold levels in plasma, skin, hair, and nails have been disappointing, and eosinophilia or raised serum IgE levels are relatively nonspecific. 6 - 8 A simple noninvasive method of assessing tissue deposition of gold might offer the clinician useful support in deciding the right time to change from weekly injections and in predicting toxicity. Ocular chrysiasis is a well-recognised phenomenon of gold therapy. Deposition of gold in the cornea has usually been noted after a total dose of 1500 mg. It is thought to increase with the total dose and diminish after cessation of gold therapy, and to be of no clinical significance. We have looked at ocular chrysiasis from a different point of view. If ocular chrysiasis is an index of tissue deposition of gold, would its appearance in the cornea coincide with clinical improvement and allow us to use cornea...|$|E

Materials and Methods Reagents, the atomic absorption spectrometer, its re-corder output, adjustment and operation have been pre-viously described (1). Analytical reagent grade chemicals were used. “Antifoam B ” was obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo. 63118. Primary gold standards were prepared as previously de-scribed (1). Method After the addition of a carborundum chip and four drops of Antifoam B (1 ml/ 100 ml), 25 ml of urine was evaporated just to dryness in a 50 -ml beaker covered with a watchglass, by simmering on a hot plate.

Therefore in the present study, some estimations such as gold levels in blood and urine, ESR, CRP, titre of rheumatoid factor, urinary 17 -KGS excretion, body weight and clinical symptoms including side effects, etc. were determined in 39 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving <b>chrysotherapy</b> (23 cases treated with GTG and 16 with GTM). All the 39 patients studied were suffering from definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis according to the ARA diagnostic criteria with duration of 1. 2 years or more.

Gold levels in blood and urine were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Comparing GTG with GTM in regard to anti-rheumatic effects, the anthor obtained the results as follows; 1) There was statistically significant correlation between plasma gold levels and gold compounds (GTG or GTM) administered. 2) Good therapeutic response initially appeared in rheumatoid patients, when the gold concentrations had risen approximately to 250 ～ 300 ug/dl of plasma level. 3) The efficacy rate of the treatment proved to be 73. 9 % in the cases given GTG and 68. 8 % given GTM.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential anti-inflammatory eects of sesame oil, which {{is present in}} the injectable gold preparation Auro-myose 1, the synthesis of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) by in vitro stimulated blood cells was measured before, during and after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with 18 g of sesame oil daily in 11 healthy male volunteers. Neither TNF-a, PGE 2 nor LTB 4 production levels showed statistically significant changes during the 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with sesame oil. These results do not suggest an anti-inflammatory eect of sesame oil as present in injectable gold preparations which are used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis, Gold compounds, Sesame oil, Prostaglandin, Cytokine. <b>CHRYSOTHERAPY</b> for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [1] has been applied in many dierent preparations dur-ing the past 60 yr. Gold salts, such as aurothiomalate and aurothioglucose, have been given in both oily suspensions and aqueous solutions. Oily suspensions were associated with reduced toxicity [2] and enhanced ecacy as compared to aqueous solutions [3]. Since oily suspensions produced more even seru...|$|E
40|$|Forty-one {{patients}} were given sodium aurothiomalate {{either in the}} conventional dose of 50 mg weekly for five months or in a small dose of 10 mg weekly for the same period. Monthly maintenance injections of 50 mg and 20 mg, respectively, were continued for a further seven months. A high incidence of toxicity and the subsequent withdrawal of 15 patients from the study prevented any analysis of results beyond five months. Statistically significant clinical improvements occurred with both treatment regimes. Although {{there were no significant}} differences between the clinical measurements of the treatment groups at any stage, a significant reduction of ESR and serum IgM occurred only with the higher dose. Side-effects were more frequent and occurred earlier with conventional treatment. However, severe toxicity, demanding withdrawal from the study, was slightly more common in the low-dose group. Thus, at least in the short term, conventional- and low-dose regimes appeared equally effective. A small dose did not lesson the hazards of toxicity. KEY WORDS: Rheumatoid arthritis, <b>Chrysotherapy.</b> GOLD salts are acknowledged to be an effective treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (1, 2). Their usefulness is limited by a high incidence of toxicity and a therapeutic response which is neither predictable nor always sustained. The extent to which these limitations may b...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of certain drugs {{to patients with}} established rheumatoid arthritis frequently results in improvement that is slow to appear but persists for long periods, even after the drug is discontinued. The three main drugs with this effect, whose efficacy and toxicity are reviewed in this paper, are gold salts, D-penicillamine and chloroquine. The cytotoxic agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, which likely have nonspecific anti-inflammatory actions and have serious long-term side effects, are also briefly reviewed. A new drug, levamisole, is currently being tested in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. It is suggested that the time for considering {{the introduction of a}} remission-inducing drug in patients with progressive rheumatoid arthritis is after an adequate trial of therapy with salicylates or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or both, and before the oral {{administration of}} steroids. It is difficult, however, on the basis of rigorous clinical comparisons, to recommend which of the three main remission-inducing drugs should be tried first, although gold salts have been used the most. Patients who have improved with 6 months of <b>chrysotherapy</b> may continue treatment for at least 3 years, during which time the frequency of mucocutaneous and renal toxic effects will steadily decrease. Some aspects of the medical economics of therapy with remission-inducing drugs for rheumatoid arthritis are discussed...|$|E
