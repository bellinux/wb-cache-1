40|$|SUMMARY: OSHA is {{revising}} the <b>Cranes</b> and <b>Derricks</b> Standard and related {{sections of the}} Construction Standard to update and specify industry work practices necessary to protect employees during the use of <b>cranes</b> and <b>derricks</b> in construction. This final standard also addresses advances in the designs of <b>cranes</b> and <b>derricks,</b> related hazards, and the qualifications of employees needed to operate them safely. Under this final rule, employers must determine whether the ground is sufficient to support the anticipated weight of hoisting equipment and associated loads. The employer is then be required to assess hazards within the work zone that would affect the safe operation of hoisting equipment, {{such as those of}} power lines and objects or personnel that would be within the work zone or swing radius of the hoisting equipment. Finally, the employer is required to 1 ensure that the equipment is in safe operating condition via required inspections and employees in the work zone are trained to recognize hazards {{associated with the use of}} the equipment and any related duties that they are assigned to perform. DATES: This final rule will become effective [INSERT DATE 90 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER]...|$|R

She also had a ram at her bow. Shortly after its commissioning he took his new command to sea on patrol. Most patrols were uneventful but sometimes U-boats were sighted and pursued but these invariably got away. Occasionally torpedoes were fired at his ship. Worsley felt the PC.61 was too easily identified as a Royal Navy vessel against which U-boats were too cautious to make a surface attack. Instead, the submarine would use its torpedoes to attack the ship.|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] The {{safety of}} {{construction}} workers who toil {{in close proximity}} to cranes garnered congressional attention after tower cranes were involved in multiple fatalities at buildings under construction in 2008 (e. g., nine deaths in two incidents in New York City). Additional crane-related fatalities occurred since the House Education and Labor Committee held a hearing on construction worker safety in June 2008, including four employees of a Louisiana-based construction firm who died when the contractor’s mobile crane fell at a Houston refinery. Construction historically has been the most hazardous industry as measured by number of fatalities. With 1, 178 out of 4, 956 on-the-job fatalities in the private sector in 2007, no other industry ranks higher than construction. The majority of construction deaths usually result from falls and transportation accidents (e. g., 38 % and 24 %, respectively, in 2007), according to the classification system of the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries. In contrast, most construction fatalities involving cranes are caused by contact with objects and equipment (e. g., struck by a falling crane). In 2007, contact with objects and equipment accounted for 71 % of crane-related deaths of workers in the construction industry. An analysis of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) files of construction fatalities involving cranes most frequently found violations of the following federal construction safety standard: 29 CFR 1926 Subpart N — <b>Cranes,</b> <b>Derricks,</b> Hoists, Elevators and Escalators. OSHA’s <b>crane</b> and <b>derrick</b> standard has been virtually unchanged since its promulgation in 1971. In a July 2002 notice of intent to create a negotiated rulemaking committee, OSHA acknowledged that industry consensus standards had been updated and crane technology had changed considerably over three decades. The <b>Crane</b> and <b>Derrick</b> Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee voted favorably on an extensive revision to the standard in July 2004 and submitted draft regulatory language to OSHA at that time. After slowly proceeding through the rulemaking process, OSHA submitted a draft proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in June 2008. OMB completed its review on August 28, 2008. Even if OSHA publishes a notice of proposed rule making in early fall, comments of OSHA administrator Foulke at the Education and Labor Committee hearing suggest an updated crane standard is unlikely to become final before the end of 2008. Although most of the 21 states that operate their own safety and health programs for private sector workers have adopted OSHA’s standards, some have developed more stringent regulations for specific hazards in certain industries. For example, many of these states require certification of crane operators: California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Utah, and Washington (in 2010). To protect the safety and property of their residents, other jurisdictions have promulgated regulations requiring certification of crane operators as well: Massachusetts, Montana, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Washington, D. C., Miami-Dade county, Chicago, Los Angeles, New Orleans, New York City, and Omaha...|$|R
