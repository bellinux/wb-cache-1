5|$|On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed on the {{threshold}} of Suk El Gharb, a village defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with strategic importance: the militias <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda, Yarze, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene. The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a {{reduction in the number of}} attacks on the Marines.|$|E

500|$|Before the {{officers}} {{arrived at the}} front of the car, Dexter Bostic, 34, opened fire from the passenger's seat with a [...]45 caliber handgun, striking Timoshenko once in the face and once in the throat. Yan had been approaching on the driver's side, while Timoshenko was <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> passenger's side. From the back seat of the BMW, Robert Ellis, 34, shot Yan with a 9mm handgun, striking him in the arm and chest; Yan was saved by his ballistic vest and was able to return fire. A third suspect, 29-year-old Lee Woods, was driving the BMW at the time of the shooting. After firing at least seven rounds at {{the officers}}, the three suspects fled the scene. Police later found the abandoned car on Kingston Avenue, about four blocks from where the shooting occurred.|$|E
500|$|Nell on {{the other}} hand is a smart and {{responsible}} girl, age seventeen {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She too goes through character development. Initially, as one reviewer put it, Nell is filled with a [...] "maelstorm of angst" [...] as she tries to figure out her relationship with Brooke and both [...] "shocked and intrigued" [...] by Brooke's eccentric behaviour. Though she expresses herself as in the control of most situations, in fact she is not, especially when Brooke is involved. One reviewer noted that Nell's voice in the novel is not altogether convincing, saying [...] "the levels of diction and spelling here seem rather high to be <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kitchen". The centrality of Nell in the novel was inspired by a postcard that Dawson bought which showed the maids from The Orchard during Brooke's stay. Though inspired by real individuals, Nell's character primarily draws inspiration from many individuals in Dawson's own life. The name Nell Golightly is a mix of two names: Izzie Golightly, a close friend of Dawson's mother, and Nelly Boxall, Virginia Woolf's servant.|$|E

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli reunite with Merry and Pippin and catch each other up on their various fortunes and what happened in Isengard. The hobbits tell the tale of how the Ents nearly caught Saruman after the Uruk-hai marched out to Rohan. [...] The Huorns followed the Uruk-hai, but the Ents attacked Isengard, only to be foiled by the magic of Orthanc and the fire of Saruman's machinery. [...] The Ents then flooded Isengard by damming and diverting the Isen.|$|E
2500|$|Moving forward {{under fire}} towards the Pear Trench, the assaulting Australians {{found that their}} way was blocked by barbed wire. It had been {{intended}} {{that it would be}} cut by the barrage, but intact it presented a significant obstacle. While attempting to move through it or over it, the German defenders began hurling grenades at them. With the tanks still <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear, the 15th Battalion's assault was temporarily checked. At that point, the two Australian Lewis gun teams that were attached to each platoon went into action, providing covering fire for the advancing riflemen. Normally a crew served weapon that is fired from the prone position, due to the tall crops which obscured the gunners' view of the target, the Lewis gunners had to stand up and fire from the hip, suppressing the German machine-guns. In doing so, they took heavy casualties, but they bought enough time for a company to rush two of the machine guns. As another Maxim opened up on the left, Private Henry Dalziel, a [...] "second" [...] in a Lewis gun crew, charged the gun with just a revolver, killing its two-man crew and capturing another. He was later awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
2500|$|Slim {{employed}} Billy Williams and his {{corps of}} elephants, led by Bandoola to build bridges and rescue refugees. He faced {{the same problems}} that the Japanese had faced in their failed 1944 offensive in the opposite direction. He made the supply of his armies the central issue in the plan of the campaign. The Chindwin River was spanned with the longest Bailey bridge {{in the world at}} the time. To distract the Japanese from his campaign in central and southern Burma, Slim ordered the Chinese in northern Burma to begin an offensive, which for a time led the Japanese to the erroneous conclusion that the main goal of the Allies was to open the Burma Road to China. Slim began his advance by sending two corps towards Mandalay and another corps along the coast towards Rangoon, but changed his plans when he learned from intelligence that the Japanese were planning on defending Mandalay from the eastern banks of the Irrawaddy. Slim had one corps cross the Irrawaddy south of Mandalay at Meiktila while another corps staged a feint attack on Mandalay from the north to distract the Japanese from the main blow <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> south. The swift flowing Irrawaddy is a wider river than the Rhine, making it into a natural defensive barrier that the Japanese believed could halt the British advance. In March 1945, after crossing the Irrawaddy the town of Meiktila was taken, followed by Burma's second city, Mandalay. The Irrawaddy river was a natural defensive barrier, but much of the countryside around the Irrawaddy consisted of plains that favored the offensive, and in his operations in the Irrawaddy river valley, Slim used combined arms offensives with artillery and tanks working closely with the infantry to bring down overwhelming firepower when the Japanese tried to block the 14th Army's advance.|$|E
