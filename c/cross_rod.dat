40|$|Stationary {{electrical}} connections and contacts, such as power connections, are commonly applied in electric power systems used for generation, {{transmission and distribution}} of electric energy. Several different degradation mechanisms can increase the contact resistance and might therefore reduce the power connection’s lifetime. The degradation by film development {{as a result of}} chemical reactions is often considered as a reason for contact failure. In this research work, the impact of film development produced by chemical reactions, such as oxidation, on the long-term behavior of stationary {{electrical connections}} and contacts was studied with <b>crossed</b> <b>rods.</b> Analytical, numerical and experimental methods were applied. Typical material systems for electric power systems were considered in this study: Cu-ETP (CW 004 A) bare, silver-, nickel- or tin-coated, Al 99. 5 (EN AW- 1050 A) and AlMgSi 0. 5 (EN AW- 6060). By applying numerical methods, the mechanical stress distribution was determined within a circular contact point. The initial contact resistance and the plastic deformed area of the considered material systems was measured in experimental tests. The film’s impact was further determined through comparative experimental studies in air (standard atmosphere) and N 2 (inert gas). During the experimental tests on perpendicularly <b>crossed</b> <b>rods,</b> other degradation mechanisms such as force reduction were suppressed. The film’s impact within the formation phase was studied on copper rods in an oven at 200 °C for 1000 h. Moreover, the dependency on different environments at 90 °C (laboratory, botanical garden and outdoor) was tested for 12000 h. Additional long-term tests over 12000 h were conducted at 200 °C. The contact resistance was determined dependent on time. Furthermore, the plastic deformed area was ascertained by microscopy. It was found that the time dependent film development caused by chemical reactions such as oxidation might possibly not result in a significant degradation of stationary electrical contacts with circular contact points and a constant force. Supplementary studies were performed at 200 °C for 1000 h with perpendicularly <b>crossed</b> <b>rods</b> at low forces (3. 5 N) as well as analytical assessment of radial and axial film growth on circular contact points. The measured long-term behavior of perpendicularly <b>crossed</b> <b>rods</b> was similar for low and high forces.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of {{electrical}} contact, to explain the evolution of electrical resistance {{as a function of}} the applied load, it is necessary to take into account the fracture of the native oxide of a metal. This work investigates the role played by the native alumina present at the surface of Al thin film in the formation of micro-contacts {{as a function of the}} applied load and loading rate. Thin aluminum films (1 mu m) are sputtered on silica rods (curvature radii of 3 mm and 6 mm). Model <b>crossed</b> <b>rods</b> electrical contact experiments are performed for pressures ranging from 100 MPa up to 1. 7 GPa. The following evolution of the electrical contact resistance is proposed. At low loads, the contact is first established without native oxide fracture leading to high levels of electrical resistance by tunneling effect (MOhm). Then fracture of native alumina is associated with the decreasing of the electrical contact resistance between kOhm to Ohm. Extrusion of aluminum through cracks is assumed to be responsible for good ohmic contact where cracks overlap. We show a strong influence of loading rate and contact geometry are investigated. At maximum load, the electrical contact resistance reaches a limit (< 100 mOhm), which is controlled by experimental geometry and intrinsic resistivity of the thin film. Current line spreading is modeled for this geometry and non negligible correction is carried out...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} {{the size of}} top-down fabricated silicon based electronic devices led to an increasing interest in alternative concepts which allow overcoming physical but also economical limits. The concept of integrating functional molecules into electronic devices, referred to as molecular electronics, might be a concept to fabricate smaller and cheaper devices in the future. The goal of this thesis was the design and synthesis of new functional molecules for molecular junctions. To achieve molecular electronic devices, molecules need to perform functions. Among them the most appealing ones are rectification and switching. However, to enable the design of electronic functions on a molecular level, it is equally important to develop a thorough comprehension {{of the relationship between}} the molecule’s structure and its transport properties. The contents of this thesis thus contribute to various aspects of molecular electronics. A row of model compounds consisting of a non-varying oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPE) backbone was synthesized. As a reference molecule, an OPE with two terminal thiol anchor groups was inspected in a mechanical controllable break junction (MCBJ) on a single molecule level. Certain components were systematically varied to examine the role of contacts and intermolecular interactions in molecular junctions. After the basic investigations the molecule’s function was further enriched and molecular switches and molecule based rectifiers moved into the focus of interest. Two redox switches based on ferrocene were proposed. In both switches, the ferrocene was functionalized in the 1, 1 ’-position with two linkers comprising thiol anchor groups. Whereas in the first model compound the linkers consist of rather poor conducting alkyl groups, the linkers of the second switch are conjugated vinyl groups to provide an efficient electronic coupling to the electrodes. The latter switch was electrochemically characterized and a fully reversible redox reaction was observed. It was possible to immobilize single molecules of the switch in an MCBJ setup. Combining the MCBJ setup with an electrochemical cell, the conductance of the immobilized molecule was investigated in relation to an applied potential with respect to a reference electrode. Indeed, a change in the conductance correlating with the oxidation state was observed, thus the molecular junction can be considered as a reversible single molecule redox switch. Furthermore a new switching concept based on the interplay of electrode and molecule was proposed. Therefore, different pathways for electrons in a cruciform type structure consisting of two <b>crossed</b> <b>rods</b> were considered. One of the rods bears terminal sulphur groups, whereas the second transversal rod is functionalized terminally with pyridine subunits. In an electrochemically controllable MCBJ the coordination of the pyridine nitrogen is expected to bind to the gold surface in dependence of the surface potential of the electrodes. The synthesis and characterization of several cruciform model compounds were synthesized to investigate the proposed coordination induced switch. The model compounds were investigated on a single molecule level in a MCBJ setup. No switching behaviour was obtained yet, nevertheless, the obtained results revealed that the molecules are functional and that electron transport is possible through both of the <b>crossed</b> <b>rods.</b> Further a molecular rectifier based on two meta-substituted benzene units, one functionalized with an electron donating group, the other with an electron withdrawing group was proposed. The synthesis was performed, but no integration experiments have yet been performed. An additional signal from a molecule other than the electrical response would be very appealing to obtain information from integrated molecules. We propose to profit from electroluminescence (EL) of a molecule connected to two electrodes. EL as signal from molecules is very appealing as it indicates that molecules are bridging the electrodes and the emitted light is characteristic for the fluorophore. Three target structures possessing fluorophores were designed to bridge a 5 nm gap of two single-walled carbon nanotube electrodes. The synthesis and characterization of three target structures with a length of around 7. 5 nm was described. The photophysical investigations in solution confirmed the possibility of tuning the absorption and emission bands. The integration into a single-walled carbon nanotube device was successfully performed and the nanotube-molecule-nanotube junction was characterized by its I/V-characteristics. Furthermore, the characteristic emission signal of integrated molecules was detected upon electrical excitation. The main work of this thesis was from synthetic nature, but in collaboration with physicists, it was contributed to several aspects of molecular electronics. ...|$|R
