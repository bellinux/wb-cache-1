25|$|Thirty-five {{men were}} sent from Ranger to Drake {{to take charge}} and assess the damage; and {{the next three days}} were spent making repairs, while moving slowly north-westward between Ireland and Scotland. A cargo brig which came too close was captured, and used as extra accommodations. On the other hand, six Irish {{fisherman}} who had been captured on the first Carrickfergus expedition were allowed, along with three sick Irish sailors, to take a boat and go home, with a present of sails from Drake, and some money from Jones. On their return they reported the concern Jones was showing for Lieut. Dobbs, who remained gravely ill. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy had sent out some proper warships in pursuit. Despite Drake lameness, they never <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slowly escaping Americans. The only real trouble Jones had was with his Lieutenant, Thomas Simpson, who had command of the Drake and at one point on the voyage sailed out of sight.|$|E
500|$|Emerald and Amethyst {{had more}} {{success in the}} spring of 1809 when on 23 March they {{captured}} the brigs Caroline and Serpent. In April, Emerald assisted Amethyst in the chase of a large 44-gun frigate off Ushant. Emerald sighted , with a main battery of 18-pounders and under the command of Captain Dupoter, at 11:00 on 5 April and immediately signalled Amethyst for assistance. Amethyst <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French forty-four just as she turned away to the south-east and gave chase but by 19:20 had lost sight of both Niemen and Emerald. Amethyst fell in with Niemen again at around 21:30 and engaged her. Niemen was forced to strike when a second British frigate, [...] came into view and fired a broadside. The Royal Navy took Niemen into service under her existing name.|$|E

One day, a young man walked by and <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sutra that Zhang was reading. [...] He was named Wang, who also had {{aspirations}} of becoming a monastic. It {{was the first time that}} Zhang had shared with anyone else his desire of becoming a monk.

2500|$|Kane {{was one of}} the first, if not the first, tourist {{to travel}} across the Canadian west and the Pacific north-west. Through his {{sketches}} and paintings, and later also his book, the public at large in Upper and Lower Canada for the first time <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peoples and their lifestyles in this vast and barely known territory. Kane had set out with a sincere desire to accurately portray his experiences—the landscape, the people, their tools. Yet it was primarily his embellished studio work that gained public appeal and made him famous. His idealized oil paintings and the similarly transformed travel notes that became his book were both a factor in the establishment and spreading of the perception of the North American indigenous people as noble savages, contrary to what the artist had intended. The more truthful field sketches were [...] "rediscovered" [...] and valued by a wider audience only in the twentieth century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1947, Kenneth Arnold claimed to have seen some unusual flying objects near Mount Rainier. His report caused {{widespread}} interest in unidentified flying objects, and Palmer was quick {{to argue that the}} [...] "flying saucers" [...] were validation of the Shaver Mystery—for several years, he noted, Shaver had mentioned the Deros' supposed spaceships. The idea that Shaver and Palmer had somehow predicted or pre-staged the [...] "flying saucer" [...] craze was later championed by writer John Keel. His 1983 article [...] "The Man Who Invented Flying Saucers" [...] (first published in Fortean Times) declared that [...] "Palmer assigned artists to make sketches of objects described by readers and disc-shaped flying machines appeared on the covers of his magazine long before June 1947. So we can note that a considerable number of people—millions—were exposed to the flying saucer concept before the national news media were even aware of it. Anyone who glanced at the magazines on a newsstand and <b>caught</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> saucer-emblazoned Amazing Stories cover had the image implanted in his subconscious".|$|E
