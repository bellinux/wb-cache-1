5|$|A prohibiting order {{operates}} {{to prevent}} illegal action {{by a public}} authority from occurring in the first place.

Like a quashing order, a prohibiting order is used to help maintain good standards of public administration.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. It was only when Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so would fight.|$|E

5|$|In 1842 {{the leaders}} of the Society of Friends, the Quaker group to which Coffin belonged, advised their members to cease {{membership}} in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves. The leaders insisted that legal emancipation was the best <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> Coffin continued to {{take an active role in}} assisting escaping slaves and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. Coffin and other Quakers who supported his activities separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention. Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

5|$|The two {{predecessor}} {{theories to}} two-level utilitarianism, act and rule utilitarianism, were beset by various objections.

Conversely, act utilitarianism was criticized for not allowing for a 'human element' in its calculations, i.e. it is sometimes too difficult (or impossible) for an ordinary person.|$|E
