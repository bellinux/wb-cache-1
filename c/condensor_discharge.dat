40|$|Hitherto the {{electric}} percutaneous stimulation of human nerve and muscle was studied by Lapicque 1) and Bourguignon 2), but values measured by them, e. g. chronaxie, cannot be estimated as correct, because they took no account of electric characters of human skin, specially of electric capacity, {{in the theory}} of measurement. Electric equivalence of human skin consists of resistance and capacity in parallel 3). When a rectangular voltage is sent through the skin, the current of outside circuit indicates a spike of exponential form. This means that the intensity of rectangular voltage, in which the current elecits muscle twitch at its percutaneous stimulation of the nerve, is not true electric threshold, but the stimulation must be compared with that by <b>condensor</b> <b>discharge,</b> where the RC-V relation of Hoorweg is of force. We measured the relation of polarization constant (RC) of human skin and intensity of rectangular voltage, and found that the intensity obeys the Hoorweg 2 ̆ 7 s law with the high resistance in series with the body circuit. 1) Lapicque L.
