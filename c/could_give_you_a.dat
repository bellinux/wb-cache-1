500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Edgar, [...] "you {{have caught}} me out. But I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> number of better reasons. It isn't my fault you resent compliments." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, true. Well, methinks, Glumm, that I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>thee</b> <b>a</b> little {{medicine}} for thy mind, but I won't, unless ye promise to keep thy spear off my back." ...|$|R
6000|$|Frank laughed. [...] "I expect Barclay <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> answer. There's {{another thing}} he could {{probably}} guess at, and that's what they've got {{in some of those}} slung baskets." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} obliged to take time, sir, before I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one should {{consider}} all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> pull, sir," [...] John {{replied with}} respectful gravity, [...] "They keep a rope {{at the station}} for shunting. Perhaps you had better send the driver, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|TALK. All that I {{know very}} well, {{for a man}} can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven; I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hundred scriptures for the {{confirmation}} of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Strange {{must have}} a manager. If you're willing to {{undertake}} the job, I daresay I could let you go. Then, if she wouldn't sooner trust her judgment, I think I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> pretty good character." ...|$|E
25|$|I wish I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of {{the beauty}} of the {{situation}} of this house. The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of the River, it certainly is very beautiful.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Imagine if I <b>could</b> {{temporarily}} <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> child's {{look at the}} world,' he said.|$|R
40|$|I wish I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> {{easy answer}} to the {{question}} posed in the title of this article, but there isn’t one. There is no easy answer because no one knows precisely where and to what degree Phakopsora pachyrhizi, the fungus that causes Asian soybean rust, will infect U. S. soybean fields this crop season...|$|R
60|$|TALK. All this I {{know very}} well. For {{a man can}} receive nothing, except it be given him from Heaven; all is of grace, not of works. I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hundred scriptures for the {{confirmation}} of this.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{no fault}} of mine!" [...] he cried. [...] "It was to be and it is. Jim, boy, for the Lord's sake {{remember}} your distances, and stick to out- fightin' with a man that <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> stone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would take}} a long time, Quashy, to answer these two {{questions}} fully; nevertheless, I think I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> roughish outline of a notion in about five minutes, if you'll promise not to stare so hard, and keep your mouth shut." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Most true!" [...] he said. [...] "The fool's {{crime is}} {{the crime that}} is found out, and the wise man's crime is the crime that is NOT found out. If I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> {{instance}}, {{it would not be}} the instance of a wise man. Dear Lady Glyde, your sound English common sense has been too much for me. It is checkmate for me this time, Miss Halcombe--ha?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a {{thorough}} English face: {{she did not}} lose those rosy cheeks till want of air faded them. Then I should hardly have known her, but the countenance had become so much more--calm it had always been, reminding me of the description of Jeanie Deans' countenance--I cannot {{tell you what it}} was then! I see a little dawning of that serenity on the mouth, even as it is here; but I wish anything <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of that look!' ...|$|R
50|$|Mother Vincent Whitty marvelled at the {{position}} of the new house in a way that many visitors to the school have done since 1863. Writing to Ireland with news of the move to Duncan's Hill she stated:I wish I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> idea of the beauty of the situation of this house. The view of the river from the Balcony is lovely and in the distance the thick bush, is here and there cleared away, with the town at one side of the River, it certainly is very beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|... "I say," [...] {{said the}} Captain of the Archangels, {{trotting}} up, [...] "are you hurt, Lutyens? We'll wait {{if you care}} {{to put in a}} substitute. I wish--I mean--the fact is, you fellows deserve this game if any team does. 'Wish we <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> man, or some of our ponies--or something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} you mean, but in some respects she's much older. In fact, I guess I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> year or two myself. But {{it seems to me}} you've kind of wilted since we began to talk. You've gone slack and your eyes look heavy. Say, I'm sorry if I've made you tired." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Canadian nodded, {{and shook}} the ash from his cigar. [...] "Exactly," [...] he said. [...] "A man with sense keeps {{his eye on the}} dollars, and leaves out the sentiment. It's quite apt to get in his way and trip him up. Well, suppose I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance of getting those dollars back?" ...|$|E
5000|$|There was a {{time when}} I <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> [...] … And then a time before that again when I did <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> hand … <b>You</b> were always in dire need of a hand, Willie.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the same}} time," [...] Tavernake went on, [...] "without a doubt Miss Beatrice's songs were also {{extremely}} popular. It is rather a pity that the management <b>could</b> not <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> little more time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{had thought}} it worth while {{to let me know}} you were going to Winnipeg, I <b>could</b> have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> errand," [...] he said, and added dryly: [...] "One would imagine that these trips are beyond your means." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then there's another point," [...] said Devine, {{with a faint}} {{twinkle in}} his eyes. [...] "You {{might want to do}} {{something}} yonder that would bring the dollars in. Now, I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> few lines that would be useful in case you wanted an engagement with one of your waterworks contractors or any one of that kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|TRIP. Why nothing {{capital of}} my master's {{wardrobe}} has drop'd lately--but I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> mortgage {{on some of}} his winter Cloaths with equity of redemption before November or--you shall have the reversion--of the French velvet, or a post obit on the Blue and Silver--these I should think Moses--with a few Pair of Point Ruffles as a collateral security--hey, my little Fellow? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Man, you're crazy!" [...] cried Brandt. [...] "He'd cut you {{to pieces}} before you'd {{have time to}} draw. He <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> tomahawk, then take it away and split your head. I tell you I know! You {{remember}} Jake Deering? He came from up your way. Wetzel fought Deering and Jim Girty together, and killed them. You know how he left Girty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way, {{what sort}} of <b>a</b> fit would <b>you</b> like? I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> either <b>an</b> epileptic or an apoplectic easily, but perhaps you'd like {{something}} more ornate--a catalepsy or a trade spasm, maybe--with miner's nystagmus or something of that kind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He damned {{himself if}} he did not love an Irish drummer better than any of the breed. [...] "The Prince has no more religion," [...] said this pious enthusiast, [...] "than one of my coach-horses." [...] . He asked me if I knew Jemmy Dawkins. I said I did not. [...] "He <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> account of them," [...] said he, [...] "but Lord Marischal has given the true {{character}} of the Prince, and certified under his hand to the people of England what a scoundrel he is {297} [...] . The Prince had the canaille of Scotland to assist him, thieves, robbers, and the like. [...] "' ...|$|R
60|$|I say, <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> me <b>a</b> {{drink of}} brandy? I'm awfully done up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but it has. If {{the estate}} was all right, {{and your father}} <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> {{thousand}} a year to live on without feeling it, and if your eldest child would be cock-sure of Greshamsbury, it might be very well that you should please yourself as to marrying at once. But that's not the case; and yet Greshamsbury is too good a card to be flung away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur Raphael and {{his sister}} came down in the train with us," [...] said Mrs. Giles to Lothair; [...] "the rest of the troupe will not be here until to-morrow; but {{they told me they}} <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> perfect proverbe if your lordship would like it; and the Spanish conjuror is here; but I rather think, from what I gather, that the young ladies would like a dance." ...|$|E
60|$|THE Duke of St. James dines to-day with Mr. Annesley. Men {{and things}} should be our study; and it is universally {{acknowledged}} that a dinner {{is the most important}} of affairs, and a dandy the most important of individuals. If we liked, we <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> description of the fête which should make all your mouths water; but everyone cooks now, and ekes out his page by robbing Jarrin and by rifling Ude.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never saw}} anybody {{in your life}} that was as full of {{knowledge}} and had less sense than old Cal. He was advised about all the branches of information contained in learning, and he was up to all the rudiments of doctrines and enlightenment. You couldn't advance him any ideas on any of the parts of speech or lines of thought. You would have thought he was a professor of the weather and politics and chemistry and natural history and the origin of derivations. Any subject you brought up old Cal <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> abundant synopsis of it from the Greek root up to the time it was sacked and on the market.|$|R
60|$|But these robberies {{extended}} chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen, {{and what}} rings or money {{they could come}} at when the person died who was under their care, but not to a general plunder of the houses; and I <b>could</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> account {{of one of these}} nurses, who, several years after, being on her deathbed, confessed with the utmost horror the robberies she had committed {{at the time of her}} being a nurse, and by which she had enriched herself to a great degree. But as for murders, I do not find that there was ever any proof of the facts in the manner as it has been reported, except as above.|$|R
50|$|If you {{are buying}} stock option {{contracts}}, for example, those contracts <b>could</b> potentially <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lot more shares {{than you could}} control by buying shares outright. So the notional value {{is the value of}} what you control rather than the value of what you own.|$|R
