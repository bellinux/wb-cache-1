5|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} was originally distributed on audio <b>cassette</b> tapes.

50|$|Additionally, an {{integron}} {{will usually}} contain {{one or more}} gene <b>cassettes</b> that have been incorporated into it. The gene <b>cassettes</b> may encode genes for antibiotic resistance, although most genes in integrons are uncharacterized. An attC sequence (also called 59-be) is a repeat that flanks <b>cassettes</b> and enables <b>cassettes</b> to be integrated at the attI site, excised and undergo horizontal gene transfer.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTIntegrons are genetic {{elements}} {{composed of}} a gene encoding an integrase, gene <b>cassettes</b> and an integration site for the gene <b>cassettes</b> (att). The integrase excises and integrates the gene <b>cassettes</b> from and into the integron, but integrons themselves are not mobile. Two groups of integrons are known: resistance integrons and super-integrons. Nearly all known gene <b>cassettes</b> from resistance integrons encode resistance to antibiotics or disinfectants. These integrons are found on transposons, plasmids and the bacterial chromosome. Gene <b>cassettes</b> in super-integrons encode {{a variety of different}} functions. Super-integrons are located on the bacterial chromosome. More than 100 gene <b>cassettes</b> may be present, in contrast to resistance integrons where less than ten <b>cassettes</b> are present. Many species harbour super-integrons, which are species-specific, whereas particular resistance integrons {{can be found in a}} variety of species. The gene <b>cassettes</b> in resistance integrons probably originated from super-integrons. In the last few years, a variety of new gene <b>cassettes</b> have been described. Many of these encode resistance against newer antibiotics such as cephalosporins and carbapenems. Resistance integrons have been found in isolates from a wide variety of sources, including food...|$|R

5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a <b>cassette</b> titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the <b>cassette)</b> as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E
