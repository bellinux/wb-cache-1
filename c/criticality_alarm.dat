In order to evaluate coverage, the facilities were modeled using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Computer Code (MCNP). MCNP was then used to simulate criticality accidents at various locations in the X- 710 and X- 760 buildings and the north half of the X- 7745 -R storage lot. The associated neutron flux at current detector locations was calculated. The neutron flux was then converted to an absorbed dose rate (in tissue) and compared with the Portsmouth <b>criticality</b> accident <b>alarm</b> set-point of 5 mrad/hr. The parameters defining the simulated criticality accidents have been calculated as ``the minimum accident of concern`` as defined in ANSI Standard ANS 8. 3 - 1986.

CAAS coverage of the process cell floors (second floors) has been evaluated in previous reports. Coverage of the roadways around the three processing buildings by the cell floor detectors in these buildings has also been verified in a previous report. In order to evaluate coverage, the facilities were modeled using the Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Computer Code (MCNP). MCNP was then used to simulate criticality accidents at various locations throughout the operating floors of the buildings and the associated neutron flux at the current detector locations was calculated. The neutron flux was then converted to an absorbed dose rate (in tissue) and compared with the Portsmouth <b>criticality</b> accident <b>alarm</b> set-point of 5 mrad/hr. The parameters defining the simulated criticality accidents have been calculated as ``the minimum accident of concern`` as defined in ANSI Standard ANS 8. 3 - 1986. These calculations are documented in Portsmouth report number POEF-SH- 31. The results of this evaluation indicate that the X- 333 Operating Floor CAAS may not alarm in response to a minimum accident of concern. This is primarily because of shielding provided by the numerous concrete columns used to support the second floor of this building and the large distances between the CAAS detectors. Conversely, the results indicate that the X- 326 and the X- 330 CAAS systems would alarm in response to a minimum accident of concern occurring on the operating floors of these buildings.

40|$|Neutron-sensitive {{radiation}} detectors {{are used}} in the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant`s (PORTS) <b>criticality</b> accident <b>alarm</b> system (CAAS). The CAAS is composed of numerous detectors, electronics, and logic units. It uses a telemetry system to sound building evacuation horns and to provide remote alarm status in a central control facility. The ANSI Standard for a CAAS uses a free-in-air dose rate to define the detection criteria for a minimum accident-of-concern. Previously, the free-in-air absorbed dose rate from neutrons was used for determining the areal coverge of criticality detection within PORTS buildings handling fissile materials. However, the free-in-air dose rate does not accurately reflect the response of the neutron detectors in use at PORTS. Because the cost of placing additional CAAS detectors in areas of questionable coverage (based on a free-in-air absorbed dose rate) is high, the actual response function for the CAAS neutron detectors was determined. This report, which is organized into three major sections, discusses how the actual response function for the PORTS CAAS neutron detectors was determined. The CAAS neutron detectors are described in Section 2. The model of the detector system developed to facilitate calculation of the response function is discussed in Section 3.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} cascade processing equipment at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) {{is located in}} Buildings X- 333, X- 330, and X- 326. These buildings were {{referred to as the}} cascade buildings. Because enriched uranium operations are performed within the cascade buildings, the potential for a criticality accident in these buildings exists. A <b>Criticality</b> Accident <b>Alarm</b> System (CAAS) is in place to alarm {{in the event of a}} criticality accident. The CAAS is required to be designed to immediately detect the minimum accident-of-concern. A minimum accident-of-concern in an area with nominal shielding delivers the equivalent of an absorbed dose rate in free air of 20 rads per minute at a distance of 2 meters from the reacting material [Am 86]. This report summarizes the analysis that was performed to evaluate the CAAS response to selected minimum accidents-of-concern on the operating floor of the cascade buildings. Selection of potential accident locations was based, in part, on the maximum distance to the closest CAAS detector. The other factor in selecting potential accident locations for analysis was the amount of intervening shielding between the accident location and CAAS detector. If the CAAS was predicted to alarm under conditions of significant shielding, then the system presumably would alarm in response to all accidents greater than the minimum accident-of-concern, at closer distances, and with less shielding...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the hybrid (Monte Carlo/deterministic) radiation transport methods and codes used at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and examples of their application for increasing the efficiency of real-world, fixed-source Monte Carlo analyses. The two principal hybrid methods are (1) Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) for optimization of a localized detector (tally) region (e. g., flux, dose, or reaction rate at a particular location) and (2) Forward Weighted CADIS (FW-CADIS) for optimizing distributions (e. g., mesh tal-lies over {{all or part of the}} problem space) or multiple localized detector regions (e. g., simultaneous optimization of two or more localized tally regions). The two methods have been implemented and automated in both the MAVRIC sequence of SCALE 6 and ADVANTG, a code that works with the MCNP code. As implemented, the methods utilize the results of approximate, fast-running 3 -D discrete ordinates transport calculations (with the Denovo code) to gen-erate consistent space- and energy-dependent source and transport (weight windows) biasing parameters. These methods and codes have been applied to many relevant and challenging problems, including calculations of PWR ex-core thermal detector response, dose rates throughout an entire PWR facility, site boundary dose from arrays of commercial spent fuel storage casks, radiation fields for <b>criticality</b> accident <b>alarm</b> system placement, and detector re-sponse for special nuclear material detection scenarios and nuclear well-logging tools.

40|$|The Appendix B {{published}} with ANSI 8. 3 in {{both the}} present and previous editions, contains a calculation example for distance of coverage of a CAAS. In it, a trip point multiplication factor of 2500 is included to address system under response to a short pulse of radiation.

An investigation of the response of some radiation detectors used in alarm systems shows some fundamental effects still make such a consideration necessary. Outputs and alarms from an ionization chamber system are examined for response to a fast pulse reactor,and some. gamma detectors response to pulse radiation are examined including GM and scintillation detectors, and an ionization chamber.

40|$|Under {{the current}} climate of {{increasing}} regulation and decreasing budgets, DOE nuclear facilities are forced to become more efficient in operations aimed at satisfying regulatory requirements. Efficiency necessitates increased cooperation between the regulator (DOE) and facility management, and often a mutually agreeable innovative solution. At Argonne National Laboratory - East (ANL-E), one issue that required such an innovative solution and cooperation between contractor and regulator was the determination of whether the risk associated with an inadvertent criticality event justified the purchase and maintenance of a <b>Criticality</b> <b>Alarm</b> System (CAS) meeting ANSI/ANS- 8. 3 - 1986 requirements. According to DOE Order 420. 1, {{the need for a}} CAS is based on the probability of occurrence of a criticality accident. If the probability is < 10 {sup {minus} 6 }/yr (i. e., incredible) as determined by {open_quotes}commonly accepted engineering judgement,{close_quotes} then a CAS is not necessary. Installation of a CAS after such a conclusion would be a conservative decision and an unnecessary expense. This paper discusses the use of {open_quotes}commonly accepted engineering judgement{close_quotes} to show that the probability of an inadvertent criticality at a nonreactor nuclear facility (e. g., the Alpha-Gamma Hot Cell Facility) is < 10 {sup {minus} 6 }/yr. and is therefore an incredible event...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirement}} from ANSI/ANS- 8. 3 states: (1) a <b>criticality</b> <b>alarm</b> {{system meeting}} the requirements of this standard shall be installed in areas where personnel {{would be subject to}} an excessive radiation dose; and (2) excessive dose = any dose to personnel corresponding to an absorbed dose from neutrons and gamma rays equal to or greater than 0. 12 Gy (12 rad) in free air. The requirement was misconstrued to imply that the Immediate Evaluation Zone (IEZ) had to cover out to 12 Rad of dose. This mis-interpretation prompted the following official clarification: The standard does not attempt to define the area that is to be evacuated, which is considered a management responsibility and outside the scope of this Standard. What we wanted was an IEZ that: (1) depended on the facility characteristics and hazards; (2) departed from the one 'Size' fits all mentality; (3) balanced the risk of a criticality with the risk of evacuating; and (4) was consistent with the emergency planning process. What they have is a facility that is a mile long; a facility that was falling down around them; a facility where workers are routinely in fall protection; and a facility where high noise is the normal condition. They ended up matching ANS- 8. 23 with their EPHA and DSA and eliminated 12 Rad as the criterion; integrated Emergency Planning into the process; established evacuation zones using DSA consequence levels; and introduced time dependence into the evacuation process...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the Bechtel Jacobs Company, LLC (BJC) Lessons Learned for system design as it relates to safety basis documentation. BJC has had to reconcile incomplete or outdated system description information with current facility safety basis for a number of situations in recent months. This paper has relevance in multiple topical areas including documented safety analysis, decontamination & decommissioning (D&D), safety basis (SB) implementation, safety and design integration, potential inadequacy of the safety analysis (PISA), technical safety requirements (TSR), and unreviewed safety questions. BJC learned that nuclear safety compliance relies on adequate and well documented system design information. A number of PIS As and TSR violations occurred due to inadequate or erroneous system design information. As a corrective action, BJC assessed the occurrences caused by systems design-safety basis interface problems. Safety systems reviewed included the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) Fluorination System, K- 1065 fire alarm system, and the K- 25 Radiation <b>Criticality</b> Accident <b>Alarm</b> System. The conclusion was that an inadequate knowledge of system design could result in continuous non-compliance issues relating to nuclear safety. This was especially true with older facilities that lacked current as-built drawings coupled with the loss of 'historical knowledge' as personnel retired or moved on in their careers. Walkdown of systems and the updating of drawings are imperative for nuclear safety compliance. System design integration with safety basis has relevance in the Department of Energy (DOE) complex. This paper presents the BJC Lessons Learned in this area. It will be of benefit to DOE contractors that manage and operate an aging population of nuclear facilities...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} represents Phase I of a two-phase project. The entire project {{consists of}} determining {{a series of}} minimum accidents of concern and their associated neutron and photon leakage spectra {{that may be used}} to determine <b>Criticality</b> Accident <b>Alarm</b> compliance with ANSI/ANS- 8. 3. The inadvertent assembly of a critical mass of material presents a multitude of unknown quantities. Depending on the particular process, one can make an educated guess as to fissile material. In a gaseous diffusion cascade, this material is assumed to be uranyl fluoride. However, educated assumptions cannot be readily made for the other variables. Phase I of this project is determining a bounding minimum accident of concern and its associated neutron and photon leakage spectra. To determine the composition of the bounding minimum accident of concern, work was done {{to determine the effects of}} geometry, moderation level, and enrichment on the leakage spectra of a critical assembly. The minimum accident of concern is defined as the accident that may be assumed to deliver the equivalent of an absorbed dose in free air of 20 rad at a distance of 2 meters from the reacting material within 60 seconds. To determine this dose, an analyst makes an assumption and choose an appropriate flux to dose response function. The power level required of a critical assembly to constitute a minimum accident of concern depends heavily on the response function chosen. The first step in determining the leakage spectra was to attempt to isolate the effects of geometry, after which all calculations were conducted on critical spheres. The moderation level and enrichment of the spheres were varied and their leakage spectra calculated. These spectra were then multiplied by three different response functions: the Henderson Flux to Dose conversion factors, the ICRU 44 Kerma in Air, and the MCNP Heating Detector. The power level required to produce a minimum accident of concern was then calculated for each combination...|$|R

40|$|Recent program {{requirements}} of the US Department of Energy/NNSA {{have led to a}} need for a criticality accident alarm system to be installed at a newly activated facility. The Criticality Safety Group of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was able to recover and store for possible future use approximately 200 neutron criticality detectors and 20 master alarm panels from the former Rocky Flats Plant in Golden, Colorado when the plant was closed. The Criticality Safety Group participated in a facility analysis and evaluation, the engineering design and review process, as well as the refurbishment, testing, and recalibration of the Rocky Flats <b>criticality</b> <b>alarm</b> system equipment {{to be used in the}} new facility. In order to demonstrate the functionality and survivability of the neutron detectors to the effects of an actual criticality accident, neutron detector testing was performed at the French CEA Valduc SILENE reactor from October 7 to October 19, 2010. The neutron detectors were exposed to three criticality events or pulses generated by the SILENE reactor. The first excursion was performed with a bare or unshielded reactor, and the second excursion was made with a lead shielded/reflected reactor, and the third excursion with a polyethylene reflected core. These tests of the Rocky Flats neutron detectors were performed as a part of the 2010 Criticality Accident Alarm System Benchmark Measurements at the SILENE Reactor. The principal investigators for this series of experiments were Thomas M. Miller and John C. Wagner of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with Nicolas Authier and Nathalie Baclet of CEA Valduc. Several other organizations were also represented, including the Y- 12 National Security Complex, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, CEA Saclay, and Babcock International Group...|$|E
40|$|Criticality Accident Alarm System (CAAS) {{detectors}} on {{the cell}} floor of the X- 326 process building at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) are located at a height of 5 m above the cell floor. It {{has been suggested that}} this height be lowered to I m to alleviate accelerated system failures caused by the elevated temperatures at 5 m and to reduce the frequency of injury to maintenance personnel lifting the approximately 90 -lb units into position. Work has been performed which analyzed the effect of relocating the CAAS detectors on the process floors of the X- 333 and X- 330 buildings from their current height to a height of 1 m{sup 1 }. This earlier work was based on criticality accidents occurring in low enriched material (5 % {sup 235 }U) and was limited to the X- 333 and X- 330 buildings and the low enriched areas of X- 326. It did not consider the residual higher enriched material in the X- 326 building. This report analyzes the effect on <b>criticality</b> <b>alarm</b> coverage of lowering the CAAS detectors. This analysis is based on criticality accidents resulting from higher enriched material which may be present as ``hold-up`` in the process equipment within the X- 326 building. The criticality accident alarm detectors at the PORTS facility are set to alarm at a neutron absorbed dose rate of 5 mrad/hr. The calculated absorbed dose rates presented in this report show that the detectors examined that produce an alarm for the given criticality event at their current height will also produce an alarm if located at a height of 1 meter. Therefore, lowering the detectors will not result in a loss of coverage within the building...|$|E
40|$|Disconnecting the <b>criticality</b> <b>alarm</b> {{permanently}} in June 1996 signified that the hazards in the PUREX (plutonium-uranium extraction) plant {{had been so}} removed and reduced that criticality {{was no longer a}} credible event. Turning off the PUREX <b>criticality</b> <b>alarm</b> also marked a salient point in a historic deactivation project, 1 year before its anticipated conclusion. The PUREX/UO 3 Deactivation Project began in October 1993 as a 5 -year, $ 222. 5 - million project. As a result of innovations implemented during 1994 and 1995, the project schedule was shortened by over a year, with concomitant savings. In 1994, the innovations included arranging to send contaminated nitric acid from the PUREX Plant to British Nuclear Fuels, Limited (BNFL) for reuse and sending metal solutions containing plutonium and uranium from PUREX to the Hanford Site tank farms. These two steps saved the project $ 36. 9 - million. In 1995, reductions in overhead rate, work scope, and budget, along with curtailed capital equipment expenditures, reduced the cost another $ 25. 6 million. These savings were achieved by using activity-based cost estimating and applying technical schedule enhancements. In 1996, a series of changes brought about under the general concept of ``reengineering`` reduced the cost approximately another $ 15 million, and moved the completion date to May 1997. With the total savings projected at about $ 75 million, or 33. 7 percent of the originally projected cost, understanding how the changes came about, what decisions were made, and why they were made becomes important. At the same time sweeping changes in the cultural of the Hanford Site were taking place. These changes included shifting employee relations and work structures, introducing new philosophies and methods in maintaining safety and complying with regulations, using electronic technology to manage information, and, adopting new methods and bases for evaluating progress. Because these changes helped generate cost savings and were accompanied by and were an integral part of sweeping ``culture changes,`` the story of the lessons learned during the PUREX Deactivation Project are worth recounting. Foremost among the lessons is recognizing the benefits of ``right to left`` project planning. A deactivation project must start by identifying its end points, then make every task, budget, and organizational decision based on reaching those end points. Along with this key lesson is the knowledge that project planning and scheduling should be tied directly to costing, and the project status should be checked often (more often than needed to meet mandated reporting requirements) to reflect real-time work. People working on a successful project should never be guessing about its schedule or living with a paper schedule that does not represent the actual state of work. Other salient lessons were learned in the PUREX/UO 3 Deactivation Project that support these guiding principles. They include recognizing the value of independent review, teamwork, and reengineering concepts; the need and value of cooperation between the DOE, its contractors, regulators, and stakeholders; and the essential nature of early and ongoing communication. Managing a successful project also requires being willing to take a fresh look at safety requirements and to apply them in a streamlined and sensible manner to deactivating facilities; draw on the enormous value of resident knowledge acquired by people over years and sometimes decades of working in old plants; and recognize the value of bringing in outside expertise for certain specialized tasks. This approach makes possible discovering the savings that can come when many creative options are pursued persistently and the wisdom of leaving some decisions to the future. The essential job of a deactivation project is to place a facility in a safe, stable, low-maintenance mode, for an interim period. Specific end points are identified to recognize and document this state. Keeping the limited objectives of the project in mind can guide decisions that reduce risks with minimal manipulation of physical materials, minimal waste generation, streamline regulations and safety requirements where possible, and separate the facility from ongoing entanglements with operating systems. Thus, the ``parked car`` state is achieved quickly and directly. The PUREX Deactivation Lessons Learned History was first issued in January 1995. Since then, several key changes have occurred in the project, making it advisable to revise and update the document. This document is organized with the significant lessons learned captured {{at the end of each}} section, and then recounted in Section 11. 0, ``Lessons Consolidated. `` It is hoped and believed that the lessons learned on the PUREX Deactivation Project will have value to other facilities both inside and outside the DOE complex...|$|E
