5000|$|Adsorbed {{proteins}} {{are among}} the most difficult food soils to remove from food contact surfaces. In particular, heat-denatured proteins (such as those found in dairy industry applications) adhere tightly to surfaces and require strong alkaline cleaners for removal. [...] It is important that cleaning methods are capable of removing both visible and non-visible protein soils. Nutrients for bacterial growth must be removed as well as biofilms that may have built up on the food contact surface. Proteins are water-insoluble, slightly soluble in acidic solutions and soluble in alkaline solutions, which limits the type of cleaner {{that can be used to}} remove protein from the surface. [...] Generally speaking, highly alkaline cleaners with peptizing and wetting agents are most effective in protein removal on food contact surfaces. [...] Cleaning temperature is also a concern for effective protein removal. As temperature increases, the activity of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>compound</b> increases, making soil removal easier. However, at higher temperatures (> 55°C) proteins denature and cleaning efficacy is reduced.|$|R

MethodsWe present a 5 -year-old girl who suffered from recurrent reactions accompanied by urticaria, angioedema, headaches, dyspnea, loss of consciousness, and abdominal pain that were not eradicated, but were instead exacerbated, by various treatments with antihistamines and intravenous corticosteroids. Her diet diary revealed that symptoms occurred after ingestion of colorful sweets such as candies and jellybeans. Open challenge tests with food additives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were performed after elimination of these items. Skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs, which were dissolved in saline, and prick-prick tests using candies and jellybeans, were carried out. ResultsOpen challenge tests with Tartrazine, aspirin and acetaminophen were positive, whereas skin prick tests using additives and NSAIDs and prick-prick tests using candies and jellybeans were all negative. Consequently, intolerance to azo dyes and NSAIDs such as aspirin was diagnosed. However, she appeared to react to multiple chemical odors {{such as those of}} cigarette smoke, disinfectant, detergent, <b>cleaning</b> <b>compounds,</b> perfume, and hairdressing, all while avoiding additives and NSAIDs.

40|$|Abstract. Mould {{cleaning}} {{process is}} the process of removal build-up deposited or residue material on the mould surface after repeated cycles of production. The currently used mould cleaning process is sand blasting (abrasive process) and dry rubber mould <b>cleaning</b> <b>compounds</b> (depends on the skill of the operators during rubber compounding). Latex laminated compounds will be beneficial as a new substitute for mould cleaning because of its excellent strength properties and the lamination process to increase its thickness. The main focus of this research is to investigate the effect of lamination process on tensile properties and mould cleaning efficiency of laminated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) latex composites. Laminated NBR latex films with cleaning agent and waste latex compound was prepared by arranging half-cured latex sheets with various thicknesses of outer layer (NBR latex films with cleaning agent) and core layer (waste NBR latex film). The core and outer layers are prepared through casting method with different thickness. The laminated films were subjected to compression moulding using hot press at 120 oC. Reinforcement of the core layer gives laminated latex composite with better tensile properties, but excessive of core layer portion reduced the elongations of laminated films. The efficiency of mould cleaning of laminated NBR latex films were dependent on the flow ability and adhesion properties of the fresh latex layer with mould cleaning agent (outer layer) ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE A {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} was conducted to evaluate the effects of oral prophylaxis on halitosis-associated, immunological and microbiological parameters. METHODS Thirty subjects were included in this {{controlled clinical trial}} (patients with generalized chronic periodontitis and controls without clinical attachment loss; each n = 15). Before oral prophylaxis and 14 days after (including tongue <b>cleaning)</b> volatile sulphur <b>compounds</b> (VSC), organoleptic scores and a tongue coating index were evaluated. The levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 8, IL- 10 and MMP- 8 were measured in GCF, and also major periodontal pathogens were detected. Data were statistically analysed using anova and paired t-test. RESULTS Supragingival plaque and calculus removal with combined tongue cleaning was able to reduce significantly (P < 0. 05) the VSC values in both groups (no significant differences between both groups). Two weeks after periodontal debridement, the VSC values were observed in the periodontitis group, {{but not in the}} control group, similar to the baseline values. The difference between the groups was statistically significant (P < 0. 05). Only a repeated prophylaxis session in the periodontitis group was able to reduce VSC values significantly in comparison with baseline (P < 0. 05). Organoleptic scores (10 and 30 cm) were significantly different (P < 0. 05) between both groups before and after the treatment. Periodontal pathogens and host-derived markers were not significantly affected by a single prophylaxis session. CONCLUSIONS Oral prophylaxis may result in a significant decrease in VSC values.

It is susceptible to its own water pollutants from municipal sewage (~ 1, 054 million m 3 /year) and also the discharge (~ 3. 0 x 109 m 3 / year) along the river from the industrialized and urbanized Mainland China cities. The local environment and human health are exposed to risks of these chemicals ascribed to rising consumption of detergents and their insufficient removal by sewage treatment, in addition to food intake in particular seafood. However, public awareness about APEO and endocrine disrupting chemicals is low due to no mandatory disclosure and control of these chemicals as well as the uncertainties about their chronic toxicity, based on the survey results of online questionnaires.
