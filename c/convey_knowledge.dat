The faculties, which when a man finds in himself, he resolves to be a painter, are, I suppose, intenseness of observation and facility of imitation. The man is created an observer and an imitator; and his function is to <b>convey</b> <b>knowledge</b> to his fellow-men, of such things as cannot be taught otherwise than ocularly. For a long time this function remained a religious one: it was to impress upon the popular mind the reality of the objects of faith, and the truth of the histories of Scripture, by giving visible form to both. That function has now passed away, and none has as yet taken its place. The painter has no profession, no purpose. He is an idler on the earth, chasing the shadows of his own fancies.|$|E

5000|$|Although television, the {{internet}} and family stories generally represent the primary sources {{of knowledge about the}} Holocaust, curricula and textbooks tell the contemporary formation of historical knowledge because they fix in words the conceptual and narrative categories in which events of the past are to be learnt in a given society. One of the central concerns when comparing both curricula and textbooks, is therefore to ensure that linguistic variations be given due attention. The absence of the words ‘Holocaust’ or ‘Shoah’ (or their equivalents in each language), for example, does not mean that this event is not taught, because alternative words or paraphrases may also <b>convey</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the event in unexpected ways.|$|E

50|$|James W. Carey did {{not believe}} that journalists could be defined as {{conveyors}} of information. Instead, he presented two alternate viewpoints of communication: the transmission view of communication and the ritual view of communication. The transmission view of communication highlights the importance of information being sent out over large distances in order to <b>convey</b> <b>knowledge</b> and ideas to a mass audience. This viewpoint is more commonly seen in industrial communities where focus is put on the extension of the message. Alternatively, the ritual viewpoint of communication focuses more on the sharing of information amongst a large group of people. Therefore, the focus is not on the extension of the message, but towards the maintenance of society over time. Carey argued that this viewpoint is not as prevalent in American society because the concept of culture is weak in American social thought.|$|E

40|$|This study retraces {{the steps}} of the 17 th century {{architect}} and engineer Salomon de Caus through his written and built works, in an attempt to understand the relationship between what he made and the model by which his world was comprehended. The central questions examined with regard to his works are: what correspondence do they reveal between language as a means of <b>conveying</b> <b>knowledge,</b> the world as the source of knowledge, and God the divine creator; and whether "meaning" resides within or without this relation. The interpretation of De Caus' works reveals an epistemological model of a world balancing on the threshold of the modern era of scientific discovery and technological progress. His texts and constructions appear as a means of <b>conveying</b> <b>knowledge</b> with the aim of making the Divine appear as mystery in the human world. De Caus is known to operate two principal layers of meaning in his works. One "mathematical" which addresses the intrinsic meaning of the order of the cosmos and the Divine; the other "narrative", "melodie" or "ornamental", addressing the mediation of situational meaning through matter. Human experience and action was a third factor in the process of mediation. Through the intense experience of the moment of performance, whether architectural, theatrical or musical, man could embody the immaterial knowledge of God. The human artefact was a "poetic instrument" guiding man through life. Today, when living in a world where the dominating paradigm reduces understanding to symbolic logic and God has long since been declared dead, De Caus' poetic model remains highly significant...|$|R

We explore here a challenge to this view, which extends the so-called situationist challenge to virtue ethics. Evidence from social psychology indicates that individuals’ behavior is often susceptible to trivial and normatively irrelevant situational influences. This evidence not only challenges approaches to ethics that emphasize the role of virtue but also undermines versions of moral cognitivism, because the value of art cannot consist in teaching us about traits that do not exist. We thus recommend a new account of the cognitive value of art: art teaches how context and character interact to produce action...|$|R
