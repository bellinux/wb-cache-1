40|$|Thanks to the {{preponderance}} of various <b>circumvention</b> <b>practices,</b> sporting video culture has fragmented. Because of this we see other interesting trends emerge. Audiences are displaying a negotiable approach to quality when looking to access geoblocked content. New forms of consumption also emerge from these practices, with six-second Vines of goals and amateur edits of highlights uploaded on video hosting platforms, letting people engage with sport in a different way. The use of VPNs also contributes to both a diasporic and at times opportunistic cosmopolitan sporting video culture, with both expats and international audiences watching and in turn 'de-territorialising' sporting content. All of this suggests {{that when it comes}} to locating media sport in the future, we will be addressing a growing selection of distinct but interrelated sites rather that a sole 'official' broadcast. Paradoxically, in the search for access to official broadcasts, sports fans have conjured up an emergent petri dish of sporting video cultures - ripe for further study...|$|E
40|$|This aims {{to present}} the early {{implementation}} of DDI 2. 5 in the French initiative of qualitative data bank named beQuali. We will discuss the limits of DDI for documenting qualitative survey {{when it comes to}} describe methodological context, materials themselves and their arborescent archivistic ordering. We have fitted DDI following <b>circumvention</b> <b>practices</b> already established and supplemented it with other standards to reach our needs : document all the specificities of our materials, interplay with archiving technologies and digitisation process, data dissemination and harvesting. Indeed none of the existing metadatas formats (DDI, EAD, PREMIS, METS) can handle the granularity of each purpose : qualitative dataset description, archivistic arborescent materials ordering, preservation metadata and compound object aggregation. For simplicity and performance we had to design an in-house metadata format named MetaJSON that acts as a pivot or switchboard between imported or disseminated ones. We are now developing an open source tool that edits and crosswalks this internal format with others. This tool would be designed to help researchers for deposing data and help us to process materials for archiving and dissemination...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} Edward Snowden’s global {{surveillance}} disclosures, {{this article examines}} news discourses about online communication security and surveillance <b>circumvention</b> <b>practices.</b> It analyses 1249 news reports mentioning encryption in The Guardian and The New York Times, covering a three-year period from June 2012 to June 2015 (one year before and {{two years after the}} Snowden revelations). Whilst there was a marked increase in the volume of news articles mentioning encryption post-Snowden, the context in which encryption is discussed has since shifted from an initial emphasis on “surveillance” towards “security” issues. However, the research found that greater news coverage of encryption did not necessarily mean an increase in depth of coverage, with most mentions of encryption vague and non-descript. In terms of source usage, the research finds an emphasis on private corporations in both publications analysed. This is problematic when many of the organisations allowed to speak on encryption were those accused of colluding with the US and UK Governments to aid covert mass surveillance—the likes of Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and so forth—thus providing them with a platform to exonerate themselves from the accusations. This contradictory depiction of communication security serves the status quo and prevents advancement of the “encrypted by default” communication practice called for by Snowden. This, by extension, has serious implications for both journalistic freedom and civil liberties since it helps to perpetuate the ability of nation states and corporations to conduct indiscriminate mass surveillance...|$|E
40|$|This study explores {{outcomes}} {{associated with}} circumvention (i. e., dissenting by going around or above one’s supervisor). Employees completed a survey instrument {{in which they}} provided a dissent account detailing {{a time when they}} <b>practiced</b> <b>circumvention.</b> Several themes regarding relational and organizational outcomes emerged from an interpretive analysis of the data. Circumvention resulted predominantly in relational deterioration with one’s supervisor, but in many cases it led to neutrality, compromise, relationship development, and understanding. Although organizational-level outcomes most often produce results that are favorable for dissenters, they also include triggering agent sanctions, organizational improvement, absence of corrective action, and disadvantageous outcomes for the dissenter...|$|R
