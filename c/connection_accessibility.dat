Logistics and transport system can simultaneously be a promotional factor of the innovation in the regions {{and it can be}} itself the subject to technological and process innovation as well. The logistics system of the islands in Western Estonia is an integral business environment re-integrating institutions with particular functions into a coherent entity reacting flexibly to the changes on the market. The main goals of these entities is to ensure time and spatial profitability of the goods and to increase supplementary value and customer satisfaction. The interaction between the economic development and transportation is quite complex. Transportation improvements may result in the growth in the other sectors, ultimately leading to economic growth, but transportation improvements can also have a negative impact. The aim of the present article is to provide a survey of the regional economic considerations and accessibility factors, as well as an empirical case study involving specific Estonian islands.

In order to achieve compatibility with annotation rules designed for standard written Portuguese, transcribed words were orthographically normalized, and the parsing lexicon augmented with speech-specific material, phonetically spelled abbreviations etc. Using a two-level annotation approach, speech flow markers like overlaps, retractions and non-verbal productions were separated from running, annotatable text. In the absence of punctuation, syntactic segmentation was achieved by exploiting prosodic break markers, enhanced by a rule-based distinctions between pause and break functions. Under optimal conditions, the modified parsing system achieved correctness rates (F-scores) of 98. 6 % for part of speech, 95 % for syntactic function and 99 % for lemmatization.

40|$|JTLU vol 5, no 2, pp 46 - 59 (2012) This paper aims to {{understand}} the spatial variability in house prices and accessibility. The motivation for understanding the <b>connection</b> between <b>accessibility</b> and house prices stems from the increasing attention given {{in recent years to}} the potential for funding transport infrastructure by land value capture policies. Establishing whether there is identifiable land value uplift, and further quantifying this uplift, is a prerequisite to sensible discussions on the potential for land value capture. Although there has been substantial related research in the United States, not only have there been fewer studies in the United Kingdom, but these have concentrated on London. London, as a capital city, differs in many respects from other cities. Large conurbations such as Manchester, Sheffield, and Tyne and Wear are more typical of British cities. This study focuses on the Tyne and Wear area, which has an extensive public transport system, with a light rail system—the Tyne and Wear Metro—forming the backbone of the public transport system. The investigation reported in this paper is underpinned by the use of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) methodology with property prices as the dependent variable, which in turn is explained by independent variables designed to standardize for household features and spatially defined factors including the transport accessibility of the house location. This methodology allows for estimation of the importance of transport accessibility in determining house prices. The empirical results show that, on average, the internal factors of the property and the socioeconomic classification of its location are dominant determinants of property prices, but transport accessibility variables are also significant. However, the local model approach of GWR shows a significant spatially varying relationship between property prices and transport accessibility to be identified. This study contributes to a quantification of the impact of accessibility on house prices. Moreover, the paper demonstrates the application of a relatively new methodology in the transport field that takes account of the spatial nature of the data required in this process...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{extensive}} and well-developed {{body of literature}} {{on the nature of}} faculty work (e. g., Blackburn 2 ̆ 6 Lawrence, 1996; Schuster 2 ̆ 6 Finkelstein, 2006) that has examined numerous aspects of faculty work and sources of influence on that work (e. g., intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, personal characteristics, disciplinary affiliation, institutional type, career stage, collegial relationships, time allocation—among others). Yet, little empirical evidence exists about the relationship between faculty work and the material environment in which faculty engage in their daily professional endeavors. Therefore, this article examines the inter-relationship of faculty work practices and the material environments in which such activities are enacted. Through a case study bounded by 20 social science faculty participants and two social science buildings (Edmunds and Klein Halls, both pseudonyms) at one large research institution in the Northeast, this study interprets the material campus as a technology that both enables and constrains specific elements of faculty work, while also being shaped by the very practices that constitute faculty work. As faculty members work in campus offices, their professional socialization meets the structural design of the buildings in often-contradictory ways. Consequently, as faculty participants negotiate and make sense of their material surroundings in relation to learned work practices, their insights provide administrators and other faculty with key principles and analytic categories to consider in relation to building projects and renovations on their own campuses. In the end, findings from this study point to a specific need to align faculty roles, rewards, and the physical environment of the campus in order to improve faculty work practices and increase faculty connection with their local institution. The two buildings that form the centerpiece of this study were constructed five decades apart, yet were architecturally designed with strikingly similar faculty practices in mind. Both buildings sought to increase collaboration among faculty and students, striving to create material environments that emphasized <b>connection</b> and <b>accessibility</b> over isolation and distance. However, over time, faculty altered the physical characteristics of the older building (Edmunds Hall) in order to reproduce traditional faculty work practices, those activities they were socialized to invoke in the name of efficiency and production. In similar fashion, faculty in the newer building (Klein Hall) saw great promise in its architectural innovations, though they perceived the building as enhancing previously established work practices rather than providing new possibilities for their work. In the end, the findings from this study reveal enduring tensions between the idealized intents of structural design and the realities of institutionalized faculty socialization as well as potential conflicts between localized campus environments and the more global influences of the academic professio...|$|R
40|$|I like {{to think}} of gardens as {{sculpturing}} of space: a beginning and a groping to another level of sculptural experience and use. A total sculptural space experience beyond individual sculptures. A man may enter such a space: it is in scale with him; it is real. ” — Isamu Noguchi, A Sculptor's World, p. 216 Artistic expression of the land has thrived from prehistoric to current times, first as monolithic structures of the ancients, then as figurative sculptures of the Renaissance, and more recently as environmental artworks of contemporary designers. These different artistic expressions, combining art and the land, are also becoming incorporated into modern landscape architecture. This project combines the fields of outdoor sculpture, environmental art, and landscape architecture into a single synthesis of art and design for the land. The purpose of this endeavor was to analyze the interaction of sculptures in and of the land, including sculpture gardens and earthwork projects, with their surrounding landscapes so as to discover the most beneficial design approach to art and land design. In an effort to solve this research problem a variety of methods were employed. First, historical literary references such as John Beardsley's Earthworks and Beyond and other noteworthy sources were examined. Then, current design theories and practices concerning outdoor sculpture display, as exhibited through modern sculpture parks, gardens, and earthworks, were interpreted. Finally, contemporary case studies of modern earthwork projects, including Charles Jencks' Garden of Cosmic Speculation, and urban sculpture gardens, including the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, were analyzed. For the practical applications of this research study, an art park was designed for a site and its surrounding context of downtown Raleigh, the state capitol of North Carolina. Located in the currently redeveloping warehouse district of the southwest edge of downtown, this site also borders a planned light rail line and station that play into the development's plan. This site operates in conjunction with and adjacent to the fledgling Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) of Raleigh, a non-collecting institution promoting art education and collaboration within the community. Using a program established from the needs of the art museum and the city parks department, four basic goals of space, aesthetics, <b>connection,</b> and <b>accessibility</b> led the design of this site. In addition to the land art garden, a cultural arts program, consisting of design elements and features throughout the district, was established for the neighborhood to promote cultural identity, historical heritage, and downtown redevelopment. With a variety of differing spaces and places, this arts garden works with the Contemporary Art Museum of Raleigh to provide a community park that benefits everyone.

40|$|In this {{scientific}} research, in {{the land}} use and transport interaction framework, the type of link (a correlation or causality) between the built environment and the travel behavior has been investigated: the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and travel behavior is taken into account to understand if attitudes and neighborhood preferences influence the residential location choices and travel behavior. It could be useful to examine, whether neighborhood design influences travel behavior or whether travel preferences influence the choice of neighborhood. This could lead {{to better understand the}} effect of the transport policies. A lot of studies (Hansen 1959, Lowry 1964, Nuzzolo 2006, Cao, Mokhtarian and Handy 2008) have verified that a suitable transport planning leads to an urban economics development wellmatched with the land use aims (e. g. Road Pricing, Congestion Charge and Eco-pass). The literature in transport research underlines the tools to catch the energetic sustainable town; these tools can be divided into 2 different objectives: 1) minimize the total travel time on the road network (in other terms shorten home-work distance) 2) maximize the modal split on behalf of public transport. In literature it is still not fully known which are the attitudes for the residential location choice (R. L. C.) and if between these attitudes even the travel preferences are included, and how this influences the R. L. C [...] To investigate if there is a casuality or an effect between the two choices (R. L. C. and Travel choice) a survey in order to calibrate a mixed multinomial logit model in the Rome metropolitan region has been conducted. In the research, after a literature review of the land use transport models, the Experimental Design Theory will be presented and the main effect of a good survey will de discussed. It will be shown how to investigate the problem and which are the main attitudes in travel behavior and residential location choice in Rome. The Fig. 1 marks the sub-area of the land use and transport system and how they are in connection. The cities in Italy are changing according to the decentralization criteria even for the household economic constraint, assuming a feature as different as possible from the old compact urban centre; new roads grow up; the buildings and the blocks are divided by streets of more than two lanes per direction and this gives an increase of the total travel time on the network for the home-work transfer. It’s easy to prove that the residential and activities replacing follows the accessibility increase or decrease. The aim of the paper is to individuate the main attributes of the utility function of the R. L. C. to evaluate the different transport policies measure to build the town to serve with an optimal transport solution. In order to obtain a result {{it will be necessary to}} make a survey on the population with an optimal experimental design - efficient designs - in order to understand the behavior of the 3 millions Roman residents with the minimum sample and with the minimum error. Through the survey it is possible to explore the <b>connections</b> among residential <b>accessibility,</b> employment, income, and auto ownership and it will be possible to focus the attention on the potential discrete choice model which will be able to predict the residential choice function of the different transport policies. A first survey has been made and the first results are useful to calibrate a choice tasks survey through the Experimental Design Theory. Later through the “Biogeme” software, the mixed utility model parameters are calibrated and with the statistical test the validity of the results are estimated. A distribution of the parameters after the calibration with biogeme is shown. For the parameters calibration even the normal, log-normal and Johnson distribution for the latent class are taken into account in order to view the differences between the outputs and underline which distribution better represents the real R.

40|$|Studies of {{connected}} speech {{have repeatedly}} {{shown that the}} contextual predictability of a word is related to its phonetic duration; more predictable words tend to be produced with shorter duration, when other factors are controlled for (Aylett & Turk, 2004, 2006; Bell et al., 2003, 2009; Gahl, 2008). Speaker-oriented accounts of phonetic variation posit that {{the probability of a}} word in its context is related to its accessibility for planning processes (Jurafsky et al., 2001; Bell et al., 2003; Gahl et al., 2012), with greater accessibility giving rise to shorter durations. However, the mechanism by which accessibility relates to phonetic duration has not been fully elaborated. This dissertation presents data relevant for understanding the <b>connection</b> between lexical <b>accessibility</b> and phonetic duration, and it argues that the relevant mechanism rests at the level of phonological encoding. The motivation and interpretation of the studies assume an interactive spreading activation model of speech production (Dell, 1986, 1988) that includes both sequential encoding of phonological segments (Sevald & Dell, 1994) and cascading activation flow. The primary hypothesis is that examining the effects of phonological neighborhood structure on the phonetic duration of words and segments can shed light on the connection between lexical activation and duration. Three experiments are undertaken to better explain the relationship between neighborhood structure and phonetic duration. Experiment 1 pursues a novel word learning study, in which preschool children are taught words that create minimal pair relationships with already known words. The results indicate that the specific phonological relationships between the words in children's lexicons do not have an appreciable effect on articulatory duration. However, the significant effect of phonotactic probability on children's articulation suggests that the relatively great importance of practice effects (at either the phonological or motor level) may have overshadowed any influence of lexical activation. Experiment 2 provides a reanalysis of data from a previous study that found an effect of minimal pair neighbors on phonetic duration in adults' single word productions. Baese-Berk and Goldrick (2009) found that words with a voicing-initial minimal pair neighbor (e. g. "cod", which has a neighbor "god") were produced with longer voice onset time (VOT) than words without such a neighbor (e. g. cop). The reanalysis presented in the dissertation suggests that this effect may not be related to minimal pair status per se, but rather to the number of neighbors in the lexicon that differ in their initial consonant segment. In addition to the findings for VOT, when segmental content is taken into account, words with more total phonological neighbors are produced with shorter rime duration. These findings support the idea that positional overlap between phonologically related neighbors is facilitatory for phonological encoding, with facilitation being reflected in the time to articulate a given segment. Experiment 3 asks whether the results from the study of adult single word productions can be extended to spontaneous speech. An analysis of the Buckeye Corpus of Conversational Speech (Pitt et al., 2007) indicates that they can; monosyllabic English words beginning with voiceless stop consonants are produced with longer VOT when they have relatively more neighbors differing in the initial consonant. The relationship between total neighborhood density and rime duration is not found to be significant, but the numerical pattern is in the predicted direction. To account for the observed relationship between positional phonological overlap and shorter phonetic duration, the Articulate As Soon As Possible Principle (AASAPP) is proposed. The AASAPP posits that the articulatory plan for a given segment is initiated and executed as quickly as possible, and that the time course for the production plan is related to the activation level of the target segment at the time of selection. Positional competition between co-activated segments is argued to be associated with longer articulatory duration because it slows the process of phonological encoding, while positional overlap is associated with the facilitation of encoding and therefore, articulation...|$|R
