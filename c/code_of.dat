40|$|Manuscript Type: Empirical. Research Question/ Issue: <b>Codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics {{contain a}} set of rules of conduct and {{corporate}} principles concerning the responsibility to stakeholders and shareholders, which help guide corporate and employees' behavior, and they constitute verifiable elements of social responsibility. Given the growing concern for social responsibility and for the relationship with external stakeholders, which has become an undeniable social demand, we think that the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> the most respectable and admired companies should reflect this trend. This study looks into the Most Admired Companies of the World ranked by Fortune magazine in 2009 to find out if their <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics exhibit greater emphasis on social responsibility and strong implementation processes, and whether they could be considered <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> the third generation. Stohl et al. (2009) suggest that the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics of the most advanced companies should evolve to the third generation ethics', which focuses on the long-term perspective and on the global, social and environmental aspects of corporate responsibility sensibility. Research Findings/Insight: Our results show that the <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics of the 2009 Most Admired Companies of the World resemble <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> conduct rather than strictly <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics or <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> corporate social responsibility.

This study used a sample of 613 management accountants drawn from the United States to study the relationship between corporate and professional <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics and employee attitudes and behaviors. The presence <b>of</b> corporate <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics was associated with less perceived wrongdoing in organizations, but not with an increased propen-sity to report observed unethical behavior. Further, organizations that adopted formal <b>codes</b> <b>of</b> ethics exhibited value orientations that went beyond finan-cial performance to include responsibility to the com-monweal.
