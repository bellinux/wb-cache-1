40|$|Rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic of {{long-term}} care – is organizational integration the answer? Since 1997 the British government has actively promoted collaboration between health and social care services, culminating in proposals for fully integrated health and social care organizations – called Care Trusts – to address problems in co-ordinating services for older people. This paper draws on historical evidence to examine the origins and develop-ment of these difficulties. A consistent theme over the past 50 {{years has been the}} changing role of health services in the provision {{of long-term}} support for older people and the consequent redefinition of the bound-aries between health and social services. However, these changes have largely not been matched by corresponding transfers of resources that might enable social services to meet their increased responsibilities. Moreover, the demands of the acute hospital sector risk marginalizing the social support valued by older people themselves. The paper argues that organizational restructuring will therefore fail to improve co-ordination between health and social services for older people unless these underlying issues are also addressed. Key words: <b>co-ordination,</b> <b>funding,</b> health and social care, older peopl...|$|R

40|$|Any {{investigation}} of environmental processes related to chemical substances or their effects depends on reliable, comparable analytical data. This also {{holds true for}} the impact of climate change on occurrence, distribution and effects of emerging pollutants, with respect to which there is particular concern regarding the reliability of analytical data, due to lack of harmonization in method validation and requirements for quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC). We present a recent European approach to developing a harmonized framework for method validation, QA/QC and provision of environmental data on emerging pollutants. The validation approach has been tested and improved by three case studies. We outline the main concept of the validation approach as well as the results of the case studies. This European validation framework {{turned out to be a}} feasible tool to check the fitness for purpose of analytical methods and to improve the reliability of environmental analytical data, particularly for emerging pollutants. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

First, nine principles are discussed which we first identified to guide mental health service organisation, and all of which can be potentially applied to long term care as well (autonomy, continuity, effectiveness, accessibility, comprehensiveness, equity, accountability, co-ordination, and efficiency). Second, we have outlined innovative operational aspects of service user participation, many of which were first initiated and consolidated in the mental health field, and some of which are now also being implemented in long term care (including case management, and crisis plans).

40|$|Effective {{biodiversity}} monitoring {{is critical}} to evaluate, learn from, and ultimately improve conservation practice. Well conceived, designed and implemented monitoring of biodiversity should: (i) deliver information on trends in key aspects of biodiversity (e. g. population changes); (ii) provide early warning of problems {{that might otherwise be}} difficult or expensive to reverse; (iii) generate quantifiable evidence of conservation successes (e. g. species recovery following management) and conservation failures; (iv) highlight ways to make management more effective; and (v) provide information on return on conservation investment. The importance of effective biodiversity monitoring is widely recognized (e. g. Australian Biodiversity Strategy). Yet, while everyone thinks biodiversity monitoring is a good idea, this has not translated into a culture of sound biodiversity monitoring, or widespread use of monitoring data. We identify four barriers to more effective biodiversity monitoring in Australia. These are: (i) many conservation programmes have poorly articulated or vague objectives against which it is difficult to measure progress contributing to design and implementation problems; (ii) the case for long-term and sustained biodiversity monitoring is often poorly developed and/or articulated; (iii) there is often a lack of appropriate institutional support, <b>co-ordination,</b> and targeted <b>funding</b> for biodiversity monitoring; and (iv) there is often a lack of appropriate standards to guide monitoring activities and make data available from these programmes. To deal with these issues, we suggest that policy makers, resource managers and scientists better and more explicitly articulate the objectives of biodiversity monitoring and better demonstrate the case for greater investments in biodiversitymonitoring. There is an urgent need for improved institutional support for biodiversity monitoring in Australia, for improved monitoring standards, and for improved archiving of, and access to, monitoring data. We suggest that more strategic financial, institutional and intellectual investments in monitoring will lead to more efficient use of the resources available for biodiversity conservation and ultimately better conservation outcomes. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the social role of local {{cultural}} institutions {{of all kinds}} has changed. A shift {{from the use of}} information on traditional paper-based carriers to electronic formats has takenplace. The implementation of technology has brought about the modernisation of basic work processes and widened the range of services and channels of access. There is closer intra- and interdomain co-operation both at national and international level. It is no longer easy to draw clear boundaries between archives, libraries and museums in terms of digital content provision. Memory institutions such as libraries, museums and archives are adjusting themselves to the digital age. Web-based services have been expanded, remote use of online catalogues and the accessibility of digitised heritage have all been improved. The task now is to create and promote new services which reach and motivate more people. New services require new tools, many of them ICT-based – and above all a new attitude. CALIMERA (Cultural Applications: Local Institutions Mediating Electronics Resource Access) <b>Co-ordination</b> Action, <b>funded</b> under Information Society Technologies Sixth Framework Programme has set out to help ordinary citizens right across Europe to join e-Europe through the digital services provided by their local cultural institutions. CALIMERA has continued to contribute to the sharing of best practice, producing guidelines and roadmaps with a special focus of local archives and museums and addressing the needs of the end user. The aim of CALIMERA Best Practice Guidelines is to provide policy makers and professionals working in cultural institutions at the local level with a concise and relevant summary {{of the state of the}} art in the use of new technologies. These Guidelines are intended to explain in a readable way how these technologies can be deployed to develop digital services designed to meet real user needs – social, cultural and economics – to stimulate wider take-up and creativity among the professional community. They are also intended to support a clearer understanding of the way in which local cultural services can play a key role in the fulfilment of major policy goals in Europe,including those of the e-Europe Action Plan. There are 23 separate Guidelines in all structured as three main roups covering Social, Management and Technical issues. Life-long learning, social disjuncture, cultural diversity, egovernment,social and economical development are the main problems discussed in the Social Policy Guidelines. In Management Guidelines one can meet the same problems discussed form another point. Strategic planning, co-operation and partnership, business models, new challenges forthe employees, activity and evaluation, legal and juridical aspects are tightly connected to the problems mentioned above and can help successfully resolve them. Technical aspects of resolving the problems are described in the third part – Technological Guidelines. Each section of the Guidelines ends up with the list of references to the library, museums and archives as well as other cultural and political organizations best practice examples from all over the world...|$|R
40|$|This article aims to {{investigate}} {{some aspects of}} the social process related to water resources management and gender relations. Given that gender and water management are interrelated issues exposed to a growing attention at the international level, it is therefore necessary to identify relations between the academic literature, the institutional framework and the field-based research. This document has been inspired by the Nostrum DSS project (Network on Governance, Science and Technology for Sustainable Water Resources Management in the Mediterranean), a <b>Co-ordination</b> Action <b>funded</b> by the European Commission, which involves eighteen partners from the North and South shores of the basin. As the scope of the project is to disseminate Best Practice Guidelines for the design and implementation of Decision Support System tools (DSS) to identify optimal water resources management regimes, this article is proposing an analysis of a particular geographical and social frame related to the social actors involved in the project, but there are no connections between the paper and the project itself. To create a network between science, policy and civil society {{is one of the main}} objectives of the project in order to reach an improved governance and planning in the field of sustainable water management. Therefore, {{to investigate}} gender sensitivity in some areas of the basin shall provide a clue. This overview of academic and institutional background refers to a particular geographical and cultural area, the Middle Eastern and North African region. In the first section lies the theoretical background, that has been extrapolated from international organisations guidelines and scholars 9 ̆ 2 publications. The second section is specifically focused on the Egyptian geographical context. The first paragraph presents a review of the guidelines suggested by international organisations related to policies on gender and water, as parts of the changes that the global scenario has recently been facing, with the shift from the micro level to the macro level. The second paragraph then describes the side effects of these overspread trends, which are identified in their missing relations with the social context of the intervention. The third and fourth paragraphs introduce the issue of women 9 ̆ 2 s role in water management in the Middle Eastern and North African Regions, while highlighting relations between women 9 ̆ 2 s involvement in the public sphere and the role they cover in local communities organisations. The proportion of the political representation faced by women in this region is also discussed, tackling their overspread participation in agriculture and their unrecognised working status. The fifth paragraph of this paper will discuss a case study in Egypt, concerning an initiative promoted by international donors and the government aimed at increasing community participation in the design and management of irrigation canals. The case study gives a concrete sample to discuss plusses and problems of women 9 ̆ 2 s participation in water users organisations, synthesising many of the theoretical issues that have been raised in the first three parts of this article...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{government}} has identified {{the need to}} transform the South African economy from one that is primarily resource based to one that is knowledge-based and has formulated a 10 year plan {{in order to accomplish}} this objective. The plan involves the creation and funding of five theme-specific consortium-based centres of competence that focus on the five top national health priorities, linked to the growth of the local pharmaceutical industry. This research study proposed that if collaboration and communication between academic researchers and the biotechnology industry in South Africa was improved it would lead to an increase in the development of innovative products for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. The objective of the study was the development of a strategy for a centre of competence for HIV research and development that brings together academic researchers and industry in a public private partnership and that will enable the proposal to be tested. Centre of competence programmes in both developed and developing countries, including Sweden, Austria and Estonia, were reviewed. The success factors for the various programmes were discussed. The strategic planning analysis began by considering the mandate of the CoC for HIV R&D. The requirements and expectations of the DST in establishment of the centres of competence were examined. An analysis of the external environment relevant to the South African biotechnology industry was then performed. This involved a detailed macro-environmental analysis in which political, economic, social, technological and environmental factors were considered. It was followed by an analysis of the current biotechnology industry in South Africa. The industry’s dominant economic features were identified as were its future driving forces. In a competitive environment analysis the South African biotechnology industry was found to be extremely competitive. Two industry issues, price controls and access to capital, were identified and discussed. The industry key success factors identified included access to large and sustained capital, attracting and retaining talented employees, an efficient and high quality regulatory authority, continued government support, productive and appropriate partnerships and skilled intellectual property management. An internal environment analysis was performed which identified competencies and resource strengths of the CoC for HIV R&D, including the high level of academic research in the HIV/AIDS field and expertise in clinical trials of HIV/AIDS products. Competitive deficiencies and resource weaknesses identified included shortages of skills and talent and the lack of <b>co-ordination</b> for <b>funding</b> of HIV/AIDS research. The analysis of the internal environment continued with the examination of the internal value chain of the CoC for HIV R&D. This consisted of discovery, pre-clinical development and clinical development stages. Gaps in the value chain were identified, including the lack of facilities for high-throughput screening of compounds for anti-HIV activity, lack of pre-clinical testing facilities and lack of manufacturing plants capable of producing products for use in clinical trials. The results of the external and internal environment analysis were used in a SWOC analysis and a number of strategies were identified to capitalise on opportunities and to address challenges. A subsequent competitive strength assessment identified a competitive advantage {{in the formation of the}} CoC for HIV R&D. In addition a number of strategic issues facing the centre were identified and ways to address or manage the issues were proposed. The strategic planning process was completed by the selection of a strategic approach for the CoC for HIV R&D. The study concluded that a PPP of public and private organisations operating under a corporate strategy of related diversification developed and implemented by the CoC for HIV R&D, would be suitable for testing the Proposal. The study’s conclusion also highlighted the need to ensure that the CoC for HIV R&D receives a long term commitment of funding from public sources, and that is managed by an experienced team with strong leadership skills. Important strategies emerging from the study and specifically from the SWOC analysis were development of a national HIV research plan and funding of the highest priority projects; focusing research funding on research with greatest potential for generation of HIV/AIDS products; and establishment of new technology platforms to fill gaps in the value chain. Finally, a number of recommendations were made for implementation of the results of this study or as the basis for further study...|$|R
