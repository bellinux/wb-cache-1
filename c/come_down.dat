5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us {{under the}} name of Hyginus. It begins with the oxhide story of Orion's birth, which this source ascribes to Callimachus and Aristomachus, and sets the location at Thebes or Chios. Hyginus has two versions. In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the mountain, Holley and others in the {{afternoon}} saw E Company men <b>come</b> <b>down</b> from the top and, later, men from the engineer company. Each group thought it was the last of the survivors and told confused, conflicting stories. When all remaining members of D Company had been assembled, Holley found that the company had suffered 50 percent casualties; 18 men were wounded and 30 were missing in action.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode half again longer {{than it was in}} the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E

5|$|Males {{and females}} prefer {{different}} foraging sites. While males usually hover among the higher shrub foliage between , females tend to forage at lower strata.

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of the British landing force then {{separated from the}} main body and seized a third battery named laNeuf, routing a force of local militia that attempted to block their advance with artillery assistance from the British squadron in the bay. The militia had <b>come</b> <b>down</b> from their garrisons in the surrounding hills and been joined by 110 French soldiers who had disembarked from Caroline, but the small French force was easily brushed aside by the British landing party. Keating and Willoughby then destroyed the guns {{in the first two}} captured batteries and stormed the remaining two fortifications, once again capturing them and using their own cannon to fire on the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not <b>come</b> <b>down.</b> Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended during high winds or heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, it was rumoured that Prince Charles Edward Stuart {{and some}} of his senior Jacobite aides had escaped to St Kilda. An {{expedition}} was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When they were persuaded to <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the Prince and had never heard of King George II either. Paradoxically, Lady Grange's letters and her resultant evacuation from the island may have prevented her being found by this expedition.|$|E

He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us.|$|E
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E

5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a language that is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> from the pre-migration era.|$|E
5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to us, {{there is no doubt}} that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rooney {{investigates the}} Bueller home {{to try to}} prove Ferris' truancy, getting into several pratfalls. At the same time, Jeannie, {{frustrated}} that the entire school believes Ferris has <b>come</b> <b>down</b> with a deathly illness, skips class and returns home to confront him, only to hear someone outside trying to break-in. Rooney flees while she calls the police; when they arrive, they arrest her for filing a false report, and contact her mother to collect her. While waiting, she meets a juvenile delinquent, who advises her not to worry so much about Ferris. Mrs. Bueller arrives at the station, upset about having to forgo a house sale, only to find Jeannie kissing the delinquent, infuriating her more.|$|E
