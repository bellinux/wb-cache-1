30|$|For the ring/liner conjunction, well-designed surface {{texturing}} {{has been}} regarded as a potential means to improve its tribological performance, {{as well as the}} application of coating. However, so far most researchers focused on the one of these aspects. In this study, the combined effect of coating and texturing on the performance of ring/liner conjunction is numerically investigated. A thermal mixed lubrication model is presented. The effects of the <b>coating’s</b> thermal and mechanical properties on the tribological performance are studied under the cold and warm engine operating conditions. Along with the increasing coating thickness, the effects of the <b>coating’s</b> thermal properties on friction loss are found to be significant, as well as the effects of the <b>coating’s</b> mechanical properties. It is also found that a soft coating with a lower thermal inertia has a greater ability to reduce the friction loss of the textured conjunction.|$|R
40|$|THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ANTICORROSIVE PROPERTIES OF RED MUD AS A BYPRODUCT OF THE BAYER PROCESS. THE RED MUD (270 - 440 MESH) WAS ADDED AS A PIGMENT IN AN EPOXY CARRIER AND IN CHLORINATED RUBBER. THE CORROSION OF STEEL SPECIMENS WAS INVESTIGATED IN A SIMULATED MARINE ENVIRONMENTAT 30 C DEGREES AND ATMOS. PRESSURE. THE ANTICORROSION PROTECTION WAS PERFORMED APPLYING CATHODIC VOLTAGE IN THE RANGE - 600 TO 950 MV (VS SCE) AND/OR <b>COATING</b> THE SPECIMENS WITH ANTICORROSIVE COMPOUNDS. THE CORROSION RATE WAS MEASURENT BY THE MASS REDUCTION OF THE SPECIMENS. INCREASED ADDITION OF RED MUD IN THE EPOXY OR CHLORINATED RUBBER <b>COATING</b> PROVIDES INCREASED STEEL CORROSION PROTECTION ONLY WITH THE SIMULTANEOUS APPLICATION OF CATHODIC VOLTAGE. THEREFORE THE EFFECTIVE USE OF RED MUD AS A PIGMENT IN AN ANTICORROSIVE <b>COATING</b> FOR STEEL PROTECTION DEMANDS THE SIMULTANEOUS APPLICATION OF CATHODIC PROTECTION, OTHERWISE, STEEL CORROSION IS ACCELERATED. ...|$|R

40|$|Augmentation of the {{internal}} software of a commercial x-ray fluorescence gauge is shown to enable the instrument to extend its continuous on-line real-time measurements of a galvanneal <b>coating's</b> total elemental content to encompass similar measurements of the relative thickness of the <b>coating's</b> three principal metallurgical phases.

The empirical basis for the numerics embedded in the software's decision logic is presented. The performance of the augmented gauge is validated by comparing the gauge-implied real-time phase distribution with the phase distribution independently measured off-line on time-tagged samples drawn from the galvanneal production line where the measurement gauge had been installed. The performance validation is shown to demonstrate good agreement between the gauge and laboratory measurements and to suggest preferred approaches to be followed in future applications of the augmented gauge...|$|R

25|$|The {{second class}} of {{non-toxic}} anti-fouling <b>coatings</b> are hydrophilic <b>coatings.</b> They rely on high amounts of hydration {{in order to}} increase the energetic penalty of removing water for proteins and microorganisms to attach. The most common examples of these <b>coatings</b> are based on highly hydrated zwitterions, such as glycine betaine and sulfobetaine. These <b>coatings</b> are also low-friction, but are considered by some to be superior to hydrophobic surfaces because they prevent bacteria attachment, preventing biofilm formation.

40|$|In this paper, {{interfacial}} {{stress analysis}} for a brittle coating/ductile substrate system, which {{is involved in}} a sliding contact with a rigid ball, is presented. By combining interface mechanics theory and the image point method, stress and displacement responses within a coated material for normal load, tangential load, and thermal load are obtained; further, the Green’s functions are established. The effects of coating thickness, friction coefficient, and a <b>coating’s</b> thermoelastic properties on the interfacial shear stress, τxz, and transverse stress, σxx, distributions are discussed in detail. A phenomenon, where interfacial shear stress tends to be relieved by frictional heating, is found {{in the case of a}} coating material’s thermal expansion coefficient being less than a substrate material’s thermal expansion coefficient. Additionally, numerical results show that distribution of interfacial stress can be altered and, therefore, interfacial damage can be modified by adjusting a <b>coating’s</b> structural parameters and thermoelastic properties...|$|R

The structure of the coating was analysed using SEM, EDAX, XRD, AFM and TEM. Nano indentation measurements were used for analysing mechanical properties; the <b>coating’s</b> performance was evaluated during the milling of a titanium alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V). The TiN film was initially deposited to improve adhesion between coating and substrate, where columnar grains {{ranging in size from}} 200 to 500 nm were observed having NaCl-type struc-ture. μ-AlTiN grain growth was also columnar but had ~ 50 nm grain size. The μ-AlTiN coated tool life was compared to an uncoated tool to determine the <b>coating’s</b> influence during Ti 6 Al 4 V milling. The μ-AlTiN coating improved tool life by 100 % compared to that of an uncoated tool due to aluminium oxide and TiC formation on the surface and a decrease in friction coefficient between the chip and the tool...|$|R
