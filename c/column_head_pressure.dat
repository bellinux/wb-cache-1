40|$|In gas {{chromatography}} (GC) reproducible retention times {{are in many}} cases highly favorable {{or in some cases}} even required. In one-dimensional GC, retention time shifts can be eliminated or minimized using a procedure called retention time locking (RTL). This procedure is based on adjusting the (constant) <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure.</b> Unfortunately, this RTL procedure cannot be used in comprehensive two-dimensional {{gas chromatography}} (GC × GC) given the fact that peaks will shift in both dimensions. Adjusting the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> in GC × GC will only minimize or eliminate the primary retention time shifts. In this paper, a fast and easy to perform, two-step retention time locking procedure for two-dimensional gas chromatography (2 D-RTL) is proposed and its feasibility is demonstrated. This 2 D-RTL procedure involves adjustment of the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> or constant column flow, followed by the adjustment of the so-called effective secondary column length. The secondary column length is increased or decreased, simply by moving it stepwise through the modulator. It is demonstrated that retention time shifts in both the primary- and secondary-dimension, which may occur after e. g. replacing the column set, can be minimized to less than half peak base width. The proposed 2 D-RTL procedure is used successfully for approximately 1 year in our laboratory...|$|E

Gas chromatographic analysis was performed using an Agilent 6890 Series GC System gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a splitless injector for a low background with an injector liner split/splitless under a <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> of 12.5 psi and H 2 as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 300 °Cat 5 °C/min. Injector and detector temperatures were 250 °C. A capillary column DB 5 -MS fused-silica J&W Scientific Inc. (Krackeler Scientific, Inc., Albany, NY) (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.; 0.25 μm film) was used. Detection was carried out with a 5973 mass-selective single quadrupole detector (Agilent technologies). Operation control and the data process were carried out by Agilent Technologies ChemStation software. The mass spectrometer was calibrated before use with perfluorotributylamine as a calibration standard.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of foods, fl avors and {{fragrances}} {{is commonly}} done by capillary gas chromatography coupled {{to a range}} of de-tectors depending on the particular needs of the analysis. Using Retention Time Locked (RTL) methods can facilitate the transfer from one instrument to another, particularly if different detectors (eg. MSD and FID) are used. Although liquid or headspace injection methods are of-ten used for these analyses, diffi cult and time-consuming sample preparation steps, or lack of sensitivity are com-monly encountered. Automated Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) or Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) can often provide substantial improvements to existing methods. In this contribution, we illustrate the use of RTL methods and the Agilent RTL Flavor Library when the GERSTEL MPS 2 autosampler is used to automate either SPME or SBSE as sample extraction and introduction technique. Procedures are given for calibrating the GC method using AN/ 2003 / 07 - 2 either technique. RTL methods created for both sample introduction techniques could be moved from a GC-FID to a GC-MSD system with different <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> requirements. Calibrated RTL SPME or SBSE methods were then used to analyze several sample types that otherwise would pose signifi cant matrix interference or detection limit issues. Example chromatograms with identifi ca-tions based on the RTL fl avor library are given...|$|E
40|$|A microscale, {{variable}} flow, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization source {{has been}} coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer {{and used to}} analyze both simple and complex protein mixtures. By using an analytical technique described as “peak parking,” the sample analysis times for components eluting from a liquid Chromatograph can be greatly increased without sacrificing Chromatographic resolution. This was achieved by instantaneously reducing the <b>column</b> <b>head</b> <b>pressure</b> (and hence, flowrate) under peaks of interest to prolong their elution from the tip. With the technique, {{it is possible to}} perform manual parent ion selection, higher resolution narrow mass range scans, and multiple stages of tandem mass spectrometry (MS 2 and MS 3) {{within the context of a}} single eluting peak. Benefits normally associated with an off-line tandem mass spectrometry analysis, such as the optimization of collision induced dissociation parameters and the analysis of more than one charge state, can now be obtained with the increased sensitivity and selectivity afforded by the chromatography. The utility of this method for the comprehensive analysis of complex mixtures was illustrated with the analysis of an in-gel protein digest mixture derived from a single spot from a two-dimensional electrophoresis gel. In addition to the expected enzyme digestion products, other peptides derived from nonspecific cleavage by the enzyme and protein impurities, as well as those having oxidized, derivatized, or deamidated amino acid residues were fully characterized...|$|E

In his original 1669 edition, the columns were placed on two successive pages (15-16) forming six short columns, three columns of seven names each (headed Carver, Samuel Fuller, and Edward Tilley) {{on the first page}} and three columns of seven, seven, and six names each (headed Turner, Priest, and Clarke) on the next page. In the second (1721) and third (1772) editions, the six short columns were joined into three long columns of 14, 14, and 13 names each on a single page (20). The first and fourth short columns were joined into the first long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Carver with Turner halfway down), the second and fifth short columns were joined into the second long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Samuel Fuller with Priest halfway down), and the third and sixth short columns were joined into the third long <b>column</b> (<b>headed</b> Edward Tilley with Clarke halfway down), changing their order.
