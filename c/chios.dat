5|$|Martino Zaccaria was a {{scion of}} the Genoese Zaccaria family. Through his father, Nicolino Zaccaria, {{he was a}} nephew to Benedetto I Zaccaria, lord of <b>Chios</b> and of Phocaea on the Anatolian coast. Benedetto I had {{captured}} <b>Chios</b> from the Byzantine Empire in 1304, citing the island's vulnerability to Turkish raids. His occupation was acknowledged by the impotent Byzantine emperor, Andronikos II Palaiologos, initially {{for a period of}} 10 years, but which was then renewed at five-year intervals. Benedetto died in 1307 and was succeeded in <b>Chios</b> by his son, Paleologo Zaccaria. When he died childless in 1314, the island passed to Martino and his brother, Benedetto II. <b>Chios</b> was a small but wealthy domain, with an annual income of 120,000 gold hyperpyra. Over the next few years, Martino made it the core of a small realm encompassing several islands off the shore of Asia Minor, including Samos and Kos.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{estimates}} that the isle of <b>Chios</b> had proportionally {{the largest number of}} slaves.|$|E
5|$|After this battle, the Rhodian admirals {{decided to}} leave <b>Chios</b> and sail back home. On {{the way back to}} Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he {{received}} at <b>Chios,</b> but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus on the shore of Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone.|$|E

50|$|Former {{editions of}} the <b>CHIO</b> Rotterdam were held in June. In 2011, also the European Dressage Championship was held on the <b>CHIO</b> area. Because of this, the 2011 <b>CHIO</b> Rotterdam was held {{one week after the}} European Dressage Championship (August 25, 2011 and June 28, 2011) without {{dressage}} competitions. The main sponsor of the 2011 <b>CHIO</b> Rotterdam horse show was the Rabobank.|$|R
5|$|Only {{the large}} Chian navy {{seems to have}} stood their ground, perhaps {{accompanied}} by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties. Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to <b>Chios,</b> thereby ending the battle.|$|E
5|$|If these {{ties to the}} Latin Emperor {{provoked}} displeasure at the Byzantine court, for {{the time}} being relations remained good: the lease of <b>Chios</b> was renewed in 1324, and in 1327 Martino took part in alliance negotiations between the Byzantines and the Republic of Venice. At the same time, however, Martino's behaviour became increasingly assertive: ca. 1325 he ousted his brother as co-ruler of <b>Chios</b> and began minting coins in his own name. In 1328, the rise of a new and energetic emperor, Andronikos III Palaiologos, to the Byzantine throne, marked a turning-point in relations. One of the leading Chian nobles, Leo Kalothetos, went to meet the new emperor and his chief minister, John Kantakouzenos, to propose a reconquest of the island. Andronikos III readily agreed. On the pretext of Martino's unauthorized building of a new fortress on the island, the emperor sent him a letter in which he ordered him to cease construction, and to present himself in Constantinople in the next year in order to renew the island's lease. Martino haughtily rejected the demands and accelerated construction, but now his deposed brother Benedetto lodged a complaint with the emperor claiming the one-half share of the island's revenues that was his due. With these events as an excuse, in autumn 1329 Andronikos III assembled a fleet of 105 vessels—including the forces of the Latin Duke of Naxos, Nicholas I Sanudo—and sailed to <b>Chios.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prevented by {{the treaty}} of Phoenice from {{expansion}} in the east, Philip set out to extend his power in the Aegean and in Asia Minor. In the spring of 201BC he took Samos and the Egyptian fleet stationed there. He then besieged <b>Chios</b> to the north. These events caused Attalus, allied with Rhodes, Byzantium and Cyzicus, to enter the war. A large naval battle occurred in the strait between <b>Chios</b> and the mainland, just southwest of Erythrae. According to Polybius, fifty-three decked warships and over {{one hundred and fifty}} smaller warships, took part on the Macedonian side, with sixty-five decked warships and a number of smaller warships on the allied side. During the battle Attalus, having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip, was forced to run his three ships ashore, narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships, causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder.|$|E

5|$|Several ancient sources mention Sophocles' {{homosexuality}} or bisexuality. Athenaios {{reported that}} Sophocles loved boys like Euripides loved women.

5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, he seems to have {{appointed}} himself as leader of the resistance against Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to <b>Chios.</b> The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Another {{narrative}} on the constellations, three paragraphs long, {{is from a}} Latin writer whose brief notes {{have come}} down to us {{under the name of}} Hyginus.

In one of them he omits Poseidon; a modern critic suggests this is the original version.|$|E
50|$|<b>Chio</b> Min Secondary School was {{established}} in 1957, which extended from <b>Chio</b> Min Primary School, established on 10 May 1918. In 1942, the <b>Chio</b> Min School had to be closed due to the Japanese invasion. It reopened in 1945. In 1948, {{the number of students}} increased to 600 people and there were 100 students studying at night. Night class closed in 1963. In 1957, two new buildings were constructed and <b>Chio</b> Min Secondary School was started. In 1958, the Primary School was renamed <b>Chio</b> Min <b>Chio</b> Min Primary School A and School B. In 1964, the government issued a total of RM40,000 to build nine new classrooms. Prior to that, in South Kedah there were no Chinese secondary schools for Chinese primary school students to further their studies. Therefore, some people had set up a committee to collect donations from the public to build a new building with 30 classrooms. At that time, the school was located in the Klang Sago, Kulim, Kedah.|$|R

5|$|Catholic {{communities}} were already established in Greece since the 13th century (Athens, Cyclades, <b>Chios,</b> Crete). Jewish communities also {{existed in the}} country, those arriving after the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492) joining the earlier Romaniotes, Jews who had been living there since the times of Apostle Paul. Muslim families were still living in Greece during Otto's reign, since hostility was mainly against the Ottoman state and its depressive mechanisms and not against Muslim people.|$|E
5|$|From ca. 1088 on, he {{used his}} base at Smyrna to wage war against the Byzantines. Employing Christian craftsmen, he built a fleet, with which he {{captured}} Phocaea and the eastern Aegean islands of Lesbos (except for the fortress of Methymna), Samos, <b>Chios</b> and Rhodes. A Byzantine fleet under Niketas Kastamonites was sent against him, but Tzachas defeated it in battle. Some modern scholars have speculated that his activities during this time {{may have been in}} conjunction, and perhaps even coordination, with two contemporary Byzantine Greek rebels, Rhapsomates in Cyprus, and Karykes in Crete.|$|E
5|$|In 1090/91, the Byzantines under Constantine Dalassenos {{recovered}} <b>Chios.</b> Undeterred, Tzachas rebuilt his forces, {{and resumed}} his attacks, even proclaiming himself emperor (basileus) and seeking to conclude an alliance against Alexios I with the Pechenegs in Thrace for a joint attack on Constantinople. In 1092, Dalassenos {{and the new}} megas doux, John Doukas, were sent against Tzachas, and attacked the fortress of Mytilene on Lesbos. Tzachas resisted for three months, but finally had to negotiate a surrender of the fortress. During his return to Smyrna, Dalassenos attacked the Turkish fleet, which was almost destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The Aetolian League {{concluded}} {{a peace agreement}} with PhilipV in 206BC, and the Roman Republic negotiated the Treaty of Phoenice in 205BC, ending the war and allowing the Macedonians to retain some captured settlements in Illyria. Although the Romans rejected an Aetolian request in 202BC for Rome to declare war on Macedonia once again, the Roman Senate gave serious consideration to the similar offer made by Pergamon and its ally Rhodes in 201BC. These states were concerned about PhilipV's alliance with Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire, which invaded the war-weary and financially exhausted Ptolemaic Empire in the Fifth Syrian War (202–195BC) as PhilipV captured Ptolemaic settlements in the Aegean Sea. Although Rome's envoys {{played a critical role}} in convincing Athens to join the anti-Macedonian alliance with Pergamon and Rhodes in 200BC, the comitia centuriata (people's assembly) rejected the Roman Senate's proposal for a declaration of war on Macedonia. Meanwhile, PhilipV conquered territories in the Hellespont and Bosporus as well as Ptolemaic Samos, which led Rhodes to form an alliance with Pergamon, Byzantium, Cyzicus, and <b>Chios</b> against Macedonia. Despite PhilipV's nominal alliance with the Seleucid king, he lost the naval Battle of <b>Chios</b> in 201BC and was blockaded at Bargylia by the Rhodian and Pergamene navies.|$|E
5|$|The Persian fleet was duly {{assembled}} {{in the spring of}} 499 BC, and sailed to Ionia. Artaphernes put his (and Darius's) cousin Megabates in charge of the expedition, and dispatched him to Miletus with the Persian army. They were joined there by Aristagoras and the Milesian forces, and then embarked and set sail. In order to avoid warning the Naxians, the fleet initially sailed north, towards the Hellespont, but when they arrived at <b>Chios</b> they doubled back and headed south for Naxos.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of manumission is confirmed to have existed in <b>Chios</b> from the 6th century BC. It probably {{dates back to}} an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the theatre or before a public tribunal. This practice was outlawed in Athens {{in the middle of}} the 6th century BC to avoid public disorder.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{sources tell}} several {{different}} stories about Orion; {{there are two}} major versions of his birth and several versions of his death. The most important recorded episodes are his birth somewhere in Boeotia, his visit to <b>Chios</b> where he met Merope and after he violated her, was blinded by her father, Oenopion, the recovery of his sight at Lemnos, his hunting with Artemis on Crete, his death by the bow of Artemis or the sting of the giant scorpion which became Scorpio, and his elevation to the heavens. Most ancient sources omit some of these episodes and several tell only one. These various incidents may originally have been independent, unrelated stories and it is impossible to tell whether omissions are simple brevity or represent a real disagreement.|$|E
