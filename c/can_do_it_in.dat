[...] The fatwā declared that [...] "the ruling to kill the Americans and their allies– civilians and military– is an individual duty for every Muslim who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque of Mecca from their grip, and in order for their [...] armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim." ...|$|E

I consult also [...] an author in Malay language so that I <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> proper Malay language but not too deep and not too difficult." [...] Summing up his philosophy when composing the anthem, Zubir cited the Malay proverb [...] "Di mana bumi dipijak, di situ langit dijunjung" [...] ("You should hold up the sky of the land where you live").|$|E
500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E

500|$|Žigić played {{regularly}} {{through the}} 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign under {{the management of}} Radomir Antić, contributing three goals and partnering former Red Star teammate Marko Pantelić as Serbia qualified for a major tournament {{for the first time}} as an independent nation. Ahead of the tournament proper, he spoke in positive terms of his development since 2006: [...] "I went to Germany as player with no reputation or real experience to speak of. Tactically, I have learned a lot and I'm in much better condition, both physically and psychologically. This is my World Cup, I think I can play a lead role and I want to show I'm a player that <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> big games." [...] After losing to Ghana in the opening group match, Serbia went on to face Germany. Within two minutes of Miroslav Klose's first-half dismissal, Žigić headed a cross down to Milan Jovanović who scored what proved to be the only goal of the game; Lukas Podolski's second-half penalty was saved, and Antić dedicated the victory to the Serbian people. In a game of missed chances against Australia, Serbia lost 2–1 and finished bottom of the group.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 1998, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, {{and three}} other leaders of Islamic militant {{organizations}} issued a fatwa {{in the name of}} the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, publishing it in Al-Quds Al-Arabi. Deploring the stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, the alleged U.S. aim to fragment Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel, they declared that [...] "The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies — civilian and military — is an individual duty for every Muslim who <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> any country in which it is possible to do it." [...] In spring 1998, Saudi elites became concerned about the threat posed by al-Qaeda and bin Laden; militants attempted to infiltrate surface-to-air missiles inside the kingdom, an al-Qaeda defector alleged that Saudis were bankrolling bin Laden, and bin Laden himself lambasted the Saudi royal family. In June 1998, Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah (Saudi intelligence) director Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud traveled to Tarnak Farms to meet with Taliban leader Mullah Omar to discuss the question of bin Laden. Turki demanded that the Taliban either expel bin Laden from Afghanistan or hand him over to the Saudis, insisting that removing bin Laden was the price of cordial relations with the Kingdom. American analysts believed Turki offered a large amount of financial aid to resolve the dispute over bin Laden. Omar agreed to the deal, and the Saudis sent the Taliban 400 pickup trucks and funding, enabling the Taliban to retake Mazar-i-Sharif. While the Taliban sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia in July for further discussions, the negotiations stalled by August.|$|E
