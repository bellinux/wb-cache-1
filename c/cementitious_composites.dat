In 2006 he was awarded the European Structural Integrity Society's Griffith Medal for [...] "his outstanding research in the field of theoretical fracture mechanics and fracture of quasi-brittle materials, in particular of concrete, fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites,</b> and advanced tough ceramics".|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of particle size and content of waste glass powder on the ASR expansion of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite,</b> with the aim to reveal the critical and the optimal particle size, as well as optimal content of waste glass powder. The <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> bar length method was applied to quantitatively assess the mitigation effect of waste glass powder on ASR expansion. Meanwhile, the microstructure characterization and pH value measurement were also conducted to explain the mechanism of mitigation effect on ASR expansion of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite.</b>|$|R
30|$|The pH {{value of}} the control <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> firstly {{exhibits}} a gradual increase, and then declines to around a value of 12.9. However, the pH value of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> incorporating waste glass powder paste decreases gradually {{with the increase of}} curing age, and the higher content of waste glass powder exhibits lower pH value.|$|R
30|$|Microstructure {{characterization}} of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> {{was carried out}} using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique of JEOL 7001 F FEG with high resolution (Li et al. 2017, 2018; Long et al. 2017). This device was equipped with a cold field emission electron gun operating at 15  kV. To examine the internal microstructure of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> with crashed pieces of hardened specimens obtained after ASR expansion measurement and soaked in acetone to stop hydration. The specimen surface was sputter coated with a thin layer (1.0  nm) of Pt/Pd prior to SEM test. Meanwhile, mineralogical analysis of the hydration products was conducted by XRF. The XRF was used to identify the polycrystalline phases of hardened <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> {{by means of the}} recognition of the X-ray patterns that are unique for each of the crystalline phases. The XRF patterns of the <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> show the expected hydration products, including calcium hydroxide and crystallized C–S–H.|$|R
50|$|High-performance fiber-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>{{composites}}</b> (HPFRCCs) are a {{group of}} fiber-reinforced cement-based composites which possess the unique ability to flex and self-strengthen before fracturing. This particular class of concrete was developed {{with the goal of}} solving the structural problems inherent with today’s typical concrete, such as its tendency to fail in a brittle manner under excessive loading and its lack of long-term durability. Because of their design and composition, HPFRCCs possess the remarkable ability to strain harden under excessive loading. In layman’s terms, this means they have the ability to flex or deform before fracturing, a behavior similar to that exhibited by most metals under tensile or bending stresses. Because of this capability, HPFRCCs are more resistant to cracking and last considerably longer than normal concrete. Another extremely desirable property of HPFRCCs is their low density. A less dense, and hence lighter material means that HPFRCCs could eventually require much less energy to produce and handle, deeming them a more economic building material. Because of HPFRCCs’ lightweight composition and ability to strain harden, it has been proposed that they could eventually become a more durable and efficient alternative to typical concrete.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{begins by}} {{discussing}} {{the need for}} damage mitigation for building structures under performance-based design by Wenchuan earthquake. Based on this concept, the character of Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> {{and the application of}} the on-site Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> device is discussed. Moreover, a new precast Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> device is suggested. Based on the practical projects, A 6 -story frame structure with and without such Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> devices was calculated in 8 -degree earthquake zone. The results indicate that Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> devices can reduce the drift angle of the base story from 0. 145 to 0. 1, reduce the displacement of the top story from 20. 23 mm to 13. 37 mm. Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> devices are confirmed to have significant potential as a new structural technology for earthquake resistance and disaster mitigation...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to characterise the effect of nano-Fe 3 O 4 as {{admixture}} on the mechanical and microstructural properties of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> Additionally, the influence of nano-Fe 3 O 4 on the hydration process and the microstructure of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> will also be determined.|$|E
30|$|In particular, the spall {{damage on}} the back side of a {{structure}} is closely related to the fracture energy; thus, the damage of FRCCs under contact explosions must be evaluated to consider the blast resistance according to the development of fracture energy. Additionally, since the strain rates of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials under contact explosions are approximately 1000 – 0, 000  s− 1, {{it is very difficult to}} evaluate the dynamic properties of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials under contact explosions. Thus, the static fracture energies of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials are considered in order to examine the dynamic fracture energy. The dynamic fracture energy is approximately the same as the static fracture energy (van Doormaal et al. 1994; Lee and Lopez 2014).|$|R
30|$|Cracking in <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> {{can result}} {{from a variety of}} factors {{including}} externally applied loads, shrinkage, and poor construction methods. Identification of cracks can be used to evaluate the long-term sustainability of structural elements made of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite.</b> For example, small cracks affecting only the external aesthetic of the structure should be differentiated from those that reduce its strength, stiffness, and long term durability. Priorities should be given to cracks that are deemed critical to the structure's functionality (e.g. safety, stability).|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} model that allows prediction or {{reproduction of the}} overall stress-strain relationship of a high performance <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> in tension is presented. Through consideration of stochastic character of the composite microstructure, the model captures the sequence of crack formation and the load fluctuations that are characteristic for the process of multiple cracking. The proposed model is used to reproduce/predict hardening stress-strain curves of an Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composite</b> (ECC). Results capture the effect of introducing artificial flaws on the composite ductility, which {{has been reported in}} experimental studies. ...|$|R
30|$|AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> had {{ambivalent}} post-cracked tensile characteristics between steel fibre {{reinforced concrete}} and ECC mixtures. For high ductile post-cracked tensile strain capacities, AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> {{was superior to}} steel fibre reinforced concrete but was inferior to ECC or SHCC mixtures. For the tensile strength, the ultimate tensile strength of AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> could be greatly enhanced varying with the fibre contents, as also observed in steel fibre reinforced concrete, but these phenomena of tensile strength enhancement cannot be fundamentally observed in ECC or SHCC mix.|$|E
40|$|The {{outcomes}} of the research in modern <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> have {{paved the way for}} their wide use in construction industry. The introduction of short, discontinuous and randomly distributed fibers to these composites has altered their inherent brittleness. Extensive research has been carried out on the effects of using of mono-fibers in a cementitious composite. However, limited reports in the approachable references on the use of hybrid fibers are available. The synergetic interaction between hybrid fibers have beneficial impact on <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> The incorporation of micro- and nano-pozzolanic materials, such as fly ash and silica fume have been used to develop high performance <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> such as reactive powder concrete, DUCTAL and CEMTEC multiscale. Further developments were recently achieved by the development of ultra-high performance <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> The matter of developing high and ultrahigh <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> using various kinds of fibers and particles has received enormous attention from the scientific community. This paper presents a comprehensive critical literature review on the area of high and ultra-high performance cement-based materials...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flexural {{strength}} of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber, fly ash (FA) and silica fume (SF) is studied in this paper. The parameters studied include volume fraction of fiber, the substitution ratio of cement by fly ash and the substitution ratio of cement by both silica fume and fly ash, which {{have an influence}} on the compressive strength and flexural {{strength of}} <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> The research findings show that {{with the increase of}} volume fraction of fiber, the flexural strength of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> are improved. When the volume fraction of fiber rises from 0 to 2 %,the flexural strength increases by 51. 8 %. When the volume fraction of fiber remains 2 %, cement substitution with fly ash reduces the flexural strength of <b>cementitious</b> <b>Composites,</b> while which is improved by cement substitution with both silica fume and fly ash...|$|E
30|$|For blast {{tests of}} <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials, the failure modes are {{influenced}} by the standoff distance from the explosion source. The effect of blast load on the test specimens decreases with atmospheric pressure and the dispersion of explosion pressure increases with the distance from the explosion source. Furthermore, the mass of high explosive (HE) is also serves as a very important parameter in the failure modes of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials. Therefore, the scaled distance with the mass of HE has {{a significant impact on the}} failure modes of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials under the explosion test. In the close-in blast test, generally induces global damage of the test specimen, such as flexural failure, cracking, and shear-punching action, based on the standoff distance level. However, local damage (i.e., crater, spall, and breach) also will occur if the combined loads are severe enough (McVay 1988), although that require larger blast charge compared to the contact blast test. In contrast, the failure modes of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials caused by contact-blast tests tend to be local damage. Thus, the current study employs contact explosions because various strengths of blast charge are required; namely, when considering the explosion tests on a laboratory scale, the local damage of the concrete panel caused by the close-in blast test is difficult to perform, whereas the evaluation of local damage is possible with only a small amount of blast charge in contact explosions.|$|R
30|$|Most recently, Singh et al. (2012) have {{developed}} CFRP rebars at Structural Testing Center of BITS Pilani {{and used them}} as near-surface mounted FRP rebars for shear and flexural strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) and engineered <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> beams.|$|R
30|$|When the {{particle}} sizes {{is less than}} 300  μm, the waste glass powder is obviously effective to reduce ASR expansion of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite.</b> The smaller particle size and higher content of waste glass powder exhibit better mitigation effect on ASR expansion.|$|R
40|$|Natural fibres as {{dispersed}} reinforcement in cement-based materials may repre-sent {{an interesting}} alternative to industrial fibres, {{because of their}} good mechani-cal properties and inborn sustainability signature. In this section the mechanical properties of Natural Fibre Reinforced <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composites</b> (NFRCCs) will be reviewed. Cutting-edge topics will be finally addressed, focusing, on the one hand, {{on the use of}} nano-sized cellulose-based constituents in cementitious com-posites, and, on the other, on the self-healing capacity that natural fibres may bring to <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> An appendix summarizing the main properties of the natural fibres so far most commonly employed in <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> will complement this information...|$|E
40|$|Fracture of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> is {{analyzed}} numerically {{using the}} cohesive surface methodology. The presence of aggregates in the cement matrix is explicitly accounted for. The composite is modeled in two dimensions as a three-phase material, {{the third phase}} being the weak interfacial transition zone in between aggregates and cement matrix. The bulk material is regarded as elastic and fracture is described with cohesive surfaces. The cohesive surface constitutive model is motivated by experimental observations regarding the loading-rate sensitivity of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> and analytical studies regarding fracture of planar microcracks. The model predicts the important toughening mechanism of crack face bridging occurring in <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> ...|$|E
30|$|In recent years, {{engineered}} <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites,</b> or ECC for short, {{has been}} developed to address the brittleness shortcomings of normal concrete. ECC has tensile ductility as much as three hundred times that of normal concrete, so that the shape of its tensile stress–strain curve looks more like that of steel than normal concrete. For this reason, it is {{also referred to as}} strain-hardening <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> (or SHCC).|$|E
30|$|CH {{crystals}} are continuously consumed due to {{the further}} hydration reaction with waste glass powder, which produces more C–S–H gels in <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite.</b> However, only few CH crystals are consumed {{due to the}} further hydration between CH crystals and fly ash.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the tension-stiffening effect of reinforced Engineered <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composite</b> (ECC), {{which is one of}} the High Performance Fiber-Reinforced <b>Cementitious</b> <b>Composite</b> (HPFRCC), uniaxial tension test is carried out for the specimens with one deformed steel rebar arranged. Bond analysis between ECC and rebar, in which fiber bridging effect of ECC at crack is considered, is conducted under the assumption of the bond stress - slippage relationship. Analysis results show that the tension-stiffening effect between ECC and steel rebar is relatively small rather than bridging action of ECC. It is also confirmed that bridging stress is smaller than crack strength of ECC as the average and strain capacity of ECC increases due to restriction of crack localization...|$|R
30|$|However, {{when the}} {{particle}} size {{is larger than}} 300  μm, the waste glass powder seems not to mitigate the ASR expansion of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite,</b> and even increases the ASR expansion when the waste glass powder replacement ratio reaches not less than 30 %.|$|R

30|$|Amorphous micro-steel (AMS) fibre made by cooling {{of liquid}} pig iron is flexible, light and durable to corrosion, {{then to be}} {{compatible}} with high flowable and disperable states of mixing as well as high ductile post-cracked performances to apply in fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> In the current research, AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> based on cement and alkali-activated ground granulated blast furnace slag mortars were newly manufactured and evaluated for the strength and ductile characteristics mainly by direct tensile and shear transfer tests in the variation in the volume of AMS fibres with two different lengths of 15.0 and 30.0  mm. As a result, {{it was found that}} 1.0 – 1.25 % fibre volume fractions were recommendable for AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> to maximize direct tensile strength, ductile tensile strain, and shear strength of the composites. However, a further fraction of AMS fibre lowered these mechanical characteristics. Simultaneously, it could be said that AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> exhibited up to about 3.7 times higher in direct tensile strength and up to 2.3 times higher in shear strength, compared to AMS fibre-free specimens.|$|E
30|$|Attempts {{to utilize}} fibre {{cementitious}} or concrete composites mixed with metallic or non-metallic fibres had been greatly made in fields of high rise building and infra structures {{in order to}} enhance additional requirements of high ductility, performance and durability (Narayanan and Darwish 1987; Ashour et al. 1992; De Hanai and Holanda 2008; Fischer and Li 2003; Kim et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2012; Choi et al. 2014). For fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites,</b> non-metallic fibres such as synthetic fibres were used to mainly develop high ductile characteristics after cracking, with no improvement of strength, known as engineered <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> (ECC) or strain-hardening <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> (SHCC) (Fischer and Li 2003; Lee et al. 2012; Choi et al. 2014; Cho et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2014). On the other hand, steel fibres are often used to mix in concrete or <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> to refine their brittle characteristics by enhancing tensile and shear strength (Narayanan and Darwish 1987; Ashour et al. 1992; De Hanai and Holanda 2008; Özgür and Khaled 2009; Özcan et al. 2009; Lim and Hong 2016; Lu et al. 2016).|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{simulating}} micro-cracking in <b>cementitious</b> <b>composite</b> materials is presented.

Int J Numer Anal Methods Geomech 2007; 31 : 133 – 46], but now a two phase composite is used in place of a homogenous material and the matrix stresses are employed in the evaluation of the micro-cracking. Single point compression and tension strain path examples show that the new formulation improves the accuracy of the model when judged against material data from concrete and mortar specimens...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{remarkable}} mechanical properties, various nanomaterials are {{now being}} considered as effective reinforcements of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> In the present study, new multi-scale <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> were developed using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and micro crystalline cellulose (MCC) as a hybrid reinforcement system. To develop these composites, CNTs and MCC were homogeneous dispersed in aqueous suspension using ultrasonication energy and a nonionic surfactant, Pluronic F- 127. These aqueous suspensions were then mixed with cement/sand mixture to fabricate the <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> Workability, mechanical properties and microstructure of the developed composites were thoroughly characterized. According to the experimental observations, flexural stiffness of <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> improved strongly due to the hybrid reinforcements, as shown in Fig. 1. Also, flexural strength improved significantly (~ 13 %) using 0. 1 % CNT and 0. 2 % MCC, dispersed using 3 % Pluronic. The workability of the cement paste, on the other hand, was not significantly influenced due to the reinforcing materials. Future efforts are being directed towards optimizing the dispersion conditions of CNT and MCC to further enhance the mechanical performance of these new composites. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Civil EngineeringDunja PericA low ratio {{between the}} {{compressive}} strength {{of concrete and}} its cost makes concrete {{one of the most}} widely used construction materials in civil engineering. Despite of a very good response to compressive stress, concrete exhibits a low tensile strength and limited tensile strain capacity. Adding short discrete fibers to a cementitious matrix can significantly improve its performance under tensile stress, thus ultimately exhibiting a ductile behavior. Nevertheless, in spite of their beneficial properties fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> remain underutilized in engineering practice. One of the main reasons for this is a lack of an adequate characterization of the tensile behavior as well as a lack of analysis methods that would allow engineers to incorporate fiber reinforced structural concrete elements into their design. Therefore, this dissertation has four key objectives: 1) to computationally model a stress-strain response of high performance fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> in uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression prior to macro-crack localization, 2) to develop and perform a diagnostic strain localization analysis for high performance fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites,</b> the results of which can characterize effects of fibers on failure precursors, 3) to devise and perform an experimental program for characterization of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites,</b> and 4) to characterize a full-fledged behavior including stress-strain and stress-crack opening displacement responses of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> in uniaxial tension. To quantify effects of fibers on onset of strain localization in fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> a combined computational/analytical models have been developed. To this end, linear-elastic multi-directional fibers were embedded into a cementitious matrix. The resulting composite was described by different types of two-invariant non-associated Drucker-Prager plasticity models. In order to investigate effects of a shape of a yield surface and hardening type linear and nonlinear yield surfaces, and linear and nonlinear hardening rules were considered. Diagnostic strain localization analyses were conducted for several plane stress uniaxial tension and uniaxial compression tests on non-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> as well as on high performance fiber-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> It was found that presence of fibers delayed the inception of strain localization in all tests on fiber-reinforced composites. Furthermore, presence of fibers exerted a more significant effect on the strain localization direction and mode in uniaxial compression than in uniaxial tension. The main objective of experimental program was to facilitate characterization of the post-cracking tensile behavior of ultra-high performance fiber reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites.</b> To this end, five different mixes of fiber-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> were cast, whereby volumetric fiber content, fiber shape and water to binder ratio were the experimental variables. Two testing methods were adopted, a direct uniaxial tension test and four-point prism bending test. Two different post-cracking behaviors were observed in direct tension tests, softening and strain hardening accompanied with multiple cracking. On the other hand, the response from prism bending tests was less scattered. Several different inverse analyses were carried out to predict stress-strain and stress-crack opening displacement responses in uniaxial tension based on the prism bending tests. The analyses resulted in worthy correlations with the experimental data, thus suggesting that the prism bending test is a viable alternative to a much more challenging to perform direct tension test for ultra-high performance fiber reinforced composites...|$|E
30|$|When the ECC or/and SHCC were {{manufactured}} to mix PVA fibres into <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> about 1.5 – 3.0 % {{in volume}} of the mix, the tensile strength was not much affected (Fischer and Li 2003; Lee et al. 2012; Choi et al. 2014; Cho et al. 2012). From observations of current direct tensile test, it was supposed that AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> had ambivalent post-cracked tensile characteristics between steel fibre reinforced concrete and ECC mixture. For ductile post-cracked tensile strain capacities, the AMS fibre cementitious composite was superior to steel fibre reinforced concrete, but was inferior to ECC or SHCC mixtures, whilst the AMS fibre-reinforced <b>cementitious</b> <b>composites</b> could greatly enhance tensile strength, which cannot be observed in ECC or SHCC mixtures. Considering the fibre dispersion, mixtures at more than 1.5 % fibre volume fraction were not recommendable to increase direct tensile strength as well as improve deformation capacities.|$|E
