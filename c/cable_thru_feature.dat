5000|$|The Dean Z, {{like its}} {{counterpart}} the Dean ML, was designed with {{the enhancement of}} tone, sustain and playability in mind. These models have dramatic string angles at the bridge and nut and a string <b>thru</b> body design <b>featuring</b> the original V plate. The added string length created by the exclusive headstock coupled with the original Dean neck design is how the Z achieves its [...] "incredible ease of play". It is still sold in its original configuration.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{south of}} town is a {{historic}} marker for the Half-Way Tree, a bur oak supposedly identified by Native Americans as the halfway point on a foot trail between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. [...] The railroad track that runs east and west <b>thru</b> town <b>features</b> a small museum with a train and army tank on display, adjacent {{to the park and}} bandstand pavilion. The museum curator said that the railroad was being wooed by two different towns and decided to split the difference and created Brodhead. A nearby branch of the Sugar River was diverted along a canal to a small hydroelectric generator supplied by a small holding pond. This supposedly gave Brodhead the distinction of having electrical service before other larger cities such as Chicago, and perhaps the first electrical service in Wisconsin.|$|R
40|$|A {{windscreen}} {{has been}} developed that features two advantages favorable for the measurement of outdoor infrasound. First, the sub-surface location, with {{the top of the}} windscreen flush with the ground surface, minimizes the mean velocity of the impinging wind. Secondly, the windscreen material (closed cell polyurethane foam) has a sufficiently low acoustic impedance (222 times that of air) and wall thickness (0. 0127 m) to provide a transmission coefficient of nearly unity over the infrasonic frequency range (0 - 20 Hz). The windscreen, a tightly-sealed box having internal dimensions of 0. 3048 x 0. 3048 x 0. 3556 m, contains a microphone, preamplifier, and a <b>cable</b> feed <b>thru</b> to an external power supply. Provisions are made for rain drainage and seismic isolation. A three-element array, configured as an equilateral triangle with 30. 48 m spacing and operating continuously in the field, periodically receives highly coherent signals attributed to emissions from atmospheric turbulence. The time delays between infrasonic signals received at the microphones permit determination of the bearing and elevation of the sources, which correlate well with locations of pilot reports (PIREPS) within a 320 km radius about the array. The test results are interpreted to yield spectral information on infrasonic emissions from clear air turbulence...|$|R
5000|$|Styled with pop-rap tones, [...] "Right <b>Thru</b> Me" [...] <b>features</b> an {{electronic}} beat, while being influenced by R&B. The main accompanying melody and chord progression are sampled from the Joe Satriani song [...] "Always with Me, Always with You" [...] from his breakthrough 1987 album Surfing With the Alien. The song {{has been described}} as a breezy jam that brandishes a swinging electronic beat, synth melodies, big pop hooks and guitar lines, and triple metre beats. Lyrically, the song describes someone who wonders aloud about how a lover can see the real her.|$|R
50|$|Michael Christianson (born April 7, 1965) is an American {{football}} {{college and}} professional coach. Christianson most recently {{served as the}} assistant running backs coach and the Director of Technology for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) in 2011 <b>thru</b> 2013 which <b>featured</b> a Superbowl appearance against the Baltimore Ravens in Superbowl XLVII (47). Prior to his tenure with the 49ers, Christianson also served on University of Michigan Head Coach Jim Harbaugh's staff at the University of San Diego (USD) where the Toreros of the Pioneer Football League won a Division I-AA Mid-Major National title in 2006. He {{has worked as a}} football coach at several other National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) institutions, including The University of Nebraska, Montana State University and Portland State University. Christianson coached the offensive line in 2002-2003 as a member of Jon Gruden's staff and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, winning Superbowl XXXVII (37). Christianson played tight-end and offensive lineman at Western Oregon University.|$|R
5000|$|Ska Parade, {{also known}} as SP Radio One, is a {{southern}} California radio show whose goal is to promote up-and-coming ska artists, {{as well as other}} types of new bands. The show was created by Tazy Phyllipz and Albino Brown. [...] The show {{was a part of the}} Orange County third-wave ska movement of the mid-1990s. In 1998, the Ska Parade was raided by the heavy metal band Gwar, who fought The Aquabats. Ska Parade's first compilation album, Step On It: The Best of The Ska Parade Radio Show, helped the career of Sublime and helped launch third wave ska onto the airwaves of many commercial radio stations (e.g. KROQ-FM, KCXX, 91X). Ska Parade's second compilation, Runnin' Naked <b>Thru</b> the Cornfield, <b>featured</b> exclusive tracks by Reel Big Fish, The Specials, Save Ferris and The Aquabats. **Ska Parade (based in OC, CA) currently airs on www.DirtyRadio.FM (commercial alternative) every Sunday from 8p-10p Pacific.|$|R
