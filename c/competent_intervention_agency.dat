Many health care clinics lack consistent use of culturally <b>competent</b> educational <b>interventions</b> when providing diabetes education to Latinos. The literature demonstrates that clinics using culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> tend to accomplish significant clinical improvements in outcomes such as lower glycosylated hemoglobin (A 1 C) levels, weight loss, increase in daily steps walked, and improved diabetes knowledge. The purpose of this Doctorate of Nursing Practice (DNP) project was to use Latino-tailored culturally competent diabetes education to achieve a reduction in weight, increase in steps walked daily, lower A 1 C levels and improved diabetes knowledge by using four, ninety minute sessions for a group of five Latino adults with type 2 diabetes. Project participants took a diabetes knowledge test before and after the intervention. Participants 2 ̆ 7 scores on the diabetes knowledge test, A 1 C levels, weight, and total average daily steps taken were measured before and after the intervention. There was a decrease in mean weight and an increase in mean diabetes knowledge test scores post intervention.

40|$|Thesis Title: Assessing Quality of Life, Psychological Well-Being and Depression in Hispanic American Women: Does Cultural Competence Matter? ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Hispanic {{people are}} at an {{elevated}} risk of developing depression as compared to any other {{racial and ethnic groups}} in the United States. Hispanic women, in particular, experience depression at roughly twice the rate of Hispanic men. The projected growth of the Hispanic population coupled with the high prevalence of depression among Hispanic women will exacerbate this already serious public health conundrum if targeted and culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> are not tailored to better tackle this illness. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effectiveness of a culturally <b>competent</b> <b>intervention</b> among Hispanic adult women who suffer from depression. METHODS: Data from a two-year randomized controlled trial conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) were analyzed. Usual care patients were offered standard referrals to MGH mental health resources. Intervention patients received a culturally focused consultation with mental health providers who were trained in culturally competent techniques, and familiar with the cultures and languages of the patients. A Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to examine differences in the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Rated Scale (QIDS-SR 16) scores between usual care and intervention groups at baseline and at 6 month-follow-up. A Friedman test was conducted to investigate differences between pretest and posttest Schwartz Outcome Scale (SOS- 10) scores in the intervention group. Parametric tests were further performed to determine differences in cumulative scores between the groups, at baseline and at 6 month- follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 81 patients completed the baseline and follow-up visits. At 6 month-follow-up, Hispanic women who received the culturally <b>competent</b> <b>intervention</b> less often reported feelings of sadness or waking up too early, as compared to Hispanic women who received the usual -non-culturally competent- care. There were statistically significant differences in the average cumulative QIDS- SR 16 scores between usual care and intervention groups. Hispanic women in the intervention group had, on average, higher scores of personal satisfaction (SOS- 10, Item 1) at two weeks as compared to baseline, but these scores remained unchanged at 6 months. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that health care services rendered by culturally competent mental health providers can be more effective at treating Hispanic American women who suffer from depression...|$|R

40|$|Objective To test {{predictors}} of medication adherence in high-risk {{racial or ethnic}} minority youth living with HIV (YLH) using a conceptual model of social cognitive predictors including a continuous measure of motivational readiness.  Methods Youth were participants in a multi-site clinical trial examining the efficacy of a motivational intervention. Racial-minority YLH (primarily African American) who were prescribed antiretroviral medication were included (N = 104). Data were collected using computer-assisted personal interviewing method via an Internet-based application and questionnaires.  Results Using path analysis with bootstrapping, most youth reported suboptimal adherence, which predicted higher viral load. Higher motivational readiness predicted optimal adherence, and higher social support predicted readiness. Decisional balance was indirectly related to adherence.  Conclusions The model provided a plausible framework for understanding adherence in this population. Culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> focused on readiness and social support may be helpful for improving adherence in YLH...|$|R

Racialism, colonialism, and culturalism continue to perpetuate the barriers to healthcare that enable health disparities between aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. Cultural competency is recognized as a strategy to ameliorate the effects of health inequities that exist for First Nations populations.

40|$|This paper explores black African children’s {{experiences}} of the child protection system in the UK.

This paper examines these themes to elucidate the factors that contribute to the provision of effective, culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> with black African children at risk of significant harm. It suggests {{that there are a number}} of tensions inherent for professionals in working with culturally diverse African families such as reconciling different beliefs and behaviours concerning child-rearing practices; affirming the parenting practices of these families in the engagement process; adopting a strengths-based orientation whilst at the same time safeguarding and promoting the welfare of vulnerable children.

40|$|The {{creation}} of trauma-informed systems that use evidence-based, culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> for affected {{children and families}} is a priority in Indian Country because mounting evidence from adverse childhood experiences research with American Indians documents the incidence and prevalence of trauma. What is more, an emergent line of research documents secondary traumatic stress (STS) in the adult workforce, which reduces their ability to help affected children and families and contributes to workforce turnover. The development of a trauma-informed system entails evidence-based detection, treatment, and prevention mechanisms for children, families, and STS-affected social services professionals. With tribal child welfare systems {{as a starting point}} and also as a centerpiece for the development of companion, trauma-informed behavioral and mental health systems, we propose a conceptual framework for such work to guide innovative system designs. Although some aspects of such a system currently are in place in several Native American communities, to our knowledge the comprehensive design we describe is not fully developed and implemented anywhere.

40|$|A {{number of}} reports {{indicate}} that cultural barriers may prevent members of ethnic minority groups from accessing diabetes services, but {{little is known about}} the specific nature of these barriers. This systematic review of observational studies aimed to identify and explore cultural barriers as a basis for improvements in care. Articles published from inception to September 2011 were retrieved from four databases (Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane and DARE), two National Health Service specialist libraries (Diabetes, and Ethnicity and Health), Warwick Medical School publications and reference lists. Inclusion criteria were qualitative or quantitative studies involving ethnic minority groups with diabetes. Two reviewers independently conducted paper selection and appraisal. A total of 316 studies were retrieved, 22 of which were included in the review. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative analysis was undertaken. Eight key cultural issues emerged, namely participants' strong adherence to cultural norms, religious beliefs, linguistic diversity, low health literacy levels, different beliefs about health and illness, belief in expert and professional support, low accessibility of culturally appropriate services/information, and low concordance with western professional advice. These issues compromised the level of diabetes care services received by members of ethnic minority groups. It is recommended that further attention is given to the development of culturally <b>competent</b> <b>interventions</b> for improving access to healthcare and diabetes outcomes for members of specific ethnic minority groups...|$|R
