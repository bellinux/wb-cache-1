40|$|Due to the enzymatic equipment, {{the yeast}} cell {{produces}} alcoholic fermentation by {{the meaning of}} a zimazic complex which catalyzes in different stages the redox processes of the carbohydrates, which are able to ferment, ultimately leading to ethanol. The fermentation rate is an exponential function being influenced by the cells concentration in the development environment and the starter <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> Most of the yeast strains do ferment some substrates rich in hexosanes and oligoglucides: sucrose, maltose, raffinose, lactose and celobiose. The biomass quantity may be increased in various ways. An important aspect in the increasing of the multiplication rate of the yeast cells is the determination of the optimum growing conditions. Some kinetic dependencies, mono and multi-factorial, have been observed; they describe the impact of the concentration of the base components in the nutrient environment, temperature, pH, mixing intensity on the multiplication rate of the yeasts...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. All the {{microbiology}} texts {{underline the}} importance of performing a gram stain on blood culture broth, if positive, with a double purpose: address the microbiologist {{in the choice of}} subculture media and provide the clinician with preliminary indication for the choice of the treatment. However, there are few data and literature on the concordance between gram stain and definitive result. The study aims at evaluating, in the reality of our hospital, the reliability of the gram stain performed starting from the blood culture broth. Materials and methods. The results of the gram stain on broth and of the final detection of all positive blood cultures performed from January 1 st 2003 to December 31 st 2004 by the Microbiology Lab based at Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo have been analysed. Results. In two years 52909 bottles have been processed; 6328 (11. 96 %) resulted positive, of which 5921 (11. 19 %) for monomicrobial flora and 407 (0. 77 %) for polymicrobial flora. Concerning the 6643 definitive identifications, the gram stain resulted fully correct in 6140 cases (92. 43 %); errors have been interpreted as “minor” in 285 cases (4. 29 %) for a partial or absent definition of the morphologic-dyeing features, “major” in 14 cases (0. 21 %) for notification of micro-organisms non grown later, “serious” in 204 (3. 07 %) for wrong reading of Gram (36 cases, equal to 0. 54 %) or no interpretation, in case of mixed <b>cultures,</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> grown later (168 cases equal to 2. 53 %).

40|$|The Automated Adaptive Directed Evolution Chamber (AADEC) is {{a device}} that allows {{operators}} to generate a micro-scale analog of real world systems {{that can be used}} to model the local-scale effects of climate change on microbial ecosystems. The AADEC uses an artificial environment to expose <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> to environmental pressures, such as UV-C radiation, chemical toxins, and temperature. The AADEC autonomously exposes micro-organisms to selection pressures. This improves upon standard manual laboratory techniques: the process can take place over a longer period of time, involve more stressors, implement real-time adjustments based on the state of the population, and minimize the risk of contamination. We currently use UV-C radiation as the main selection pressure, UV-C is well studied both for its cell and DNA damaging effects as a type of selection pressure and for its related effectiveness as a mutagen; having these functions united makes it a good choice for a proof of concept. The AADEC roadmap includes expansion to different selection pressures, including heavy metal toxicity, temperature, and other forms of radiation. The AADEC uses closed-loop control to feedback the current state of the culture to the AADEC controller that modifies selection pressure intensity during experimentation, in this case culture density and growth rate. Culture density and growth rate are determined by measuring the optical density of the culture using 600 nm light. An array of 600 nm LEDs illuminate the culture and photodiodes are used to measure the shadow on the opposite side of the chamber. Previous experiments showed that we can produce a million fold increase to UV-C radiation over seven iterations. The most recent implements a microfluidic system that can expose cultures to multiple different selection pressures, perform non-survival based selection, and autonomously perform hundreds of exposure cycles. A scalable pump system gives the ability to pump in various different growth media to individual cultures and introduce chemical toxins during experimentation; AADEC can perform freeze and thaw cycles. We improved our baseline characterization by building a custom UV-C exposure hood, a shutter operates on a preset timer allowing the user to set exposure intensity consistently for multiple iterations...|$|E

30|$|The {{chemostat}} is {{a laboratory}} apparatus {{used for the}} continuous <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms.</b> Mathematical models <b>of</b> the chemostat are surprisingly amenable to analysis. Early results {{can be found in}} the articles of Levin [1] and Hsu [2]. For a general discussion of competition, Smith and Waltman [3] discussed the well-unstirred model in detail. Recently, Wu [4 – 6] and Nie [7, 8] studied the coexistence and asymptotic behavior of chemostat models from the viewpoint of partial differential equations theories. The response functions are mainly the Michaelis-Menten functional response f(S) = S/(1 + κ S), κ is a constant. Until very recently, both ecologists and mathematicians chose to base their studies on the Beddington-DeAngelis (denoted by B-D) functional response introduced by Beddington [9] and DeAngelis [10]. The Beddington-DeAngelis functional response has some of the same qualitative features as the Michaelis-Menten form but has an extra term βu in the denominator which models mutual interference between predators. It has been the source of controversy and can provide a better description of predator feeding over a range of predator-prey abundances, which are strongly supported by numerous field and laboratory experiments and observations.|$|R

40|$|A {{kinetic model}} for a growing <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> was {{developed}} that correlated the biochemical structure of cells with quantitative physiological behaviour. The three-compartment model was adequate for simulation of continuous, batch and transient experiments with activated sludge fed on vanillin. The model assumed three basic compartments in a cell: (1) a building-block for synthesis of energy-rich compounds, small metabolites, DNA and storage materials; (2) the protein-synthesizing machinery; (3) the pool of enzymes and other proteins. The concept of viability was incorporated by postulating irreversible conversions of the three compartments to inert fractions. The two-stage activated-sludge process was improved and a mathematical model was developed for kinetic optimalization of the process. The two-stage process {{was better than the}} one-stage process in rate of vanillin breakdown. The kinetic coefficients of the second stage were affected by concentration and composition of intermediate substrate. Increase of maximum yield coefficient and simultaneous decrease of maintenance coefficient of the second stage with decreasing concentration of intermediate substrate were predicted by fitting the biochemical data of the second stage to the model. The production of biomass in the two-stage system under optimum kinetics was always greater than that of the one-stage system. The presence of acetate allowed higher rates at low concentrations of substrate, reducing the kinetic' advantage of the two-stage process. The predominant populations of bacteria in the chemostat altered if the specific growth rate was increased by a factor 4 or when acetate was added to the vanillin-basal medium.

These studies {{were part of a}} broad investigation of the {{study of the}} progression of the biochemical oxygen demand of soluble organic compounds {{in order to determine the}} validity of a short-term B. O. D. determination. The progression in soluble substrates of the B. O. D. exerted by a mixed <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> was found to be a multi-stage reaction. This is believed to be the first work using this biochemical technique of studying intermediary metabolism to define the progression of the biochemical oxygen demand of soluble organic compounds. Previous work on the inhibition of assimilation utilized pure cultures and heavy inoculums of bacteria for short incubation periods. Sodium azide, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, and sodium fluoride were used for the selective stimulation of respiration or inhibition of assimilation processes. Sodium azide was the only agent which produced a marked degree of stimulation of respiration for either glucose, glutamic acid or a 1 : 1 mixture of these substrates. The general pattern of oxidation due to these agents is shown in graph form. The progression of the oxidation of these soluble compounds can be altered considerably and yet produce 120 -hour incubation period (five-day) B. 0. D. values which are within the accepted standard deviations for these substrates using the bottle dilution technique. Similar results were obtained from manometric experiments. A critical concentration of the inhibitory agent significantly prevented synthesis and forced the reaction in the direction of complete oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, as shown by increased plateau values. Low concentrations of sodium azide initially retarded respiration slightly and simultaneously the synthesis processes were partially inhibited. Relatively high concentrations of this agent reduced the rate of respiration considerably. No increase in the extent of oxidation of fresh settled sewage was observed in the presence of sodium azide or 2, 4 - dinitrophenol...|$|R

The indigenous intestinal microflora is a complex ecosystem which develops early in life. In adulthood, this system consists of at least 500 different bacterial species with a maximum concentration of the bacteria in the ileum and colon [2]. More than 99 % of the microorganisms in the colon are strictly anaerobic, such as bifidobacteria, peptostreptococci, Bacteroides spp., and Clostridium spp. [3]. Intestinal microflora has several important functions for the host including the production of vitamins, degradation of bile acids, digestion of nutrients and the conversion of (pro) carcinogenic substances. In addition, the colonization of the intestine by commensal bacteria is also important for the development and functioning of the immune system [4]. The functions of the intestinal microflora may be positively influenced by probiotics which exert a therapeutic effect through modification of the composition of indigenous intestinal microflora and its metabolic activity, prevention of overgrowth and colonization of pathogens, and stimulation of the immune system...|$|R

The cultured inoculum significantly (P < 0 · 05) improved nitrogen digestion and retention in mulga-fed sheep by 16 and 76 %, respectively. Inocula consisting of simplified mixtures of bacteria isolated from sheep, feral goats, and native marsupials did not affect mulga digestion.
