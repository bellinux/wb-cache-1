5|$|The {{caterpillars}} of many butterflies attach {{themselves by}} a button of silk to {{the underside of}} a branch or stone or other projecting surface. They remain attached to the silk pad by a hook-like process called a cremaster. Most chrysalids hang head downward, but in the families Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae, the <b>chrysalis</b> is held in a more upright position by a silk girdle around {{the middle of the}} <b>chrysalis.</b>|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of butterflies have a four-stage life cycle; egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (<b>chrysalis)</b> and imago (adult). In the genera Colias, Erebia, Euchloe, and Parnassius, {{a small number of}} species are known that reproduce semi-parthenogenetically; when the female dies, a partially developed larva emerges from her abdomen.|$|E
5|$|When Yagdra {{learned that}} Sarah Kerrigan was {{transforming}} in a <b>chrysalis,</b> it attempted {{to halt the}} process permanently by sending its pack at Kerrigan's brood. In the process, Yagdra also eradicated the last remnants of Brakk's now-leaderless pack, however, it was not successful in killing the Queen of Blades before she hatched from her <b>chrysalis.</b> The opportunity came soon enough, however, when Kerrigan, now the Primal Queen of Blades, set out to challenge the pack leaders for control of Zerus. She came for Yagdra first. Aided by Dehaka's Pack, Kerrigan fought her way through Yagdra's minions and confronted the pack leader himself. Yagdra {{told her that her}} transformation meant nothing. The two fought, and Kerrigan emerged victorious. After slaying Yagdra, she absorbed his essence.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly larvae, caterpillars, {{have a hard}} (sclerotised) {{head with}} strong mandibles used for cutting their food, most often leaves. They have {{cylindrical}} bodies, with ten segments to the abdomen, generally with short prolegs on segments 3–6 and 10; the three pairs of true legs on the thorax have five segments each. Many are well camouflaged; others are aposematic with bright colours and bristly projections containing toxic chemicals obtained from their food plants. The pupa or <b>chrysalis,</b> unlike that of moths, is not wrapped in a cocoon.|$|E

5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a <b>chrysalis</b> it claims will be its {{greatest}} creation. The <b>chrysalis</b> eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and Terran genetics. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E

The band's record company, <b>Chrysalis</b> Records, complained that the sleeve would be too expensive to produce, but Anderson countered that if a real newspaper could be produced, a parody of one would also be practical.|$|E

50|$|The London Butterfly House in Syon Park was an insectarium {{like a large}} {{glasshouse}} {{containing a}} butterfly zoo. Visitors could see butterflies and moths flying about, feeding, and emerging from <b>chrysalises.</b> There was also a colony of large ants (kept with the butterflies), a small tropical bird aviary, and a small gallery of reptiles, amphibians, insects and spiders. The lease on the current site expired in October 2007 and the Butterfly House closed on 28 October.|$|R

5|$|Beetles {{are members}} of the {{superorder}} Endopterygota, and accordingly most of them undergo complete metamorphosis. The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the egg, the larva, the pupa, and the imago or adult. The larvae are commonly called grubs and the pupa sometimes is called the <b>chrysalis.</b> In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final instar. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families Meloidae and Rhipiphoridae, go further, undergoing hypermetamorphosis in which the first instar {{takes the form of a}} triungulin.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies {{have the}} typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs {{on the food}} plant on which their larvae, known as {{caterpillars}}, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a <b>chrysalis.</b> When metamorphosis is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Cyberpunk is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock vocalist Billy Idol. A concept album, it was {{released}} in 1993 by <b>Chrysalis</b> Records. Inspired by his personal interest in technology and his first attempts to use computers {{in the creation of}} his music, Idol based the album on the cyberdelic subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Heavily experimental in its style, the album was an attempt by Idol {{to take control of the}} creative process in the production of his albums, while simultaneously introducing Idol's fans and other musicians to the opportunities presented by digital media.|$|E
25|$|The Butterfly Rainforest is {{a display}} of live {{butterflies}} in a large, outdoor enclosed space attached to the museum. It is the main exhibit in the McGuire Center which is accessed from the main entrance of Powell Hall. At any given time, the exhibit contains 60 to 80 butterfly and moth species, totaling some 1,000 individuals. The butterflies are brought {{from around the world}} as <b>chrysalises</b> and released into the exhibit after emerging as adults. The butterfly exhibit is currently the only permanent exhibit that requires an entrance fee.|$|R
50|$|The {{butterfly}} {{park was}} founded in 1997 in a former nursery garden. Visitors can experience the many different species in natural surroundings. Mating {{can also be seen}} as well as the development of eggs into caterpillars and <b>chrysalises.</b> In the butterfly house there are also quails which dispose of ants and snails. Japanese carp swim in the tropical lake while parrots and parakeets fly around or perch in the treetops. Species of butterfly include the Heliconius, Attacus atlas, Greta oto, Morpho peleides, Danaus plexippus, Idea leuconoe, Papilio, Phoebis philea and Caligo eurilochus.|$|R
25|$|While Princess Cadence was {{preparing}} {{to be married to}} Shining Armor(the captain of the Royal Guard of Canterlot, and the brother of Twilight Sparkle) in Canterlot, changelings (creatures that can change their physical form, and feed off the love of others) covertly snuck into the town. The changeling queen, Queen <b>Chrysalises,</b> imprisoned and impersonated Cadence, so she could feed off Shining Armor's love for her. Twilight Sparkle discovered this just before the imposter of Cadence and Shining Armor could be wed. She then freed Cadence, allowing Cadence and Shining Armor to defeat the Changelings with the power of their love, {{with the help of the}} bearers of the Elements of Harmony (the Mane 6 ponies).|$|R
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did not produce another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to {{the failure of}} the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at <b>Chrysalis</b> Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, and the formation of a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E
5|$|Velvet Revolver soon gained major label {{attention}} with Warner Bros. and <b>Chrysalis.</b> RCA and Elektra were {{also interested in}} signing the band. They eventually signed with RCA Records. They recorded their album at NRG Recording Studios, while Slash recorded his guitar parts at a smaller studio on the southern corner between Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. During recording, Weiland could only work for {{three hours a day}} due to a court order mentioning that he was to stay in a halfway house. The marketing campaign for Velvet Revolver {{in the run-up to the}} release of the first album was profiled as part of the Frontline program The Way the Music Died, which included interviews with the band members and producers.|$|E
5|$|Despite having {{completely}} {{dropped out}} of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, Silent Cry reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to <b>Chrysalis,</b> {{the owners of the}} now defunct Echo Label. The subsequent Silent Cry tour was Feeder's longest playing up to 29 different dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, Silent Cry remains their first album since 1997's Polythene not to achieve at least gold status. The 2010 follow-up Renegades, was less successful only spending two weeks in the chart after entering at #16, while also being their first since the aforementioned Polythene not to chart within the Top 10.|$|E
50|$|Fuss {{has embraced}} {{a range of}} {{historical}} and contemporary photographic techniques to capture a broad set of emotion-laden subject matter. Art critics often describe the artist’s work as speaking to the ephemerality of {{a moment in time}} and life itself. Fuss’s images have depicted babies, water droplets, christening dresses, moving light, snakes, sunflowers, rabbit entrails, and human skulls. Perhaps Fuss’s best known images are those of babies on their backs in shallow baths of water with ripples and droplets of water capturing the youngster’s motion. His most recent images (since 2003) have included concentric waves originating from a single water droplet (the “Ark” series), butterfly <b>chrysalises,</b> powder trails made by live snakes, and autobiographical childhood images.|$|R
50|$|The Detroit Zoo's Wildlife Interpretive Gallery houses {{hundreds}} of free-flying butterflies. The Zoo purchases about 250 butterfly pupae (<b>chrysalises)</b> each week from growers in Costa Rica and El Salvador. The butterflies are raised by growers who maintain their own breeding stock; {{they are not}} taken from the wild but {{are part of an}} effort to promote butterfly conservation programs in those countries. Approximately 25 species can be observed engaging in many of their natural behaviors, including feeding on flower nectar or ripe fruit and basking in the sunlight. The garden is kept at a balmy 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the optimal temperature for the butterflies to take flight. The immersive habitat is open year-round and is free with Zoo admission.|$|R

He is approached by Stark who agrees to have the gland removed in exchange for him helping them use the gland for <b>Chrysalis's</b> own purpose, but eventually escapes. He appears in 9 episodes.|$|R
5|$|The album's {{original}} cover art by Burton Silverman features a watercolour {{portrait of a}} long-haired, bearded man in shabby clothes. The idea for the cover came from a photograph Anderson's wife took of a homeless man on Thames Embankment, and Anderson later felt {{it would have been}} better to have used the photograph rather than commission the painting. Ian Anderson recalls posing for a photograph for the painting, though Silverman claims it was a self-portrait. The artwork was commissioned and purchased by <b>Chrysalis</b> Records head Terry Ellis. Artist Silverman claims the art was only licensed for use as an album cover, and not for merchandising; and approached the band seeking remuneration for its further use. Silverman and Anderson have different accounts of level of enmity involved in this. The original artwork for both the front and back covers are now privately owned by an unknown family, apparently having been stolen from a London hotel room.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of multimedia software {{as a special}} feature was a novelty when <b>Chrysalis</b> Records released the Billy Idol's Cyberpunk diskette. This was also widely adopted by the music industry years later. CD-ROMs were initially considered as a medium for Cyberpunks multimedia features, but were too expensive {{at the time of}} production, and so floppy disks were used instead. Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren had previously experimented with CD-ROMs, but it was hoped that if Idol's album had proved popular, it could have been reissued with CD-ROMs, catapulting the format into the music industry's mainstream. This never materialised due to the album's general failures. However, during the late '90s it became increasingly common for some limited edition digipaks to include CD-ROMs, evolving by the early 2000s into the {{inclusion of}} DVDs.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The <b>chrysalis</b> stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

I was blessed with having been {{able to look at}} both the expensive collection of Doctor Nicolaas Witsen, mayor of Amsterdam and director of the East Indies society, and that of Mr. Jonas Witsen, secretary of Amsterdam. Moreover, I also saw the collections of Mr. Fredericus Ruysch, doctor of medicine and professor of anatomy and botany, Mr. Livinus Vincent, and many other people. In these collections I had found innumerable other insects, but finally if here their origin and their reproduction is unknown, it begs the questionsic as to how they transform, starting from caterpillars and <b>chrysalises</b> and so on. All this has, at the same time, led me to undertake a long dreamed of journey to Suriname.|$|R
