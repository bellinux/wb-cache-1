Neste trabalho, objetiva-se escrutinar, através de fontes documentais, elementos orientadores relacionados ao ensino de aritmética na formação do {{professor}} primário no curso complementar em Laguna, Santa Catarina. Buscamos responder a seguinte pergunta: como se deram as orientações no período de 1911 a 1947 para o ensino de aritmética na formação do professor primário no Curso Complementar Jerônimo Coelho? Os documentos privilegiados como fontes de pesquisas foram: a) as determinações oficiais encontradas nos Programas de Ensino do Curso Complementar de 1911, 1919, 1928, 1935 e 1939; b) a Circular n. 54 que trata das orientações para as reuniões pedagógicas do ensino primário catarinense e c) o Livro com as Atas das reuniões pedagógicas do Curso Complementar em Laguna. Os referenciais teórico-metodológicos permeiam os estudos da História Cultural, em especial os conceitos de cultura escolar e análise do documento histórico. Identificamos em nossos estudos a presença das orientações expedidas pelo estado catarinense referente as reuniões pedagógicas do diretor e professores do curso complementar. Percebemos que as formas de ensinar a aritmética na prática passavam por um longo período de transição entre o Ensino Intuitivo e a Escola Nova, porém, temos que o método intuitivo ainda prevalecia. Conclui-se também que o curso complementar era na prática uma continuidade do ensino dos grupos escolares e que não preenchiam a finalidade de formador de professores. Abstract : In this work, {{the objective}} is to scrutinize, through documentary sources, guiding elements related to the teaching of arithmetic {{in the formation of the}} primary teacher in the <b>complementary</b> <b>course</b> in Laguna, Santa Catarina. We sought to answer the following question: how were the guidelines given in the period from 1911 to 1947 for the teaching of arithmetic in the formation of the primary teacher in the <b>Complementary</b> <b>Course</b> Jerônimo Coelho? The documents privileged as sources of research were: a) the official determinations found in the <b>Complementary</b> <b>Course</b> Teaching Programs of 1911, 1919, 1928, 1935 and 1939; B) a Circular n. 54 which deals with the guidelines for the pedagogical meetings of primary education in Santa Catarina and c) the Book with the Minutes of the pedagogical meetings of the <b>Complementary</b> <b>Course</b> in Laguna. The theoretical-methodological references permeate the studies of Cultural History, especially the concepts of school culture and analysis of the historical document. We identified in our studies the presence of guidelines issued by the State of Santa Catarina regarding the pedagogical meetings of the director and teachers of the <b>complementary</b> <b>course.</b> We realized that the ways of teaching arithmetic in practice went through a long period of transition between Intuitive Teaching and New School, but we have that the intuitive method still prevailed.

40|$|After the {{introduction}} of the Basic Education Teacher Diploma (BETD) in Namibia, a number of studies were conducted on how teachers, lecturers, stakeholders and the Namibian public perceived the BETD program and its implementation. However, very few studies focussed specifically on mathematics subject content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge in the BETD. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the need for a <b>complementary</b> <b>course</b> in mathematics education to address the lack of mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge in the Namibian BETD. The study involved five mathematics school teachers, two mathematics college lecturers in the Kavango educational region and a professor of mathematics education at the University of Namibia. These participants were purposefully selected because of their knowledge and experiences with various aspects of the BETD program. The motivation for conducting this study was to gain a better understanding of some of the issues that have been raised about the BETD program, particularly the perceived inadequacy of mathematical subject content and methodology since the inception of the program. The study adopts a qualitative approach in reporting participants’ reflections. The views of the focal educators and documents such as syllabi and course outlines were the main source of data. The findings indicate that despite the training that the three BETD mathematics graduates in this study received, the level of mathematics taught in a <b>complementary</b> <b>course,</b> such as an ACE, would clearly better equip mathematics teachers to teach proficiently and facilitate access to institutions of higher learning such as universities. The results of the study revealed that there was a need for the implementation of a <b>complementary</b> <b>course</b> to the BETD in mathematics education for teachers of mathematics in Namibia. This study also provided valuable insights into what such a course could look like...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: One reason {{given by}} the South African {{government}} for establishing a physician training agreement with Cuba is that the ethical, humanistic and solidarity principles promoted in Cuban medical education are difficult to acquire in other settings. However, Cuba's general medical training program does not provide all skills needed by a general practitioner in South Africa: other competencies are required, such as management of general and gynecological or obstetrical surgical emergencies, administration of anesthesia and nursing procedures. As long as the desired humanistic values were assured, South African authorities have preferred to complement these competencies. Thus, since 2003, the Medical University of Villa Clara has applied a curricular strategy of 12 <b>complementary</b> <b>courses</b> to develop the requested additional skills, but results have not met expectations. OBJECTIVE: Determine why the complementary curricular strategy has not been entirely successful and identify {{possible courses of action}} for improvement. METHODS: A document review was conducted of the curricular strategy applied and of minutes of meetings between Cuban and South African counterparts to identify correspondence between requested professional skills and actions to develop them. In addition, South African students were surveyed and Cuban professors were interviewed in depth. Senior university administrators and key informants were also interviewed. Variables assessed were course quality and satisfaction of students and professors. RESULTS: Some actions originally included in the curricular strategy were not implemented and there were structural weaknesses in <b>complementary</b> <b>courses,</b> primarily in objectives, teaching strategy and evaluation. Students reported insufficient practical activities and lack of relationship between content and the health situation in South Africa. Professors were dissatisfied with student levels of motivation and ability to manage their own learning. Other influencing factors were insufficient academic management and professors' lack of knowledge about the context where these future professionals would eventually practice. CONCLUSIONS: Curricular strategy deficiencies detected are primarily in academic management; overcoming them could facilitate action in specific directions identified to improve the requested skill levels...|$|R
