25|$|In the 1980s, <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> with 5 or 6 rigid spokes {{began to}} appear in the Olympic Games and {{professional}} racing: these have advantages in specialized applications, such as time trials, but wire-spoked wheels are used for most purposes.|$|E
50|$|Taking {{into account}} their {{generally}} inferior quality compared to forged wheels, the main advantage of <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> is {{the relatively low}} cost of production. And although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are more affordable than forged wheels, <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are designed to be}} heavier than forged wheels for a given required load. Manufacturing defects found in <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> include cavities or porosity and a different metallurgical microstructure, entailing larger grain size. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> will tend to fracture upon overbearing high-speed impact, whereas forged wheels will tend to bend.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> {{had already}} been used on {{automobiles}} previously, {{it was not until}} the 1927 that the Böhmerland, a motorcycle built in Czechoslovakia was fitted with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Yamaha RD400C sold in 1976 was {{the first}} {{motorcycle}} by a major manufacturer to be fitted with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels.</b> The <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> weighed 100 g more than the spoked wheels fitted to its RD350 predecessor.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the early}} 1980s Honda had begun {{equipping}} newer models with <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> called ComCast [...] stating [...] "...that technology has solved the casting porosity {{problem and that}} <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are now used on Hondas for styling and marketing reasons". ComCast wheels were a combination of pressed-together cast aluminium hub and spokes with a hollow extruded aluminium rim.|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} fatigue and fracture behaviour of commercially produced cast 13; and forged rail wheels {{has been made}} using specimens extracted from various locations of 13; the wheel quadrant. A systematic investigation in the web and rim regions of the wheel 13; quadrant with various notch orientations showed that the forged material exhibited a 13; better intrinsic resistance to fatigue crack growth than the cast material. Since linear 13; elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) based fracture toughness could not be validated for 13; both the <b>cast</b> and forged <b>wheel</b> material, elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) based 13; characteristic fracture toughness was used. Results showed that fracture resistance of the 13; forged material is superior {{to that of the}} <b>cast</b> material. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheel</b> specimens exhibited 13; unstable crack extension in comparison to substantial stable tearing in forged specimens. 13; Microstructural and fractographic analyses showed that the <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> material contained 13; large amounts of inclusions. The poor fracture resistance of <b>cast</b> <b>wheel</b> material is therefore 13; attributed to the inferior material quality...|$|R

50|$|Motorcycle {{wheels are}} made to cope with radial and axial forces. They also provide a way of {{mounting}} other critical components such as the brakes, final drive and suspension. Wheels, and anything directly connected to them, {{are considered to be}} unsprung mass. Traditionally motorcycles used spoked wheels with inner tubes and pneumatic tyres. Although <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> were first used on a motorcycle in 1927, it would not be until the 1970s that mainstream manufacturers would start to introduce <b>cast</b> <b>wheels</b> on their roadgoing motorcycles. Spoked wheels are usually made with steel spokes and steel or aluminium rims. <b>Cast</b> <b>wheels</b> are predominantly made from aluminium or an alloy of, but can also be made from more exotic materials such as magnesium or carbon fibre.|$|E

5000|$|A {{patent for}} a <b>cast</b> alloy {{motorcycle}} <b>wheel</b> was filed in 1974 and assigned to Carroll Shelby's Shelby-Dowd Industries; and in early 1975 Thomas J.

By mid 1975, Shelby-Dowd aftermarket <b>cast</b> alloy <b>wheels</b> were advertised for sale. In November 1975, Harley-Davidson, Moto Guzzi and Ducati all showed factory models fitted with alloy wheels at the EICMA show in Milan. By 1976, two more manufacturers were offering aftermarket cast aluminum wheels: Henry Abe of Osaka, Japan (now Daytona Global); and Lester Industries of Ohio (now a division of ITT).|$|R
