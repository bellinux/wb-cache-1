5|$|In October 2013 Liverpool City Council {{approved}} {{the acquisition of}} the Cunard Building for use as offices and as a <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> terminal. The council projected that the building would accommodate 1000 staff relocated from Millennium House and leases in the Capital Building, saving an estimated £1.3 million. The anticipated use as cruise terminal however had to be abandoned due to the high costs associated with security and border control.|$|E

The Chevron Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700on September16 to 450the next day. Gordon also forced the <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at sea for one day. Residents in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were also advised by radio {{to keep track of the}} approaching hurricane.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Pollock was {{appointed}} as captain on , a German <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> which {{was seized by}} the United States government {{for use as a}} military transport ship. She was rechristened George Washington in September 1917 and Pollock was given her command on October 1, 1917. That December, she set out with her first load of troops. During the war, Pollock successfully transported 60,000 American soldiers to France in 18 round trips. In 1918, the George Washington was tasked to deliver President Woodrow Wilson to the Paris Peace Conference, though Pollock would not make the trip. He was reassigned on September 29, 1918.|$|E

5|$|Dallas {{delivers}} Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David, whereupon it {{is revealed}} {{that she is}} the Fifth Element. Cornelius learns from her that the element stones were not on the Mondoshawans' ship, as they entrusted the stones to the alien Diva Plavalaguna, an opera singer. Zorg kills many of the Mangalores because of their failure to obtain the stones, but their surviving compatriots determine to seize the artifacts in revenge. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that the stones are in Plavalaguna's possession, General Munro, Dallas' former superior, recommissions Dallas and orders him to travel undercover to the planet Fhloston to meet Plavalaguna on a luxury cruise; Dallas takes Leeloo with him. Meanwhile, Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple designed to house the stones, then stows away on the space plane transporting Dallas to the <b>cruise</b> <b>liner.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was first noted in the central Atlantic Ocean on August21. Slowly intensifying, the system initially moved towards the west. On August22, a steamship in the vicinity was sustained some structural damage. After attaining hurricane strength on August24, the system turned northwestward, and reached Category3 intensity on August 25 with maximum sustained winds of 125mph (205km/h) as it grazed Bermuda. Recurving to the northeast, a French <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> encountered the hurricane while it was a Category2 hurricane. A large wave struck the ship, shattering glass on the vessel and injuring 40passengers. Although still a Category2 hurricane, the system became extratropical shortly after on August28. The extratropical storm was tracked due east towards the Azores {{for a few days}} while gradually weakening before abruptly turning to the north and dissipating.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Able was {{expected}} {{to move through the}} Bahamas, people executed standard preparations such as securing windows and bringing ships to harbor. One <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> diverted its route from the Bahamas toward New York. In Florida, the U.S. Air Force made preliminary plans to move planes. Ultimately, the hurricane spared the region. Further north, the United States Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Morehead City, North Carolina to the Eastern Shore of Virginia. There, the hurricane ended up bringing light winds and rough waves. Moderate precipitation occurred along the North Carolina coast. In southern New England, Able dropped 35inches (75125mm) of rainfall, with a peak of 6.89inches (175mm) in Beechwood, Massachusetts. Flooding was reported in portions of New York City. The resulting slick roads from the rains caused nine traffic fatalities across New England. The storm produced 55mph (90km/h) gusts in Nantucket and Cape Cod, along with high tides and waves. Offshore, the waves damaged a freighter headed for Florida.|$|E

5|$|In 1934 the Cunard Steamship Company {{merged with}} the White Star Line to form Cunard White Star Line, which became the largest {{passenger}} steamship company in the world, helping to make Liverpool {{one of the most}} important centres of the British trans-Atlantic ocean liner industry. The Cunard building subsequently acted as the central headquarters for the newly merged firm, with both administrative and ship-designing facilities located within the building. Many ships and liners were developed and designed at the Cunard Building, including the RMS Queen Mary and RMS Queen Elizabeth. Given that Liverpool was a major trans-Atlantic port and due to the building's proximity to the River Mersey, the lower floors of the Cunard Building were allocated to provide space for <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> passengers, both prior to and after sailing. Within the building there were passenger facilities including separate waiting rooms for first, second and third class passengers, a booking hall, luggage storage space, and a currency exchange. The building also provided facilities for both land and sea based Cunard employees. During the Second World War, the sub-basement level of the Cunard Building was used as an air raid shelter for workers in the building and also for those from adjacent premises. The basement levels also served as the central Air Raid Precautions headquarters for the City of Liverpool during the war. Additional reinforced steel joists were fitted to further strengthen the basement in case of a direct hit on the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{demise of}} the once {{thriving}} canal and maltings businesses brought about a serious decline in Banagher's fortunes, including a significant population decrease. However, a number of businesses kept {{many people in the}} locality employed during lean times. The most notable of these was Bord na Móna, a semi-state company founded in 1946 to manage the harvesting of peat from Ireland's bogs, the most extensive of which are located in the midlands. However, the advancement of mechanised harvesting, the exhaustion of the bogs and the closure of a number of peat-fired power stations, means that this is no longer a significant employer in the region. Green Isle Foods had a facility just outside Banagher and provided good employment during the 1970s and 1980s. It was taken out of production some years ago and is now used as a storage facility only. The largest industry in Banagher these days is Banagher Precast Concrete Limited, a company specialising in precast concrete structures. The company employs approximately 150 people {{and was one of the}} largest concrete firms in the country, employing over 400 people at its peak in 2008. It has supplied components for many major projects, including the Aviva Stadium, Croke Park, Channel Tunnel, the Dublin Port Tunnel, Thomond Park and the Limerick Tunnel, and most recently Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Cork. Other notable employers include Banagher Sawmills and the <b>cruise</b> <b>liner</b> businesses located at the marina.|$|E
