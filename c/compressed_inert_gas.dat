40|$|Organic {{chemistry}} applications on digital microfluidic devices often involve reagents {{that are}} volatile or sensitive {{and must be}} introduced to the chip immediately before use. We present a new technique for automated, on-demand loading of ∼ 1 μL droplets from large (∼ 1 mL), sealed, off-chip reservoirs to a digital microfluidic chip {{in order to address}} this challenge. Unlike aqueous liquids which generally are non-wetting to the hydrophobic surface and must be actively drawn into the electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) chip by electrode activation, organic liquids tend to be wetting and can spontaneously flood the chip, and hence require a retracting force for controlled liquid delivery. Using a combination of <b>compressed</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> and gravity to exert driving and retracting forces on the liquid, the simple loading technique enables precise loading of droplets of both wetting and non-wetting liquids in a reliable manner. A key feature from a practical point of view is that all of the wetted parts are inexpensive and potentially disposable, thus avoiding cross-contamination in chemical and biochemical applications. We provide a theoretical treatment of the underlying physics, discuss the effect of geometry and liquid properties on its performance, and show repeatable reagent loading using the technique. Its versatility is demonstrated with the loading of several aqueous and non-Aqueous liquids on an EWOD digital microfluidic device. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013...|$|E
40|$|Household {{aerosols}} are self-contained handheld {{devices for}} spraying {{products such as}} air fresheners, hairspray, surface cleaners, polishes, and deodorants. Industrial aerosols are similar devices for spraying: cleaners, lubricants, paints, and adhesives. They also have hospital and specific medical uses for spraying coagulants and disinfectants. Worldwide around 20 billion devices are manufactured annually and the UK has a major share of this market, manufacturing 5 billion units, {{second only to the}} USA. Led by the Californian Air Resources Board (CARB) in 2001, there is mounting pressure for the use of liquefied gas propellants (volatile organic compounds) in aerosol cans to be banned. This paper addresses the challenges of creating a fine spray using a pressurized inert gas (non-VOC) as the propellant for household aerosols. The spray produced has to achieve a relative performance to that of a traditional fine spray VOC propellant aerosol with regard to droplet size, reach, cone angle, and flow rate. The findings of this work have demonstrated that to achieve a sub- 50 -µm (Dv, 50) spray is extremely challenging when using <b>compressed</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> and single fluid alone. However, by bleeding air into the insert arrangement, a spray of 24 µm (Dv, 50) can be obtained and this is comparable in droplet size to that produced by a traditional fine spray VOC aerosol...|$|E
40|$|Conventional needle-free {{injection}} (NFI) {{devices are}} driven by a pressure source generated by either a compressed spring mechanism or <b>compressed</b> <b>inert</b> <b>gas,</b> which have fixed injection (pressure versus time) profiles. The NFI device developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology BioInstrumentation Laboratory (MIT BiLab) is novel in its use of a Lorentz force voice coil actuator as the pressure source. With servo-control, the applied pressure can be adjusted for injection conditions such as skin toughness and injection depth. The focus of this thesis was on designing, building and characterizing a more compact version of the current NFI device. The proposed design features a reduction of {{the diameter of the}} voice coil motor by packing empty space with an additional set of magnets. A prototype was built, and benchtop tests were conducted to characterize its force sensitivity, the stability of this force sensitivity, and the jet velocity from the syringe. The force sensitivity was found to be 8. 3 N/A, and its consistency was shown to be remarkably stable throughout the stroke of the voice coil. It was found that, with a 200 V input, the voice coil exerted a force of 127 N on the syringe piston, which is equivalent to 12. 7 MPa; this pressure produced a jet velocity of 162 m/s out of the syringe. by Diana Lui.

The gas propels the liquid fuel out of the cylinder through a flexible pipe and then into the gun element of the flamethrower system. The gun consists of a small reservoir, a spring-loaded valve, and an ignition system; depressing a trigger opens the valve, allowing pressurized flammable liquid to flow and pass over the igniter and out of the gun nozzle. The igniter can be one of several ignition systems: A simple type is an electrically-heated wire coil; another used a small pilot flame, fueled with pressurized gas from the system.|$|R

In highwall mining, a horizontal auger or a mining machine enters the coal seam from a surface mine pit {{at the bottom}} of a highwall, and the coal is mined out from a series of parallel holes. Explosions can be prevented by injecting <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> into each hole as it is mined. Coal near the surface has lost most of its methane gas over time. However, in recent years, surface mining has been used for deeper reserves of coal. This trend toward mining deeper reserves has increased the chance of encountering methane, and methane explosions at highwall mining operations have resulted in injuries. HOW <b>INERT</b> <b>GAS</b> WORKS TO PREVENT METHANE EXPLOSIONS A methane explosion requires the presence of sufficient amounts of both methane and oxygen, as well as an ignition source. If the methane cannot be reduced and the ignition source cannot be eliminated, then explosions may be prevented by adding an <b>inert</b> <b>gas,</b> which contains little to no oxygen, to the mixture [FWQA 1970]. Just how much <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> must be added depends on the mining rate, as well as the composition of the <b>inert</b> <b>gas.</b> An explosibility diagram can be used to show whether a methane mixture is explosive after <b>inert</b> <b>gas</b> is added [Zabetakis et al. 1959] (Figure 10 - 1). This diagram indicates that gas mixtures fall into one of three range categories explosive, explosive when mixed with air, and nonexplosive depending on the percentage of methane and percentage of effective inert. Effective inert is calculated from the percentage of excess nitrogen 3 and percentage of carbon dioxide in the mixture...|$|R
