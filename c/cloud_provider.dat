Furthermore, the mechanism guarantees that the cloud federation structure is stable, that is, the <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> do not have incentives to break away from the current federation and join some other federation.

30|$|The <b>cloud</b> <b>provider’s</b> {{resource}} sharing (CPRS) scheme [10] {{was developed to}} study the cooperative behavior of multiple <b>cloud</b> <b>providers.</b> In the CPRS scheme, a hierarchical cooperative game model was designed; it was composed of two interrelated cooperative games to analyze the decisions of <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> to support internal users and to offer service to public cloud users. In the lower-level, the CPRS scheme implemented a stochastic linear programming game model to study the resource and revenue sharing for a given coalition of <b>cloud</b> <b>providers.</b> In the upper-level, the CPRS scheme formulated the coalitional game for which the <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> can form the groups of cooperation to share resource and revenue. Finally, the analytical model based on a Markov chain was used to obtain stable coalitional structure [10]. All the earlier work has attracted {{a lot of attention}} and introduced unique challenges to efficiently solve the {{resource sharing}} problem in C-RAN systems. Compared to these schemes [4, 9] and [10], our proposed scheme attains better system performance.|$|R

50|$|Data breach is a {{big concern}} in cloud computing. A {{compromised}} server could significantly harm the users as well as <b>cloud</b> <b>providers.</b> A variety of information could be stolen.

30|$|There {{are three}} basic cloud service models: (i) Software as a Service (SaaS): <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> can install, operate and access their {{application}} software using a web browser, thus {{eliminating the need}} for customers to run and install the application on their own computers (e.g., Salesforce delivering customer relationship management software); (ii) Platform as a Service (PaaS): <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> deliver <b>cloud</b> platforms which represent an environment for application developers to create and deploy their applications. (e.g., Google App Engine); and (iii) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): <b>cloud</b> <b>providers</b> offer physical (computers, storage) and virtualized computer resources (e.g., Amazon EC 2, and Azure Services Platform).|$|R
5000|$|However, moving data in {{the cloud}} can be a {{difficult}} procedure. [...] In the case of Software as a Service (SaaS), it is difficult particularly if the incumbent <b>cloud</b> <b>provider</b> used proprietary software, or if it altered an open source application.|$|E
50|$|BOSH {{connects to}} the {{underlying}} IaaS layer through an abstraction called the CPI (<b>Cloud</b> <b>Provider</b> Interface).

50|$|To {{help support}} more {{underlying}} infrastructures, BOSH uses {{a concept of}} <b>Cloud</b> <b>Provider</b> Interface (CPI).
