40|$|Aptitude and {{achievement}} data of students detained at the Utah State Industrial School were studied {{in order to}} establish occupational aptitude patterns to serve as guidelines in the formation of a vocational educational curriculum at the institution. Based on scores attained on the California Achievement test, the total group sample was found to be retarded 3. 7 years in achievement level, compared to norms established by this instrument. Based on the scores attained on the General Aptitude Test Battery, the total group sample was found to be significantly below the norms established by this instrument in aptitudes relating to intelligence, verbal, numerical, and <b>clerical</b> <b>perception,</b> and above average norms in manual dexterity and form perception. Occupational aptitude patterns were established from the General Aptitude Test Battery, and it was determined that 60 percent of the student sample group could qualify for seven of these occupational aptitude patterns. Based on established occupational aptitude patterns and other extenuating factors, the type of vocational education curriculum which was suggested for the Utah State Industrial School was a general vocational curriculum with stress on vocational guidance and a well defined work experience program...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the qualitative findings about women's maternal role from an interview study of role integration and health in a U. S. sample of 87 women clerical workers. The data draws from <b>clerical</b> women's <b>perceptions</b> of the satisfactions and stresses they experience in {{their roles as}} mothers, the coping strategies they use, and the resources available to them. The analysis provided is based on participants' descriptions of their subjective experiences as mothers within {{the larger context of}} managing domestic responsibilities and fulltime jobs outside their homes. Results suggest that women in clerical jobs find many aspects of their maternal role satisfying, like participating in their children's growth, nurturing them, receiving unconditional love, and finding companionship. However, they identify multiple and pervasive stresses including boundless worries, strained relationships, overload, child care problems, and financial burdens. Many of their coping strategies are solitary in nature, although they also engage in active problem-solving, especially when they have to juggle child care and occupational responsinilities. Many do not view their spouses as sources of emotional and tangible support in childrearing. In addition to an in-depth discussion of qualitative findings, the authors examine implications for social policy, intervention, and future research about multiple roles and health. maternal role clerical workers feminist qualitative analysis women...|$|R
