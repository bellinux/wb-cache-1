40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the performance of}} wireless transmissions over random fading channels at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The performance criteria we consider are average probability of error and outage probability. We show that as functions of the average SNR, they can both be characterized by two parameters: the diversity and <b>coding</b> <b>gains.</b> They both exhibit identical diversity orders, but their <b>coding</b> <b>gains</b> in decibels differ by a constant. The diversity and <b>coding</b> <b>gains</b> are found {{to depend on the}} behavior of the random SNR's probability density function only at the origin, or equivalently, on the decaying order of the corresponding moment generating function (i. e., how fast the moment generating function goes to zero as its argument goes to infinity). Diversity and <b>coding</b> <b>gains</b> for diversity combining systems are expressed in terms of the diversity branches' individual diversity and <b>coding</b> <b>gains,</b> where the branches can come from any diversity technique such as space, time, frequency, or, multipath. The proposed analysis offers a simple and unifying approach to evaluating the performance of uncoded and (possibly space [...] time) coded transmissions over fading channels, and the method applies to almost all digital modulation schemes, including-ary phaseshift keying, quadrature amplitude modulation, and frequencyshift keying with coherent or noncoherent detection...|$|R

The symbol rate is identical to that of 100BASE-TX (125 megabaud) and the noise immunity of the five-level signaling is also identical to that of the three-level signaling in 100BASE-TX, since 1000BASE-T uses four-dimensional trellis coded modulation (TCM) to achieve a 6 dB <b>coding</b> <b>gain</b> across the four pairs.|$|E

This tool {{is unique to}} Dolby Digital Plus (and unsupported in Dolby Digital), and uses an additional Type II Discrete cosine transform to combine six adjacent transform blocks (located within a syncframe) into an effectively longer block. In addition to the two-stage transform, a different bit-allocation structure is used, and two ways of representing encoded mantissas are deployed: use of vector quantization, which gives the highest <b>coding</b> <b>gain,</b> and use of gain-adapted quantization (GAQ) when greater signal-fidelity is required. Gain-adaptive quantization may be independently enabled for each frequency bin within a channel, and permits variable-length mantissa encoding.|$|E

This object type is based on a general audio transform coding scheme which is integrated with the AAC coding frame work, a spectral flattening module, and a weighted interleave vector quantization module. This scheme reportedly has high <b>coding</b> <b>gain</b> for low bit rate and potential robustness against channel errors and packet loss, since it does not use any variable length coding and adaptive bit allocation. It supports bitrate scalability, both by means of layered TwinVQ coding and in combination with the scalable AAC.|$|E

Secondly, due {{to the way in which}} the compression algorithm is structured as a series of decisions, the same algorithm can be run at the decoder to reconstruct the coefficients, but with the decisions being taken according to the incoming bit stream. In practical implementations, it would be usual to use an entropy code such as arithmetic code to further improve the performance of the dominant pass. Bits from the subordinate pass are usually random enough that entropy coding provides no further <b>coding</b> <b>gain.</b>|$|E
