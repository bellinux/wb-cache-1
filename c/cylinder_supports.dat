40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a dynamometer {{developed for the}} measurement of torque of micromotors {{as a function of}} the rotational speed. The operating principle of the device is based on that of a typical viscometer. The shaft of the micromotor to be tested is coupled to a small cylinder, which is placed concentrically into a larger cylinder. The motor torque is transmitted from the inner cylinder to the outer one by means of a well-known viscosity fluid. A pneumatic <b>cylinder</b> <b>supports</b> the outer cylinder, so that the test is performed under free-friction conditions and the torque is determined by a lever arm in contact with a load cell...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that heat {{conduction}} to mounting systems significantly affects the heat transfer characteristics of cylinders in cross-flow unless the length-to-diameter ratio is large, typically over 1000. For inclined cylinders in cross-flow an additional effect exists due to significant aerodynamic interference of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>supports</b> with the flow. The effective cooling velocity, C, of inclined cylinders such as hot-wire anemometer sensors is frequently described in terms of the velocity with the cylinder normal to the flow, U, and the angle between the cylinder normal and the flow, α, by C = U(cos 2 α + K 2 sin 2 α) 0. 5 Extensive investigations have indicated that k 2 is predominantly a function of the cylinder length-to-diameter ratio. Arguments are presented which show that the k 2 term describes the effective turning of the flow through a small angle. This interpretation shows that for narrow support spacings, flow channelling by the supports, which causes the flow to be more normal to the cylinder, gives the apparent increase in cooling above the 2 ̆ 7 cosine law 2 ̆ 7 so frequently reported. New measurements with inclined hot-wire anemometers show that when interference with the flow over the cylinder {{is expected to be a}} minimum, that is, at large length-to-diameter ratios, typically larger than 1000, k 2 assumes negative values...|$|E

The conical receptacle of the first spacecraft constitutes an exterior portion of a sealed gas-tight compartment. Pressurization of the sealed compartment causes the conical receptacle to extend toward the incoming conical projection of the second spacecraft. When the mating conical portions are latched together, the docking energy is absorbed by the compressed gas in the sealed compartment. Rebound forces are countered by a plurality of actuator <b>cylinders</b> <b>supporting</b> the conical receptacle...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the small-particle phonon-polariton response of several microstructures {{that are made}} of silicon carbide (SiC). Phonon polaritons can be excited in a wavelength region between 10 and 12 µm. Simple structures such as elliptical <b>cylinders</b> <b>support</b> phonon polaritons at two wavelengths, which depend on the axis ratio of the particle. In particles with a more irregular shape such as rectangular or triangular cylinders, up to five phonon polaritons can be excited. Through comparison {{of the strength of}} phonon-polariton excitation with the similar effect of the plasmon-polariton excitation in metallic nanoparticles, it is found that the excitation of phonon polaritons is more efficient. This behavior is attributed to the lower imaginary part of the dielectric constant of SiC...|$|R

The <b>cylinder</b> <b>support</b> crane telescopic booms deformation {{and stability}} analysis {{model in the}} lifting plane is equivalent with the multistep column with elastic restraint. To analyze the lateral flexibility and vertical stability of the telescopic booms with elastic restraint accurately, this paper established the deflection differential equations of multi-sectioned telescopic booms with second-order effect, introduced proper boundary conditions, obtained the precise recurrence lateral deflection differential equations and the buckling characteristic equations of arbitrary sectioned telescopic booms, and some practical applications of the buckling characteristic equations were presented.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been carried}} out {{to examine the effects of}} triplestarting helical grooves on the drag of fixed circular cylinders and the vortex-induced vibration of elastically <b>supported</b> <b>cylinders.</b> For the elastically <b>supported</b> <b>cylinder,</b> the Reynolds number varied from 1. 3 x 104 to 4. 6 x 104, whilst for the fixed cylinder from 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 75 x 105. A comparative approach which allows direct comparisons of the results was adopted where two cylinders of identical dimensions and physical properties with or without helical surface grooves were tested in exactly same experimental set-ups. In the elastically <b>supported</b> <b>cylinder</b> tests, the cylinders were attached to a vertically cantilevered supporting rod and towed in a towing tank. Both the in-line and cross-flow vibrations were permitted. In the fixed cylinder tests, the <b>cylinders</b> were <b>supported</b> on rigid vertical struts and towed horizontally in the same towing tank. It is found that for the case investigated the helical grooves were effective in suppressing the vortex-induced cross-flow vibration amplitudes with the peak amplitude reduced by 64 %. Drag reductions of up to 25 % were also achieved in the sub-critical Reynolds number range tested in the study for the fixed cylinders...|$|R

To create them, d'Alesi sketched the highlights from a year-long trip he took between Marseille and Yokohama. He then directed a large team of decorative and scene painters for eight months, to transfer the sketches onto the 20,000 m² (215,000 square feet) of canvas. Mounted on large <b>cylinders</b> <b>supported</b> by floats, and driven by hydraulic motors, the two canvases unrolled past the spectators {{over the course of the}} simulated journey.

5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single <b>cylinder</b> <b>supported</b> by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{stability}} and nonlinear dynamics are studied for a slender flexible cylinder subjected to axial flow. A nonlinear model is presented, {{based on the}} corresponding linear equation of motion, for dynamics of the <b>cylinder</b> <b>supported</b> at both ends. The nonlinear terms considered here are the quadratic viscous force and the additional axial force induced by the lateral motions of the cylinder. Using two-mode discretized equation, numerical simulations are carried out for the dynamical behavior of the cylinder to explain, with this relatively simple nonlinear model, the flutter instability found in experiment. The results of numerical analysis show that at certain value of flow velocity the system loses stability by divergence, and the buckled configuration becomes unstable at higher flow leading to post-divergence flutter. As the flow velocity increases further, the system is restabilized in the buckled configuration prior to another dynamic instability at higher flow...|$|R

The gas <b>cylinder,</b> <b>support</b> structures, brackets, lugs and other devices are welded in place.

Most depictions of rhinoceroses in Shang, Zhou and Han art show two distinct horns, {{and in some cases}} wrinkles around the eyes are also evident, which are features only found in the Sumatran Rhinoceros (Indian and Javan rhinoceroses only having a single horn). [...] However, a few examples of sculptures showing one-horned rhinoceroses are also known, for example on a bronze <b>cylinder</b> <b>supported</b> by three rhinoceroses from the tomb of King Cuo of Zhongshan (late 4th century BC).

[...] On the other hand, the posterior horn of the Sumatran Rhinoceros is often undeveloped and inconspicuous, so it is still possible that such examples of one-horned rhinoceroses may in fact also represent the Sumatran Rhinoceros.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a weak structural nonlinearity on the dynamical behaviour of a vertical offshore riser subjected to vortex-induced vibration (VIV). Coupling of the riser dynamics with the flow of the surrounding fluid is achieved by attaching a wake oscillator to a reduced model of the structure, which is obtained through the application of the invariant manifold technique for the derivation of nonlinear normal modes. The structure is modeled as an Euler–Bernoulli beam excited at modal frequencies by vortices in the form of wake oscillators of Van der Pol type as shown in Figure 1. The rise may move only in the direction normal to flow (Fig. 1 (b)), an assumption that is quite valid when its flowwise displacement is relatively small. For flexible <b>cylinders</b> <b>supported</b> at both ends, experimental investigations show that the cross-flow response dominates over the inline motion in terms of amplitude [18], therefore having a greater contribution in the fatigue of the riser’s material.
