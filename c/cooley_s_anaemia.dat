40|$|Background: A {{study is}} {{presented}} of 10 {{children with a}} novel syndrome born to consanguineous parents from the Irish Traveller population. The syndrome is characterised by a natural killer (NK) cell deficiency, evidence of an atypical Fanconi 2 ̆ 7 s type DNA breakage disorder, and features of familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD). The NK cell deficiency probably accounts for the patients 2 ̆ 7 recurrent viral illnesses. Molecular tests support a diagnosis of mosaic Fanconi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>anaemia,</b> but the patients do not present {{with any of the}} expected clinical features of the disorder. The symptomatic presentation of FGD was delayed in onset and may be a secondary phenotype. As all three phenotypes segregate together, the authors postulated that the NK cell deficiency, DNA repair disorder and FGD were caused by a single recessive genetic event. Methods: Single-nucleotide polymorphism homozygosity mapping and targeted next-generation sequencing of 10 patients and 16 unaffected relatives. Results: A locus for the syndrome was identified at 8 p 11. 21 -q 11. 22. Targeted resequencing of the candidate region revealed a homozygous mutation in MCM 4 /PRKDC in all 10 affected individuals. Consistent with the observed DNA breakage disorder, MCM 4 and PRKDC are both involved in the ATM/ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated/ATM-Rad 3 -related) DNA repair pathway, which is defective in patients with Fanconi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>anaemia.</b> Deficiency of PRKDC in mice has been shown to result in an abnormal NK cell physiology similar to that observed in these patients. Conclusion: Mutations in MCM 4 /PRKDC represent a novel cause of DNA breakage and NK cell deficiency. These findings suggest that clinicians should consider this disorder in patients with failure to thrive who develop pigmentation or who have recurrent infections...|$|R

25|$|In 1923, the {{airfield}} {{was taken over}} by the Cooley family. Charles P. Cooley was the primary flight instructor in San Carlos at the time, after returning from battle. The airport itself was legally operated by <b>Cooley's</b> father, Frank <b>S.</b> <b>Cooley.</b> On July 12, 1940, a fire destroyed the main hangar and twelve aircraft. The family then vacated the property in 1935, closing the airport and the flight school and moving their operations to a new airfield near today's Twin Dolphin Drive in San Carlos. By March 1950, {{the airfield}} had a 200ft by 2100ft runway and a building for various industries on the airfield. However, the Cooley family soon regarded the airport as being inadequate due to its proximity to the Phelpes Slough and Steinberger Slough and poor ground conditions for a suitable runway. They opened another airfield at the present location of the San Carlos airport. By March 1952, the Cooley family transferred ownership of the airfield to Mr. Francis Michaud, who renamed it San Carlos-Belmont Airport. Many repair and administrative buildings were added along with plans to expand the runway up to 7000ft in length. In 1957, the airport was renamed as San Mateo Country Airport, Inc. Ownership was also split between Michaud, the Piombo Construction Company and six other parties.|$|R

Intestinal parasitic infections are known to affect both growth and haemoglobin levels. Much has been reported on the impact of geohelminths on anaemia and undernutrition, leaving that of Schistosoma mansoni not well studied. Therefore this study intended to determine the association between <b>S.</b> mansoni infections, <b>anaemia</b> and undernutrition among schoolchildren in Rorya district, Northwestern Tanzania. A cross-sectional study was carried among schoolchildren in two onshore villages namely Busanga and Kibuyi in Rorya district. Single stool specimens were collected from 513 randomly selected schoolchildren and processed for microscopic examination using the Kato-Katz method. Nutritional status was determined by anthropometry. Blood samples were also collected and examined for malaria parasites and haemoglobin levels using the Giemsa stain and HaemoCue methods, respectively. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic data and associated factors. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection and malaria was 84. 02 % and 9. 16 %, respectively. Other parasites found were Ascaris lumbricoides (1. 36 %) and Hookworm (1. 36 %). The prevalence of stunting and wasting was 38. 21 % and 14. 42 %, respectively. The prevalence of anaemia was 29. 43 %, whereby 0. 58 % had severe <b>anaemia.</b> <b>S.</b> mansoni infection was not found to be associated with undernutrition or anaemia (p> 0. 05). The risk of stunting and wasting increased with increasing age (p< 0. 001). Anaemia was associated with age, sex and village of residence (p< 0. 05). S. mansoni, undernutrition and anaemia are highly prevalent in the study area. The observed rates of undernutrition and anaemia were seen not to be associated with S. mansoni infection suggesting possibly being a result of poor dietary nutrients.

For many years downtown Boise was a desolate wasteland. Very few people frequented downtown, and nearly no one resided downtown. From the late 1960 s to the mid 1970 s nearly eight city blocks of Boise's Central Business District were demolished with money from Federal Urban Renewal Grants. Thereafter, the redevelopment of downtown Boise was stopped for 15 years due to the supposedly imminent arrival of a downtown, enclosed, retail mall. Thanks to {{the vision of a}} few politicians and the actions of a couple of agencies Downtown Boise recovered. This thesis analyzes the mistakes and wisdom of Boise's urban renewal efforts as well as the actions of politicians and agencies in making downtown Boise into a successful mixed-use downtown. In particular, this thesis focuses on what went wrong during Boise's first downtown urban renewal attempt and the actions and practices put into place to ensure the same mistakes did not occur during the second renewal period. I will conclude by highlighting the lessons learned through the process of rejuvenating downtown Boise. This thesis is intended to aid cities that find themselves in the desolate situation Downtown Boise found itself 15 years ago. By understanding both the process by which downtown Boise was changed and the lessons learned throughout the first and second urban renewal endeavors, {{it is my hope that}} cities will gain ideas to assist them in the rebuilding and improving of their own downtowns. by Matthew <b>Cooley</b> Smith.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{inherited}} disorders {{are associated with}} bone marrow failure. Amongst them Fanconi's anaemia (FA) {{is the most common}} and, together with dyskeratosis congenita (DC), the best characterized. The aim of this study was twofold: A. To devise a strategy which may prermit "expression cloning" of the FA genes. B: To characterise cytogenetic (and molecular) features of cells from FA and DC patients which may provide {{a better understanding of the}} basis of these disorders. As a first step towards cloning the gene (<b>s)</b> for Fanconi's <b>anaemia</b> (FA) I devised a selection system [based on the DNA cross-linking agents mitomycin-c (MMC) and diepoxybutane (DEB) ] that discriminates between FA and normal cells. 'Mixing experiments' (where approximately 10 normal cells were co-plated with 106 FA cells) demonstrated that it is possible to kill FA cells at high density without significantly affecting the cloning efficiency of normal cells. Transfection of FA fibroblasts with normal DNA (mouse genomic, human genomic, and human cDNA) either by calcium phosphate precipitation or by electroporation yielded 11 DEB and MMC resistant colonies. However, southern analysis of the DNA from these colonies with the appropriate probes gave no positive signal, and thus no "handle" to recover the FA gene (s). Experiments addressing the effect of the specific DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, on FA and normal cells showed: 1. The FA lymphocytes have increased chromosomal breakage compared to normal lymphocytes after incubation with camptothecin (p= 0. 006). 2. Incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) from normal subjects with camptothecin, produced the same type of chromosomal breakage as that seen in FA lymphocytes. 3. FA fibroblasts were more sensitive to camptothecin than normal fibroblasts. These data are compatible with either a defect which makes topoisomerase I more crucial, or its function being abnormal in some FA patients. In patients with DC, primary skin fibroblast cultures were abnormal in both morphology and growth rate. Survival studies using 4 clastogens and gamma-irradiation showed no significant difference between DC and normal fibroblasts. Cytogenetic studies performed on pbl showed no difference between DC and normal lymphocytes with or without prior incubation with clastogens. However, bone marrow from 1 out of 3 patients and fibroblasts from 2 out of 4 patients showed numerous unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements in the absence of clastogenic agents. Although patients with FA and DC share some features in common they appear to differ in two fundamental ways: Firstly, unlike Fanconi cells, DC cells are not hypersensitive to clastogens. Secondly the primary defect in DC appears to predipose cells to developing chromosomal rearrangements rather than to chromosomal gaps and breaks seen in FA...|$|R
