5000|$|The {{process of}} {{dissolving}} {{carbon dioxide in}} water is called carbonation. <b>Commercial</b> <b>soda</b> water in siphons is made by chilling filtered plain water to 8 C or below, optionally adding a sodium or potassium based alkaline compound such as sodium bicarbonate to reduce acidity, and then pressurizing the water with carbon dioxide.

He was accused of cupidity, for liquidating his sugar importing company (Perier, Berlioz & Rey) by paying investors in depreciated assignats, and more seriously, of supporting an anti-Jacobin revolt in southern France at Lyons. There was some substance to these charges - Claude Perier's opportunism was not always circumspect.

40|$|Imperfections {{in glass}} formed during {{manufacture}} or subsequent transportation can weaken bottles, creating a hazard by {{causing them to}} fail at lower pressure. When soda glass bottles are pressurized to fracture, the crack density in the broken glass and the fracture pressure are highly correlated.

Thus, after failure it is possible to estimate the pressure to which a bottle was subjected by analyzing the glass fragments. The crack patterns and density agree with analytical models for crack branching in brittle materials under stress.

The modulating effect on postprandial oxidative stress by an antioxidant-rich beverage, fermented rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) was compared to that of a commercial soft drink (soda). Both study beverages contained sucrose and were consumed with a standardised fat meal. The study consisted of two parts, a pilot study (Phase One) where participants consumed either a standardised fat meal with water (control group n = 5) or a standardised fat meal with a sucrose-containing <b>commercial</b> <b>soda</b> (treatment group n = 8) using a parallel design, and the experimental study (Phase Two) where participants (n = 14) consumed the standardised fat meal with the <b>commercial</b> <b>soda</b> (control group) or the rooibos beverage (treatment group) using a crossover design. Specific analytical techniques and methods for determination of plasma glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, an inflammatory indicator (high sensitive C-reactive protein), plasma antioxidant capacity, whole blood redox status and plasma lipid oxidation biomarkers were used. Results from the pilot study indicated significantly (P< 0. 05) higher postprandial levels of glucose in the control group at 4 hr and 6 hr postprandially. The inflammatory biomarker and triglyceride levels were significantly (P< 0. 05) elevated in both groups when compared to their respective baselines. Results also showed the total antioxidant capacity and total glutathione levels in the plasma of both groups to be significantly (P< 0. 05) lowered when compared to the baseline values. The level of lipid oxidation biomarkers in the plasma was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher at 2 hr, 4 hr and 6 hr post time intervals for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and 4 hr post time interval for conjugated dienes in the participants consuming the standardised fat meal with soda when compared to the baseline value, while this was reflected only at 2 hr post time interval for thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, with the conjugated dienes levels being significantly (P< 0. 05) lowered at 6 hr post time interval in the control group. No differences were shown on inter group level for the pilot study. On inter group level, results from Phase Two showed significant (P< 0. 05) lower levels of plasma glucose at 6 hr post time interval in the treatment group when compared to the control group, with insulin levels being significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the control group at 4 hr post time interval...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this paper shows {{that the use of}} the single aliquot regeneration (SAR) method for thermoluminescence (TL) measurements applied to soda lime glasses allows to carry out a retrospective dose evaluation. We have followed a fast and efficient sample preparation procedure which permits measurements without powdering and sieving processes. We have analyzed the TL signal of <b>commercial</b> <b>soda</b> lime watch glass irradiated with 6 Mega Volts (MV) LINAC photons, 10 MeV LINAC electrons and 62 MeV protons. After the initial exposure and following TL reading, the samples are successively irradiated with increasing doses of photons. Therefore, for each sample its calibration curve is constructed and the initial dose is reconstructed. We have found that for samples initially irradiated with photons the SAR procedure allows to reconstruct dose of 1 Gy with an accuracy of 20 %. The application of the SAR procedure has highlighted the ability of measuring even low photon doses (e. g. ≈ 0. 5 Gy) with appreciable accuracy. The application of the SAR method for samples initially exposed to electrons and protons provides values of reconstructed doses less accurate. The effect of the fading on the dose reconstruction with this SAR procedure is also discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{is focused}} on the {{optimization}} of a green process based on the employment of by-products obtained from wood treatments as raw materials for producing flexible polyurethane foams. More specifically, lignin was employed in flexible polyurethane foams in order to partially replace the usual fossil polyols; therefore glycerol (GLY) and glycerin polyglycidyl ether (EJ 300) were used as the polyol fraction for lignin liquefaction. Polypropylene glycol triol was used as a chain extender in different ratios with liquefaction solvents, and polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate as an isocyanate fraction. Liquefaction of lignin was performed by microwave irradiation, thus reducing the processing time and energy required compared to present industrial production processes. All the foams were produced in controlled expansion through the adoption of a one-shot' approach, using water as a blowing agent and with an isocyanate index (NCO/OH) of less than 100 to improve the flexibility of the foam. This approach allowed for the substitution of up to 12 % of common petro derived polyol with <b>commercial</b> <b>soda</b> lignin. Finally, the foams were characterized, presenting properties that could be modulated as a function of lignin content, GLY/EJ 300 ratio and isocyanate index.

The stack was then treated with cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) at different temperatures using a constant treatment time. The effect of the CdCl 2 treatment was studied using optical, materials, and electrical characterization of the samples and compared with the as-deposited CdZnTe film with the same stack configuration. The band gap deduced from Tauc plots on the as-deposited CdZnTe thin film was 1. 72 [*]eV. The deposited film had good crystalline quality with a preferred orientation along the { 111 } plane. After the CdCl 2 treatment, the absorption edge shifted toward longer wavelength region and new peaks corresponding to cadmium telluride (CdTe) emerged in the x-ray diffraction pattern. This suggested loss of zinc after the CdCl 2 treatment. The cross sectional transmission electron microscope images of the sample treated at 400 [*]°C and the energy dispersive elemental maps revealed the absence of chlorine along the grain boundaries of CdZnTe and residual CdTe. The presence of chlorine in the CdTe devices plays {{a vital role in}} drastically improving the device performance which was not observed in CdZnTe samples treated with CdCl 2. The loss of zinc from the surface and incomplete recrystallization of the grains together with the presence of high densities of stacking faults were observed. The surface images using scanning electron microscopy showed that the morphology of the grains changed from small spherical shape to large grains formed due to the fusion of small grains with distinct grain boundaries visible at the higher CdCl 2 treatment temperatures. The absence of chlorine along the grain boundaries, incomplete recrystallization and distinct grain boundaries is understood to cause the poor performance of the fabricated devices...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the history of natural and human-induced {{environmental}} change as recorded in the sediments of two lakes: Mountain Lake in the Presidio National Park, San Francisco, California and Big Soda Lake, near Fallon, Churchill County, Nevada. The records of these lakes examined in this study cover approximately the last 2, 000 years. Sediment cores from the lakes were dated with radiocarbon, lead- 210, plutonium 240 / 239, tephrachronology, and the first appearance of non-native pollen types. The cores were analyzed to determine changes in stable isotopes (carbon and oxygen), sediment chemistry, fossil pollen, magnetic susceptibility, organic content, and brine shrimp cyst concentrations. Big Soda Lake {{has been the subject of}} scientific investigation since the 19 th Century and two famous scientists have previously worked at the site. First, the geologist, Israel Russell explored the lake in 1882 as part of his work on Pleistocene Lake Lahontan and provided the first scientific report on the lake. Later in 1933, Evelyn Hutchinson, the famous Yale limnologist, provided the first detailed limnological report for the lake. More recently in the 1980 's, the lake has been studied by scientists from the United States Geological Survey. However, prior to the research reported on here, very little was known of the history of the lake or to what extent its sediments contained a useful record of environmental change. The sediments of Big Soda Lake provide clear evidence for both natural and human-induced environmental change during the past 1600 years. The climate record developed from the analyses of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon, sediment chemistry, and the concentrations of brine shrimp cysts show several significant shifts in climate. The early part of the record from A. D. 400 - 850 is period marked by a fluctuating climate, with alternating wet/dry phases each lasting several decades each (40 - 60 years). During the period known as the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) (A. D. 850 - 1400), we observe at least two relatively dry periods from A. D. 850 - 1150 and A. D. 1260 - 1400. Between the two dry phases, there is a pronounced wet period from A. D. 1150 - 1260. This wet period matches fairly well with evidence presented in other paleoenvironmental studies in the western Great Basin. During the Little Ice Age (LIA), the evidence indicates that the Big Soda Lake area was not always colder and/or wetter, but that it was in fact drier and perhaps warmer from A. D. 1400 - 1700 than it had been in the previous millennium. Pronounced dry phases were observed around A. D. 1400, A. D. 1500 and A. D. 1650. The wettest period during the LIA came between A. D. 1750 - 1800. The human impact record at Big Soda Lake developed from the analyses of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon, sediment chemistry, and the concentrations of brine shrimp cysts show several dramatic changes in and around the lake since Anglo American settlement of the area began, in the 1850 's. Several human impacts have been identified, including regional mining activity, soda salt extraction from the lake, and irrigation induced rising groundwater levels in the last century. Two of these events have dramatically impacted the lake in that time. Firstly, the development of a <b>commercial</b> <b>soda</b> manufacturing and processing facility at the lake beginning in 1875 until the early 20 th century; and secondly, the development of irrigation agriculture which led to an 18 m rise in lake level in the first few decades of the twentieth century. The sediments at Mountain Lake provide evidence of unprecedented heavy metal contamination at the San Francisco Presidio during the past 60 years. The lake evidence is consistent with local land-use changes initiated by the arrival of Europeans in the area after 1776 and the construction of California State Highway 1 adjacent to the lake in the late 1930 's. The study shows how small water bodies alongside roads can concentrate heavy metals and demonstrates the need for careful scientific investigation of sediments earmarked for dredging to determine what if any contaminants are present. A key outcome of the Mountain Lake research carried out as part of this dissertation was that in the Fall of 2011 a Federal judge ordered the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to pay 13. 5 million dollars to the Presidio Trust so that the contaminated sediments could be removed and further run-off from the road be prevented from entering the lake...|$|E
