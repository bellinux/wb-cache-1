5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by the neutron {{activation}} of molybdenum-98. When needed, other technetium isotopes are not produced in significant quantities by fission, but are manufactured by neutron irradiation of parent isotopes (for example, technetium-97 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> neutron irradiation of ruthenium-96).|$|E
5|$|Charcoal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E

5|$|Parts <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> hot {{pressing}} from four commercial grades of h-BN. Grade HBN contains a boron oxide binder; it is usable up to 550–850°C in oxidizing atmosphere {{and up to}} 1600°C in vacuum, but due to the boron oxide content is sensitive to water. Grade HBR uses a calcium borate binder and is usable at 1600°C. Grades HBC and HBT contain no binder {{and can be used}} up to 3000°C.|$|E
5|$|Two {{series of}} {{nitrogen}} oxohalides are known: the nitrosyl halides (XNO) and the nitryl halides (XNO2). The first are very reactive gases that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> directly halogenating nitrous oxide. Nitrosyl fluoride (NOF) is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent. Nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) behaves {{in much the}} same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent. Nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) is red. The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar: nitryl fluoride (FNO2) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, {{and there is}} some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E

5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium {{that can be used to}} make a target. The light isotopes <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> oxidising alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E
5|$|Military squads can be {{assigned}} to a barracks to train in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be directly commanded to attack enemies. Crossbows {{can be made for}} ranged attacks and a range with targets can be constructed for training. Walls can be carved into fortifications and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Training areas can be made to train war animals like dogs. Players can use traps and engineering in addition to training an army. Traps <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> constructing mechanisms and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or cages. More complex lever-operated and pressure plate-triggering trap components are available.|$|E

5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have interchangeable barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low {{white blood cell count}} (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|As the {{character}} progresses through the game, experience points (XP) are earned from accomplishing various actions, such as completing a quest, killing an enemy, and so forth, {{with a new}} level granted upon reaching the necessary amount of XP. A new level grants the player the ability to allocate points to the various Skills available and thus improve upon them, making them more effective; for instance, a higher lock-picking skill allows the player {{to be able to}} tackle more difficult locks on doors and containers, while a higher medicine skill increases the amount of health recovered with Stimpaks. Once {{the character}} achieves their second level, they can be granted a Perk, which offers advantages of varying quality and form, such as being able to carry more items, finding more ammo in containers, and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied, often requiring a certain Skill level to acquire them, while a new Perk can be granted for every two levels earned by the character. Additional improvements to Skill levels <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> finding Skill books, which confer a permanent boost to levels, while players can also search for and find a series of around 20 bobbleheads that also confer a bonus to these and also primary attributes.|$|E

5|$|The pale-brown bromine monofluoride (BrF) is {{unstable}} at room temperature, disproportionating {{quickly and}} irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct {{reaction of the}} elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. Bromine monochloride (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though it <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in carbon tetrachloride. Bromine monofluoride in ethanol readily leads to the monobromination of the aromatic compounds PhX (para-bromination occurs for X = Me, But, OMe, Br; meta-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO2Et, –CHO, –NO2); {{this is due to}} heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br+.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E
