Load control is considered to be one of the most important parts for future horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) designs. Deploying effective <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> on the blades could either increase loads at off-design wind speed conditions or reduce the extreme loads, leading to either higher energy output or a more stable energy output from the wind turbine.

40|$|Abstract—Power <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>devices</b> such as phase {{shifting}} transformers are increasingly {{important in the}} power system. They can increase reliability and can serve {{as an alternative to}} new investments in overhead lines, which are difficult {{due to a lack of}} public support. Furthermore, they are an important means of control for a transmission system operator in the liber-alized market. HVDC links recently also got renewed attention as they do not only provide the possibility to <b>control</b> the power <b>flow,</b> but can also be economically competitive to underground ac cables [1]. Especially with the emergence of VSC HVDC applications for bulk power transport, HVDC is a real alternative in the meshed power system. The usage of power <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>devices</b> in a meshed grid causes the power to flow along alternative paths. However, these devices, and especially HVDC and VSC HVDC, incorporate significant losses. Furthermore, the shifting of power to other lines can cause losses in other parts of the grid. In this paper, the losses caused by the different power <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> elements are discussed, and afterwards their influence on the power system losses of a meshed grid are investigated. An important issue that is addressed in this paper is the use of multiple power <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>devices</b> in one grid, consisting of multiple control areas.

The Reynolds number was Reh = 2. 0 × 104, {{based on the}} free-stream velocity and the backward-facing step height. Three types of <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices,</b> which {{are referred to as}} acoustic tube (AT), oscillating flap (OF) and vortex generators (VGs), were implemented independently on the backward-facing step in order to <b>control</b> the turbulent <b>flow</b> separation downstream of the step. For each implementation of the devices, 2 D- 2 C planar particle image velocimetry was used to measure the separated shear layer, recirculation region and reattachment area downstream. Moreover, 3 D- 3 C(t) timeresolved tomographic particle image velocimetry was employed, within a threedimensional volume at a high sampling frequency, to measure the three-dimensional fluid motions in the separated shear layer downstream of the vortex generators. The first <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>device</b> under investigation in the present work was the acoustic tube. As an active <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>device,</b> the acoustic tube generated periodic pressure perturbations influencing the flow through a spanwise thin slot close to the separation edge at an actuation frequency of fa = 100 Hz, which was close to the most-amplified frequency of the shedding instability of the turbulent shear layer.

As a result of this cycle-to-cycle variability, fuel injection systems are calibrated to inject more fuel than necessary, in an attempt to ensure that the engines fire on every cycle.

Road vehicles are still largely a consumer product and as such the styling of a vehicle becomes {{a significant factor in}} how commercially successful a vehicle will become. The influence of styling combined with the numerous other factors to consider in a vehicle development programme means that the optimum aerodynamic package is not possible in real world applications. Aerodynamicists are continually looking for more discrete and innovative ways to reduce the drag of a vehicle. The current thesis adds to this work by investigating the influence of active <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> on the aerodynamic drag of square back style road vehicles. A number of different types of <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> are reviewed and the performance of synthetic jets and pulsed jets are investigated on a simple 2 D cylinder flow case experimentally. A simplified ¼ scale vehicle model is equipped with active <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> actuators and their effects on the body drag investigated. The influence of the global wake size and the smaller scale in-wake structures on vehicle drag is investigated and discussed.
