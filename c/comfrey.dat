5|$|Immediately {{following}} the tornado in <b>Comfrey</b> there was {{uncertainty about the}} town's long-term survival. Then in the week {{following the}} tornado the town decided to rebuild the school, {{and as a result}} most of Comfrey's businesses decided to follow suit. Ground was broken on the new school early the next year, and it opened to students on October 4, 1999. The population of <b>Comfrey</b> is down to 367 from the 425 it was when the tornado hit.|$|E
5|$|With {{a path of}} , the <b>Comfrey</b> tornado had the fifth-longest {{track of}} any tornado on record in Minnesota. It is however the longest continuous-track tornado in Minnesota history, meaning {{that it was the}} longest to have been {{observed}} to always be in contact with the ground. The damage from the F4 tornado that struck <b>Comfrey</b> is the strongest ever measured in Minnesota during the month of March. The previous strongest-measured were two F3's, occurring on March 27, 1905, and March 26, 1921.|$|E
5|$|Four {{additional}} tornadoes {{touched down}} this day. A tornado that {{was associated with}} the main supercell touched down briefly near Fulda, Minnesota, at 3:55pm, while the <b>Comfrey</b> tornado was also on the ground. It was rated as an F1 and caused minor damage. Three other tornadoes that were all unrelated to the main supercell were confirmed as well; one in southeast Minnesota near Wabasha and two in Wisconsin. All three were rated F0 on the Fujita Scale and produced only minor damage.|$|E
25|$|Examples include: Ackee fruit, Bajiaolian, Camphor, Copaltra, Cycasin, Garcinia, Kava leaves, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, Horse {{chestnut}} leaves, Valerian, <b>Comfrey.</b> Chinese herbal remedies: Jin Bu Huan, Ma-huang, Shou Wu Pian, Bai Xian Pi.|$|E
25|$|The {{scarlet tiger}} moth Callimorpha (Panaxia) dominula (family Arctiidae) occurs in {{continental}} Europe, western Asia and southern England. It is a day-flying moth, noxious-tasting, with brilliant warning colour in flight, but cryptic at rest. The moth is colonial in habit, and prefers marshy ground or hedgerows. The preferred food of the larvae is the herb <b>Comfrey</b> (Symphytum officinale). In England {{it has one}} generation per year.|$|E
25|$|Lanolin from sheep's wool {{is found}} in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common {{ingredient}} in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the <b>comfrey</b> plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the tornado}} in <b>Comfrey,</b> {{residents}} {{were forced to}} temporarily evacuate the town due to several gas leaks, and the Minnesota National Guard {{was called in to}} help secure the area. Because the town's K–12 school was destroyed, students resumed classes two weeks later [...] to the north in Sanborn. Since many <b>Comfrey</b> residents were displaced to nearby towns, school buses from <b>Comfrey</b> drove to each town to provide children transportation to the school in Sanborn. To help stock their classrooms, the school used equipment and supplies that had been salvaged from the damage as well as items that had been donated.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 4:30pm the twister, which witnesses {{described as}} a [...] "mass of blowing dust" [...] or [...] "rolling fog bank" [...] entered <b>Comfrey,</b> a town of 550people located in both Cottonwood and Brown Counties. Comfrey's fire chief saw the tornado while storm spotting and ordered the town's sirens activated. The tornado moved {{through the center of}} <b>Comfrey</b> one minute after the sirens went off, and destroyed a grain elevator, the town hall, three of the town's four churches, the grocery store, and most of the main street businesses downtown. The town's firehouse collapsed, and the school was heavily damaged. Of the 200houses in the town, all but 15suffered damage. Fifty of those homes were destroyed and as a result 100people were left homeless. Approximately 75% of the buildings in <b>Comfrey</b> were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Over $235million {{in damage}} (1998US$) was {{recorded}} from the tornadoes, {{two people were}} killed, and 21others were injured. Most of the damage was caused by three tornadoes—one rated F4 on the Fujita scale that hit the town of <b>Comfrey,</b> Minnesota, an F3 that hit St. Peter, Minnesota, and an F2 that hit Le Center, Minnesota. [...] Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter was especially hard-hit, with several buildings damaged or destroyed, 2,000trees lost, and nearly 80% of the windows on the campus shattered. In <b>Comfrey,</b> 75% of the structures in the town were damaged or destroyed, including the local K–12 school. Seven counties in southern Minnesota were later declared federal disaster areas.|$|E
500|$|March 29, 1998: An F4 and an F3 tornado {{that were}} part of a larger {{outbreak}} tore through the towns of <b>Comfrey</b> and St. Peter. [...] They killed two and caused damage in the millions of dollars in Minnesota's earliest recorded tornado outbreak.|$|E
500|$|Spring {{is a time}} {{of major}} {{transition}} in Minnesota. [...] As winter nears its end, the sun rises higher in the sky and temperatures begin to moderate. As this happens much of the Midwest starts to experience severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. Storm systems that move inland from the Pacific begin to collide with the increasingly warm and moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. [...] In {{the early part of the}} spring, Minnesota is usually not in a geographically favorable position to experience severe weather since the warm air needed for it has not yet pushed that far to the north. [...] Early spring tornado outbreaks do occur occasionally in Minnesota though, as evidenced by the 1998 <b>Comfrey</b> – St. Peter tornado outbreak on March 29, 1998. [...] More often, Minnesota is on the northern (cooler) side of major storm systems in the early spring, which instead results in only rain and possibly snow. [...] Even though the winter snow pack typically starts to melt in southern Minnesota in early March, there is usually still enough cold air present over Canada to allow for major snow storms in Minnesota until late April.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{destructive}} tornado {{of the day}} was a [...] multiple vortex F3 tornado that hit the Minnesota cities of Nicollet and Kasota. It was on the ground for 33 miles, killed one person and caused $30 million in damages. [...] This tornado passed near but did not hit the city of St. Peter, which was devastated by the 1998 <b>Comfrey</b> – St. Peter tornado outbreak.|$|E

[...] Examples include horses in certain tropical nations who have sprained tendons or ligaments are treated with rachette (Nopalea cochenillifera), castor bean leaves (Ricinus communis), aloes (Aloe vera) or leaves of wonder of the world (Kalanchoe pinnata). [...] Natural remedies are also used to treat exercise induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH) with lungwort (Pulmonaria officinalis). Other plants used in combination with conventional medications included liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) root, aerial parts of mullein (Verbascum thapsus) or mallow (Althea), and <b>comfrey</b> (Symphytum officinalis) root.|$|E
2500|$|... "It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{excellent}} provisions of Nature" [...] he wrote in a chapter for the warmest time of the year [...] "that chub are to be angled for on hot summer afternoons ... When the grass is high and full of hum and rustle, when the <b>comfrey</b> blooms along the edge of the water and the air shivers in the heat, the chub lie just under the surface in slacks and corners and eddies all along the bank. You will see them and you will think they have not seen you". His writing and contacts among anglers saw the president of the Piscatorial Society, Sir Robert Saundby, asking Hargreaves to organise the Society's library. With typical thoroughness the collection was removed to Jack's home, leaving it fully catalogued with not a volume unread. This was when he became sceptical about the opinion of the immortal 17th century author of The Compleat Angler, Izaak Walton, as to the culinary qualities of the chub – a dish Hargreaves described as [...] "eating cotton wool full of pins and needles".|$|E
60|$|Where {{the village}} lies {{low in the}} valley and the cottage is near the water, there are wild blooms, too, which almost rival those of the garden in beauty--water agrimony and <b>comfrey</b> with ivory-white and dim purple blossoms, purple and yellow loosestrife and gem-like, water forget-me-not; all these mixed with reeds and sedges and water-grasses, forming a fringe or border to the potato or cabbage patch, {{dividing}} it from the stream.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have very}} bad news. Mr. <b>Comfrey,</b> a lawyer of not the highest standing, who is, I have learnt, acting for this fellow, called upon me. He said, 'I {{am sorry to}} say that I have some painful news to give you, Mr. Pettigrew. Yesterday {{the body of a}} child, a boy some six or seven years old, was found in the canal at Paddington. It was taken to the lockhouse. The {{features}} were entirely unrecognizable, and the police surgeon who examined it said that {{it had been in the}} water over a month. Most of its clothing was gone, partly torn off by barges passing over the body; but there still remained a portion of its underclothing, and this bore the letters W. R. The police recognized them as those of the child who has been so largely advertised for, and, as my client, Mr. Simcoe, had offered a thousand pounds reward, and as all information was to be sent to me, a policeman came down, just as I was closing the office, to inform me of the fact.|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers are}} quite {{different}} from those of the peaty marshes on the opposite side of the district, belonging to an alluvial soil, washed down from the chalk hills. The great reed-mace adorns the Itchen, and going along the disused towing path of the canal there is to be found abundance of the black and golden spikes of the sedge, and the curious balls of the bur-reed, very like the horrid German weapon called a morning star. Also meadow-sweet, meadow-rue, and <b>comfrey</b> of every shade of purple, the water avens and forget-me-not, also that loveliest plant the bog-bean, with trefoil leaves and feathery blossoms. Orchis latifolia is in plenty, and also Orchis incarnata, sometimes called the Romsey orchis. Of late years the mimulus has gilded the bank of one of the ditches. Is it compensation for the Pinguicula vulgaris, which has been drained away, or the mountain pink at Highbridge, which I suspect some gardener of appropriating? Higher up the course of the river, Orchis conopsea, long-spurred and very sweet, the compact Orchis pyramidalis, and the rare Epipactis palustris are to be found, as well as Campanula Glomerata, and crow garlic, in an old chalk-pit nearly destroyed by the railway and the water works.|$|E
60|$|Let {{us up and}} onward to {{that long}} still reach, which is now curling up fast before the breeze; there are large fish to be taken, one or two at least, even before the fly comes on. You need not change your flies; the cast which you have on--governor, and black alder--will take, if {{anything}} will. Only do not waste your time and muscle, as you are beginning to do, by hurling your flies wildly {{into the middle of}} the stream, on the chance of a fish being there. Fish are there, no doubt, but not feeding ones. They are sailing about and enjoying the warmth; but nothing more. If you want to find the hungry fish and to kill them, you must stand well back from the bank--or kneel down, if you are really in earnest about sport; and throw within a foot of the shore, above you or below (but if possible above), with a line short enough to manage easily; by which I mean short enough to enable you to lift your flies out of the water at each throw without hooking them in the docks and <b>comfrey</b> which grow along the brink. You must learn to raise your hand at the end of each throw, and lift the flies clean over the land-weeds: or you will lose time, and frighten all the fish, by crawling to the bank to unhook them. Believe me, one of the commonest mistakes into which young anglers fall is that of fishing in 'skipjack broad;' in plain English, in mid-stream, where few fish, and those little ones, are to be caught. Those who wish for large fish work close under the banks, and seldom take a mid-stream cast, unless they see a fish rise there.|$|E
6000|$|... "The only comfort is, {{the more}} closely they search the sooner {{they will come}} to the {{conclusion}} that the boy is not to be found. I believe that, though they declared they did not recognize the body, they had no real doubt about it, and they only said so because if they had admitted it, the trustees would have had no excuse for not carrying out the provisions of the will. That text the girl had the impudence to quote to me looked as if she believed the body was Walter's, and that I had killed him, though it may be that she only said it to drive me to bringing the whole business into court, by bringing an action against her for libel; but I am not such a fool as to do that. Just at present there is a lot of public feeling excited by the circumstances of the child's loss and the finding of the body, and even if I got a verdict I fancy that the jury would be all on the girl's side, and give me such trifling damages that the verdict would do me more harm than good. No, our game clearly is to let the matter rest until it has died out of the public mind. Then we shall apply formally for the trustees to be called upon to act. No doubt they will give us a great deal of trouble, but <b>Comfrey</b> says that he thinks that the order must be granted at last, though possibly it may be withheld, as far as the estate is concerned, for some years. At any rate I ought to get the ten thousand at once, as the question whether the boy is alive or dead cannot affect that in the slightest." ...|$|E
60|$|Finally, {{to go back}} to its disadvantages, {{the village}} is waterless; at all events in summer, when water is most wanted. Water is such a blessing and joy in a village--a joy for ever when it flows {{throughout}} the year, as at Nether Stowey and Winsford and Bourton-on-the-Water, to mention but three of all those happy villages in the land which are known to most of us! What man on coming to such places and watching the rushing, sparkling, foaming torrent by day and listening to its splashing, gurgling sounds by night, does not resolve that he will live in no village that has not a perennial stream in it! This unblessed, high and dry village has nothing but the winter bourne which gives it its name; a sort of surname common to a score or two of villages in Wiltshire, Dorset, Somerset, and Hants. Here the bed of the stream lies by the bank {{on one side of the}} village street, and when the autumn and early winter rains have fallen abundantly, the hidden reservoirs within the chalk hills are filled to overflowing; then the water finds its way out and fills the dry old channel and sometimes turns the whole street into a rushing river, to the immense joy of the village children. They are like ducks, hatched and reared at some upland farm where there was not even a muddy pool to dibble in. For a season (the wet one) the village women have water at their own doors and can go out and dip pails in it as often as they want. When spring comes it is still flowing merrily, trying to make you believe that it is going to flow for ever; beautiful, green water-loving plants and grasses spring up and flourish along the roadside, and you may see <b>comfrey</b> and water forget-me-not in flower. Pools, too, have been formed in some deep, hollow places; they are fringed with tall grasses, whitened over with bloom of water-crowfoot, and poa grass grows up from the bottom to spread its green tresses over the surface. Better still, by and by a couple of stray moorhens make their appearance in the pool--strange birds, coloured glossy olive-brown, slashed with white, with splendid scarlet and yellow beaks! If by some strange chance a shining blue kingfisher were to appear it could not create a greater excitement. So much attention do they receive that the poor strangers have no peace of their lives. It is a happy time for the children, and a good time for the busy housewife, who has all the water she wants for cooking and washing and cleaning--she may now dash as many pailfuls over her brick floors as she likes. Then the clear, swift current begins to diminish, and scarcely have you had time to notice the change than it is altogether gone! The women must go back to the well and let the bucket down, and laboriously turn and turn the handle of the windlass till it mounts to the top again. The pretty moist, green herbage, the graceful grasses, quickly wither away; dust and straws and rubbish from the road lie in the dry channel, and by and by it is filled with a summer growth of dock and loveless nettles which no child may touch with impunity.|$|E
60|$|I. Among {{the hours}} {{of his life to}} which the writer looks back with {{peculiar}} gratitude, as having been marked by more than ordinary fulness of joy or clearness of teaching, is one passed, now some years ago, near time of sunset, among the broken masses of pine forest which skirt the course of the Ain, above the village of Champagnole, in the Jura. It is a spot which has all the solemnity, with none of the savageness, of the Alps; where {{there is a sense of}} a great power beginning to be manifested in the earth, and of a deep and majestic concord in the rise of the long low lines of piny hills; the first utterance of those mighty mountain symphonies, soon to be more loudly lifted and wildly broken along the battlements of the Alps. But their strength is as yet restrained; and the far-reaching ridges of pastoral mountain succeed each other, like the long and sighing swell which moves over quiet waters from some far-off stormy sea. And there is a deep tenderness pervading that vast monotony. The destructive forces and the stern expression of the central ranges are alike withdrawn. No frost-ploughed, dust-encumbered paths of ancient glacier fret the soft Jura pastures; no splintered heaps of ruin break the fair ranks of her forests; no pale, defiled, or furious rivers rend their rude and changeful ways among her rocks. Patiently, eddy by eddy, the clear green streams wind along their well-known beds; and under the dark quietness of the undisturbed pines, there spring up, year by year, such company of joyful flowers as I know not the like of among all the blessings of the earth. It was Spring time, too; and all were coming forth in clusters crowded for very love; there was room enough for all, but they crushed their leaves into all manner of strange shapes only to be nearer each other. There was the wood anemone, star after star, closing every now and then into nebulæ: and there was the oxalis, troop by troop like virginal processions of the Mois de Marie, the dark vertical clefts in the limestone choked up with them as with heavy snow, and touched with ivy on the edges--ivy as light and lovely as the vine; and ever and anon, a blue gush of violets, and cowslip bells in sunny places; and in the more open ground, the vetch, and <b>comfrey,</b> and mezereon, and the small sapphire buds of the Polygala Alpina, and the wild strawberry, just a blossom or two, all showered amidst the golden softness of deep, warm, amber-colored moss. I came out presently on the edge of the ravine; the solemn murmur of its waters rose suddenly from beneath, mixed with the singing of the thrushes among the pine boughs; and, on the opposite side of the valley, walled all along as it was by grey cliffs of limestone, there was a hawk sailing slowly off their brow, touching them nearly with his wings, and with the shadows of the pines flickering upon his plumage from above; but with a fall of a hundred fathoms under his breast, and the curling pools of the green river gliding and glittering dizzily beneath him, their foam globes moving with him as he flew. It would be difficult to conceive a scene less dependent upon any other interest than that of its own secluded and serious beauty; but the writer well remembers the sudden blankness and chill which were cast upon it when he endeavored, in order more strictly to arrive at the sources of its impressiveness, to imagine it, for a moment, a scene in some aboriginal forest of the New Continent. The flowers in an instant lost their light, the river its music[15]; the hills became oppressively desolate; a heaviness in the boughs of the darkened forest showed how much of their former power had been dependent upon a life which was not theirs, how much of the glory of the imperishable, or continually renewed, creation is reflected from things more precious in their memories than it, in its renewing. Those ever springing flowers and ever flowing streams had been dyed by the deep colors of human endurance, valor, and virtue; and the crests of the sable hills that rose against the evening sky received a deeper worship, because their far shadows fell eastward over the iron wall of Joux and the four-square keep of Granson.|$|E

50|$|In modern herbalism, <b>comfrey</b> is most {{commonly}} used topically. Some experts say that <b>comfrey</b> should be restricted to topical use, and should never be ingested, as it contains dangerous amounts of hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Studies associating <b>comfrey</b> with veno-occlusive disease (VOD), do not differentiate between Russian and common <b>comfrey,</b> plants with very different levels of PAs.

50|$|<b>Comfrey</b> {{should be}} {{harvested}} by using either shears, a sickle, or a scythe {{to cut the}} plant about 2 inches above the ground, taking care handling it because the leaves and stems are covered in hairs that can irritate the skin. It is advisable to wear gloves when handling <b>comfrey.</b> Despite being sterile, Bocking 14 Russian <b>Comfrey</b> will steadily increase in size. It is therefore advisable to split it up every few years. It is however difficult to remove <b>comfrey</b> once established as it is very deep rooting, and any fragments left in the soil will regrow. Rotovation can be successful, but may take several seasons. The best way to eradicate <b>comfrey</b> is to very carefully dig it out, removing {{as much of the}} root as possible. This is best done in hot, dry summer weather, wherein the dry conditions will help to kill off any remaining root stumps. <b>Comfrey</b> is generally trouble free once established, although weaker or stressed plants can suffer from <b>comfrey</b> rust or mildew. Both are fungal diseases, although they rarely seriously reduce plant growth and thus do not generally require control. However infected plants should not be used for propagation purposes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Comfrey</b> as a mulch or side {{dressing}} - a two-inch layer of <b>comfrey</b> leaves placed around a crop will slowly {{break down and}} release plant nutrients; it is especially useful for crops that need extra potassium, such as fruit bearers but also reported to do well for potatoes. <b>Comfrey</b> can be slightly wilted before application optionally but either way, avoid using flowering stems as these can root.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Comfrey</b> as a {{companion}} plant for trees and other perennials - soil tests confirm that soil nutrients {{increase in the}} presence of <b>comfrey</b> even when it is not used as mulch, side dressing, or liquid fertilizer, but just allowed to grow.|$|E

Add a little dolomitic limestone to slightly raise pH. Leave for between 2-5 months depending on the season, checking that it does not dry out or become too wet.
