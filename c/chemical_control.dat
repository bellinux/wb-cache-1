5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from biological and <b>chemical</b> <b>control.</b> Larval development lasts {{two to three}} months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|The larval {{stages of}} B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, and are {{therefore}} protected from any control measures, including <b>chemical</b> <b>control.</b> Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have therefore targeted adults either at colonization stage in the field or at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.|$|E

2500|$|Common <b>chemical</b> <b>controls</b> include [...] "hard" [...] {{chemicals}} such as Amitraz (marketed as Apivar [...] ), fluvalinate (marketed as Apistan), and coumaphos (marketed as CheckMite). [...] "Soft" [...] <b>chemical</b> <b>controls</b> include thymol (marketed as ApiLife-VAR and Apiguard), sucrose octanoate esters (marketed as Sucrocide), {{oxalic acid}} and formic acid (sold in gel packs as Mite-Away, but {{also used in}} other formulations). [...] According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, when used in beehives as directed, these treatments kill {{a large proportion of}} the mites while not substantially disrupting bee behavior or life span.

5|$|Two {{kinds of}} control {{measures}} have been advocated since the 19th century. One aims at total pest population reduction, while the other is aimed at protection of the particular crop. , integrated pest management (IPM), an array of techniques and approaches to control pests, was recommended. Practices such as deep ploughing, mechanical destruction, and trap crops are also used to kill different instars. <b>Chemical</b> <b>control</b> is widely successful, and includes the use of applying mineral oil inside the tip of each corn ear, which suffocates the young larvae. Pesticides are one method by which corn earworm populations are controlled; however, since they have been widely used, the insects have become resistant to many pesticides. The use of biological controls, such as the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and various forms of nematodes, is also common, although not without their own problems. Corn earworm moths are not always vulnerable to the bacterium, and they are only afflicted by nematodes once the larvae have pupated and dropped to the ground.|$|E

25|$|Chemical safety laws {{govern the}} use of {{chemicals}} in human activities, particularly man-made chemicals in modern industrial applications. As contrasted with media-oriented environmental laws (e.g., air or water quality laws), <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> laws seek to manage the (potential) pollutants themselves.

40|$|Chemical {{applications}} {{may provide}} one {{means of control}} for Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of Sudden Oak Death (SOD). Such controls have been effective with other Phytophthora species in landscape and orchard situations. We have initiated laboratory and field studies to test the efficacy {{of a number of}} products previously reported to control Phytophthora. “In vitro ” tests have determined that many of the standard <b>chemical</b> <b>controls</b> (e. g., metalaxyl, copper sulfate, phosphoric acid) are effective against P. ramorum. Field and green house studies include experiments to treat trees and saplings already infected with the pathogen as well as treatments to protect trees from infection. Application of chemicals has been by drench, injection, and topical application directly to the bark. Although preliminary results are positive, {{it should be pointed out}} that use of <b>chemical</b> <b>controls</b> will be limited to urban situations and specimen trees.

Ant-proofing can be effective against colonies nesting inside buildings by caulking and sealing cracks, which successfully suppresses the population outside the walls. Homeowners have used their own methods to remove mounds by pouring boiling water on them or igniting them with flammable liquids. Although these methods may be effective, they are not recommended because they can be harmful to humans and the environment.|$|E
25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned.

If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be performed before flowering.

2500|$|A key step in {{managing}} weeds in any pasture system is identification. [...] Once the undesired species in a pasture system are identified, an integrated approach of management {{can be implemented}} to control weed populations. [...] It {{is important to recognize}} that no single approach to weed management will result in weed free pastures; therefore, various cultural, mechanical, and <b>chemical</b> <b>control</b> methods can be combined in an integrated weed management plan. [...] Cultural controls include: avoiding spreading manure contaminated with weed seeds, cleaning equipment after working in weed infested areas, and managing weed problems in fencerows and other areas near pastures. [...] Mechanical controls such as repeated mowing, clipping, and hand weeding can also be used to effectively manage weed infestations by weakening the plant. [...] These methods should be implemented when weed flower buds are closed or just starting to open to prevent seed production. [...] Although these methods for managing weeds greatly reduces reliance on herbicides, weed problems may still persist in managed grazing systems and the use of herbicides may become necessary. [...] Use of herbicides may restrict the use of a pasture for some length of time, depending on the type and amount of the chemical used. [...] Frequently, weeds in pasture systems are patchy and therefore spot treatment of herbicides may be used as a least cost method of <b>chemical</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
