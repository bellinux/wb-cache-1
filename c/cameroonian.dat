5|$|Both monogamous and {{polygamous}} marriage are practiced, {{and the average}} <b>Cameroonian</b> family is large and extended. In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat and grow cash crops. Like most societies, <b>Cameroonian</b> society is male-dominated, and violence and discrimination against women is common.|$|E

5|$|In 1910 the German Reichstag {{developed}} a plan {{by which the}} river in Duala would be moved inland to allow for wholly European riverside settlements. Manga Bell became the leader of pan-Duala resistance to the policy. He and the other chiefs at first pressured the administration through letters, petitions, and legal arguments, but these were ignored or rebutted. Manga Bell turned to other European governments for aid, and he sent representatives to the leaders of other <b>Cameroonian</b> peoples to suggest {{the overthrow of the}} German regime. Sultan Ibrahim Njoya of the Bamum people reported his actions to the authorities, and the Duala leader was arrested. After a summary trial, Manga Bell was hanged for high treason on 8 August 1914. His actions made him a martyr in <b>Cameroonian</b> eyes. Writers such as Mark W. DeLancey, Mark Dike DeLancey, and Helmuth Stoecker view his actions as an early example of <b>Cameroonian</b> nationalism.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} investigates how language {{affects the}} livelihoods of migrants {{and their use}} of social networks for income generation in Johannesburg. The study focuses on the <b>Cameroonians,</b> a community constituted by two main linguistic groups: Francophones and Anglophones. It explores the historic process of migration into the Republic of South Africa, the motivations behind {{the choice of the}} inner city of Johannesburg by <b>Cameroonians,</b> and it differentiates the type of social networks in which <b>Cameroonians</b> in this study engage in. The research report also explores how language shapes social networks among <b>Cameroonians</b> living in the inner city of Johannesburg. Findings of this study reveal that language does not have a direct effect on livelihoods as almost all <b>Cameroonians</b> migrants interviewed in this study are able to speak both English and French. It nevertheless, shapes the respondents’ opportunities and strategies as many rely on linguistic communities to access information, get social assistance, and find jobs. This study found that <b>Cameroonians</b> living in the inner city of Johannesburg use intra-linguistic social networks more than inter-linguistic group social networks for their income generating strategies. It also demonstrates the importance that language has in the lives of these respondents. The study is based on non-representative sample of <b>Cameroonians</b> living in Johannesburg. It used a multi-methods approach including in-depth face-to-face interviews and written sources such as journals, books and research reports were combined to gather relevant data. Thematic content analysis was used to analyse the data...|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Cameroonians</b> who voluntarily {{arrived in}} the US immigrated to {{this country in the}} 1960s, {{pursuing}} educational opportunities which were lacking in their own country. During the 1990s many other <b>Cameroonians</b> immigrated as political refugees, fleeing political turmoil. To avoid imprisonment, torture and political repression, many citizens decided to emigrate.|$|R

5|$|In June 2006, talks {{concerning}} a territorial {{dispute over the}} Bakassi peninsula were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and resulted in <b>Cameroonian</b> control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally {{handed over to the}} <b>Cameroonian</b> government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon 2 years later, in 2008.|$|E
5|$|No {{one took}} over as {{paramount}} chief upon Atangana's death. His opulent palace went unoccupied and fell into ruins. However, traditional <b>Cameroonian</b> chieftaincies were re-established on 11 July 1977 by Decree #77/609, and by the 1990s, <b>Cameroonian</b> ethnic groups had rejuvenated these dormant traditions. Atangana's daughter Marie-Thérèse became the new Ewondo paramount chief. In December 2000, she began the renovation of his palace at Efoulan, Yaoundé, a project that would cost an estimated 150,000,000 francsCFA.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Cameroon {{hosted a}} total {{population}} of refugees and asylum seekers of approximately 97,400. Of these, 49,300 were from the Central African Republic (many driven west by war), 41,600 from Chad, and 2,900 from Nigeria. Kidnappings of <b>Cameroonian</b> citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005.|$|E

50|$|<b>Cameroonians</b> {{have been}} active in {{activism}} movements in the United States. One notable example is the set of political movements in favor of Cameroon, developed in Chicago. So, in 1991, <b>Cameroonians</b> from that city were held in outside wing of the Social Democratic Front from Cameroon in support for political pluralism. After his success in Chicago, the SDF party eventually established several subsidiaries in other US cities. The group managed to raise funds to support the political movement of Cameroon, and lobbied the US Senate and United Nations and stops the advance of the sale of weapons {{to the government of}} Cameroon, i.e. to prevent that the sale of arms can continue exerting between this government and the US government. Soon after, another group of <b>Cameroonians</b> of Chicago, mainly francophone, organized a wing of the Cameroon People's Democratic Movement, driving his own campaign to support the government of Cameroon.|$|R

5|$|<b>Cameroonian</b> {{literature}} has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era {{writers such as}} Louis-Marie Pouka and Sankie Maimo were educated by European missionary societies and advocated assimilation into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world. After World War II, writers such as Mongo Beti and Ferdinand Oyono analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} are an {{integral}} part of <b>Cameroonian</b> ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as Jean-Paul Ngassa and Thérèse Sita-Bella {{explored}} similar themes. In the 1960s, Mongo Beti, Ferdinand Léopold Oyono {{and other}} writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and {{the recovery of}} African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa and Daniel Kamwa dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films {{during the next two}} decades concentrated more on wholly <b>Cameroonian</b> themes.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, West <b>Cameroonians</b> (Anglophones) have {{expressed}} deep concern regarding their relative deprivation in the political, {{social and economic}} realities in Francophone dominated Republic of Cameroon, particularly the widening gap which continues to manifest itself between the two entities since integration in 1972. This study examines the factors and circumstances (internal and external) responsible for fusion of the two polities, {{and the implications of}} such a union for the life experiences of Anglophone <b>Cameroonians,</b> particularly in the political, economic, social, and infrastructure domains. A case study analysis approach was utilized to analyze data gathered from <b>Cameroonians</b> at home and in the United States, as well as personal interviews. The researcher found that successive Francophone regimes used varied policies and strategies to reinforce the hegemonic nexus of East Cameroon (center) over West Cameroon (periphery). The conclusions drawn from the findings suggests that although Francophone policies and strategies are paramount in hindering anglophone progress in Francophone dominated Cameroon, there are, never the less, other salient factors which have combined to make this reality apparent...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the colonial languages, there are approximately 250 other languages spoken by nearly 20 million <b>Cameroonians.</b> It is because of this that Cameroon {{is considered one of}} the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.|$|R
5|$|An {{irregular}} {{chain of}} mountains, hills, and plateaus {{known as the}} Cameroon range extends from Mount Cameroon on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to Lake Chad at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the Western High Plateau, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created crater lakes. On 21 August 1986, one of these, Lake Nyos, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the World Wildlife Fund as the <b>Cameroonian</b> Highlands forests ecoregion.|$|E

His African debut came on 28 May 2000, in a 2–1 win against Ethiopian Coffee, making the {{aggregate}} score 3–3, {{which led to the}} game being decided on penalties. Zamalek won 4–2. Zamalek eventually reached the 2000 African Cup Winners' Cup final, beating <b>Cameroonian</b> side Canon Yaoundé 4–3 on aggregate.

5|$|After World War I, the {{territory}} was divided between France and the United Kingdom as League of Nations mandates. The Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, {{leading to the}} <b>Cameroonian</b> Independence War fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. The southern part of British Cameroons federated with it in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the United Republic of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Europe, Atangana {{returned}} to his homeland in Cameroon, which by then was a League of Nations mandate territory under {{the administration of the}} French Third Republic. The French doubted his loyalties at first, but Atangana served them with the same ardour he had shown the Germans and regained his post as paramount chief. During the remainder of his life, he oversaw the Westernisation of his subjects and the improvement of his domains despite the erosion of his powers due to French policies and unrest among his people. He never advocated resistance to the European powers, preferring to embrace the European as a means of personal enrichment and in the service of African interests. After his death in 1943, Atangana was largely forgotten. However, since Cameroon's independence in 1960, <b>Cameroonian</b> scholars have rediscovered his story.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona responded quickly, as Carles Puyol found Eto'o {{with a long}} throw-in {{down the}} right wing. The <b>Cameroonian</b> then found Messi, who cut inside and hit a curling 25-yard shot that just shaved {{the top of the}} crossbar. A quick-passing move from United followed, {{culminating}} with a through-ball to Park in the inside right channel, only for Valdés to cut out the pass, taking out the South Korean in the process. The resulting throw-in eventually broke to Ronaldo, whose 30-yard shot went just wide. Valdés' clash with Park, however, left him requiring treatment, and although the injury was not sufficient to necessitate a substitution, Valdés chose to leave his next few goal kicks to Piqué.|$|E
