50|$|An {{underground}} poker {{room will}} usually generate {{revenue for the}} profit of the host(s) and/or to pay for operating expenses by <b>collecting</b> <b>rake</b> and/or other house fees while not being a licensed gaming operator. Underground poker venues can also generate revenue by selling food and beverages (with or without the appropriate licences) and/or by offering side games with a built-in house edge such as blackjack or craps in addition to (or as an alternative to) <b>collecting</b> <b>rake</b> and/or house fees, but this is less common.|$|E
50|$|A {{percentage}} rake {{is taken}} {{directly from the}} pot. In a live casino, the dealer manually removes chips from the pot while the hand is being played and sets them aside to be dropped into a secure box after completion of the hand. When playing online, the rake is taken automatically by the game software. Some software shows the rake amount next to a graphical representation of the dealer and takes it incrementally between the rounds of betting, whereas other software programs wait until the entire hand is over and then takes it from the pot total before giving the rest to {{the winner of the}} hand. This is the prevalent method of <b>collecting</b> <b>rake</b> in online poker.|$|E
50|$|Free {{games were}} {{supported}} by advertising before and during gameplay; cash games {{were supported by}} <b>collecting</b> a <b>rake</b> on prizes, with no advertising displayed before the game begins.|$|R
50|$|Since {{games played}} in card rooms are usually player-against-player instead of player-against-house, card room {{operators}} typically derive their revenues {{in one of}} two ways. In most, the dealer of each game (employed by the establishment) will <b>collect</b> a <b>rake,</b> a portion of the pot from each hand. At other times, a charge will be levied against each player for a specific time period, typically each half-hour.|$|R
50|$|The picture depicts {{four girls}} in the {{twilight}} <b>collecting</b> and <b>raking</b> together fallen leaves in a garden. They are making a bonfire, but the fire itself is invisible, only smoke emerging from between the leaves. The two girls on the left, modelled on Millais' sisters-in-law Alice and Sophy Gray, are portrayed in middle-class clothing of the era; the two on the right are in rougher, working class clothing.|$|R
25|$|Half dollar coins saw heavy use, {{particularly}} {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. For many years, they were commonly used in casinos. Rolls of half dollars may still be kept on hand in cardrooms for games requiring 50-cent antes or bring-in bets, for dealers to pay winning naturals in blackjack, or where the house <b>collects</b> a <b>rake</b> in increments. Additionally, some concession vendors at sporting events distribute half dollar coins as change for convenience.|$|R
50|$|Cockles are {{a popular}} type of edible {{shellfish}} in both Eastern and Western cooking. They are <b>collected</b> by <b>raking</b> {{them from the}} sands at low tide. However, collecting cockles is hard work and, {{as seen from the}} Morecambe Bay disaster, in which 23 people died, can be dangerous if local tidal conditions are not carefully watched. In England and Wales, people are permitted to collect 5 kg of cockles for personal use. However, pickers wishing to collect more than this are deemed to be engaging in commercial fishing and are required to obtain a permit from the Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority.|$|R
40|$|Three lakes {{located within}} the Klamath River Basin in Oregon (Upper Klamath Lake, Fourmile Lake, and Lake of the Woods) were {{surveyed}} for aquatic invasive species {{during the summer of}} 2012. Specimens were <b>collected</b> using plant <b>rakes,</b> benthic dredges, plankton nets, and crayfish traps. No invasive aquatic plants, gastropods, snails, bivalves or crayfish were detected in the lakes...|$|R
50|$|A berry-picking rake or berry picker is a {{tool for}} <b>collecting</b> berries. Berry-picking <b>rakes</b> {{can be used to}} collect lingonberries, bilberries, currants, and other berries. The rake may damage softer berries, and {{introduces}} some detritus, requiring cleaning of the berries afterwards. If misused, it may also damage or uproot the plants, reducing next year's yields. Despite these drawbacks, a rake has much greater efficiency than picking by hand, and is thus used in all commercial berry picking--though modern large-scale farms use mechanical harvesters.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{effort has}} been conducted on an aerospace-quality helical gear train to investigate the thermal behavior of the gear system as speed, load, and lubricant flow rate were varied. Temperature test data from a helical gear train at varying speeds and loads (to 5000 hp and 15000 rpm) was <b>collected</b> using thermocouple <b>rakes</b> and axial arrays. The instrumentation was able to capture the radial and axial expelled lubricant-air environment (fling-off lubricant) that is expelled during the gear meshing process. Effects of operational characteristics are presented...|$|R
5000|$|The algae washes ashore, piles up on beaches, and decays, often {{causing a}} foul odor, {{releasing}} fumes of sulphur compounds that rust metals, {{that can turn}} taps black in shore houses, damages mod cons, and causes respiratory problems, particularly for asthmatics. 52 patients were recorded by a single doctor in Guadeloupe with sargassum related symptoms. Insurance problems arise for tourist operators and homeowners, where the household and business losses do not fall into previous insurance categories. Wildlife also suffers, for example baby sea turtles that die {{on their way to}} the open water.The affected countries and territories are discussing causes of the outbreak, potential solutions, and the negative affects on tourism.Currently, it is cleaned by spade and barrow onshore, and it can be <b>collected</b> by <b>raking</b> boats offshore. Barrages of shallow nets floated by long buoys can be used to ward off algea drifts, depending on wave height and current.|$|R
40|$|Apollo 16 sample 63545 was {{initially}} described {{as one of}} a group of 19 generally rounded, fine-grained, crystalline rocks that were <b>collected</b> as <b>rake</b> samples [1]. This 16 g "rocklet" was collected at Station 13 on the ejecta blanket of North Ray Crater at the foot of Smoky Mountain [2]. Originally classified as a Very High Alumina (VHA) basalt on geochemical grounds [3], it was later argued to be an impact melt rock [4]. Here we report a Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic study that shows that some portions of the rock failed to reach isotopic equilibrium on last melting in agreement with the impact melt rock interpretation. Nevertheless, by omitting mineral fractions that are discordant with the majority of the data, we arrive at the time of last melting as 3. 88 plus or minus 0. 05 Ga ago. This age is in agreement with the Ar- 39 /Ar- 40 plateau age of 3839 plus or minus 23 Ma [5], if the latter is adjusted for the ~ 1. 4 - 1. 8 % revision in the age of the hornblende monitor [6]. This investigation was undertaken in part as proof-of-concept for SPA-basin sample return...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€” Channel {{information}} provided by impulse-radio ultrawideband communications hardware is used in radar applications requiring information about the surrounding physical environment. The methods presented are similar to sonar-based echolocation methods, but have the advantage that complex reflections can be analyzed. The localization and classification of multipath allows sonar-based map-building algorithms to be applied. Novel solutions are presented for reflection classification and map building for multi-user, multi-antenna, and single-antenna hardware. E MERGING ultrawideband (UWB) technology potentially offers not only hundred-megabit-per-second data rates for wireless communications, but also sub-centimeter resolution radar applications [2]. The short pulse duration of impulse-radio implementations allows most of the dominant multipath reflections in the environment to be individually resolved [1] and this multipath energy may be <b>collected</b> with a <b>Rake</b> receiver, which is common with spread-spectrum communications. Channel estimation {{is crucial to the}} performance of wideband receivers, but also provides information about the local environment. This paper explores the options for mapping the local physical environment from channel information already obtained by communications hardware. Location-based services, such as emergency- 911, are already proving popular in the cellular industry [3], but do not provid...|$|R
6000|$|In 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope. He was an Italian, {{hostile to}} the French, and full {{of a sense of}} the great traditions and mission of Rome. For a time he carried things with a high hand. In 1300 he held a jubilee, and a vast {{multitude}} of pilgrims assembled in Rome. [...] "So great was the influx of money into the papal treasury, that two assistants were kept busy with the <b>rakes</b> <b>collecting</b> the {284} offerings that were deposited at the tomb of St. Peter." [...] [5] But this festival was a delusive triumph. Boniface came into conflict with the French King in 1302, and in 1303, {{as he was about to}} pronounce sentence of excommunication against that monarch, he was surprised and arrested in his own ancestral palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret. This agent from the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his way into the bedroom of the frightened Pope--he was lying in bed with a cross in his hands--and heaped threats and insults upon him. The Pope was liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to Rome; but there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the Orsini family, and in a few weeks' time the shocked and disillusioned old man died a prisoner in their hands.|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{vibration}} exposure {{has been linked}} to chronic back pain and low back symptoms among agricultural tractor drivers. The objectives of this study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) were to assess driver whole body vibration (WBV) exposures and recommend interventions {{to reduce the risk of}} back related injuries, particularly relative to vehicle jarring/jolting (the transient mechanical shock components of WBV). The methodology included collecting, from two independent samples, ?eld data and health and work history data of farm equipment operators. Data were <b>collected</b> during mowing, <b>raking,</b> baling, chiseling, tilling, and road travel for different model tractors. Spraying using a sprayer and shrub removal with a skid steer loader were also included. Based on ISO 2631 (1985), the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, threshold limit values, presents 0. 5 m/s 2 as the action level recommended by the Commission of European Communities for overall weighted total RMS acceleration (vector sum for axes x, y, and z) [ACGIH, 2006. Threshold limit values and biological exposure indices. Cincinnati, OH]. WBV measured at the operator/seat interface exceeded this action level. The roughest rides and highest vector sum accelerations occurred with small utility tractor mowers (3. 3 and 2. 8 m/s 2) and a skid steer loader (1. 7 m/s 2). Major ?ndings from health and work history data showed 96...|$|R
