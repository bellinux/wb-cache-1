5|$|Some {{screenings}} of Grindhouse (mainly in Canada) {{also featured}} a fake trailer {{for a film}} titled Hobo with a Shotgun. The trailer, created by Dartmouth, Nova Scotia filmmakers Jason Eisener, John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's South by Southwest Grindhouse trailers contest. In the trailer, David Brunt plays a vagabond with a 20-gauge shotgun (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a vigilante. In the trailer, he is shown killing numerous persons, ranging from armed robbers to corrupt <b>cops</b> <b>to</b> a pedophilic Santa Claus. The trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star <b>Cops</b> <b>to</b> the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

25|$|Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal {{metabolite}} used experimentally {{to disrupt}} the secretion pathway {{as a method of}} testing Golgi function. BFA blocks the activation of some ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). ARFs are small GTPases which regulate vesicular trafficking through the binding of <b>COPs</b> <b>to</b> endosomes and the Golgi. BFA inhibits the function of several guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that mediate GTP-binding of ARFs. Treatment of cells with BFA thus disrupts the secretion pathway, promoting disassembly of the Golgi apparatus and distributing Golgi proteins to the endosomes and ER.|$|E
500|$|A {{very small}} amount of {{merchandising}} has been produced for Star <b>Cops.</b> <b>To</b> coincide with the broadcast of the series in 1987, BBC Enterprises released Justin Hayward's theme song [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] as a 7-inch and 12-inch single. The 7-inch included the track [...] "Outer Space" [...] by Hayward and Tony Visconti, {{which was one of}} the incidental music tracks written for [...] "An Instinct for Murder", on the B-side. The 12-inch had an extended version of [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] on the A-Side and the 7-inch version of [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] and [...] "Outer Space" [...] on the B-Side. [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] was later released on compact disc as part of the compilation The Best of BBC TV's Themes.|$|E
500|$|... "X-Cops" [...] {{was filmed}} in Venice and Long Beach, California. When members of The X-Files staff asked Cops {{producer}} John Langley about a potential cross-over, {{the crew of}} Cops liked the idea and offered their complete cooperation. Gilligan was even invited to the shooting of an episode. Inspired by Cops, Watkins' directing style was unique for this episode. Watkins filmed some of the scenes himself, {{in addition to the}} shots caught by the usual camera operators of The X-Files. However, he also brought in Bertram van Munster, a cameraman for <b>Cops,</b> <b>to</b> shoot scenes to give the finished product an authentic feel. In an attempt at realism, other staff members from Cops participated in the production: Daniel Emmet and John Michael Vaughn, two Cops crew members, were featured during the episode's climax. During rehearsals, Watkins kept the cameras away from the set, so that when filming commenced, the cameramen's unfamiliarity would create the [...] "unscripted" [...] reality feel of a documentary. In addition, a Cops editor was brought in to insert the blur over the faces of bystanders.|$|E

They were angrier than I guess they had ever been, because {{everybody}} else had rioted... but the fairies were not supposed to riot... no group had ever forced <b>cops</b> <b>to</b> retreat before, so the anger was just enormous.

[...] With larger numbers, police detained anyone they could and put them in patrol wagons to go to jail, though Inspector Pine recalled, [...] "Fights erupted with the transvestites, who wouldn't go into the patrol wagon." [...] His recollection was corroborated by another witness across the street who said, [...] "All I could see about who was fighting was that it was transvestites and they were fighting furiously." ...|$|E

The Washington Posts Sean Fennessey saw it as his [...] "Confused, and worse, dull album". Steve Jones of USA Today noted that T.I. on the album [...] "He deals with this quandary on his star-studded No Mercy, where he alternately <b>cops</b> <b>to</b> his character flaws while condemning celebrity-hating detractors who make things miserable for him". Andy Gill of The Independent gave it three out of five stars and stated that [...] "tracks like the delinquent reminiscence [...] "How Life Changed" [...] and the mea culpa duet with Chris Brown, [...] "Get Back Up", teeter queasily on the cusp of boast and apology. But you have to admire the gall of a repeat offender brazen enough to feature a quote from Helen Keller in his lyric booklet". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian commented that most of its songs [...] "range from dour, generic pieces that can't conceal his listlessness to a few pretty good-ish party songs with sharp hooks and crackling beats. You can only hope he rediscovers his swagger".|$|E
