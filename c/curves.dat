5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth <b>curves,</b> with junctions where three {{or more of the}} <b>curves</b> meet. When the junctions all have exactly three <b>curves</b> meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more <b>curves</b> meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed <b>curves</b> of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest <b>curves</b> to collapse to a point under the curve-shortening flow.

5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} of the flow to non-smooth <b>curves</b> based on the level set method, there are only two possibilities. <b>Curves</b> with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth <b>curves)</b> instantly evolve into smooth <b>curves,</b> after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood <b>curves</b> with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved <b>curves</b> to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{results can}} be {{extended}} from closed <b>curves</b> to unbounded <b>curves</b> satisfying a local Lipschitz condition. For such <b>curves,</b> if {{both sides of the}} curve have infinite area, then the evolved curve remains smooth and singularity-free for all time. However, if one side of an unbounded curve has finite area, and the curve has finite total absolute curvature, then its evolution reaches a singularity in time proportional to the area on the finite-area side of the curve, with unbounded curvature near the singularity. For <b>curves</b> that are graphs of sufficiently well-behaved functions, asymptotic to a ray in each direction, the solution converges in shape to a unique shape that is asymptotic to the same rays.|$|E

5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for <b>curves</b> in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space. The normal vector in this case can be defined (as in the plane) as the derivative of the tangent vector with respect to arc length, normalized to be a unit vector; {{it is one of}} the components of the Frenet–Serret frame. It is not well defined at points of zero curvature, but the product of the curvature and the normal vector remains well defined at those points, allowing the curve-shortening flow to be defined. <b>Curves</b> in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space <b>curves</b> has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane <b>curves.</b>|$|E
