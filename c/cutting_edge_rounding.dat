40|$|Abstract. After the {{grinding}} process, the cutting edges of cemented carbide milling tools tend to chipping. Chipping {{has a strong}} influence on the tool performance. For this reason, the cutting edges are further prepared. Additionally, a <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> {{has an impact on}} the wear behavior and the process stability. For the cutting edge preparation of milling tools, magnetic finishing is a promising process. This paper describes the process of magnetic finishing. The influencing parameters, i. e. the process time and the distance between the cutting tool and the magnetic disks, are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of magnetic finishing on the tool life is demonstrated using the example of a milling process with titanium...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} two {{processes for}} the wear minimization of micro milling tools {{that are used}} for the machining of precision components.

(1980) and Stepanov (1987) point out the elastic recovery of polymer composite materials after processing and suggest the formula initially developed by Drozhzhin (1983) and given in the paper for the determination of the elastic recovery of the processed surface of laminated plastics (getinaks, textolite - PCB) after cutting with a non-worn tool. The formula suggested by Drozhzhin (1983) contains the following factors: drill bit <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> <b>rounding</b> radius, tool <b>cutting</b> wedge angle of processed surface in contact with the rear surface of the tool, tool clearance angle, ratio, taking into account the processed material and stiffness of the system machine-adaptation-tool-work piece. However, the formula given in Drozhzhin (1983) is designed for determination of the shrinkage in laminated plastics and is not acceptable for the calculation of the shrinkage in polymer composite materials.|$|R

Furthermore, the classification of workpiece quality for reinforced plastic components has not been sufficiently addressed thus far and is also a focus of the work being undertaken. In order to adequately describe the workpiece quality, fibre pull-out and fibre protrusion must both be analysed.

The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} the development and validation of a three dimensional thermomechanically coupled finite element model for gun drilling AISI 4150 quenched and tempered steel.

40|$|AbstractDrilling of fiber-metal {{compound}} {{materials is}} one of the most challenging machining operations. Besides frequently occurring damages of the borehole surface tool wear is a major concern when drilling compound stacks. The significantly divergent cutting conditions of fiber reinforced plastics and metallic alloys require compromises in the tool geometry as well as the cutting materials and coatings. Excessive <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> <b>rounding</b> due to the brittle and abrasive fibers leads to increasing cutting forces and temperatures in the metallic alloy. This usually results in a catastrophic failure of the tools. In the present study low frequency vibration assisted drilling (LFVAD) of CFRP/Ti 6 Al 4 V [10 / 10 mm] was investigated in terms of tool wear and compared to conventional drilling. Solid carbide drills with a diameter of 4. 8 mm and different CVD and PVD coatings have been tested. The flank wear as well as the adhesions at the cutting edges have found to be significantly lower when using LFVAD. The tool life could be increased by more than 300 % compared to conventional drilling. This is based on considerably lower process temperatures and an improvement of the process stability which could be proved by cutting force measurements. Additionally the chip extraction was found to be more efficient due to the generation of small chip segments which is a consequence of the interrupted cut. Best results in terms of tool wear and borehole quality have been achieved with an AlCrN coating...|$|E
40|$|In microdrilling, {{because of}} lower feed, the microdrill <b>cutting</b> <b>edge</b> radius is {{comparable}} to the chip thickness. The <b>cutting</b> <b>edges</b> therefore should be regarded as <b>rounded</b> <b>edges,</b> which results in a more complex cutting mechanism. Because of this, the macrodrilling thrust modeling is not suitable for microdrilling. In this paper, a mathematical modeling to predict microdrilling thrust is developed, and the geometric characteristics of microdrill were considered in force models. The thrust is modeled in three parts: major <b>cutting</b> <b>edges,</b> secondary <b>cutting</b> <b>edge,</b> and indentation zone.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a micro optical probe, which is employed to evaluate edge contours of single point diamond tools {{with a size}} {{in a range of}} several millimetres. The micro optical probe consists of a laser source with a wavelength of 405 nm, an objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0. 25, a photodiode for measurement, and a compensating optical system including another photodiode for compensation of laser intensity. A collimated laser beam, which is divided by a beam splitter in the compensating optical system, is focused by the objective lens so that the focused spot can be used as the micro optical probe. The micro optical probe traces over an edge contour of an objective tool while the signals of both the two photodiodes are monitored. The output of the photodiode for measurement is compensated by using that of the photodiode for laser intensity compensation to eliminate the influence of the laser instability. The signal of the photodiode for measurement is used to define the deviation of edge contour within the diameter of the micro optical probe. To verify the feasibility of the developed optical probe, the optical system was mounted on a diamond turning machine, and some experiments were carried out.
