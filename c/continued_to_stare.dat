60|$|The {{judge did}} not answer him, but <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Twinkle.|$|E
60|$|Barker {{turned a}} fierce red, but <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... [But as he <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at her {{a strange}} {{disorder}} appears in his face. MAGGIE feels {{that it is}} to be now or never.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} is young, very young, only a girl," [...] replied {{the captain of the}} Minerva, <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> into the {{blackness}} that hid the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... (They {{go out on}} {{the porch}} and stand just outside the door [...] waiting for Eileen to notice them; but the girl in bed [...] <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> into the woods, {{oblivious}} to their presence.) ...|$|R
60|$|The King <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> {{at him as}} if he were a human curiosity.|$|E
60|$|But Danton merely <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare,</b> as if {{into the}} quiet of an aquarium.|$|E
60|$|Dawes <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> in a satirical fashion at {{the picture}} over the mantelpiece.|$|E
5000|$|Brayton {{initially}} {{decides to}} retreat from {{the room with the}} snake but wonders if he should confront the creature. He <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the snake, anticipating its plan of attack, but the snake <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> be motionless. Eventually he feels a blow to his face and chest.|$|R
60|$|PROF. That's what I'm {{trying to}} say here. The Orpheus legend symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! [He takes up his pen, while she <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> out at the moonlight. Yawning] Dash it! I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner coffee twice as strong.|$|R
5000|$|They <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> dumbfounded {{when they}} return to the van, and in bed during the night. The next day, a news {{reporter}} does a story about sightings of a floating house. She attempts to get George and A.J.'s opinion, {{but they are still}} staring dumbfounded. Meanwhile, other senior citizens around the city, including at Shady Oaks, are watching the news report and celebrating Carl's [...] "escape".|$|R
60|$|He did {{not seem}} to hear her words, but <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at Alan.|$|E
60|$|He {{shook hands}} with Captain Blossom, while the Rover boys <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|But she <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> {{into the}} fire, {{as though she}} had not heard me.|$|E
5000|$|When {{they finally}} open the door, {{they see the}} {{children}} staring back at them. They are in a practically empty room, with the children, a table, dolls that resemble some of the black-cloaked coven members and a music box. The children <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at {{the people and the}} camera slowly pans to an empty, black hole in a corner. The screen goes dark, and bright pink gothic words show up, saying, [...] "Come in, children." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the late}} afternoon, Jerry trotted aft, after having {{administered}} another lesson to the wild-dog, and found Skipper {{seated on the}} deck, back against the low rail, knees drawn up, and gazing absently off to leeward. Jerry sniffed his bare calf--not {{that he needed to}} identify it, but just because he liked to, and in a sort of friendly greeting. But Van Horn took no notice, <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> out across the sea. Nor was he aware of the puppy's presence.|$|R
6000|$|They <b>continued</b> both <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at her, {{helpless}} {{for what}} ever different reasons {{to take their}} eyes away, and they were still interested in her when they heard her asking the conductor, [...] "Must I change and take another train {{before we get to}} Belford? My friends thought--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{caught the}} irony now more plainly in his voice. She <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|Ezra <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> gloomily into vacancy {{and took}} no notice of his late companion's remark.|$|E
60|$|He <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at me. Then {{a sudden}} flash of {{intelligence}} lit up his features.|$|E
50|$|A chicken can be hypnotized, or {{put into}} a trance, by holding its head down against the ground, and drawing a line along {{the ground with a}} stick or a finger, {{starting}} at the beak and extending straight outward in front of the chicken. If the chicken is hypnotized in this manner, it will remain immobile for somewhere between 15 seconds and 30 minutes, <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the line. Ethologists refer to this state as 'tonic immobility' i.e. a natural state of semi-paralysis that some animals enter when presented with a threat, which is probably a defensive mechanism intended to feign death, albeit rather poorly.|$|R
60|$|These {{were very}} much the {{feelings}} of Arthur and Angela. He hesitated before her, confused, and she kept her head down over the dog. But presently Aleck, getting bored, moved on, and, {{as it would have}} been inane <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the floor, she had to raise herself as slowly as she might. Soon their eyes arrived in the same plane, and whether a mutual glance of intelligence was exchanged, or whether their power of attraction overcame his power of resistance, {{it is not easy to}} determine, but certain it is that, following a primary natural law, Arthur gravitated towards her, and kissed her on the face.|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} {{comes to an}} end, Molly ends her {{engagement}} with Greg, who moves out and back to his hometown. Molly then visits Bridget to report Greg leaving her and both women lie in bed side by side, staring at the ceiling. Bridget tells Molly that she's totally keeping her interested and that she's {{trying to be the}} one Molly wants. Then she questions the look on Molly's face, to which Molly responds with the look indicates love. Bridget cries a little of not able to say anything back. The final shot shows both of them <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the ceiling, each speculating their next move. However, their facial expressions tell more than words ever will. Bridget's expression is one of entering unexplored territory (i.e., that of love). Molly's expression is one of self-doubting as she has fully committed to living a full-on lesbian life very different from that she has ever experienced.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Preston <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the rector without speaking. Suddenly {{he put out}} his hand.|$|E
60|$|But the jest evoked no {{response}} from her. She <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him with those eager yet timid eyes.|$|E
60|$|The Doge <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> on {{the speaker}} with the fixedness of regard {{that one might}} be {{supposed}} to fasten on a creature of unearthly existence.|$|E
50|$|After {{walking for}} an {{extended}} period, the silver robot slows down and comes to a stop. Becoming aware of this, the gold robot {{walks back to the}} silver one. The silver robot <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the ground for a moment before removing his own jacket. He then turns away from the other robot, revealing a switch on his back. The gold robot flips the switch, which begins a timer. When the countdown ends, the silver robot is blown to pieces. The remaining robot piles the remains of the silver robot, then <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> walk. The gold robot eventually falls to his knees and attempts to reach the switch on his own back, but to no avail. Another moment passes before the robot removes his helmet and repeatedly slams it into the ground until the helmet shatters. Using one of the shards as a burning-glass, the robot focuses the sunlight to set his hand ablaze. The film ends as the robot, completely on fire, walks in slow motion through darkness.|$|R
40|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{a number}} of welcome indications, such as {{attaining}} peace in Cambodia and the admission of Vietnam to ASEAN membership, signaled that the Asian-Pacific region was headed into a more predictable era. The Asian countries were becoming more mature politically, and this political stability in turn engendered eye-opening economic growth. However, {{the end of the}} Cold War in and of itself, did not remove any of the various causes of tension and confrontation in Asia. In northeastern Asia in particular, destabilizing factors <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> exist unabated: a divided nation remains, territorial disputes continue, a former superpower looks toward an uncertain future, and heavy accumulations of military forces remain. On the Korean peninsula, 1. 6 million troops <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> each other down {{on either side of the}} 38 th parallel, and the relationship between Taiwan and China has become very tense. The territorial dispute over the Spratley Islands is yet another possible source of tension. These issues <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> demand our undivided attention. This article discusses the actions of Russia and Japan post Cold War, and addresses what Japan should do to assure its own security, what Japan should do to assure regional security, and what the role of the United States is in this conflict...|$|R
50|$|Billie {{is later}} accused of arson and becomes {{depressed}} when her brother Ash doubts her innocence. Nate grows concerned for her {{mental and physical}} health when she goes missing from the hospital. He contacts Kat, who realises Billie is close to breaching her bail conditions, and she and Ash start a search for Billie. However, they fail to locate her and have to call the search off for the night. The following day, Kat receives a call about a sighting of a young woman near the lighthouse on the headland. Worried that Billie could jump any minute, Kat gently tries to coax her away from the edge. Billie <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> out <b>to</b> sea, until she is startled by Kat's radio and fearing that she is about to be arrested, she moves closer {{to the edge of the}} cliff. Kat lunges towards her to pull her back, but Billie steps to the side at the last minute, causing Kat to go over the edge of the cliff instead. She manages to grab hold of the ledge and calls Billie to help her. Billie eventually manages to pull Kat back over.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> {{out of the}} window, and her stillness denoted {{some success}} in {{controlling}} herself. [...] "If he's not lost, why are you unhappy?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{small boy}} stopped and {{replenished}} his lungs. Tommy <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at him. At that moment Julius rejoined him. He held {{an open letter}} in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Then it was that, {{while he}} <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare,</b> a light broke {{for him and}} the blood slowly came to his face, which began to burn with recognition.|$|E
50|$|The girl goes to {{the window}} again and begins her dance. The tramps and girl see a bizarre figure in the street, soon heard coming up the stairs. The tramps hide, and the figure, a Mandarin (wealthy Chinese man), stands {{immobile}} in the doorway. The tramps urge the girl to lure him closer. She begins another saucy dance, the Mandarin's passions slowly rising. Suddenly, he leaps up and embraces the girl. They struggle and she escapes; he begins to chase her. The tramps leap on him, strip him of his valuables, and attempt to suffocate him under pillows and blankets. However, he <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at the girl. They stab him three times with a rusty sword; he almost falls, but throws himself again at the girl. The tramps grab him again and hang him from a lamp hook. The lamp falls, plunging the room into darkness, and the Mandarin's body begins to glow with an eerie blue-green light. The tramps and girl are terrified. Suddenly, the girl knows what they must do. She tells the tramps to release the Mandarin; they do. He leaps at the girl again, and this time she does not resist and they embrace. With the Mandarin's longing fulfilled, his wounds begin to bleed and he dies.|$|R
50|$|Howie and Becca {{decide to}} have a garden lunch. The scene begins with Howie telling Becca how the lunch would take place, while {{simultaneously}} the screen fades into the lunch as Howie <b>continues</b> <b>to</b> speak in the background. The film ends with Becca and Howie sitting in their garden alone after all their guests have left staring into space. Becca reaches out to Howie and touches his hand. They hold hands affectionately as they <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> sit and <b>stare</b> into space.|$|R
50|$|It is Rebecca's {{birthday}} and Kara and Sara planned to celebrate {{it with their}} whole family and friends. Laura notices a strange bear mascot who is <b>continuing</b> <b>to</b> <b>stare</b> at them. Rebecca gives a thoughtful speech but Alex ruined the moment as Arellano informed Sebastian that Alex managed to escape the hospital and she attacked the nurse. Kara is then used as an prop for an entertainment trick and gets kidnapped by Alex and then becomes unconscious. The Suarez's evacuate the area but, Laura is inside the kitchen and gets confronted by Lucille. Laura begs for Lucille's forgiveness {{and she wants to}} forgive her to, but, Lucille listens to Antonio's apparition and hits Laura in the head, which causes her to become unconscious. The bear mascot uncovers herself to Kara and it is Alex. Alex becomes even more desperate for her son and is now holding Kara and Sara as hostages. Sebastian begs for Alex's forgiveness but Alex cannot manage to forgive him as to much damage has happened. Alex persistently tries to make Kara shoot Sara as she knows that Sara is Rebecca's bone marrow donor. Lucille arrives with Laura and she is held hostage as well. It is uncovered by Lucille that she is only being used by Alex and attacks her. While all this is happening, Kara and Sara switch places making Alex believe the twin is the other one. They did this in order to save one another, especially Sara. Edward then awakens, as he had gotten knocked out, and fights with Alex physically. Edward, Lucille, Laura, Sebastian, Kara and Sara try to escape but Alex got hold of the gun and shoots Kara, much to their horror.|$|R
