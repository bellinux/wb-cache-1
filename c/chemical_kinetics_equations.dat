The equations were solved numerically using the Crank-Nicholson method of finite differences programmed in FORTRAN. At each time step the local concentration of reactants and FER was determined and algebraically correlated to the loss of cation exchange sites based on the 'unzipping' mechanism of chemical degradation. The percent degradation of initial exchange sites was used to estimate the useful life of the membrane. In order to meet the industry standard of 40, 000 hours of operation, the model results show that the fixed hydrogen peroxide concentration within the membrane should be limited to approximately 340 micromoles per cubic centimeter.
