40|$|Acetazolamide is {{a useful}} {{prophylactic}} for acute mountain sickness causing marked reduction in headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, etc. Improvements correlate with increased arterial oxygen concentrations, reduction in proteinuria and peripheral oedema and other objective measures of acute mountain sickness. Evidence that Acetazolamide is beneficial for pulmonary oedema or cerebral oedema is scanty because of the lower frequency of these severe forms of mountain sickness. Dexamethasone, used prophylactically, also reduces the symptoms of acute mountain sickness partly due to its euphoric effect. Use of Acetazolamide {{as a treatment for}} established acute mountain sickness has been investigated. Large doses of Acetazolamide increase arterial oxygen levels over a few hours and this leads to a reduction of symptoms but data is limited and faster acting <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydrides</b> inhibitors such as Methazolamide may be preferable in an emergency situation. There is no comparison of the effectiveness of Acetazolamide with other drugs used for treating acute mountain sickness such as steroids and calcium channel blocking drugs. Also, there is no data on drug combinations which could have additive effects and thereby be more beneficial than individual drugs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism can be subdivided into two partial reactions (see figure to the right). In the first reaction, ATP is carboxylated to produce <b>carbonic</b> phosphoric <b>anhydride</b> −O(−O)P(=O)O-C(=O)O− {{which in turn}} carboxylates a biotin cofactor that is covalently attached to a lysine residue of the BCCP domain. [...] <b>Carbonic</b> phosphoric <b>anhydride</b> decomposes into carbon dioxide and phosphate prior to attack by the enzyme linked biotin molecule. In most species, this reaction requires acetyl-CoA as an allosteric activator binding to the PT domain. In the second reaction, occurring in the CT domain of an adjacent monomer, carbon dioxide is transferred to the acceptor molecule, pyruvate, to form oxaloacetate. The reaction proceeds via the removal of a proton from pyruvate, by an as yet unidentified active site residue, to generate an enolate intermediate. The enolate intermediate then attacks CO2 transiently released from the enzyme linked biotin molecule. The resultant oxaloacetate is released. The biotin molecule is protonated by the aforementioned active site residue and released from the active site of the CT domain to be recarboxylated. The major regulator of enzyme activity, acetyl-CoA, stimulates the cleavage of ATP in the first partial reaction and also {{it has been shown}} to induce a conformational change in the tetrameric structure of the enzyme.|$|R

40|$|A kinetic {{analysis}} of the curing reaction between an epoxide (Epikote 828) and a <b>carbonic</b> acid <b>anhydride</b> (HN- 2200) using a finite element analysis with a coupled matrix has been previously reported. Shrinkage of the epoxy resin during the cure creates an internal stress. Both the reaction rate and the material constitutive relationships have great influence on the internal stress. Although stress relaxation reduces the internal stress, {{it has not been}} taken into account in the previous work. In order to introduce the effects of stress relaxation of the epoxy resin in the finite element analysis, the relaxation modulus was obtained from complex modulus measurements made on a dynamic mechanical analyzer. The relaxation modulus was expressed as a Prony series. The influence of stress relaxation on reducing the internal stress of the epoxy resin was estimated with this relaxation modulus. The Maximum equivalent stress after stress relaxation was one-fiftieth that without the stress relaxation. Experimental results showed good agreement with those of numerical analysis without mean normal stress relaxation when the epoxy resin was put between metal parts. This indicated that the mean normal stress relaxation of epoxy resin is negligible...|$|R
40|$|Epoxy resins {{have been}} widely used as {{insulators}} in electronic devices because of the in excellent electrical properties. Cracking of the epoxy resin (interface) is a problem during the curing process, hence many experimental investigations on the causes have been performed. Few studies have dealt with this problem by numerical methods because the relationship among the reaction rate, temperature, stress, and strain is too complex to be expressed numerically. The finite element analysis method with a coupled matrix of the relationships is the most suitable for implementation. The results determined with numerical analysis is useful for designing electronic devices, although many parameters are necessary to accomplish the analysis. This paper reports on the kinetic analysis of the curing reaction between an epoxide (Epikote 828) and a <b>carbonic</b> acid <b>anhydride</b> (HN- 2200) using a finite element analysis with a coupled matrix. The degree of reaction at a given temperature was determined by titration of the unreacted acid and epoxy groups in the system. Because the curing rates obtained by a power law model were not in good agreement with experiment, the curing rate was expressed as a function of temperature and the degree of reaction by means of a multiple regression analysis. To deal with the curing rate in the finite element analysis, the degree of reaction was defined as one of the variables at the Gaussian integration points in finite elements. Consequently, the analytical results with the new finite element model were in good agreement with the experimental data. This numerical method would be available for predicting the strain in epoxy resins and the degree of reaction throughout the curing process...|$|R
40|$|A brief {{survey of}} {{decarboxylation}} reactions and carboxylation reactions {{that are known}} or presumed in biological systems will be presented. While {{a considerable number of}} amino acid decarboxylations are known, their mechanisms will not be included in the present discussion but will be reserved for a later paper in the symposium. The remaining decarboxylation reactions may be subdivided into oxidative and nonoxidative decarboxylations. In most cases, these reactions are practically irreversible except when coupled with suitable energy-yielding systems. The carboxylation reactions which are useful in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds in biological systems seem to fall into two or three groups: those which exhibit an apparent ATP requirement, and those which exhibit a reduced pyridine nucleotide requirement, and those which exhibit no apparent ATP requirement. Of the first group at least four cases, and possibly six or seven, are known, and one interpretation of them involves the preliminary formation of 'active' carbon dioxide, generally {{in the form of a}} <b>carbonic</b> acid-phosphoric acid <b>anhydride.</b> Those exhibiting no apparent ATP requirement seem to be susceptible to classifications as enol carboxylations in which the energy level of the substrate compound is high, rather than that of the carbon dioxide.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of frequency modulated electromagnetic neural stimulation (FREMS), a recently developed safe and effective treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, on cutaneous microvascular function. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with painful neuropathy were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind, crossover FREMS vs. placebo study; each received two series of 10 treatments of either FREMS or placebo in random sequence within no more than 3 weeks. Patients were studied at baseline, end of FREMS and placebo series, and after 4 months of follow-up. Cutaneous blood flow was measured by laser doppler flowmetry and partial tissue tension of oxygen (TcPO 2) and <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydride</b> (TcPCO 2) by oxymetry at the lower extremities in basal resting conditions and as incremental response after thermal stimulation. RESULTS: Crossover analysis showed no consistent differences between FREMS and placebo. After 4 -month follow-up, a 52 % increase of cutaneous blood flow was observed in resting conditions (P=. 0086 vs. baseline), while no differences were observed as incremental flow after warming; compared with baseline, no significant differences were observed for TcPO 2 and TcPCO 2, both in resting conditions and as incremental response to warm. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 10 treatments with FREMS may induce an enhancement of microvascular blood flow measurable at 4 months of follow-up. The findings of this study will need to be confirmed in a larger, adequately powered study (ClinicalTrial. gov Id: NCT 00337324) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the mineralogical, textural and physical behaviour {{of different types of}} compositions of building materials and their durability under attack by salt crystallisation, freezing and polluted atmosphere. 8 types of masonry samples were prepared using 4 types of lime mortars (pure lime mortar, mortar + air-entraining agent, mortar + pozzolana, mortar + pozzolana + air-entraining agent) sandwiched between pieces of brick or calcarenite. Data from granulometry, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, optical microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, mercury intrusion porosimetry, ultrasounds and accelerated aging tests were interpreted and compared. It was observed that high CO 2 concentrations favour a faster, more complete carbonation of lime mortars. It was seen a more prolific development of calcite crystals in the pores and fissures through which the <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydride</b> flows. Under natural conditions the carbonation was much slower. The mineralogy and texture of mortars varied {{depending on the type of}} additive used but the speed of the portlandite- calcite transformation did not change significantly. A fine layer of calcite microcrystals developed on the contact surface between the mortar and the brick (or the calcarenite). This is produced by the transformation of the portlandite which concentrates in this area due to capillarity. If on the one hand this surface may represent an obstacle to the flow of water between the different parts of the system formed by these materials, it may also favour greater adherence between the components, especially when the pieces being joined with the mortar are calcarenites. ...|$|E
40|$|Facing air {{pollution}} in large urban areas {{is one of the}} great challenges in health and environment protection. The use of photocatalytic products (Kaneko, 2002; Fujishima, 1999) may be an answer to such an issue. The main feature of these products, which generally contain titanium dioxide photocatalyst, lies in the ability to exploit both solar and suitable artificial light to induce chemical reactions which cause the destruction of surface adsorbed pollutants. This allows the removal of air pollutants and of organic compounds which would otherwise cause the progressive deterioration of buildings. The use of photocatalytic materials in confined environments may lead to an improvement of air quality in domestic, working and school environments, by the reduction of both organic and inorganic compounds (mainly converted to <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydride</b> and inorganic salts, respectively), and of particulate (PM 10 and PM 2, 5). In order to obtain the best performance from the photocatalytic finishing, it is necessary to consider practical aspects such as room lighting, type and distance of the light sources, and air humidity as well. The work presented here is being performed within the framework of a research project of the University of Padova, named "Nanotechnologies for the building trade. New photocatalytic materials based on metal systems-modified titanium dioxide. Application to cement and glass-based materials. Technological tests and fields of use for the proposed innovative materials". The issues involved in the project are as follows: (i) building-up simple tests and devices able to yield quantitative data about photodegradation both in solution and in gaseous systems, starting from the most common commercial titanium dioxide product (P 25); (ii) widening the light frequency range able to induce the photocatalytic process through doping of titanium dioxide (especially with N), and the subsequent preparation of the product as a nanopowder by means of a simple and inexpensive method; (iii) measuring the degradation effectiveness towards several pollutants, and studying the influence of the host matrix; (iv) testing different light sources for indoor applications; (v) verifying the effectiveness of other useful surface properties such as self-cleaning and bactericide action...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{and diverse}} {{physiological}} actions are found among 2 -oxazoline compounds. No {{reports of the}} synthesis or biological testing of 4 -spiro- 2 -aryl- 2 -oxazolines {{were found in the}} literature. On the basis of the known pharmacological activities of certain aza- and diazaspirans, it was felt that 4 -spiro- 2 -aryl- 2 -oxazolines should possess medicinal activity. In particular, it was reasoned that the combination in a bicyclic spiro structure of the 2 -oxazoline ring with rings systems commonly found in synthetic antitussive compounds might result in active antitussive agents. The aim of this research was the synthesis of a series· of 2 -aryl- 2 -oxazoline- 4 -spirocyclopentanes and a series of 12 ̆ 7 -methyl- 2 -aryl- 2 -oxazoline- 4 -spiro- 4 ’-piperidines. Six members were to be prepared in each series in which the aryl group represents respectively, a phenyl, a p-chloro, p-methyl, p-nitro, p-ethoxy, and p-dimethylaminophenyl radical. With the exception of the p-dimethylamino derivative, acylation of 1 -aminocyclopentane- 1 -carboxylic acid gave the corresponding amido acids, the methyl esters of which were reduced with lithium borohydride to the corresponding amide-alcohols. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was employed to produce 1 -(p-dimethylaminohenzamido) - 1 -carbomethoxycyclopentane from p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid and 1 -amino- 1 -carbomethoxycyclopentane after unsuccessful attempts to prepare it by the mixed <b>carbonic</b> <b>anhydride</b> method. Each amide-alcohol, on treatment with hydrogen chloride in chloroform, rearranged by N to 0 acyl migratilon to the corresponding 1 -amino- 1 -cyclopentylmethyl p-substituted benzoate hydrochloride. On treatment with base these compounds rearranged to the original amide-alcohols by 0 to N acyl migration. This sequence of reactions confirmed the structure of the amide-alcohols. Treatment of each amide-alcohol with thionyl chloride afforded the corresponding, 2 -aryl- 2 -oxazoline- 4 -spirocyclopentanes in good yields. The structure of these compounds was confirmed in each case by the infrared spectra and elemental analyses of the oxazoline and/or its hydrochloride. Futhermore, the structure of 2 -(p-ethoxyphenyl) - 2 -oxazoline- 4 -spirocyclopentane was confirmed by a proton magnetic resonance spectrum. Each oxazoline compound (except the p-dimethylamlnoderivative) was converted to the corresponding 1 -(p-substitutedbenzamido) - 1 -chloromethylcyclopentane by treatment with a saturated solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane. Each chloroamide compound (except the p-nitro derivative) was converted to the corresponding oxazoline by treatment with alkali in order to provide further evidence for the oxazoline structure of the products isolated from the thionyl chloride reactions. 4 -Amino-l-mothylpiporidine- 4 -carboxylic acid was obtained by both acid and alkaline hydrolysis of the corresponding hydantoin. 4 -Amino- 4 -hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine, which was obtained by the reduction of 4 -amino- 4 -carbomethoxy-l-methylpiperidine with lithium borohydride, was treated with benzoyl chloride and p-methylbenzoyl chloride to give respectively, 4 -benzamido- 4 -hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine and 4 -(p-methylbenzamido) - 4 -hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine. 4 -Benzamido- 4 -hydroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidine was also obtained by the reduction with lithium borohydride of 4 -benzamido- 4 -carbomethoxy- 1 -methylpiperidine which was prepared by benzoylation of 4 -amino- 4 -carbomethoxy-l-methylpiperidine. 12 ̆ 7 -Methyl- 2 -phenyl- and 1 ’-methyl- 2 -(p-methylphenyl) - 2 -oxazoline- 4 -spiro- 42 ̆ 7 -piperidine were prepared by treatment of the corresponding amido-alcohols with thionyl chloride...|$|E
