5|$|In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died. Gandhi, then 16 years old, and {{his wife}} of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi. The Gandhi couple had four more <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.|$|E
5|$|New Year's Eve of 1924 {{brought more}} illness. Wise's uncle Fred Gienke, his wife, Lily, {{and several of}} their <b>children</b> <b>all</b> began {{suffering}} stomach pains similar to those Hasel had experienced before her death. Several family members were hospitalized, and Lily and Fred were both dead by February 1925. In total, seventeen relatives were taken ill with similar symptoms {{in the fall and}} winter of 1924/1925. Four of the Gienke children were left partially paralyzed from the mysterious illness.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women with small <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E
50|$|The {{vaccination}} campaign targeted <b>all</b> <b>children</b> of applicable ages in Kousséri, ensuring protection for Cameroonian and refugee <b>children</b> alike. <b>All</b> <b>children</b> aged {{six months to}} 15 years were vaccinated against measles, and <b>all</b> <b>children</b> under 5, including newborns, were vaccinated against poliomyelitis.|$|R

5|$|The {{primitive}} early mines of Cornwall and Devon {{probably were}} operated by local extended families, with the men, women and <b>children</b> <b>all</b> working. Men and boys probably worked both {{above the surface}} and below ground, and women and girls worked only above ground; there is no archaeological evidence for women and children working underground in Bronze Age Britain, although some mines from the period contain tunnels so small that only children or very short adults could have worked in them.|$|E
5|$|Also in that year, Barbara Kepler {{contracted}} Hungarian spotted fever, {{then began}} having seizures. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three <b>children</b> <b>all</b> fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua. At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived Calvinist heresies {{in violation of}} the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return. The University of Padua—on the recommendation of the departing Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, {{traveled}} in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging to relatives during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The <b>children</b> <b>all</b> now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E
5|$|David {{was born}} Elizabeth Gwynne, {{the second of}} four <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> {{daughter}}s, of Rupert Sackville Gwynne and his wife, the Hon. Stella Gwynne, daughter of the 1st Viscount Ridley. Both parents' families had considerable fortunes, the Gwynnes from engineering and land speculation and the Ridleys from coal mining. Through the two families, David was of English, Scottish and Welsh or Irish descent and, through an ancestor on her father's side, also Dutch and Sumatran. She and her sisters grew up in Wootton Manor in Sussex, a seventeenth-century manor house with extensive modern additions by Detmar Blow. Her father, despite having a weak heart, insisted on pursuing a demanding political career, becoming Conservative MP for Eastbourne, and a junior minister in Bonar Law's government. Overwork, combined with his vigorous recreational pastimes, chiefly racing, riding, and womanising, brought about his death in 1924, aged 51.|$|E
5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes. Here they find the videotape setup and tapes dating {{all the way back to}} the '60s, including one of Amber Lynn LaPierre. The man who runs the park is promptly arrested, and Mulder finds graves of <b>children</b> <b>all</b> over his ranch.|$|E

5|$|In 1429, when Isabeau {{lived in}} English-occupied Paris, the {{accusation}} was again put forth that CharlesVII {{was not the}} son of CharlesVI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throne—the young HenryVI and disinherited Charles—this could have been propaganda {{to prop up the}} English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughter—a rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after Orléans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Wendell Willkie {{was born}} in Elwood, Indiana, on February 18, 1892, the son of Henrietta (Trisch) and Herman Francis Willkie. Both of his parents were lawyers, his mother {{being one of the}} first women {{admitted}} to the Indiana bar. His father {{was born in}} Germany and his mother was born in Indiana, to German parents; his grandparents were involved in the unsuccessful 1848 revolutions in Germany. The Trisches initially settled in Kansas Territory but, as they were abolitionists, moved to Indiana after the territory was opened to slavery in the mid-1850s. Willkie was the fourth of six <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> intelligent, and learned skills during the nightly debates around the dinner table that would later serve him well.|$|E
5|$|Sidney Weinberg, {{who rose}} from the job of {{assistant}} porter to head Goldman Sachs from 1930 to 1969, was married at Baith Israel Anshei Emes in 1920. The Weinberg family, which had joined the synagogue {{when it was still}} on Beorum Place, was also very active in the synagogue; Sidney's mother, Sophie, was sisterhood president from 1912 to 1913, and his father, Pincus, served as president from 1919 to 1921, and the <b>children</b> <b>all</b> attended the Sunday school and Talmud Torah. The Weinbergs subsequently moved to Flatbush, where in 1924 Pincus became the first president of the East Midwood Jewish Center.|$|E

5|$|Stanley's {{will was}} signed on 20 March 1908, and was probated on 26 October 1909. When he died, his wealth was £58,905 18s. 4d. The will {{provided}} for Stanley's wife, and each nephew, niece, great-nephew and great-niece were mentioned by name, and left money and shares. His brother's {{wife and his}} adopted daughter also received shares. Every servant received £5, as did each teacher in the school. Every factory employee received £2. Several individuals received monthly incomes of £1 or £2 a month. Croydon General Hospital, the Croydon Natural History Society, The British Home and Hospital for Incurables, Croydon Police Court Relief Fund and Croydon Society for the Protection of Women and <b>Children</b> <b>all</b> received shares, as did the Croydon Corporation, although these were {{to be used for}} the purchase of books annually to be used as prizes for students in Croydon.|$|E
5|$|William Foster and William Eddy, both {{survivors}} of the snowshoe party, started from Bear Valley to intercept Reed, taking with them a man named John Stark. After one day, they met Reed helping his <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Halfway there they found the crudely mutilated and eaten remains of two children and Mrs. Graves, with one-year-old Elizabeth Graves crying beside her mother's body. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. Stark picked up two children and all the provisions, and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graveses to Bear Valley.|$|E
5|$|A {{second group}} of 770 {{children}} from Stara Gradiška followed on 13–14July, while a third, consisting of another 850 children were transported from the Adriatic coastal village of Jablanac {{at the end of}} the month. On 5August, 800 more children arrived from the concentration camp at Mlaka. The last group arrived from the nearby village of Gornja Reka on 14August with 150 <b>children,</b> <b>all</b> boys. In total, 3,136 children arrived at the camp up to 14August. According to the historian Dragoje Lukić, a total of 3,336 children passed through the camp during its existence, aged between one and fourteen years old. One survivor, Dušanka Šmitran, who had previously been held at one of the sub-camps of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex, stated that she was dragged away from her mother at the sub-camp and they were packed tightly into railway wagons for the journey. On arrival in Zagreb, she said they were taken to the Croatian Red Cross building where they were washed, had their hair cut, and were allowed to eat as much as they could. She remarked that this was the only time such things occurred during her time in the Ustaše camps.|$|E
