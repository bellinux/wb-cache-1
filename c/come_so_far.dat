5|$|Cardiff City is yet {{to return}} to the FA Charity Shield, which was renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. However, between 2001 and 2006, the match was held at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. The closest Cardiff City has <b>come</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> to {{returning}} to the match was in 2008 when they reached the FA Cup Final once more, but lost by a goal to nil against Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, Packer {{was seen}} disconsolately {{counting}} cars as {{they arrived in}} the car park at some of his matches. He held one glimmer of hope, however. The best attended matches had been the day-night fixtures, and this format would become {{the backbone of the}} programming for the second season. In hindsight, his organisation's ability to even stage the games at such short notice was a triumph and excellent fine-tuning for what was to <b>come.</b> <b>So</b> <b>far,</b> the ACB had enjoyed the backing of the press and the true aficionados of the game. But a series of misfortunes and poor decisions came to plague the ACB in their battle to stay ahead of Packer.|$|E
500|$|Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems {{reflecting}} a {{preoccupation with the}} teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with [...] "wit and American colloquial language". Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the [...] "salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention {{to the life of}} Jesus Christ" [...] and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the [...] "poetic tradition of Christian devotion" [...] alongside Hopkins, Eliot and Auden. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: [...] "The Savior must have been/ A docile Gentleman–/ To <b>come</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> so cold a Day/ For little Fellowmen/ The Road to Bethlehem/ Since He and I were Boys/ Was leveled, but for that twould be/ A rugged billion Miles–".|$|E

500|$|When Higginson {{urged her}} to come to Boston in 1868 so that they could {{formally}} meet for the first time, she declined, writing: [...] "Could it please your convenience to <b>come</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as Amherst I should be very glad, but I do not cross my Father's ground to any House or town". It was not until he came to Amherst in 1870 that they met. Later he referred to her, in the most detailed and vivid physical account of her on record, as [...] "a little plain woman with two smooth bands of reddish hair ... in a very plain & exquisitely clean white piqué & a blue net worsted shawl." [...] He also felt that he never was [...] "with any one who drained my nerve power so much. Without touching her, she drew from me. I am glad not to live near her." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have <b>come</b> <b>so</b> <b>far?</b> ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

60|$|Yet such would {{imitative}} art be in its perfection. Not by {{any means}} an easy thing, as Reynolds supposes it.
