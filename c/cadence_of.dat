25|$|Ginsberg's poetry was {{strongly}} influenced by Modernism (most importantly the American style of Modernism pioneered by William Carlos Williams), Romanticism (specifically William Blake and John Keats), the beat and <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> jazz (specifically that of bop musicians such as Charlie Parker), and his Kagyu Buddhist practice and Jewish background. He considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake, the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca. The power of Ginsberg's verse, its searching, probing focus, its long and lilting lines, {{as well as its}} New World exuberance, all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed.|$|E
25|$|In the preface, Titelouze {{explains}} that this structure makes these Magnificat settings usable for the Benedictus. Save for the introductory ones, {{all of the}} versets are fugal. Most feature two main points of imitation: the first concludes on the mediant <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> the mode, and so, Titelouze writes, the organist can shorten any verset during the service by substituting this cadence with one on the final. Most fugue subjects are derived from the chant; there are many double fugues and inversion fugues in the collection. Four-voice polyphony is employed throughout the collection. The music is much more forward-looking than in the Hymnes (see Example 2 for an excerpt {{from one of the}} inversion fugues).|$|E
25|$|Gary Grice {{developed}} {{an interest in}} hip-hop by attending block parties {{as a child in}} the early 1970s. He was involved in breakdance, graffiti, and DJing. Early on he {{developed an}} interest in writing, studying Mother Goose and nursery rhyme. In 1974-76 he listened to The Last Poets, however he was attracted by profanity rather than content, and didn't understand the underlying messages until many years later. The Last Poets, as well as songs by The Isley Brothers, the Commodores, and the O'Jays had a big part in his early life, especially regarding the tone and <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> speech. Later on, he began to listen to hip hop and R, for example by Secret Weapon and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five.|$|E

Numerous dynamics are marked in the score: piano, forte, crescendo and decrescendo. This episode ends with the dynamic double forte decrescendo on a perfect <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> G [...] (D dominant seventh → G [...] major), repeated twice identically. The G [...] major chord becomes the dominant of the key of the second exposition.|$|E
500|$|The {{sections}} {{comprising the}} cantata are traditionally grouped into four movements. The musicologist Carol Traupman-Carr notes: [...] "Although movements {{are marked by}} tempo changes, occasionally key changes, meter changes, and double bar lines, Cantata 106 {{appears to be a}} continuous work. Bach helps create a more seamless effect by occasionally resolving the <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> one section at the downbeat of another, thus blurring the beginnings and endings of traditional movements." [...] The keys and tempo markings are taken from the first publication. The keys in the Neue Bach-Ausgabe and other more recent publications start in F major.|$|E

500|$|The Chicken Dinner Bar {{had been}} {{a product of the}} Sperry Candy Company, which was {{acquired}} by Pearson’s in 1962. [...] The bar, introduced during The Great Depression, was so called in reference to President Herbert Hoover’s promise of “a chicken in every pot”. [...] The bar did not contain chicken or other poultry products, but was, rather, a chocolate-covered nut roll. [...] Pearson’s discontinued the bar’s production after the acquisition. Early TV commercials sang [...] "Chick - Chick - Chick - Chick - Chicken Dinner" [...] similar to, and in the <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> a rooster crowing.|$|E
500|$|After {{the closing}} <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> the sinfonia, {{there is a}} reprise of the ritornello in the {{orchestra}} in a slightly expanded form. Immediately the chorus enters in pairs with their own musical material, singing in homphonic form. The word [...] "brich" [...] (break) in their initial declamatory phrase [...] "Brich dem hungrigen dein Brot" [...] is echoed in the pauses in the musical setting, pauses already present in the fragmentary detached quavers of the accompaniment. Equally well the repetition of this phrase is broken for one bar during which the original texture of the sinfonia is briefly heard again. [...] describes the musical material as representing [...] "imploring gestures, emotionally choked, their pleas breaking and stuttering." [...] In contrast the following phrase [...] "und die, so in Elend sind" [...] has sustained melismas in all the parts on the word [...] "Elend" [...] (misery), with chromaticism, suspensions and descending quaver figures.|$|E

500|$|In the fugato section each {{voice in}} the chorus sings the fugal subject {{following}} the tenors: the altos come in next, emerging from the tenor part; then the sopranos, emerging from the alto part; and finally the fourth statement of the subject in the basses leads into a true repetition of the closing two bar <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> the ritornello, with a reprise of the original accompaniment in the orchestra, thus concluding the fugato episode. As [...] comments, the first tenor entry with its prominent A flats and D flats [...] "has a pathos all of its own, especially when for eight bars it is joined in imitation by the altos." [...] The musicologist André Pirro notes that the A flat–D flat motif in the fugal subject on the word Elend is typical of Bach's use of suspended figures to evoke the burden of suffering and misery.|$|E

After being approached by Lee to star in the film, he was given the opportunity to play Frazier or Dalton Russell, but turned down the latter, citing concerns over the character's disguise. TotalFilm.com|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=April 13, 2013|work=Total Film}} Washington cited his Broadway performance as Brutus in Julius Caesar as inspiration: [...] "I think it actually helped me prepare for Frazier—Russell ’s script is heavy with great dialogue. My character does a lot of talking! I kind of thought of Frazier as Brutus goes to Brooklyn. For me, there is a certain rhythm and <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> New Yorkers, and this gave me the opportunity to play a New York kind of guy who’s going through a lot while dealing with this smart and challenging adversary." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a further}} {{contrast}} in the next phrase [...] "führe ins Haus" [...] where the soprano and alto are paired with a long lyrical melisma in semiquavers on the word [...] "führe" [...] (lead). This new musical material is matched by the semiquaver figures of the woodwind. Similarly the detached quaver accompaniment in the continuo is matched by parallel figures in the tenor and bass parts. In the next four bars of this second rendition of the sinfonia, [...] there is a reprise of the rising semiquaver figures in the continuo and sustained chords in the woodwind. In the first two bars each voice in the chorus enters successively with a new rising fourth motif for the phrase [...] "und die" [...] before the music intensifies as the chorus joins the sustained chords of the woodwind for the word [...] "Elend". The final two bars of the closing <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> the ritornello are more complex. On the one hand the mounting tension in the previous bars is resolved with the phrase [...] "führe ins Haus" [...] in the soprano, alto and bass voices.|$|E

The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins. Here she imagines herself as the sea itself, proud of all the belegged creatures she's spit out onto land over the last hundred million years. It's the nearest evolutionists have come to having their own gospel tune".|$|E

Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{added that the}} technique of looking for a boss's weak spot was similar to Metroid. Famitsu reviewers praised how the game encouraged players to experiment with the basic [...] "grab, throw, and shake" [...] gameplay.

O'Neill (Nintendo Life) thought the game had great variety in gameplay mechanics (from maze puzzles to outrunning lava), graphics (from bosses that scale back the screen to levels with screen rotation), and audio (from upbeat quirk to scary), and added that {{he was surprised to}} hear critics speak against the [...] "unique, varied, and dramatic" [...] sound. Scott McCall of AllGame too appreciated the sound, from the voice to the [...] "almost indescribable" [...] music.

500|$|Remember is {{a fantasy}} novella set in Berlin, {{depicting}} dramatic {{events in the}} life of dandy Aubrey de Vere. Perpessicius argued that the main protagonist was [...] "taken, apparently, from a short story by Oscar Wilde", while others noted a direct reference to the 19th century writer Aubrey de Vere, an indirect one to Poe's Lenore (the lyric: [...] "And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!"), or a partial anagram of the name Barbey d'Aurevilly. The mysterious events standing {{at the center of the}} writing have been interpreted by several critics as an allusion to de Vere's homosexuality. Probably taking place in 1907, it contrasts Caragiale's other, more tenebrous, writings of its kind—one of its main traits is the writer's nostalgia towards the German capital, which serves to give the story an atmospheric rather than narrative quality. Its depiction of hallucinatory visions probably owes inspiration to Gérard de Nerval, while, according to historian Sorin Antohi, the main character is reminiscent of Joris-Karl Huysmans' Des Esseintes (see À rebours). Lovinescu praises the story for [...] "the gravity of its tone, [...] the <b>cadence</b> <b>of</b> its sumptuous, cultured and noble style." [...] George Călinescu, who referred to the narrative as [...] "a pastiche", and to Berlin as portrayed in Caragiale's story as [...] "a Berlin-Sodom", concluded that the text allowed readers to form [...] "the direct sensation" [...] of Bucharest as a [...] "Balkan Sodom" [...] to be discerned from the German landscape.|$|E
