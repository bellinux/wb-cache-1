Different {{from the results of}} previous studies, in this paper the membership function of the fuzzy minimum total <b>crash</b> <b>cost</b> is constructed based on Zadeh's extension principle and fuzzy solutions are provided. A pair of two-level mathematical programs parameterized by possibility level [alpha] is formulated to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the fuzzy minimum total <b>crash</b> <b>cost</b> at [alpha]. By enumerating different values of [alpha], the membership function of the fuzzy minimum total <b>crash</b> <b>cost</b> is constructed, and the corresponding optimal activity time for each activity is also obtained at the same time. An example of time-cost trade-off problem with several fuzzy parameters is solved successfully to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.

Government also pays when its employees crash while working and covers fringe benefits for crash-involved employees and their benefit-eligible dependents in non-work hours. We estimated government shares of <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> by component.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{measure of}} <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> {{is required to}} support effective decision-making about transportation investments. In particular, underinvestment will occur if measurement fails to capture the full <b>cost</b> of <b>crashes.</b> Such mis-measurement and underinvestment may be occurring {{in the case of}} crashes at highway-rail grade crossings (HRGCs). HRGC <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> can be substantial because of the severity of crashes. However, another important potential cost is the disruption to the transportation and logistics system. Existing methodologies capture the first set of costs but often fail to fully capture the second set. This research provides a standardized methodology for assessing the expected annual <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> at HRGCs in Nebraska, and the potential benefits from removing and replacing HRGC sites, for example, with an overhead bridge. Avoided <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> are the primary benefit of safety improvements but logistics costs savings also are identified. Throughout the report, we trace a scenario using traffic conditions at the mean at-grade highway-rail crossing crash. We find that the <b>cost</b> of a <b>crash,</b> if it did occur, would be $ 805, 675. The lifetime benefit of removing an at-grade intersection and replacing it with an overhead bridge or an underpass would be $ 235, 836 given the traffic conditions at the mean Nebraska HRGC crash site. Given the relatively low traffic volumes found in many parts of Nebraska, the injuries and deaths associated with crashes are the primary cost at the mean crash site, with logistics costs accounting for a small share of costs (though exceeding the share of operating costs for trucks and rail). Naturally, benefits would vary given different traffic conditions, with benefits rising if the number of motor vehicles and trains using a highway-rail at grade crossing increases. More generally, in this project we developed a spreadsheet which can be used to calculate the economic <b>costs</b> of individual <b>crashes</b> based on the annual average daily traffic (AADT) and detour time on the impacted roadway and train traffic and length of delay on the railway.

40|$|Cobb-Douglas Production Function {{was widely}} used in {{economics}} and productivity studies across many sectors. The function’s quantitative modeling of resource inputs and production outputs is appealing to the research domain of construction management. In this thesis we explored this function’s application in construction schedule crashing and project risk analysis related to duration of construction projects. Existing research on construction time-cost tradeoff issues rarely explore {{the origin of the}} <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> which is defined as the cost needed to shorten the project to the desired duration. In the existing literature <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> function was either assumed without much justification, or came from ad-hoc regression analysis of historical data of some actual projects. Cobb-Douglas production function, which defines the portion of labor and equipment needed based on the production rate, provides a much-needed piece to modeling the cost functions in the construction time-cost tradeoff problem during the schedule crashing process. This new perspective fills a gap of existing time-cost tradeoff research by considering project duration, labor and equipment cost as parameters of the Cobb-Douglas production function. A case study was presented to show how the proposed framework works. Case results are presented based on deterministic values of Cobb-Douglas function’s parameters (and). Presented results show each of labor and equipment’s portion in total cost. Here, more than that we had earlier, we can analyze different options based on just one of these factors to find the optimum solution. Not only, the total labor and total equipment cost of a project is available, labor and equipment cost of each activity’s option can be calculated and compared with other options. After that, sensitivity analysis on the mentioned parameters was conducted to further explore the model’s sensitivities to these parameters. Inflation factors in labor and equipment cost were incorporated in the sensitivity analysis based on assumed costs’ fluctuation range. The results show that the total cost highly depends on the summation of and. The conclusion of the thesis is that utilizing Cobb-Douglas production function in construction <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> analysis expands our understanding of <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> sources and the portion of each of elements. Moreover, from sensitivity analysis results, it is concluded that labor and equipment efficiencies have significant effects on total cost of a project.

40|$|Road {{barriers}} {{have been}} used as an effective countermeasure to prevent exposure of errant vehicles to both vehicles travelling in the opposite direction and to roadside hazards. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the in-service safety performance of three types of road barriers (concrete barriers, steel W-beam guardrails, and high-tension cable barriers) in Indiana using cross-sectional analysis based on crash data. The quantitative evaluation was comprised of three components: 1) the effect of the road, barrier scenarios, and traffic on the barrier-relevant (BR) crash frequency, 2) the effect of the road and the barrier scenarios on the BR harmful events, and 3) the effect of the BR events and other conditions on the injury outcomes. The introduction of the BR harmful events linked the crash onset with its outcome. The three developed statistical models were connected through their inputs-outputs and followed the sequence of various BR events during the BR crash. This improvement allowed a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the barriers’ safety effects and a more efficient use of data. The injury outcomes were estimated for all the individuals in a crash rather than for the most severe outcome of a crash. Further improvement of the cost estimates was accomplished by utilizing hospital data. For median barriers, this study found that the total number of BR crashes was higher with the use of median barriers, mostly due to the introduction of collisions with barriers and an increase in the collisions after redirecting vehicles back to traffic. These undesirable effects of barriers were surpassed by the positive results of reducing hazardous events such as cross-median crashes, rollover events, and collisions with roadside hazards, which substantially reduced the number of severe injuries and fatalities. The average (unit) <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> were estimated for roads without barriers and for roads with various barrier scenarios. The <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> were reduced by 50 % where cable barriers were in medians wider than 50 feet and where concrete barriers or guardrails were in medians less than or equal to 50 feet wide. Roadside barriers (guardrails) reduced the unit <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> by 20 % to 30 %. Median cable barriers were found to be the most effective among all the studied barriers due to the smallest increase in the crash frequency and least severe injuries in barrier-relevant crashes. A cable barrier’s offset to the travelled way was also investigated in this study. When considering vehicles moving in one direction, the nearside cable barriers installed at an offset less than or equal to 30 feet performed better than far-side cable barriers with a larger offsets thanks to the better protection they provide for vehicles against rollovers in the median and impact with the median drain. Consequently, the biggest safety benefit can be expected where cables barriers are installed in the median at both edges. The results were implemented through a set of crash modification factors and unit <b>crash</b> <b>costs</b> estimated for 51 road-barrier scenarios.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} a two-echelon supply chain inventory problem consisting of a single-vendor and a single-buyer with controllable lead time and investment for quality improvements. This paper presents an integrated vendor-buyer inventory model in order to minimize the sum of the ordering cost, holding cost, setup cost, investment for quality improvement and <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> by simultaneously optimizing the optimal order quantity, process quality, lead time and number of deliveries the vendor to the buyer in one production run with the objective of minimizing total relevant cost. Here the lead-time <b>crashing</b> <b>cost</b> has been assumed to be an exponentially function of the lead-time length. The main contribution of proposed model is an efficient iterative algorithm developed to minimize integrated total relevant cost for the single vendor and the single buyer systems with controllable lead time reduction and investment for quality improvements. Graphical representation is also presented to illustrate the proposed model. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the procedures and results of the proposed algorithm. Matlab coding is also developed to derive the optimal solution and present numerical examples to illustrate the model...|$|R

Crashes may also result from different objects found on the tracks, including other cars; in two sequences, hazards are encountered off the track as the car passes through the walls between two mouse-holes, and across a billiard table. All <b>crashes</b> <b>cost</b> time while the car is replaced on the track.|$|R
