50|$|The {{mosquito}} species Anopheles gambiae, {{which is}} notorious mainly as a malaria vector, {{has been demonstrated}} to be a <b>competent</b> <b>vector</b> for Rickettsia felis.

In addition, in tropical regions where Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti are established disease vectors and ectoparasites of humans, patients have tested positive for Rickettsia felis. To some authorities this suggests that Aedes species {{might be able to}} infect their hosts with Rickettsia felis, and that patients in, or returning from, the tropics with fevers of unknown origin, should be tested for Rickettsia felis infection.

40|$|The {{cliff swallow}} (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota, Vieillot) could {{potentially}} {{play an important}} role in the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) because of its breeding ecology, reservoir competence status, and potentially high natural exposure rates. These birds nest in colonies and their nests are occupied year round by swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius, Hovarth), hematophagus ectoparasites that feed primarily on cliff swallows. Swallow bugs are most likely exposed to WNV while feeding on infectious blood of cliff swallows and, thus, if <b>competent</b> <b>vectors,</b> could contribute to initiation and maintenance of seasonal WNV transmission. In addition, swallow bugs remain within nests year round and, therefore, if persistently infected and <b>competent</b> <b>vectors,</b> they could provide an overwintering mechanism for WNV. We tested the hypothesis that swallow bugs become infected with WNV through direct abdominal inoculation or ingestion of infectious blood meals. We observed that swallow bugs did not maintain or amplify WNV, and infectious virus titers within bugs declined over 15 d post-exposure. These results suggest that swallow bugs may not be <b>competent</b> <b>vectors</b> of WNV, and therefore are unlikely to play a significant role in transmission...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{approaches}} {{for controlling disease}} vectors have aimed either to reduce wild-type populations or to replace wild-type populations with insects that cannot transmit pathogens. Here, we propose a Reduce and Replace (R&R) strategy in which released insects have both female-killing and anti-pathogen genes. We develop a mathematical model to numerically explore release strategies involving an R&R strain of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. We show that repeated R&R releases {{may lead to a}} temporary decrease in mosquito population density and, in the absence of fitness costs associated with the anti-pathogen gene, a long-term decrease in <b>competent</b> <b>vector</b> population density. We find that R&R releases more rapidly reduce the transient and long-term <b>competent</b> <b>vector</b> densities than female-killing releases alone. We show that releases including R&R females lead to greater reduction in <b>competent</b> <b>vector</b> density than male-only releases. The magnitude of reduction in total and competent vectors depends upon the release ratio, release duration, and whether females are included in releases. Even when the anti-pathogen allele has a fitness cost, R&R releases lead to greater reduction in competent vectors than female-killing releases during the release period; however, continued releases are needed to maintain low density of competent vectors long-term. We discuss the results of the model as motivation for more detaile...|$|E

40|$|The {{cliff swallow}} (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) could play an {{important}} role in the transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) because of its breeding ecology, reservoir competence status, and potentially high natural exposure rates. Cliff swallows nest within colonies and their nests are occupied year-round by swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius), hematophagus ectoparasites that feed primarily on cliff swallows. These parasites are likely exposed to WNV while feeding on infectious blood of nesting cliff swallow adults and nestlings and thus, if <b>competent</b> <b>vectors,</b> could contribute to seasonal elevations in WNV transmission. In addition, swallow bugs remain within nests year-round and therefore could provide a potential overwintering mechanism for WNV if persistently infected. To test the hypotheses that swallow bugs are <b>competent</b> <b>vectors</b> and become persistently infected with WNV, we experimentally inoculated cliff swallow nestlings, allowed swallow bugs to feed on these birds during the acute phase of infection, and then exposed naive cliff swallow nestlings to the same swallow bugs. In addition, a subset of swallow bugs that fed on infectious swallow nestlings was maintained through a simulated overwintering period. Although swallow bugs ingested infectious blood (up to 106. 8 plaque-forming units of WNV/mL serum) and subsequently blood-fed on naive swallows, no WNV transmission was detected, and all bugs tested WNV negative after the simulated overwintering period. Although many ecologic scenarios exist beyond the present study, our results suggest that swallow bugs may be unlikely to serve as <b>competent</b> biological <b>vectors</b> for WNV during active transmission periods or to reinitiate seasonal transmission...|$|R

The present study reports the species abundance, composition and vectoral competence of Anopheles species in six areas of Lagos in Nigeria. The human blood index (HBI) and sporozoite rates (SR) were the components of vectoral competence. Human landing catches was used in collection. Species identification morphologically and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out on mosquitoes.

Replication <b>competent</b> NYVAC-C-KC <b>vectors</b> induced higher HIV-specific responses, as measured by IFN-ÔÅß ELISpot assay, than the replication defective NYVAC-C vectors. Application through scarification only required one immunization to induce maximum HIV-specific immune responses. This method simultaneously induced relatively lower anti-vector responses. In contrast, two to three immunizations were required when the NYVAC-C-KC vectors were given by intradermal or intramuscular injection and this method tended to generate slightly lower responses.
