50|$|Pigtails {{can have}} <b>female</b> or male <b>connectors.</b> <b>Female</b> <b>connectors</b> could be mounted {{in a patch}} panel, often in pairs {{although}} single-fiber solutions exist, {{to allow them to}} be connected to endpoints or other fiber runs with patch fibers. Alternatively they can have male connectors and plug directly into an optical transceiver.|$|R
2500|$|Where XLR {{connectors}} {{are used}} for DC power, the genders are reversed {{with respect to their}} standard use for line-level and mic-level audio. Typically, audio signals on XLR connectors [...] "follow the pin," [...] such that a male connector is an output and a <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> is an input. In most power applications (not just XLR <b>connectors)</b> the <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> is the output and the male connector is the input. This makes accidental contact with live parts less likely. In audio devices it also prevents accidental application of DC power to signal inputs.|$|R

5000|$|A Speakon {{connector}} {{is designed}} with a locking system {{that may be}} designed for soldered or screw-type connections. Line <b>connectors</b> (<b>female)</b> mate with (male) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join cables, a coupler can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube). Recently the manufacturer has introduced a new series called STX which includes also male line <b>connectors</b> and <b>female</b> panel Speakon <b>connectors</b> are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4" [...] speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} DMX512 1990 {{specified that}} where connectors are used, the data link shall use five-pin XLR style electrical <b>connectors</b> (XLR-5), with <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> used on transmitting (OUT) ports and male connectors on receiving ports.The {{use of any}} other XLR style connector is prohibited.|$|R
50|$|Port {{connectors}} may be male or <b>female,</b> but <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are much}} more common. Bent pins are easier to replace on a cable than on a connector attached to a computer, so it was common to use <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> for the fixed side of an interface.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} cables used in DMX512 networks employ XLR5 connectors, with a {{male connector}} on one end and a <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> on the other end. The cable's male connector attaches to the transmitting, female jack (OUT), and its <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> attaches to the receiving, male jack (IN).|$|R
5000|$|Some cords contain {{multiple}} <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> {{in close}} proximity of one another; others have <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> spaced {{along the length of}} the cord. Cords generally contain either grounded or ungrounded connectors. While a grounded male connector can be forced into an ungrounded female socket, this is unsafe.|$|R

50|$|RS-232 devices may be {{classified}} as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, male connectors have DTE pin functions, and <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "socket" [...] is {{analogous}} to physical <b>female</b> <b>connectors,</b> communication between two nodes through a channel being visualized as a cable with two male connectors plugging into sockets at each node. Similarly, the term [...] "port" [...] (another term for a <b>female</b> <b>connector)</b> is used for external endpoints at a node, and the term [...] "socket" [...] is also used for an internal endpoint of local inter-process communication (IPC) (not over a network). However, the analogy is strained, as network communication need not be one-to-one or have a channel.|$|R

50|$|The usual wiring has the {{positive}} (red) wire {{running to the}} terminal with a square profile, and the negative (black) wire running to the half-circle, half-square terminal. This is true for both genders of <b>connector.</b> The <b>female</b> sockets are in a male housing and the male pins are in a female housing. The male pins (<b>female</b> housing) <b>connector</b> is usually on the battery side.|$|R
50|$|The widest {{application}} of D-subs is for RS-232 serial communications, though the standard {{did not make}} this connector mandatory. RS-232 devices originally used the DB25, but for many applications the less common signals were omitted, allowing a DE-9 to be used. The standard specifies a male connector for terminal equipment and a <b>female</b> <b>connector</b> for modems, but many variations exist. IBM PC-compatible computers tend to have male connectors at the device and <b>female</b> <b>connectors</b> at the modems. Early Apple Macintosh models used DE-9 connectors for RS-422 multi-drop serial interfaces (which can operate as RS-232). Later Macintosh models use 8-pin miniature DIN connectors instead.|$|R
