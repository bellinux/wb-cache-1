2500|$|Liberace's fame in the United States was matched {{for a time}} in the United Kingdom. In 1956, {{an article}} in the Daily Mirror by {{columnist}} Cassandra (William Connor) described Liberace as [...] "…the summit of sex—the pinnacle of masculine, feminine and neuter. Everything that he, she and it can ever want… a deadly, winking, sniggering, snuggling, <b>chromium-plated,</b> scent-impregnated, luminous, quivering, giggling, fruit-flavoured, mincing, ice-covered heap of mother love", a description which strongly implied that he was a homosexual.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept for}} the V design came from Winston Churchill's famous V sign, and the V {{denomination}} {{mark on the}} US 5¢ pieces of 1883–1912. A novel feature was an inscription of Morse code on the coin. This International Code message meant [...] "We Win When We Work Willingly" [...] and was placed along the rim on the reverse instead of denticles. The regular reverse and composition were resumed in 1946. [...] <b>Chromium-plated</b> steel was again used for the 5¢ coin from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War, but the reverse was unchanged.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, {{the size}} of the 1¢ was reduced and the silver {{fineness}} of the 5¢, 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ coins was reduced to 0.800 silver/.200 copper. [...] This composition was maintained for the 10¢, 25¢ and 50¢ piece through 1966, but the debasement of the 5¢ piece continued in 1922 with the silver 5¢ being entirely replaced by a larger nickel coin. In 1942, as a wartime measure, nickel was replaced by tombac in the 5¢ coin, which was changed in shape from round to dodecagonal. <b>Chromium-plated</b> steel was used for the 5¢ in 1944 and 1945 and between 1951 and 1954, after which nickel was readopted. The 5¢ returned to a round shape in 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The 1960 Valiant {{exemplified}} Chrysler's {{leadership in}} aluminum die casting. While the aluminum Slant-6 engine block wouldn't enter production until 1961, the Kokomo, Indiana, foundry produced {{a number of}} other aluminum parts for the 1960 Valiant, all instrumental in reducing the total weight of the car. The 1960 model contained as much as [...] of aluminum in structural and decorative forms, with the majority of the material used in cast form as chassis parts. These parts included the oil pump, water pump, alternator housing, Hyper-Pak (see below) and standard production intake manifolds, all-new Torqueflite A-904 automatic transmission case and [...] tail extension, and numerous other small parts. These cast-aluminum parts were roughly 60% lighter than corresponding parts of cast iron. A cast aluminum part had the benefit of reduced section thickness where strength was not a vital consideration. Section thickness of cast-iron parts were often dictated by casting practice, which required at least [...] to ensure good castings. Exterior decorative parts stamped from aluminum were lighter than similar <b>chromium-plated</b> zinc castings. The entire grille and surrounding molding on the Valiant weighed only [...] If this same assembly had been made of die-cast zinc, as many grilles of the era were, it would have weighed an estimated [...] An estimated —about 4% of a Valiant's total shipping weight—was saved with the [...] of aluminum parts.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of debuting with a {{full-length}} album, Swervedriver released {{a series of}} four-track EPs over the span of a year, subscribing to the popular trend in the early '90s. [...] "If you had 4 songs ready-ish, you would record them there and then and put them all out ASAP. No such thing as 'saving songs for the album' back then," [...] explained Hartridge. Recording was performed at The Greenhouse & Falconer Studios in London and all tracks were produced by the band. Swervedriver's debut offering, Son of Mustang Ford, was released on 16 July 1990 and included the song [...] "Kill the Superheroes", one of Franklin's first attempts at writing in an alternate tuning. Franklin stated in NME, [...] "Son of Mustang Ford {{was based on the}} Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas idea – driving around, out of your box, over America's landscapes." [...] The EP was characterized as [...] "a <b>chromium-plated</b> piece of automobile romanticism." [...] The group launched the release with an appearance on the John Peel BBC Radio 1 show on 31 July 1990, performing a select B-side from each of their three debut EPs along with the song [...] "Over" [...] (which would not see an official release for 15 years). The release of Rave Down, the second EP in the series, followed in November. Mary Anne Hobbs called its title track [...] "a cyclone of wild, swollen riff machinery that sounds like it's been played with dislocated shoulder joints." [...] Both EPs received favorable reviews and their title singles made their way into the UK indie and metal charts. However, mainstream British music press soon shifted their focus to bands who fit easier into the shoegazer mould. The group began gaining popularity in the United States, and in early 1991 Swervedriver signed with American label A Records and went on their first US tour, a brief [...] run of shows in support of Ned's Atomic Dustbin that kicked off at the Marquee in New York City. On 22 July 1991, their third EP, Sandblasted, was released with the title single reaching number 67 on the UK chart and being described as [...] "a head-on collision between guitars raging for chaos." ...|$|E

50|$|A four-seat tourer, {{now much}} sought after, joined the saloons in mid 1935 and a de-luxe version, the CX, with <b>chromium-plated</b> trim was {{available}} from late 1935 to early 1937.|$|E
50|$|Improvements {{announced}} were: <b>chromium-plated</b> cylinder bores for the engine; a new more rigid {{chassis frame}} {{to go with}} new independent front suspension and a new synchromesh gearbox. Chassis lubrication was now centralised.|$|E
50|$|These {{guns were}} similar to Mark 9, with the same shell weight and maximum range, with a smaller chamber and rifling twist {{increased}} from 1 in 35 to 1 in 25 in a <b>chromium-plated</b> bore.|$|E
50|$|For 1938 {{the engine}} was updated to {{overhead}} valve as fitted to the Wolseley Ten increasing the power output from 27 to 37.5 bhp. The <b>chromium-plated</b> radiator surround {{was replaced by a}} painted one, and all paint schemes were single, rather than two-tone.|$|E
50|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220-6224, were painted in Caledonian blue with banding in silver-coloured {{aluminium}} paint.

50|$|On 14 October 1931 Vauxhall {{announced}} their Silent 80 with a quieter engine, constant mesh 3rd gear and quieter gearbox. Car bodies were now mounted on rubber blocks, {{and they were}} given a <b>chromium-plated</b> shell for the radiator, large hubs with chromium hubcaps and new body styles.|$|E
50|$|It uses long {{piston stroke}} gas {{operated}} action with a rotating bolt.

50|$|The {{barrel and}} rifling are <b>chromium-plated</b> to prevent fouling. The bolt housing has grooves to allow bolt movement, even in {{extremely}} adverse {{conditions such as}} exposure to mud, dust, or sand. The exterior surfaces of the firearm are finished with epoxy resin coating for protection against corrosion and damage.|$|E
5000|$|The libel action {{related to}} an article Connor wrote {{describing}} Liberace as"...the summit of sex - the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter.

50|$|The firms MG and Rover, amongst other British sporty {{cars in the}} 1960s often {{specified}} Rostyle wheels as {{original equipment}} instead of ones made of light alloy or wire spoked wheels. <b>Chromium-plated</b> Rostyle wheels were made for Jensen, Rover and, famously, the Ford Cortina 1600E, originally designed for Ford Chairman Len Crossland's wife.|$|E
50|$|The {{manifold}} {{is usually}} machined {{from a high}} grade brass alloy, and <b>chromium-plated</b> for corrosion resistance and appearance. Brass is used because it is acceptably corrosion resistant, easy to machine, and suitable for oxygen service. The isolation valve uses similar materials, when present. Manifold lengths are available to connect different cylinder diameters.|$|E
50|$|The {{academic}} {{badge of}} the university was designed in 1914 as a silver (or <b>chromium-plated</b> brass) badge depicting Phra Kiao on a round pillow, which is the personal emblem for Chulalongkorn and the university's emblem. The Thai acronym for the faculty is inscribed beneath the pillow. Regardless of degree level, {{there is only one}} style for a particular faculty.|$|E
5000|$|British {{cartridges}} included [...] "Ball", [...] "Armour-Piercing", [...] "Tracer", and [...] "Incendiary". Blanks and a Drill round {{were also}} available for instruction purposes. The Drill round was an aluminium bullet fixed in a <b>chromium-plated</b> case which had three deep lengthwise recesses painted red to identify it. Ammunition was supplied in belted form with 225 rounds per belt.|$|E
50|$|Power {{came from}} a more {{powerful}} version of the previous model's 2.1 L (2103 cc/128 in³) Rover IOE straight-6 engine now with <b>chromium-plated</b> cylinder bores, an aluminium cylinder head with built-in induction manifold {{and a pair of}} horizontal instead of downdraught carburetters. A four-speed manual transmission was used with a column-mounted gear lever which was replaced by a floor-mounted mechanism in September 1953.|$|E
5000|$|For 1933 {{detailed}} refinements {{were made}} to provide more comfort and better appearance, [...] "the bodies are more imposing and the cars look lower". Bonnet flutes, lamps and bumpers were <b>chromium-plated.</b> The saloon's rear seats were deeper and finer quality leather upholstery provided. An eddy-free roof front, anti-glare sloping windscreen and anti-dazzle dipping headlamps were fitted, and dual electric screenwipers replaced the single vacuum instrument.|$|E
5000|$|In 1928 she {{designed}} three chairs from Corbusier's {{principles that}} {{the chair was}} a [...] "machine for siting," [...] and {{that each of the}} three would accommodate different positions for different tasks. At Corbuiser's request a chair was made for conversation: the B301 sling back chair, another for relaxation: the LC2 Grand Comfort chair, and the last for sleeping: the B306 chaise longue. Each chair had a <b>chromium-plated</b> tubular steel base.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the latest}} {{variants}} is BI-7-4 rifle, version 9, produced under {{the order of the}} Russian Biathlon Union. It differs significantly from the serial BI-7-4. The rifle has a new stock, which can be almost fully adjusted to a specific sportsman. Apart from that, it has an Anschutz diopter sight and an adjustable ring sight. The barrel and the receiver are <b>chromium-plated,</b> which increases its service life by significantly enhancing the rust protection.|$|E
50|$|The four-door saloon {{body was}} made {{in-house}} by Morris {{and had the}} traditional MG grille flanked by two large <b>chromium-plated</b> headlights. Unlike the SA the front doors did not have separate quarter light windows. The spare wheel was carried on the left front wing, with a second spare {{on the other side}} as an option. Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat at the rear, all with leather covering. A fitted radio was an option.|$|E
5000|$|Liberace's fame in the United States was matched {{for a time}} in the United Kingdom. In 1956, {{an article}} in the Daily Mirror by {{columnist}} Cassandra (William Connor) described Liberace as [...] "…the summit of sex—the pinnacle of masculine, feminine, and neuter.

50|$|The {{built-up}} gun {{is constructed}} of liner, tube, jacket, three hoops, two locking rings, tube and liner locking ring, yoke ring and screw box liner. Some components were autofretted. Typical of United States naval weapons {{built in the}} 1940s, the bore was <b>chromium-plated</b> for longer barrel life. It uses a Welin breech block that opens downwards and is hydraulically operated. The screw box liner and breech plug are segmented with stepped screw threads arranged in fifteen sectors of 24 degrees each.|$|E
5000|$|There was a 12-volt {{electrical}} system for lighting and starting. Timing {{was at the}} back of the engine. From there on the off-side were driven in-line the generator, water-pump and magneto. Reported refinements for the 1929 Motor Show included: <b>chromium-plated</b> exterior fittings, Triplex glass, improved (dome type) [...] "mud wings (front mudguards) and new gas (sic) and ignition control levers [...] "neatly placed above the steering wheel". For 1930 the specification included Biflex magnetic dip and switch headlights and wire wheels.|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and king pins were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased <b>chromium-plated</b> brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|E
50|$|The barrel is {{air-cooled}} and massively dense, {{contributing to}} a fairly high overall weight. The bore is <b>chromium-plated</b> and able to withstand continuous fire for long periods. The barrel can also be easily changed by releasing a simple lock, and the carrying handle allows a hot barrel to be lifted clear without difficulty. The World War II version of the gun had a smooth outline to the barrel, and the cocking handle was under the receiver, with no dust covers to the feed and ejection ports.|$|E
