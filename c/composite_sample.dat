[...] Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples. That sequence {{was derived from the}} DNA of several volunteers from a diverse population. [...] However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort {{the decision was made to}} switch from sequencing a <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. [...] Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. [...] Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome. [...] In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. [...] Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released, including those of Desmond Tutu, and of a Paleo-Eskimo. In November 2013, a Spanish family made their personal genomics data publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The work was led by Manuel Corpas and the data obtained by direct-to-consumer genetic testing with 23andMe and the Beijing Genomics Institute).

5000|$|Machairodus {{was first}} named in 1832, by German Naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. Though its remains were known since 1824, it was {{believed}} by Georges Cuvier that the fossils {{had come from a}} species of bear, which he called [...] "Ursus cultridens" [...] (known today as Megantereon) based on <b>composite</b> <b>sample</b> of teeth from different countries, species and geologic ages, leading to what would become a long series of complications. Kaup however, recognized the teeth as those of felids and promptly reclassified the existing specimens as Machairodus, including M. cultridens in it. The name quickly gained acceptance {{and by the end of}} the 19th Century, many species of felid or related feliform (such as nimravids) were lumped into the genus Machairodus, including but not limited to Sansanosmilus, Megantereon, Paramachairodus, Amphimachairodus, Nimravides, and Homotherium among others. This would eventually turn Machairodus into something of a wastebasket taxon, which would be rectified with the discoveries of more complete skeletons of other machairodonts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractComposite milk samples, {{in which}} milk from all 4 bovine {{quarters}} is {{collected in a}} single vial, are widely used in many developed dairy industries for detection of intramammary infections (IMI).

The dilution effect may be problematic, however, resulting in lower sensitivity (Se) in IMI detection on <b>composite</b> <b>samples.</b> Relative Se and specificity (Sp) in <b>composite</b> <b>samples</b> have previously been described for some major pathogens, but because the causative organism for IMI is initially unknown, it is beneficial to investigate the reliability of <b>composite</b> <b>samples</b> for detection {{of all types of}} mastitis-causing bacteria. The Canadian Bovine Mastitis Research Network has a large data collection platform—the National Cohort of Dairy Farms—containing a vast amount of data on mastitis in Canada. These data have been used to further investigate the Se and Sp of <b>composite</b> <b>samples</b> in detecting IMI caused by specific mastitis pathogens. Milk samplings of selected cows before dry-off, after calving, and during lactation (n= 48, 835 samples) were employed to this end. <b>Composite</b> <b>samples</b> showed moderately high Se for Staphylococcus aureus (77. 1 %, 95 % CI= 73. 3 – 80. 5) and Streptococcus dysgalactiae (73. 4 %, 95 % CI= 60. 9 – 83. 7), with moderate Se for Streptococcus uberis (62. 1 %, 95 % CI= 49. 3 – 73. 8) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (59. 8 %, 95 % CI= 58. 4 – 61. 2).

50|$|Capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) and microcapillary {{gel electrophoresis}} (μCGE) are well-recognized microchip electrophoresis (MCE) methods {{that can provide}} numerous analytical advantages including high resolution, high sensitivity, and effective coupling to mass spectrometry (MS). Microchip electrophoresis can be applied generally as a method for high-throughput screening processes that help discover and evaluate drugs. Using MCE, specifically CE, microcapillary gel electrophoresis (μCGE) devices are created to perform high-number DNA sample processing, {{which makes it a}} good candidate for DNA analysis. μCGE devices are also practical for separation purposes because they use online separation, characterization, encapsulation, and selection of diﬀering analytes originating from a <b>composite</b> <b>sample.</b> All of these advantages of MCE methods translate to microfluidic devices. The reason MCE methods are coupled to droplet-based microfluidic devices is because of the ability to analyze samples on the nanoliter scale. Using MCE methods on a small scale reduces cost and reagent use. Similarly to HPLC, fluorescence based detection techniques are used for capillary electrophoresis, which make these methods practical and can be applied to fields such as biotechnology, analytical chemistry, and drug development. These MCE and other electrophoresis based methods began to develop once capillary electrophoresis gained popularity in the 1980s and gained even more attention in the early 1990s, as it was reviewed nearly 80 times by the year 1992.|$|E
