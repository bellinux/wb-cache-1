5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied aid credit, even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied aid credits are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a <b>concessionality</b> level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the <b>concessionality</b> level, the more the tied aid credit looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|E

It includes both outright grants and loans, {{as long as the}} loans are on significantly easier terms than the commercial norm: the DAC calls these [...] "concessional" [...] loans. The change to the definition of ODA in 1972 involved tightening the definition of [...] "concessionality". The DAC defines <b>concessionality</b> according to a mathematically computed [...] "grant element"; loans with a grant element of at least 25 percent are considered concessional and count as ODA. This criterion has not been changed since 1972.|$|E
50|$|The CEFC applies a {{commercial}} approach when making investment decisions {{and seeks to}} develop a portfolio across the spectrum of clean energy technologies that in aggregate must have an acceptable but not excessive level of risk relative to the sector. The Corporation applies {{a commercial}} filter when making its investment decisions, focussing on projects and technologies at the later stages of development. The filter is not as stringent as the private sector equivalent, as the Corporation has a public policy purpose and values any positive externalities being generated. Consequently, it has different risk/return requirements. For a given return, the Corporation may take on higher risk and, for a given level of risk, due to positive externalities, may accept a lower financial return. In line with its policy intent, the Corporation considers the positive externalities and public policy outcomes when making investment decisions and when determining the extent of any <b>concessionality</b> for an investment.|$|E

Since the nineties, LICs have been granted debt relief by bilateral creditors andby international financing institutions, namely from 1996 on underHighly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and from 2005 onunder Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Did those debt relief initiatives send a negative message to the lenders, deterring themto lend to the LICs? For assessing this we use the <b>concessionality</b> rate of new financing flows as a measurement of the “distance to the market” and assess the impact of debt relief on the <b>concessionality</b> rate implementing a Granger causality tests using panel data, a methodology perfected by Hurlin (2004, 2005) and Hurlin and Venet (2004).

We investigate the potential implications on the country-allocation of loan commitments and the degree of <b>concessionality</b> using a panel vector autoregression model and single equation dynamic panel estimation. We find that BRICs lend more to LICs with weaker institutions. Land-locked, resource-scarce LICs receive significantly less financing than other resource-rich LICs. The degree of <b>concessionality</b> is negatively correlated with the amount of loans and positively correlated with better institutional indicators suggesting that the higher the risks, the higher the required returns that BRICs expect.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} a {{wide range}} of issues relating to the mix between loans and grants as well as the degree of <b>concessionality</b> of loans. A number of empirical tests are carried out based on annual panel data over 1970 to 1999 for 22 donor countries and 72 recipient countries. Based on the tests, we are able to identify a number of economic and political factors that have influenced donors 2 ̆ 019 past decisions on the grant-loan mix. We also observe that for bilateral donors, past grant-loan mix (and, hence, reflows from past transfers) do not influence the volume of current resource transfers. In addition, we find that loans are better suited than grants in promoting recipient governments budgetary discipline, as is commonly understood in fiscal reform literature. Our tests also show that the rate of official borrowing by the recipients (and, by deduction, the extent of their past debt burden) is positively influenced by the extent of the <b>concessionality</b> of such loans 2 ̆ 014 irrespective of whether it is in the form of subsidized interest rates or longer grace periods. The paper concludes with a review of the circumstances in which grants, soft loans and non-concessional loans might have their respective comparative advantage, as well as a discussion of the need, so as to overcome the negative incentive problems of soft loans, for a typical concessional loan package to be separated into two constituent parts. This would enable the recipient to be given the grant component and the option to take from the non-concessional loan component as much as desired. 2 ̆ 013 aid; ODA; grants; official loans; soft loans; grant element; grace period; bilateral aid; multilateral ai...|$|E
40|$|A {{debate has}} emerged over the optimal {{delivery}} of {{official development assistance}} (ODA) to developing countries: through grants or through concessional loans. While some countries such as Japan provide aid through loans, other countries tend to rely on grants. An endogenous growth model is considered, in which public spending is financed through aid and the donor community can influence a recipient country's growth path by choosing a combination of grants and loans. Empirically, {{it is found that}} an increase in the <b>concessionality</b> attached to ODA loans can facilitate recipient countries' economic development.

40|$|Scott 1 The {{definition}} of Official Development Assistance (ODA) has for 40 years been the global standard for measuring donor efforts in supporting development co-operation objectives. It {{has provided the}} yardstick for documenting the volume and {{the terms of the}} concessional resources provided, assessing donor performance against their aid pledges and enabling partner countries, civil society and others to hold donors to account. Yet for all its value, the ODA definition has always reflected a compromise between political expediency and statistical reality. It is based on interpretation and consensus and therefore allows for flexibility. It has evolved over the decades, while preserving the original concepts of a definition based on principal developmental motivation, official character and a degree of <b>concessionality.</b> While agreement on the ODA concept was a major achievement, discussion of the appropriateness of this measure has never ended.

40|$|The {{method used}} by Development Assistance Committee {{countries}} {{for measuring the}} <b>concessionality</b> of aid loans has remained unchanged for nearly 20 years. It was designed to measure the net cost of aid to donors not the net benefit to recipients. The discount rate used takes no account {{of changes in the}} value of the currency of the loan or of changes in prices for goods traded by recipient countries. Furthermore, it does not consider the implications of tying of aid or of policy conditionality. This paper suggests an alternative measure that shows the real net benefit of aid finance to recipients. It argues that the discount rate used by the Development Assistance Committee is too high and that changes {{in the value of the}} currency in which a loan is taken out can be important. Nevertheless, real rates of interest for developing countries remain surprisingly high despite low nominal rates due to falling prices of traded goods. This finding has implications for the future real cost of debt service to recipients. ...|$|E
40|$|Official flows {{account for}} close to half of capital flows to {{developing}} countries, and close to 90 per cent of receipts for Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper documents trends in these official flows {{over the last three}} decades. The most striking trend has been declining aid volume. Following two decades of relative stability, official flows have decline in the 1990 s; in particular aid to just 0. 2 per cent of donor GNP. A second trend is the decline in aid to low-income countries, partly as aid flows are diverted to transition economies and ‘trouble spots’. As a result of these trends, real aid per capita to Sub-Saharan Africa fell by 40 per cent in the 1990 s. Continuing an existing trend, multilateral agencies have accounted for a growing share of total aid, in part {{as a result of the}} expansion of EU aid, but non-EU donors have contributed more of their aid through the UN system. Positive developments have been the increased <b>concessionality</b> of aid and a move toward untying. However, substantial parts of the multilateral system, notably the World Bank, continue to extend loans rather than grants. And the move to untying is not well-established, having been somewhat reversed in some countries in recent years. Finally, the aid programme of most donors is thinly spread over many recipients. Whilst there are good grounds to question the current fashion for selectivity, there remain good developmental arguments for greater concentration by individual donors. ...|$|E
40|$|Debate {{about the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years, as budgetary pressures on aid have increased in donor countries. Whatever the merits of opposing arguments, the question is: do conventional measures of aid (such as OECD's Net ODA), which lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows? The authors analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional measures of aid and propose a new approach, which measures official aid flows as the sum of grants and the grant-equivalents of official loans (in a new aggregate they call"Effective Development Assistance,"or EDA). They show how results using this conceptually superior measure may differ significantly from conventional aggregates, providing a quite different view on major aid trends. They implement their approach empirically using data on some 40, 000 official loans from the World Bank's DRS database [...] virtually all of the official loans to 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. The numerical results underscore several points: 1) The conventional approach has led to systematic overestimates of the <b>concessionality</b> of official loans. This overestimate has increased significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Conventional methods show a rising trend; the new method shows the opposite. 2) Net ODA increasingly overstates the true aid content of official flows, although the divergence between the two approaches is somewhat muted by the rising relative importance of grants over loans in total official flows.

This is done with a comparative view in relation to western donors and with the aim to develop recommendations as to how Arab development finance can be strengthened and rendered more effective for the new millennium. In the 1960 s and 1970 s Arab donors established a variety of national and multilateral agencies. These agencies share many characteristics of their western counterparts, but some also exhibit distinctive features. Both in terms of absolute volume as well as generosity measured by aid as a percentage of GDP, Arab countries have been important donors in the past, even though recent years have seen a significant fall in Arab aid. Reversing this downfall in aid, targeting its aid better towards the poor and very poor recipient countries and raising the grant share and the <b>concessionality</b> of loans for these countries together with a reallocation of aid towards the social sectors of human development would render Arab aid-giving more effective in terms of poverty alleviation and more in line with western aid. A greater willingness to participate in the ongoing discussions amongst western donors about the proper objectives and design of development finance would help Arab donorsto achieve the recognition they truly deserve. Closer cooperation with western donors would be a logical consequence of taking such a step.

40|$|With the Millennium Development Goals {{deadline}} {{only five}} years away, the international donor community faces significant challenges due to the global economic crisis, record government deficits, and simultaneous funding requests from nearly every multilateral development institution. This paper proposes a new World Bank financing model for creditworthy emerging economies, such as India and Vietnam, which currently receive {{billions of dollars in}} IDA assistance. In contrast to the current IDA-centric financing model, the IBRD would provide the same loan volumes to qualifying emerging economies while IDA would provide grant subsidies to buy down the <b>concessionality</b> level of these IBRD loans. As such, these countries would be held harmless both in terms of aid volumes and lending terms. By better leveraging the IBRD’s balance sheet for loan capital, IDA then could re-allocate what it otherwise would have provided to emerging economies. For the current IDA- 15 replenishment period, this would mean up to $ 7. 5 billion in additional assistance for the world’s poorest, most vulnerable countries. In relative terms, this would entail a 30 percent increase over existing levels. Of this, African countries would have received an additional $ 5. 5 billion in IDA assistance. If donor governments find a way to scrape together increased contributions to IDA, then the allocation pie would grow by an even larger margin. The Inter-American Development Bank already successfully utilizes a similar approach for its lower middle-income and low-income country clients. It is time for World Bank shareholders to seriously consider the same resource-maximizing model. With the IDA- 16 replenishment and IBRD general capital increase negotiations currently underway, they have an excellent window of opportunity to implement this win-win-win approach.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} economic rationale {{and efficiency}} effects of proposals directed at alleviating debt problems of poor countries. Key {{to the investigation}} is determination of whether proposed mechanisms tackle fundamental causes of the debt crisis. The paper finds that despite the enthusiasm for debt relief, the major proposals have not tackled issues central to debt problems of poor countries. The Baker plan and Schumer Watkins plan targeted wealthier debtors in Latin America who threatened integrity of the international banking system, while the Bradley Plan failed to identify {{who was going to}} bear the cost of the debt write relief. Proposals of the Brandt report calling for global correction of imbalances in the international economic system [also echoed in Mitterand and Lawson proposals] addressed resource needs of poor countries, but simply failed to get international consensus. Lopsided commercial debt concerns of the Brady Plan have also eluded poor economies the bulk of whose debt is multilateral. By rescheduling small amounts of debt at market interest rates during 1980 ’s high inflation, Paris Club relief under "Toronto Terms" and “ London terms” also failed to ameliorate poor country debt. “Naples Terms” innovatively offered deeper relief, but most poor countries were ineligible {{as a result of a}} large part of the debts of being multilateral. By providing funds to buy commercial debt, the IDA Debt Reduction Facility of the World Bank similarly eluded poor states. However, by increasing multilateral financing under SAF, ESAF at a faster pace the IMF has substituted the drop in bilateral assistance, and also facilitated debt stock restructuring. By disbursing IDA credits and resources of the Fifth dimension program the World Bank has also strengthened the move towards greater <b>concessionality.</b> However, preponderance of exogenous factors that constrained export performance, lack of sustained economic reform, and factors constraining the ability of poor economies to realise their full potential, multilateral debt service demands are rising in relation to exports. Poor countries always have the ‘willingness to pay’ but the fact that a large share of new multilateral disbursements is merely being recycled into multilateral debt service while demands of the development program are not met in full is affecting their ‘ability to pay’. The challenge facing the bilateral amd international financial community is to extricate poor countries from the multilateral debt trap. debt relief, paris club, debt rescheduling, debt cancellation, ESAF, SAF, IDA, aid...|$|E
