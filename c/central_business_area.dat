25|$|In the 20th century, many {{suburban}} areas, {{especially those}} {{not within the}} political boundaries of the city containing the <b>central</b> <b>business</b> <b>area,</b> began to see independence from the central city as an asset.

Federal subsidies for suburban development accelerated this process as did the practice of redlining by banks and other lending institutions.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates spatio-temporal {{patterns of}} police calls-for-service in the Region of Waterloo, Canada, at a fine {{spatial and temporal}} resolution. Modeling was implemented via Bayesian Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Temporal patterns for two-hour time periods, spatial patterns at the small-area scale, and space-time interaction (i. e., unusual departures from overall spatial and temporal patterns) were estimated. Temporally, calls-for-service {{were found to be}} lowest in the early morning (02 : 00 – 03 : 59) and highest in the evening (20 : 00 – 21 : 59), while high levels of calls-for-service were spatially located in <b>central</b> <b>business</b> <b>areas</b> and in areas characterized by major roadways, universities, and shopping centres. Space-time interaction was observed to be geographically dispersed during daytime hours but concentrated in <b>central</b> <b>business</b> <b>areas</b> during evening hours. Interpreted through the routine activity theory, results are discussed with respect to law enforcement resource demand and allocation, and the advantages of modeling spatio-temporal datasets with Bayesian INLA methods are highlighted...|$|R
