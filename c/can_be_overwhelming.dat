[...] She called the character [...] "a great representation of what [...] deals with daily. Our responsibilities <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming</b> and things often don't go as you planned, {{so you have to}} roll with it. Susan celebrates rolling with it". She is a hopeless romantic and often expresses her more openly and vulnerably than the other characters in the series. The series begins a year after Susan's first divorce, when she is still emotionally raw. Throughout the series, several other characters have confronted Susan about her inability to live happily and without drama. Susan has a close relationship with her daughter, Julie (Andrea Bowen), who often acts as the parent figure in the relationship.|$|E

Sometimes it's overwhelming. Why did God give me my talent, my gift, my family. But I know you're not supposed to question God." [...] She told Entertainment Tonight: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} a little different with the film ... I wanted people to re-experience the show in a different way. Everyone that had been to the show -- I wanted them to see things that they didn't get to see. I figured it would be cool for everyone to see it from my point of view. It's a peek behind the curtain ... honestly, more than no makeup, the emotions and just being so real and raw, I don't think I'd be able to let down my guard the way I did if anybody was in the room." [...] The last minutes of the film get very sentimental, with a performance of Etta James's classic [...] "At Last" [...] set to the backdrop of Civil Rights-era footage, followed by a close-up moment when Beyoncé admits that her life <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>overwhelming,</b> although she is blessed, stating, [...] "I'm grateful... I'm alive and I'm living my dreams." [...] The film's final performance shows Beyoncé performing [...] "Halo" [...] and sees her paying tribute to Michael Jackson. She also splices in footage of an old video from the night she attended her first Michael Jackson concert as a child. At the end of the performance, the whole production wraps as Beyoncé throws up the Roc sign and exits the stage.|$|E

In a starred review, Publishers Weekly observed that Tatsumi tackles difficult subjects, but instead of exploiting, he humanizes his characters. It also called his art masterful in how he varies his style and depicts [...] "graceful motion, grisly suffering and complicated emotion." [...] Gordon Flagg of Booklist noted that the stories in the manga are more political than usual for Tatsumi in their portrayal of postwar Japan, saying of the manga: [...] "Tatsumi's mastery of the visual simplicity of classic manga gives a stark power to these devastating, uncompromising pieces." [...] Richard Rayner of the Los Angeles Times described the stories as [...] "remarkable, amazing" [...] saying that their style is [...] "spare, elliptical and it's sometimes necessary to read two or three times to appreciate the full nightmarish power." [...] Andrew Wheeler of ComicMix preferred the stories translated in Abandon the Old in Tokyo, but still found the stories [...] "Hell" [...] and the titular title to be comparable, calling the manga [...] "a stunning achievement, a collection of dark, realistic stories from a side of the world we rarely see." [...] Calling the manga bleak, Tom Baker of The Daily Yomiuri said that [...] "there's no point in reading such depressing stuff unless it is done very well. And Tatsumi does it excellently." ...|$|E

If the sand accretion is not too fast, the stolons can grow vertically through it, but the seagrass <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>overwhelmed</b> by rapid accretion. Patch death was mostly caused by erosion as roots were uncovered, encrusting and drilling organisms increased and plants were swept away. The dune movement cycle tended to take two to six years, which gives the seagrass time to recolonise bare areas. Sand accretion also stimulates flowering and dormant seeds can enable recolonisation when conditions allow it.|$|R
