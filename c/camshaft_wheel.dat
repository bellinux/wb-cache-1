40|$|A {{method to}} {{identify}} the natural frequency of a timing belt is developed. The method is simple and based on applying a lateral load at a suitable (middle) point between the <b>camshaft</b> <b>wheel</b> and the crankshaft wheel. The tension measurements together with the belt density and length provide necessary information in order {{to identify the}} natural frequency. The analytical method is also validated by experimental measurements of natural frequency. Results were found to be in a good agreement...|$|E
5000|$|The Audi R8 was {{initially}} {{equipped with a}} 4.2 litre V8 engine. Specifically, it is an all-aluminium alloy 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) petrol engine, utilising Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and has a displacement of [...] It develops a motive power output of [...] (Directive 80/1269/EEC), and generates 430 Nm of torque, on 98 RON 'Super Unleaded' petrol. It is basically the same engine used in the Audi B7 RS4, but is modified to use a dry sump lubrication system. It uses two chain-driven double overhead camshafts (DOHC) per cylinder bank, and utilises variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust <b>camshafts.</b> The 4 <b>wheel</b> drive system is biased towards the rear; it sends 30% of its power to the front wheels and 70% to the rear.|$|R
500|$|... "Cog" [...] {{opens with}} a {{close-up}} on a transmission bearing rolling down a board into a synchro hub. The hub in turn rolls into a gear wheel cog, which falls off the board and into a <b>camshaft</b> and pulley <b>wheel.</b> The camera tracks slowly from left to right, following the domino chain of reactions across an otherwise empty gallery space. The complexity of the interactions increases as the commercial progresses, growing from simple collisions to ziplines made from a bonnet release cable, scales and see-saws constructed from multiple carefully balanced parts, and a swinging mobile of suspended glass windows. Later sequences begin {{to make use of}} the Accord's electronic systems; the automated water sensors attached to the windscreen are used to make wiper blades start crawling across the floor, and a side door with a door-mirror indicator lowers the automated window to let a part pass through.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} dependence of valve train sound quality on certain camshaft machining parameters. In particular, a sound quality issue referred to as camshaft chatter was investigated. Camshaft chatter refers to a noise caused by geometrical undulations on the camshaft lobes that excite valve train and cylinder head vibration modes during operation. The undulations are an artifact of the manufacturing process. The engine {{used in the study}} was a dual overhead camshaft (DOHC) V 6. Eight different left-hand-side exhaust camshafts were manufactured with different, known combinations of the selected machining parameters. Each parameter was varied between a 2 ̆ 2 high 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 low 2 ̆ 2 setting. Tri-axial accelerometers were mounted at two locations on the cylinder head of the test engine, and extensive vibration data was collected for each camshaft. The vibration data was analyzed using a number of methods, including: time domain analysis, RMS analysis, angle domain variance analysis, and RPM-frequency analysis. After a method was developed to objectively quantify the severity of camshaft chatter, a main effects analysis was performed {{to assess the impact of}} the individual machining inputs. It was found that vibration of the <b>camshaft</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> had the largest impact on camshaft chatter, followed by vibration of the grinding wheel motor. Tension of the drive belt was also shown to impact the severity of the chatter phenomenon. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.
