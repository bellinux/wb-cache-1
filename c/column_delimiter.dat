The line break code {{in the file}} is {{different}} for each of platform; LF (line feed or new line, ASCII hex code 0 x 0 a) in UNIX, Linux, Mac OS X, and other derivatives and CR[*]+[*]LF (carriage return[*]+[*]line feed, 0 x 0 d[*]+[*] 0 x 0 a) in Microsoft Windows. The treatment and display of non-ASCII characters are not standardized, so the output displayed depends on the program used; the use of other non-printing ASCII characters is therefore not recommended. The first line of the file indicates the plot title. In each line (record) below the title, the <b>column</b> <b>delimiter</b> should be either a space (0 x 20) or tab (0 x 09) character.|$|E

The design {{is based on the}} utilisation of common reference and counter electrodes to reduce the complexity of the electrode arrangement Control of the purpose built instrumentation was effected with a 486 - 33 personal computer and Analog Devices RTI- 815 and RTI- 817 data acquisition/control cards, which are responsible for hardware control functions and data acquisition via digital and analogue control lmes. Software for instrumentation control, data display (2 - or 3 -dimensional formats), on-line and post-run data processmg and storage has been developed usmg the QuickBASIC software environment. The user interface utilises a Wmdows style display to achieve user friendliness with an on-lme help facility Data is stored in a spreadsheet compatible format (ASCII with <b>column</b> <b>delimiter)</b> to facilitate post-run processmg with standard applications packages such as Microsoft EXCEL The system has been applied to the determination of well characterised electroactive compounds usmg flow-mjection analysis Linearity over the range 10 " 2 - lO 2 ̆ 7 ^M has been obtamed with a detection limit of 2 x 102 ̆ 77 m (S/N = 3 0) for potassium femcyamde The array has been applied to the simultaneous measurement o f both oxidation and reduction currents of femcyamde and hydroqumone...|$|E

50|$|Any {{character}} {{may be used}} {{to separate}} the values, but the most common delimiters are the comma, tab, and colon. The vertical bar (also referred to as pipe) and space are also sometimes used. In a comma-separated values (CSV) file the data items are separated using commas as a delimiter, while in a tab-separated values (TSV) file, the data items are separated using tabs as a <b>delimiter.</b> <b>Column</b> headers are sometimes included as the first line, and each subsequent line is a row of data. The lines are separated by newlines.|$|R
