5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect <b>crop</b> <b>productivity</b> in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} {{for most of}} the renewable freshwater resource withdrawals in Malawi, yet food insecurity and water scarcity remain as major challenges. Despite Malawi’s vast water resources, climate change, coupled with increasing population and urbanisation are contributing to increasing water scarcity. Improving <b>crop</b> water <b>productivity</b> has been identified as a possible solution to water and food insecurity, by producing more food with less water, that is, to produce “more crop per drop”. This study evaluated <b>crop</b> water <b>productivity</b> from 2000 to 2013 by assessing crop evapotranspiration, crop production and agricultural gross domestic product (Ag GDP) contribution for Malawi. Improvements in <b>crop</b> water <b>productivity</b> were evidenced through improved <b>crop</b> production and <b>productivity.</b> These improvements were supported by increased irrigated area, along with improved agronomic practices. <b>Crop</b> water <b>productivity</b> increased by 33 % overall from 2000 to 2013, resulting in an increase in maize production from 1. 2 million metric tons to 3. 6 million metric tons, translating to an average food surplus of 1. 1 million metric tons.

We conduct an empirical analysis of the agricultural impacts associated with major dams in Idaho, focusing on their <b>crop</b> mixes, <b>crop</b> <b>productivities,</b> and overall agricultural land values using an integrated county-level repeated cross section dataset. Our {{results suggest that the}} presence of a dam resulted in significant increases in total crop acreage, particularly in those counties in which farmers have predominantly junior water rights. Dams led to an increase in the acreage of the higher-valued, more water-intensive crops and positively impacted some <b>crop</b> <b>productivities,</b> particularly during periods of severe droughts. In contrast to the traditional literature, we find that the presence of a dam had a small, positive, but non-significant effect on farmland values. Finally, we evaluate long-term patterns in stream flow change and examine the impacts of dams on the natural environment. We find that the presence of dams enabled the spatiotemporal transfer of water resources from cold (non-agricultural) to warm (agriculturally-intensive) seasons, reduced the potential availability of water resources for ecosystem use, and increased the seasonal volatility in water supplies...|$|R
