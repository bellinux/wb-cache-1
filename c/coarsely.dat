5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of {{subgenus}} Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This grouping comprises species that have, in maturity, <b>coarsely</b> reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this subgenus include G.fastigiata and the central European species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore reticulation was sufficiently unique to be worthy of designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E
5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more <b>coarsely</b> ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, but unlike the latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|The nervous shark has {{a rather}} stout, {{spindle-shaped}} {{body and a}} short, broadly rounded snout. The anterior margin of each nostril is extended into a slender nipple-shaped lobe. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval in shape and equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth lacks conspicuous furrows at the corners and contains 25–30 upper and 23–28 lower tooth rows. The upper teeth are narrow and angled, with <b>coarsely</b> serrated edges. The lower teeth are more slender and upright in shape, and have finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are medium in length.|$|E
5|$|Earl Thomas {{granted the}} manor to his steward, Robert de Holland, in February 1308. In 1311, Robert {{obtained}} a licence to crenellate from Edward II {{in order to}} fortify the manor house, and the more modest earlier building was converted into a castle between 1311 and 1322. Local tradition says that the stone was obtained from a quarry {{on the site of}} what is now Melbourne Pool. The records show £1,313 was spent on the project in the year 1313–14, of which £548 was paid to masons for dressing stone. Several masons working on the project were involved in an affray at Ravenstone in 1315. The important medieval buildings in Melbourne were constructed from the local bedrock, Millstone Grit. This is a <b>coarsely</b> grained sandstone which can be worked to produce good-quality ashlar. The village was centred around the church, castle and High Street until the late eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a <b>coarsely</b> warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} oval, white and <b>coarsely</b> textured. All species {{normally}} lay {{at least two}} eggs; the usual clutch size is one to three, rarely up to six. Both sexes incubate with the eggs on top of or below the feet; they may display when changing shifts. Incubation takes 30–36 days; hatching success for undisturbed pairs can {{be as high as}} 95 percent but, because of sibling competition or siblicide, in the wild usually all but one nestling dies within the first few weeks (later in the pink-backed and spot-billed species). Both parents feed their young. Small chicks are fed by regurgitation; after about a week they are able to put their heads into their parent’s pouch and feed themselves. Sometimes before, or especially after, being fed, they may seem to have a seizure that ends in falling unconscious; the reason is not clearly known.|$|E
5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a <b>coarsely</b> granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there has}} been {{uncertainty}} {{as to whether the}} European species known as Battarrea stevenii is a unique species or merely a polymorphic variant of B.phalloides. The taxon has been described as both a variety (as B.phalloides var. stevenii by Cleland and Cheel in 1916) and as a form (as B.phalloides f. stevenii by Calonge in 2004). In 1995, mycologist Roy Watling opined that B.stevenii differs in having spores that are colored more orange-tawny, slightly larger (5–6.5 by 5.75–7µm, as opposed to 4.5–5.25 by 4.5–5.75µm), and less ornamented. Further, B.stevenii is thought to have a larger fruit body size, a more <b>coarsely</b> scaly stipe, and lack of mucilage in the volva and the innermost parts of the stem. The presence or absence of mucilage has been traditionally considered the significant characteristic separating the species. In 1904, Lászlo Hollós proposed the idea of a single polymorphic species; in 1942, Paul Marshall Rea, after studying 25 specimens from southern California, concluded that B.stevenii was conspecific with B.phalloides and represented a single species. An analysis of a number of European specimens—using both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in addition to molecular analysis of ITS regions of the 5.8S rDNA—also suggested both to be conspecific. The authors of this study considered the differences in spore ornamentation and stipe hyphae to be insufficient to discriminate them as two species; they did, however, note that their inability to locate the type material for both species limited the conclusiveness of their suggestion. The conspecificity of the species was supported in a later study that used traditional and molecular methods to compare field-collected English specimens and an extensive range of herbarium material collected from around the world. They found that material labeled B.stevenii generally had a greater range of cap and stem sizes, while that labeled B.phalloides was generally more consistent, and smaller. However, the B.phalloides material they studied was generally from similar habitats in the UK, while the B.stevenii material originated {{from a wide variety of}} locales and habitats, suggesting that environmental factors influence fruit body morphology. Evidence pointing to conspecificity included the continuum of spore sizes between the two, and the lack of any significant differences between their DNA. In 2006, however, based on a study of specimens collected in China, other scientists considered them to be independent species.|$|E

25|$|No terra {{material}} {{similar to}} that in the Kuiper quadrangle (De Hon and others, 1981) was recognized in the Beethoven quadrangle. Its absence may be due, in part, to fewer clusters of large young craters whose coalesced ejecta blankets could have yielded the <b>coarsely</b> textured, rough surfaces that characterize the unit in the Kuiper area. Also, the visible effect of roughness is diminished by the higher sun angle at which the Beethoven images were acquired.|$|E
25|$|Paris green (copper(II) acetate triarsenite or copper(II) acetoarsenite) is an {{inorganic}} compound.

It is also used as a blue colorant for fireworks. The color of Paris green is said to range from a pale blue green when very finely ground, to a deeper green when <b>coarsely</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|The hummocky {{deposits}} on Augustine's lower flanks resemble both topographically and lithologically {{those of}} the great landslide or debris avalanche that initiated the spectacular May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The deposit of that landslide revealed the origin of coarse diamicts with hummocky topography at other strato volcanic cones. Since 1980 many hummocky <b>coarsely</b> fragmental deposits on Augustine's lower flanks {{have come to be}} interpreted as deposits of numerous great landslides and debris avalanches.|$|E
25|$|Northwest of Pail Dome lies a {{parasitic}} subglacial volcano called Cauldron Dome {{which also}} formed and last erupted during the Pleistocene period.

However, any precise record of volcanic glass or fine-scale jointing has probably been worn away by erosion. Two compositionally identical lava flows spread to the southwest {{from the base of the}} volcano. It is likely that Cauldron Dome was formed subglacially and the associated lava flows were erupted within a meltwater conduit.|$|E
25|$|Ecclesiastical {{patronage}} in Rome {{dried up}} with {{the removal of the}} Papacy to Avignon in 1305, {{and by the time the}} curial court had returned and the ensuing schism had been settled a hundred years later, the craft tradition had lapsed. The differential resistance of the stones used in Cosmati work, marbles, porphyry and other colored stones has resulted in uneven wear on pavements, which have been periodically repaired, whether finely or <b>coarsely,</b> since the late Middle Ages, with the result that modern assessments of the quality of individual works may be compromised by overlooking later repairs.|$|E
25|$|The oldest known {{surviving}} {{example of}} the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been <b>coarsely</b> overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed {{to be a very}} high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|The {{revival of}} natural dyeing {{has had a}} major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in Shiraz during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi, {{particularly}} Gabbeh rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, <b>coarsely</b> knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from Fars province soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.|$|E
25|$|In Monte Carlo, {{an initial}} {{configuration}} is refined by taking random steps which are accepted or rejected {{based on their}} induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until {{a certain number of}} steps have been tried. The assumption is that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled <b>coarsely,</b> and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move.|$|E
25|$|The {{youngest}} rock units {{consist of}} rough terra and smooth plains materials. Rough terra occurs as overlapping and intermixed ejecta blankets around dusters of large young craters {{in the eastern}} part of the quadrangle. The relief here appears to be higher than elsewhere in the map area, and the occurrence of dense arrays of fresh secondary craters produces a <b>coarsely</b> textured, hummocky surface at a scale of about 10–20km. The effect of roughness is highlighted by the low sun illumination angle. Ordinarily, rough terra material would be subdivided and mapped as individual ejecta blankets around and belonging to particular craters. In this eastern region, however, the closely grouped craters have about the same age, and it has not been possible to distinguish the boundaries between their aprons in many places.|$|E
25|$|Arabidopsis thaliana is {{an annual}} (rarely biennial) plant, usually growing to 20–25cm tall. The leaves form a rosette {{at the base}} of the plant, with a few leaves also on the {{flowering}} stem. The basal leaves are green to slightly purplish in color, 1.5–5cm long and 2–10mm broad, with an entire to <b>coarsely</b> serrated margin; the stem leaves are smaller and unstalked, usually with an entire margin. Leaves are covered with small, unicellular hairs (called trichomes). The flowers are 3mm in diameter, arranged in a corymb; their structure is that of the typical Brassicaceae. The fruit is a siliqua 5–20mm long, containing 20–30 seeds. Roots are simple in structure, with a single primary root that grows vertically downward, later producing smaller lateral roots. These roots form interactions with rhizosphere bacteria such as Bacillus megaterium.|$|E
25|$|<b>Coarsely</b> lineated ejecta {{blankets}} from Beethoven and Raphael basins {{dominate the}} southern part of the map area. The crater wall of Beethoven is buried by its ejecta blanket and by plains materials. Although the ejecta blankets from both basins are extensive, they are highly asymmetrical and deeply embayed in places by intercrater plains and younger plains units. These embayment relations, together with the discontinuous and subdued appearance of the rim crests and interior walls of the basins, suggest that they are relatively old impact structures. Morphologic appearances may be misleading on Mercury, however, because of the planet’s high temperature and gravity field compared with, for example, those of the Moon. Both of these conditions may promote, particularly on large structures, more rapid isostatic adjustments that would be expressed by subdued topography and the premature “aging” of once-large topographic features. Crater counts, on the other hand, tend to support observed stratigraphic relations.|$|E

Like Elvis in his pelvis-moving days or Wayne Cochran with his towering hairdo, Janis is a curiosity as well as a musical attraction. She cultivates a Madame of Rock image, lounging against an organ, exchanging profanities with bandsmen, cackling <b>coarsely</b> at private jokes, even taking a belt or two while onstage. She also has something to say in her songs, about the raw and rudimentary dimensions of sex, love and life. She gets her point across, splitting a few eardrums in the process. Opening the Joplin concert were Teegarden and Van Winkle, an organ-drums duo... Before her concert, Miss Joplin walked into the lobby and watched customers arrive. She was not recognized.|$|E
25|$|In their {{vaulting}} structures, Umayyad period buildings show {{a mixture}} of ancient Roman and Persian architectural traditions. Diaphragm arches with lintelled ceilings made of wood or stone beams, or, alternatively, with barrel vaults, were known in the Levant since the classical and Nabatean period. They were mainly used to cover houses and cisterns. The architectural form of covering diaphragm arches with barrel vaults, however, was likely newly introduced from Iranian architecture, as similar vaulting was not known in Bilad al-Sham {{before the arrival of}} the Umayyads. However, this form was well known in Iran from early Parthian times, as exemplified in the Parthian buildings of Aššur. The earliest known example for barrel vaults resting on diaphragm arches from Umayyad architecture is known from Qasr Harane in Syria. During the early period, the diaphragm arches are built from <b>coarsely</b> cut limestone slabs, without using supporting falsework, which were connected by gypsum mortar. Later-period vaults were erected using pre-formed lateral ribs modelled from gypsum, which served as a temporal formwork to guide and center the vault. These ribs, which were left in the structure afterwards, do not carry any load. The ribs were cast in advance on strips of cloth, the impression of which can still be seen in the ribs today. Similar structures are known from Sasanian architecture, for example from the palace of Firuzabad. Umayyad-period vaults of this type were found in Amman Citadel and in Qasr Amra.|$|E
