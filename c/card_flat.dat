50|$|Buses in the London Buses network accept Travelcards, Oyster card {{products}} (including bus {{passes and}} Oyster pay as you go) and contactless debit and credit cards. Cash fares {{have not been}} available since 6 July 2014, but Day Bus passes (issued either as a single use Oyster card, or on paper from station ticket machines) were re-introduced on 2 January 2015. Single journey fares used to be charged in relation to length of journey (fare stages), but are now charged as single flat fares {{for any length of}} journey. From 2000, the flat fare was higher for journeys in Zone 1 than in outer zones, although from 2004 this difference was eliminated, the change coinciding with the introduction of Oyster <b>card</b> <b>flat</b> fares.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, {{the park}} {{underwent}} a massive {{expansion in the}} entertainment department when Mark Shapiro took control of Six Flags. With this, Six Flags New England has added Justice League characters, along with the Hall of Justice. In 2007, enemies of the Justice League known as the Legion of Doom came to Six Flags. This addition brought the following characters to the park: Batman, Robin, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Hawk Girl, Green Lantern, The Flash, The Joker, The Riddler, Sinestro, Cheetah, Lex Luthor, and Captain Cold. The Hall of Justice {{is located in the}} building where the Jokers Wild <b>Card</b> <b>flat</b> ride used to be, transforming it into a secret lair.

5000|$|Playing {{cards and}} similar paper objects {{have very little}} mass and are not very {{aerodynamic}} except under certain circumstances. Simply throwing a card with no technique (that is, applying lateral speed only) usually will result in it fluttering about and falling to the ground. Achieving accuracy, distance and force with a card requires giving it both lateral speed and angular momentum (i.e. [...] "spin") along its z-axis. The spin creates gyroscopic stabilization so that the <b>card's</b> <b>flat</b> profile remains mostly parallel to the direction of travel and thus suffers the least possible air resistance.|$|R

6000|$|<b>Cards,</b> lying <b>flat,</b> {{and being}} more easily {{manipulated}} than paper, are now {{used at the}} laboratory for receiving the impressions. They are of rather large size, 11-1/2 × 5 inches, to enable the prints of the ten digits to be taken on the same card in two rather different ways (see Plate 2, Fig. 3), and to afford space for writing notes. The cards must have a smooth and yet slightly absorbent surface. If too highly glazed they cease to absorb, and more ink will remain on the fingers and less be transferred from them to the paper. A little trial soon determines the best specimen from among a few likely alternatives. [...] "Correspondence cards" [...] are suitable for taking prints of not more than three fingers, and are occasionally employed in the laboratory. Paper books and pads were tried, but their surfaces are inferior to cards in flatness, and their use is now abandoned.|$|R

The instructions also recommend that the test card be heldvertically and faced in a direction midway between the Sun and the camera;similar directions are also given in the Kodak Professional Photoguide.The combination of exposure increase and the card orientation givesrecommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by anincident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with anoff-axis light source.|$|R
50|$|A lace card is a {{punched card}} with all holes punched (also called a whoopee card, {{ventilator}} card, flyswatter card, or IBM doily). They were mainly used as practical jokes to cause unwanted disruption in card readers. Card readers tended to jam when a lace card was inserted, as the resulting card had too little structural strength to avoid buckling inside the mechanism. Card punches could also jam trying to produce cards with all holes punched, owing to power-supply problems. When a lace card was fed through the reader, a card knife or <b>card</b> saw (a <b>flat</b> tool used with punched card readers and card punches) {{was needed to}} clear the jam.|$|R
50|$|FuMG 65 Würzburg Riese(Giant): The {{electronics}} of the D model Würzburg {{combined with}} a 7-meter dish to improve resolution and range. Range approx 70 km. Version E was a modified unit to fit on railroad <b>flat</b> <b>cards</b> to produce a mobile Flak radar system. Version G had the 2.4-meter antenna and electronics from a Freya installed. The antenna dipoles were inside the reflector. The reason for this was that the allies were flying very high recon flights which were at altitudes above the maximum height of the Freya. The standard Würzburg Riese's 50 cm beam was to narrow to fid them directly. So by combining the two systems the Freya could set the Würzburg Riese onto the target.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an interface for assisting {{the design and}} production of pop-up cards by using a computer. A pop-up card {{is a piece of}} a folded paper from which a three-dimensional structure pops up when it is opened; it can be folded flat again afterward. Many people enjoy this interesting mechanism in pop-up books and greeting cards. However, nonprofessionals find it difficult to design pop-up cards because of the various geometric constraints required to make the <b>card</b> fold <b>flat.</b> We therefore propose an assistant interface to help people easily design and construct pop-up cards. In this paper, we deal with pop-up cards that open fully to 180 ◦. We have designed a prototype that allows the user to design a pop-up card by setting new parts on the fold lines and editing their position and shape afterward. At the same time, the system examines whether the parts protrude from the card or whether the parts collide with one another when the card is closed. Users can concentrate on the design activity because the results are continuously fed back to them. We created several pop-up cards using our system and performed an informal preliminary user study to demonstrate its usability. ...|$|R
40|$|Carding is {{the first}} and only machine (in card process) which can {{eliminate}} neps, seed coat neps and the remaining impurities which cannot be eliminated by blowroom section. In case of carding machine the higher the production rate, the more sensitive the carding operation and the greater danger of negative influence onquality. So the optimization of speed is the prime factor today [1]. Excessive higher speed can lead to fiberdamage and higher neps generation which will downgrade the final product. Again lower speed will reduce production rate which is not acceptable. So {{we need to find out}} the optimum speed which results best for both production rate and quality. In carding machine actual carding action takes place between the cylinder and flats[1]. Generally the high production <b>cards</b> process higher <b>flat</b> speed. The speed of <b>flats</b> affect the <b>carding</b> process and quality of final yarn and in practice the flat is optimized...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of a novel, non-contact smart card (1) is claimed. The electrically-insulating, <b>flat</b> <b>card</b> is made {{with at least one}} recess(es) on one side. Conductive track(s) are applied in a given pattern, {{on the surface of the}} recessed side. The track(s) are applied on surfaces both within and outside the recess(es). Microcircuit chip(s) (4) are aligned in the recess(es) and brought into contact with the track(s). Also claimed is a contact-less smart card, essentially as described. USE - Used to make a contact-less smart card with potentially extremely wide application in private and public life. ADVANTAGE - The process manufactures non-contact smart cards, producing the coils especially, at low cost. Resistance to mechanical stress and reliability are good. Single stage processes are employed where possible. Hot Stamp coil application is particularly economic and adhesive on the coil underside completes attachment. High production rates are achieved. The coil transfers data and/or e nergy, acting as an antenna. Of various applicable mounting technologies, the flip-chip method is particularly compact. Contact bumps are conveniently and accurately formed and registered during the earlier hot-stamping stage. Hermetic sealing using glob top technology, increases the reliable life of the card...|$|R

On each trial, observers viewed an achromatic standard object and indicated the best match from a palette of 36 grayscale samples.

The air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the edge keeps it out.|$|R
