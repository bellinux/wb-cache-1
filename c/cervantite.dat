50|$|Antimony tetroxide is an {{inorganic}} compound with the formula Sb2O4. This material, which exists as the mineral <b>cervantite,</b> is white but reversibly yellows upon heating. The material, with empirical formula SbO2, is called antimony tetroxide to signify {{the presence of}} two kinds of Sb centers.|$|E
50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} in 1980 for an occurrence as thin coatings or platelets replacing sphalerite {{in the type}} locality in De Kalb Township, Saint Lawrence County, New York. It also occurs in a magnetite-chromite a serpentinite-hosted deposit in Eretria, Greece. It occurs associated with spionkopite, sphalerite, tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, malachite, azurite, brochantite, chrysocolla, <b>cervantite,</b> stibiconite, hemimorphite and calcite in the type locality; and with spionkopite, chalcopyrite, cobaltian pentlandite, magnetite, chromite, andradite, chlorite, diopside in the Eretria deposit.It has also been reported {{from a variety of}} locations worldwide, including the Logatchev-1 hydrothermal field along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge complex.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTailings and slag {{residues}} {{from the}} most important antimony mine of the French Massif Central were analysed for their mineralogical and chemical contents by conventional X-ray powder diffraction and synchrotron-based X-ray microdiffraction (μ-XRD). Results show that ∼ 2000 metric tons of Sb are still present at the abandoned mining site. Mean concentrations of Sb in slags and tailings are 1700 and 5000 mg kg− 1, respectively. In addition, smaller quantities of As were also measured (∼ 800 mg kg− 1 in tailings). Toxicity tests of As and Sb indicate that the growth of bacteria is severely affected at these concentrations. In particular, Sb was observed to cause negative effects for several types of bacteria. Almost all primary minerals carrying trivalent Sb disappeared during weathering {{at the expense of}} phases in which Sb 5 + is the most abundant form. Instead of sulphides, Sb-bearing Fe hydroxides (goethite and lepidocrocite) are now present in the residues together with Sb-bearing jarosite and Sb(-Fe) oxides and hydroxides such as tripuhyite, senarmontite, romeite, <b>cervantite,</b> and valentinite. Water analyses of the main local stream indicate little remobilization of Sb downstream the site and despite the acidic pH of the surface tailings, pH values show neutral or near-neutral values on all locations of the site...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time, we prepare new ternary glass systems of {{composition}} (95 -x) Sb 2 O 3 -xP 2 O 5 - 5 MgO, where xÂ =Â  45, 40, 35 Â mol%; (85 -x) Sb 2 O 3 -xP 2 O 5 - 15 MgO, where xÂ =Â  55, 35, 25 Â mol%; (75 -x) Sb 2 O 3 -xP 2 O 5 - 25 MgO, where xÂ =Â  45, 35, 25 Â mol%; and 60 Sb 2 O 3 -(40 -x) P 2 O 5 -xMgO, where xÂ =Â  10, 20 Â mol% via melt-quenching method. Synthesized glasses are characterized using XRD, FESEM, EDX, and TG/DTA measurements. The influence of varying modifier concentrations on their thermal properties is evaluated. The XRD patterns confirmed the amorphous nature of samples. SEM images demonstrated interesting phase formation with ribbons-like texture. Five crystalline phases are evidenced in the ternary diagram which are antimony phosphate and antimony orthophosphate as major phases {{as well as}} magnesium phosphate, magnesium cyclo-tetraphosphate and <b>cervantite</b> as minor phases. EDX spectra detected the right elemental traces. Detailed thermal analysis of these glasses revealed their high-molecular polymer character for Sb 2 O 3 content greater than 50 Â mol%. Three different glass transition temperatures are achieved around 276, 380 â 381 and 422 â 470 Â Â°C depending on the composition. Furthermore, the solidus and liquidus temperature are found to decrease with increasing Sb 2 O 3 and increases for MgO contents till 15 Â mol% and then decrease, where the lowest recorded solidus temperature is 426 Â Â°C. This observation may open up new research avenues for antimony based ternary glasses and an exploitation of the derived results for optoelectronics applications, photonic devices and non-linear optical devices.
