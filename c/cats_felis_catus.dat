5|$|The felids are {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} family of mammals that {{share a common}} ancestor only 10–15million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic <b>cats</b> (<b>Felis</b> <b>catus)</b> {{are part of the}} genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.|$|E

25|$|Some known predators of the rock-haunting {{ringtail}} possum are the Dingo (Canis lupus dingo), the Oenpelli Python (Morelia oenpelliensis), the Olive Python (Liasis olivaceous), quolls (Dasyurus spp.), owls (Strigiformes), feral <b>cats</b> (<b>Felis</b> <b>catus),</b> domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) {{and humans}} (Homo sapiens). The rock-haunting ringtail possum spends {{a large amount}} of time participating in sentinel behaviour to avoid predators. It perches on branches or ledges and scans the area for danger. In an attempt to deter predators and to warn others, this possum beats its tail against tree branches vigorously causing the entire tree to shake.|$|E
500|$|Vespucci's account {{suggests}} that Noronhomys was common when {{the island was}} first visited, but was not encountered by the first biological explorers of the island, who conducted their research in the late 19th century. The introduced black rat and house mouse (Mus musculus), which became very common on the island, may have driven it to extinction by directly competing for food, preying on young Noronhomys, or transmitting diseases. Other factors that {{may have played a}} role include modification of its habitat, introduction of predators such as <b>cats</b> (<b>Felis</b> <b>catus),</b> and predation by visiting sailors. These extinction mechanisms are common for island endemic species. In 1888, Henry Nicholas Ridley already suggested that the rat Vespucci had seen had been driven to extinction by the introduced black rat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as [...] "extinct".|$|E
2500|$|No [...] mammal {{species are}} native on Diego Garcia, with {{no record of}} bats. Other than rats (Rattus rattus), all [...] "wild" [...] mammal species are feral {{descendants}} of domesticated species. During the plantation era, Diego Garcia was home to large herds of Sicilian donkeys (Equus asinus), dozens of horses (Equus caballus), hundreds of dogs (Canis familiaris), and house <b>cats</b> (<b>Felis</b> <b>catus).</b> In 1971, the BIOT Commissioner ordered the extermination of feral dogs following {{the departure of the}} last plantation workers, and the program continued through 1975, when the last feral dog was observed and shot. Donkeys, which numbered over 400 in 1972, were down to just 20 individuals in 2005. The last horse was observed in 1995, and by 2005, just two cats were thought to have survived an island-wide eradication program.|$|E

2500|$|During hibernation, predators of Indiana bats {{may include}} black rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus) [...] and {{northern}} raccoons (Procyon lotor). During other {{times of the}} year northern raccoons have been observed trying to grab bats from the air when they attempt to fly away. Skunks (Mephitidae), Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), and feral <b>cats</b> (<b>Felis</b> <b>catus)</b> may pose a similar threat. If Indiana bats fly from their day roosts during the day, they may be susceptible to predation by hawks (Accipitridae). Indiana bats foraging at night may also be susceptible to predation by owls (Strigidae). While not a predator, woodpeckers (Picidae) may disturb roosting bats through their foraging activities by peeling away sections of bark being utilized by Indiana bats, causing Indiana bats to fly from the roost during the day and making the tree unsuitable for future habitation.|$|E

The golden eagle also occasionally takes dogs as prey [...] The only other family of mammals to be important in the golden eagle's diet is the hedgehogs, though these are only known as prey in Europe. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) appears {{to be the most important}} prey species on the Swedish island of Gotland, making up 42.5% of sampled nest remains. In Estonia, the southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor) was the most significant prey species (28.6%). The latter species was also the most important mammalian prey (13.8%) in the a small study in the Sarnena Sredna Gora Mountains of Bulgaria.|$|E
