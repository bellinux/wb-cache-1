5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive and negative charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions that personal positions <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E

25|$|As for a {{possible}} underground leg in downtown (under 8 Avenue South), {{the cost of the}} project will be at least C$800 million (in 2012 dollars), but its priority has been lowered because there is no funding available for it. However, the overall cost of this and other projects <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> least C$8 billion.|$|E
25|$|Since other ancient rifts {{are known}} to occur in North America but not all are {{associated}} with modern earthquakes, other processes <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> work to locally increase mechanical stress on the New Madrid faults. It has also been suggested {{that some form of}} heating in the lithosphere below the area may be making deep rocks more plastic, which would concentrate compressive stress in the shallower subsurface area where the faulting occurs.|$|E
25|$|Large {{solar power}} {{photovoltaic}} cell arrays or thermal power plants {{would be needed}} to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers' use. In developed parts of Earth, electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person (or roughly 10 megawatt-hours per person per year.) These power plants <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power, or much farther away with wireless power transmission.|$|E

25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the end effector, for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|On {{the secular}} {{equation}} of the Moon, 1773; also noticeable for the earliest {{introduction of the}} idea of the potential. The potential of a body at any point is the sum of the mass of every element of the body when divided by its distance from the point. Lagrange showed that if the potential of a body at an external point were known, the attraction in any direction <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> once found. The theory of the potential was elaborated in a paper sent to Berlin in 1777.|$|E
25|$|Men, women, and {{children}} may all {{be taken as}} prisoners of war under traditional interpretations of Islamic law. Generally, {{a prisoner of war}} <b>could</b> <b>be,</b> <b>at</b> the discretion of the military leader, executed, freed, ransomed, exchanged for Muslim prisoners, or kept as slaves. In earlier times, the ransom sometimes took an educational dimension, where a literate prisoner of war could secure his or her freedom by teaching ten Muslims to read and write. Some Muslim scholars hold that a prisoner may not be ransomed for gold or silver, but may be exchanged for Muslim prisoners.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian Antarctic {{historian}} Hans Bogen {{described her}} in 1955 as: “Ingrid Dahl {{was exactly what}} in our time we call a kjekk og frisk jente (a Norwegian expression meaning a girl who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> {{once one of the}} boys, then one of the girls, without losing her femininity or charm). She was the natural leader of the girls in her age group because of her initiative, humour and fearlessness, qualities she has preserved unwaveringly to the present day”. Ingrid married Lars Christensen in 1910, uniting two of Sandefjord’s most powerful ship owning families, and they had six children.|$|E
25|$|It is very {{important}} to have a properly formatted, edited, and reviewed medical transcription document. If a medical transcriptionist accidentally typed a wrong medication or the wrong diagnosis, the patient <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> risk if the doctor (or his designee) did not review the document for accuracy. Both the doctor and the medical transcriptionist play an important role to make sure the transcribed dictation is correct and accurate. The doctor should speak slowly and concisely, especially when dictating medications or details of diseases and conditions. The medical transcriptionist must possess hearing acuity, medical knowledge, and good reading comprehension in addition to checking references when in doubt.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Researchers at LANL {{reasoned}} that a plasma oscillating <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> local thermodynamic equilibrium. This prompted the POPS and Penning trap designs. At this time, researchers at MIT {{became interested in}} fusors for space propulsion and powering space vehicles. Specifically, researchers developed fusors with multiple inner cages. Greg Piefer graduated from Madison and founded Phoenix Nuclear Labs, a company that developed the fusor into a neutron source for the mass production of medical isotopes. Robert Bussard began speaking openly about the Polywell in 2006. He attempted to generate interest in the research, before his death. In 2008, Taylor Wilson achieved notoriety for achieving nuclear fusion at 14, with a homemade fusor.|$|E

25|$|Since the Byzantine {{army was}} still holding on after this defeat the sultan {{thought it was time}} to set up his secret weapon, a huge mobile tower. This tower could hold many {{soldiers}} who <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan's encouragement the Muslims broke the wall in two places and entered the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed.|$|E
25|$|A {{flat tax}} system and income taxes overall are not {{inherently}} border-adjustable; meaning the tax component embedded into products via taxes imposed on companies (including corporate taxes and payroll taxes) are not removed when exported {{to a foreign}} country (see Effect of taxes and subsidies on price). Taxation systems such as a sales tax or value added tax can remove the tax component when goods are exported and apply the tax component on imports. The domestic products <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> a disadvantage to foreign products (at home and abroad) that are border-adjustable, which would impact the global competitiveness of a country. However, it's possible that a flat tax system could be combined with tariffs and credits to act as border adjustments (the proposed Border Tax Equity Act in the U.S. attempts this). Implementing an income tax with a border adjustment tax credit {{is a violation of}} the World Trade Organization agreement. Tax exemptions (allowances) on low income wages, a component of most income tax systems could mitigate this issue for high labour content industries like textiles that compete Globally.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} before the Mongol invasion, the Cuman-Kipchaks were in {{ambiguous}} relationships with their neighbours (often through marital and martial alliances), the Kwarizmians, Byzantines, Georgians, and the Rus'; {{at a given time}} they <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> peace with one, at war with another. The Byzantine Empire hesitated {{to go to war with}} the Cuman-Kipchaks north of the Danube River; instead, like the Hungarians, they chose to bribe them. Since Kwarizm had more important enemies, they hired the Cuman-Kipchaks for garrison duty. There were numerous ways the Cuman-Kipchaks could make a living as nomadic warriors. One could partake in questing and raiding with their tribe and subsequently keep the spoils. Another avenue was to seek employment as a mercenary in exchange for the guarantee of loot. One could serve in a garrison, although this caused those Cumans to eventually forget their light cavalry skills and become poor infantry. This was fully exploited when the Mongol army destroyed the Cuman-Kipchak garrison in Samarkand. Cuman-Kipchak women fought beside their fellow male warriors. Women were shown great respect and would often ride on a horse or wagon while the men walked.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the changes}} made was {{replacing}} the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly {{on a par with}} criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of due process in accordance with the rule of law the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.|$|E
