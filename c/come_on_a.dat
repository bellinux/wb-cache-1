25|$|In the {{following}} years Wang realised a far-reaching development plan. He tried to bring more workers into the booming Manchurian economy. Most had <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> temporary basis, returning to their homes in north China in winter. The Manchurian government now encouraged them to bring women and children, and settle permanently. As an incentive, they were made eligible for reduced fares on all Chinese-owned railways in Manchuria, received funds to build a dwelling and were promised total ownership {{after five years of}} continuous occupation. Rent for the land was canceled for the first years. Most were sent to the interior of Manchuria, where they reclaimed land for agriculture, or worked in forestry or mines. Between 1924-29 the amount of land under tillage increased from 20 to 35 million acres (80,000 to 140,000km²).|$|E
25|$|Once {{converted}} to full-back, Pardoe became {{a fixture in}} the Manchester City team, and played at left-back throughout the club's successful period in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

However, he did not play, and Roy Cheetham became the first City player to <b>come</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> substitute three games later. After spending the opening match on the bench, Pardoe was restored to the starting line-up and played every game for the rest of the season. Manchester City won the Second Division by five points, and were promoted to the First Division. Pardoe was still predominantly a forward at this point. He scored 11 goals in 50 appearances, the most productive goalscoring season of his career. Six of these came in September, including braces in consecutive matches, against Carlisle United and Norwich City.|$|E
