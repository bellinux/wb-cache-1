40|$|A {{wealth of}} data and {{services}} {{are available on the}} Web, and often have geographical context as well. But the vast quan-tity of offered geospatial information is rather difficult to explore, and its quality hard to assess, due to lack of suf-ficient metadata. Hence, the Open Geospatial Consortium has specified application profiles for publishing, accessing, and searching over collections of spatial metadata with stan-dardized <b>Catalogue</b> <b>Services</b> for the Web (CSW). Unfortu-nately, existing spatial metadata remain largely unexploited by Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we introduce TripleGeo-CSW, a middleware {{that can be used to}} discover metadata from existing CSWs through a virtual SPARQL endpoint. Acting as broker between a request (in SPARQL) and <b>catalogue</b> <b>services</b> (in XML/GML), this platform can provide on-the-fly information (as RDF triples) on available geodata according to multiple, user-specified criteria (e. g., area of interest, date of last update, keywords). As a proof of concept, we have set up an instance of this middleware against CSWs from public authorities across Europe, which involve datasets complying with the EU INSPIRE Directive. Our experience testifies that TripleGeo-CSW can assist stake-holders to repurpose existing CSWs with minimal overhead and readily expose spatial metadata on the Semantic Web...|$|R
40|$|The {{provision}} of multi-lingual web services {{is dependent on}} the creation and maintenance of appropriate multi-lingual metadata. In particular multi-lingual cataloguing data is an essential component of providing access to digital libraries and library catalogues. CAVAL Collaborative Solutions, a consortium of the University Libraries in Victoria and the State Library of Victoria, provides a range of services to the library and information communities throughout Australasia. One of these services is the {{provision of}} multi-language cataloguing, currently CAVAL provides <b>cataloguing</b> <b>services</b> to customer libraries in over sixty languages. Customer libraries come from all sectors- public libraries, state libraries, academic libraries and government and special libraries. Unicode is an international character set developed for the scripts of all the languages of the world. The ability to use the Unicode format was a key factor in the selection of a library management system to support CAVAL’s multi-lingual <b>cataloguing</b> <b>services.</b> The Aleph 500 library management system from Ex Libris was implemented in 2002, and the system was upgraded in 2005.

CLs are human languages restricted to specific domains and with limited vocabulary and restricted syntax. Control aims to minimise ambiguities in the texts.

40|$|Geoscience {{data are}} {{typically}} big data, {{and they are}} distributed in various agencies and individuals worldwide. Efficient data sharing and interoperability are important for managing and applying geoscience data. The OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) <b>Catalogue</b> <b>Service</b> for the Web (CSW) is an open interoperability standard for supporting the discovery of geospatial data. In the past, regular OGC catalogue services have been studied, but few studies have discussed a near-real-time OGC <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> for geoscience big data. A near-real-time OGC <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> requires frequent updates of a metadata repository in a short time. When dealing with massive amounts of geoscience data, this comprises an extremely challenging issue. Discovering these data via an OGC <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> in near real-time is desirable. In this study, we focus on how the near-real-time OGC <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> is realized through several lightweight data structures, algorithms, and tools. We propose a framework of a near-real-time OGC <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> and discuss each element of the framework to which more attention should be paid when dealing with the massive amounts of real-time data, followed by a review of several methods {{that need to be}} considered in a near-real-time OGC CSW service.

40|$|Provenance, {{also known}} as lineage, is {{important}} in understanding the derivation history of data products. Geospatial data provenance helps data consumers to evaluate the quality and reliability of geospatial data. In a service-oriented environment, where data are often consumed or produced by distributed services, provenance could be managed by following the same service-oriented paradigm. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) <b>Catalogue</b> <b>Service</b> for the Web (CSW) {{is used for the}} registration and query of geospatial data provenance by extending ebXML Registry Information Model (ebRIM). Recent advance of the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) paradigm has shown great promise for the easy integration of distributed resources. RESTful Web Service aims to provide a standard way for Web clients to communicate with servers based on REST principles. The existing approach for provenance <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> could be improved by adopting the RESTful design. This paper presents the design and implementation of a <b>catalogue</b> <b>service</b> for geospatial data provenance following RESTful architecture style.
