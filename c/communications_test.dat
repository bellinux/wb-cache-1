40|$|Designing {{a robust}} {{communications}} structure needed in a robotic system {{often leads to}} many difficulties and compromises due to design constraints. Some of the capabilities of an 802. 11 Ethernet radio modem can suffer {{as a direct result}} of compromises made to allow a robotic system to operate effectively within its established parameters. This was the case in the Man Portable Robotic System (MPRS) project, funded by the Army. The Urban Robot (URBOT) developed under this project had many specific user requirements, which led to challenging problems when designing the communications system. A <b>communications</b> <b>test</b> was conducted to determine the baseline capabilities of the BreezeNET PRO. 11 modems that are currently being used in the URBOT.
