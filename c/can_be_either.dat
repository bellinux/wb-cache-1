5|$|Enzyme inhibitors are {{molecules}} that reduce or abolish enzyme activity, while enzyme activators are {{molecules that}} increase the catalytic rate of enzymes. These interactions <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> reversible (i.e., removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity) or irreversible (i.e., the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme).|$|E
5|$|Heart murmurs are {{abnormal}} heart sounds which <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> pathological or benign. One {{example of}} a murmur is Still's murmur, which presents a musical sound in children, has no symptoms and disappears in adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Some enzymes do {{not need}} {{additional}} components to show full activity. Others require non-protein molecules called cofactors to be bound for activity. Cofactors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> inorganic (e.g., metal ions and iron-sulfur clusters) or organic compounds (e.g., flavin and heme). These cofactors serve many purposes; for instance, metal ions can help in stabilizing nucleophilic species within the active site. Organic cofactors <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> coenzymes, which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction, or prosthetic groups, which are tightly bound to an enzyme. Organic prosthetic groups can be covalently bound (e.g., biotin in enzymes such as pyruvate carboxylase).|$|E

The high-frequency wave {{sent by the}} tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as {{to pick up the}} high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).|$|E
5|$|In coal seams, coal {{balls are}} {{completely}} surrounded by coal. They are often found randomly {{scattered throughout the}} seam in isolated groups, usually in {{the upper half of}} the seam.

5|$|Like many Australian languages, Wagiman {{does not}} categorially {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives. These form one word class {{that is called}} nominals. Wagiman nominals take case suffixes (see below) that denote their grammatical or semantic role in the sentence. The grammatical cases are ergative and absolutive, and the semantic cases include instrumental (using), allative (towards), ablative (from), locative (at), comitative (with, having), privative (without, lacking), temporal (at the time of) and semblative (resembling). The dative case <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>either</b> grammatical or semantic, depending on the syntactic requirements of the verb.|$|E

Older parents are financially established and generally have fewer problems raising children compared to their teenage counterparts.|$|E

The principal value of 41/2 is 2, but −2 is also a valid square root. If the definition of exponentiation of real numbers is extended to allow negative results then the result is no longer well-behaved.|$|E
