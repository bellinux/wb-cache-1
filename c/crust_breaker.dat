40|$|An animal-drawn, inclined-roller <b>crust</b> <b>breaker</b> was designed, {{developed}} and evaluated in the Alfisol field. It completely breaks the soil crust, causes negligible injury to seedlings, and promotes emergence of pearlmillet [Pennisetum typhoides (Burm. f.) Stapf & C. E. Hubb.,syn. P. americanum (Linn.) Leeke] and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (Linn.) Moench] {{to the level}} expected {{in the absence of}} crusting. It covers a im wide strip, and its average field capacity is 0. 35 ha/hr. The design is simple and it can be made locall...|$|E
40|$|Soil crusting or capping is {{a serious}} problem in arid and {{semiarid}} regions; it restricts the emergence of crop seedlings. A mechanical, rolling soil <b>crust</b> <b>breaker</b> was designed, developed, and tested in the field. The equipment is of simple construction and breaks the soil crust over the rows of germinated seeds effectively, improving emergence significantly without any damage to seedlings. It can be manually operated as a single-row unit or a multiple row unit and can be pulled by animal draft power or a small tracto...|$|E
40|$|A {{suite of}} simple bullock-drawn {{implements}} {{has been developed}} at ICRISAT to form broadbeds and furrows and to carryout subsequent field operations easily. Agribar II, an improved version of the Agribar fitted with a four-row planter, can sow various crops and per form tillage operations. Simple implements based on a T-bar {{have been developed for}} making broadbeds, applying fertilizer, sowing, and interrow cultivation. A <b>crust</b> <b>breaker</b> was developed to enhance seedling emergence through the surface crust. A spinning-disc knapsack sprayer and a groundnut digger have also been developed to meet specific requirements of farmers who grow groundnut in the semi-arid tropics...|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} {{cultivation of}} sugar beet the weeding and crust breaking are mostly performed manually. The objectives {{of this research}} were to design, fabricate and evaluate a soil <b>crust</b> <b>breaker</b> and weeding implement equipped with a detecting sensor. Each unit consisted of a distance detecting sensor and a hydro-motor for driving the blades and pneumatic valves for moving the blades. The hydro-motor was activated by the sensors. To avoid damaging the plants, a command signal {{was sent to the}} pneumatic valves to move the blades up and down and pass safely. Three configurations of cutting blades were considered which could be mounted to the <b>crust</b> <b>breaker.</b> The field evaluation was conducted with two tractor forward speeds (0. 4 and 1 km h- 1) and four plant-to-plant spacings within rows (20, 25, 30 and 40 cm) all with three different blade shapes. For field evaluation split plot experiments arranged in a completely randomized block design with three replications. The number of plants damaged (evaluated only for four-lobe blades) and size of broken crusts (evaluated for all blade shapes) for various treatments were recorded and compared. The results of analysis indicated that the higher the inter-row spacing the lower the injury to the plant. The highest and the least damage to the plants occurred for within-row plant spacings of 20 and 40 cm, respectively. The forward speed was also significantly affected the percent of plant damaged. The forward speed of 1 km h- 1 at 20 cm spacing had the most (59 %) and the speed of 0. 40 km h- 1 at 40 cm spacing had the least effect (3. 3 %) on the percent of plant damage. The two-lobe blade could result in the maximum surface area broken...|$|E
40|$|Field {{operations}} in Alfisols and related soils require timeliness and precision {{for the early}} establishment of a crop in the rainy season. Animal-drawn, multipurpose wheeled tool carriers (WTCs) {{have been found to}} be the most appropriate machinery for this purpose. Three designs discussed in this paper covered 1 ha in 3 - 4 hours for different tillage operations, and could be drawn by a pair of oxen of average size. A WTC fitted with a planter-and-fertilizer applicator, consisting of an inclined plate for seed metering and 1416 oscillating mechanisms for fertilizer metering and a double-shoe furrow opener, gave excellent results in sowing various crops, and covered 1 ha in 4 - 5 hours with an average draft of 1530 N (156 kgf) for four rows. A rolling <b>crust</b> <b>breaker,</b> developed to enhance seedling emergence through the surface crust, gave good results. Intensive primary tillage of Alfisols showed advantages in the early stages of crop growth, but they tended to disappear late in the season. Results of tillage studies conducted for 4 years indicate a need for further research to find out the comparative advantages of different intensities of primary tillage during the cropping season and off-season...|$|E
40|$|To {{increase}} mechanized cotton planting {{in areas}} with saline irrigation water and crust forming soil in Isfahan Province, assessment of seeders in flatland planting method with or without crust breaking is essential. An experiment was conducted at the Kabootarabad Research Station of Isfahan Research Center to compare the performance parameters of planting equipment in a clay loam soil. Four planting equipment treatments using Bazrsazan and John Deere planters and Nordsten drill along with three crust breaking methods, including rolling cultivator, rolling-type <b>crust</b> <b>breaker</b> and no crust breaking, were {{laid out in a}} factorial experiment within a randomized complete block design with three replications. Planters’ performance was evaluated by measuring the number of plants and plant spacings in each treatment, and estimation of the mean and standard deviation, multiples index, miss index, quality of feed index, precision, and hill-dropping index. Although the plant spacings, and not the seed spacings, were measured in this experiment, the indices used in this research showed the planters’ performance to be very satisfactory. The suggested hill-dropping index showed the multiple seeds dropping characteristics of the seeders to be better than those of the multiples index regardless of the crust breaking methods. In the non-crust breaking method, the multiple seeds dropping tendency of Bazrsazan planter brought about a reduction in the mean and standard deviation of plant spacings. Crost breaking caused a reduction in plant spacings for all seeders, especially for the drill whose multiple seeds dropping tendency was negligible. The results indicated that the seed metering systems in Bazrsazan and John Deere planters were volumetric rather than single seed metering devices...|$|E
