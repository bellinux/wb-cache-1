25|$|Unlike {{corporate}} bonds, most securitizations are amortized, {{meaning that}} the principal amount borrowed is paid back gradually over the specified term of the loan, rather than in one lump sum at the maturity of the loan. Fully amortizing securitizations are generally <b>collateralised</b> by fully amortizing assets, such as home equity loans, auto loans, and student loans. Prepayment uncertainty is an important concern with fully amortizing ABS. The possible rate of prepayment varies widely {{with the type of}} underlying asset pool, so many prepayment models have been developed to try to define common prepayment activity. The PSA prepayment model is a well-known example.|$|E

5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to replicate the effect of security by making an outright transfer of the asset, with a provision that the asset is re-transferred once the secured obligations are repaid. In some jurisdictions, these arrangements may be recharacterised as the grant of a mortgage, but most jurisdictions tend to allow the parties freedom to characterise their transactions as they see fit. [...] Common examples of this are financings using a stock loan or repo agreement to <b>collateralise</b> the cash advance, and title transfer arrangements (for example, under the [...] "Transfer" [...] form English Law credit support annex to an ISDA Master Agreement (as distinguished from the other forms of CSA, which grant security)).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} asset backed {{securities}} and the pricing thereof. First, an overview of debt markets is provided with a particular focus on the recent crisis in the sub prime markets. Second, literature surrounding securitization, {{asset backed securities}} and related types of debt is analysed and discussed. A revised pricing model for asset backed securities based on two existing models (Ebrahim, 2000; Ebrahim & Ahmed, 2007) is successively developed and implemented in Maple programming language. This model assumes access to symmetric information and provides optimum pricing for securities backed by a deprecating asset while <b>collateralising</b> the loan with the underlying asset and the income of the borrower. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed on the model, the results are analysed and conclusions drawn. Further extensions to the model are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Transaction cost shocks in {{financial}} markets {{are known to}} affect asset prices. This paper analyses how changes in transaction costs may affect the value of assets that banks use to <b>collateralise</b> borrowings in monetary policy operations. Based on a simple asset pricing model and employing a dataset of hypothetical Eurosystem collateral positions, we simulate and quantify the resulting change in collateral value pledged by counterparties to the Eurosystem, resulting from a transaction cost shock. A 10 basis point increase in transaction costs entails a direct - 0. 30 % decrease of collateral value and a - 0. 07 % decrease when adjusted for the expected {{reduction in the number}} of trades of each asset. We conclude that banks will on average suffer small collateral losses while selected institutions could face a considerably larger collateral decrease...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the Fed, the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright. The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so-called refinancing facilities. In these facilities, bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions: repurchase agreements, or <b>collateralised</b> loans. These two transactions are similar, i.e. bonds are used as collaterals for loans, the difference being of legal nature. In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid.|$|E

50|$|The {{availability}} {{and cost of}} liquidity are two crucial issues for the smooth processing of payments in RTGS systems. In TARGET2, liquidity can be managed very flexibly and is available at low cost since fully remunerated minimum reserves - which credit institutions are required to hold with their central bank - {{can be used in}} full for settlement purposes during the day. The averaging provisions applied to minimum reserves allow banks to be flexible in their end-of-day liquidity management. The overnight lending and deposit facilities also allow for continuous liquidity management decisions. The Eurosystem provides intraday credit. This credit must be fully <b>collateralised</b> and no interest is charged. However, all Eurosystem credit must be fully <b>collateralised,</b> i.e. secured by other assets. The range of eligible collateral is very wide. Assets eligible for monetary policy purposes are also eligible for intraday credit. Under Eurosystem rules, credit can only be granted by the national central bank of the Member State where the participant is established. Banks’ treasury managers have a keen interest in the use of automated processes for the optimisation of payment and liquidity management. They need tools {{that will allow them to}} track activity across accounts and, where possible, make accurate intraday and overnight funding decisions from a single location - e.g. their head office.TARGET2 users have, via the Information and Control Module, access to comprehensive online information and easy-to-use liquidity management features that meet their business needs.|$|E

The bank receipts were used in short-term bank-to-bank lending, known as [...] "ready forward" [...] transactions, which Mehta's firm brokered. By the second half of 1991 Mehta had earned the nickname of the ''''Big Bull'''', because he was said to have started the bull run in the stock market.

5000|$|It was not, {{however, the}} sole source of RBS's problems, as RBS {{was exposed to}} the {{liquidity}} crisis {{in a number of}} ways, particularly through US subsidiaries including RBS Greenwich Capital. Although the takeover of NatWest launched RBS's meteoric rise, it came with an investment bank subsidiary, Greenwich NatWest. RBS was unable to dispose of it as planned {{as a result of the}} involvement of the NatWest Three with the collapsed energy trader Enron. [...] However the business (now RBS Greenwich Capital) started making money, and under pressure of comparison with rapidly growing competitors such as Barclays Capital, saw major expansion in 2005-7, not least in private equity loans and in the sub-prime mortgage market. It became one of the top three underwriters of <b>collateralised</b> debt obligations (CDOs). This increased exposure to the eventual [...] "credit crunch" [...] contributed to RBS's financial problems.|$|E

40|$|Debt {{with many}} {{creditors}} is analysed in a continuous-time pricing {{model of the}} levered firm. We specifically allow for debtor opportunism vis-à-vis a non-co-ordinated group of creditors, in form of repeated strategic renegotiation offers and default threats. We show that the creditors initial entitlement to non-collateralized assets will be expropriated through exchange offers. Exchange offers successively increase the level of collateral until all assets are fully <b>collateralised.</b> The ex ante optimal debt contract is neither fully <b>collateralised</b> nor without any collateral. Diffusely held debt allows for a larger debt capacity and bears lower credit risk premia than privately held debt.
