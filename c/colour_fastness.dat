50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting <b>colour</b> <b>fastness,</b> {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved enamelling processes, c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments {{in the last ten years}} include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and new easy-to-clean enamels.|$|E
40|$|Fastness {{measurement}} by eyes is subjective, {{since it}} is dependent on evaluation of the observer.

40|$|Poor <b>colour</b> <b>fastness</b> in textile {{products}} {{is one of}} the major sources of customer dissatisfaction and leads to fading or bleeding of textile colour by various type of external influences like water, perspiration, rubbing etc., during textile manufacturing and in daily use.

This article has tried to find a solution to mitigate the poor <b>colour</b> <b>fastness</b> to perspiration particularly for dark shade on silk fabrics. This paper shows a comparative analysis of different type of fastness properties of natural silk fabrics and their strength loss while dyeing with reactive and metal complex dyes following different national and international standards like ISO, ASTM standards etc. In this study, it has been revealed that <b>colour</b> <b>fastness</b> to perspiration of reactive dyed silk fabric against all types of fibres is comparatively better than that of metal complex dyed silk fabric.

40|$|Wool fabrics {{were treated}} by {{ultraviolet}} radiations, using a medium pressure Hg lamp, {{in order to}} obtain a strong modification onto fibers surface. [1, 2, 3] As consequence, UV treated wool showed a decrease of water contact angle, then an increase of hydrophilicity, together with a better kinetics of dye absorption under the same conditions of dyeing, obtaining a dye-bath exhaustion nearly complete. The interaction between the metal cation and new ligand groups formed on irradiated wool (such as cystine oxides and cysteic acid) is responsible for the significantly increased depth of shade with 1 :l metal-complex dyes. In support of this hypothesis, UV-C-treated wool soaked in solutions of various transition metal salts (namely Mohr's salt, copper sulphate and silver nitrate) at room temperature gave a grey/brown colour in the irradiated regions, denouncing the increased affinity. Experimental results showed that different kind of dyes are able to give differential dyeing after irradiation, but not all members of the same dyeing class have similar behavior. Then, a selection of 1 : 1 metal-complex dyes was chosen to evidence the maximum of colour difference between irradiated and not irradiated areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find the best conditions for differential dyeing in terms of pH, temperature, liquor ratio, dyeingtime.

30|$|The dye and mordants {{extracted}} from unexplored plant materials {{were found to}} be effective colouring agents for the dyeing of pashmina, wool and silk fabrics. The mordants enhanced the colour quality of the fabrics due to the increased efficiency in absorption, colour strength, <b>colour</b> coordinates and <b>fastness</b> grades in terms of washing, light and rubbing, respectively. However, the cotton fabric showed less affinity for the dye and mordant with lower values and grades. The most excellent results of the dye and mordant were recorded in pashmina followed by wool and silk fabrics. The dye applied on fabrics showed striking shades with the change in mordant and method both in combination and in isolation which were represented by fast and light colours of brown, red and yellow with varying shades and tones. Thus, the recorded observations recommend natural dyeing agents as a potential colouring material for wool, pashmina and silk fabric which can be explored commercially at national and international levels.|$|R
