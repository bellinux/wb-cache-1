50|$|For the clock, {{the work}} {{consisted}} of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and <b>chain</b> <b>adjuster.</b> For the strike, the installation {{consisted of a}} RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and <b>chain</b> <b>adjuster.</b> The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the internal dial re-lacquered. The work {{was carried out by}} the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric motor clamped to weights and geared with sprockets onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.|$|E
5000|$|The {{four-cylinder engine}} {{featured}} double overhead cams, with hydraulic lifters which eliminated valve adjustments. The exhaust was a four-into-two finished in black chrome. The engine layout {{was the same}} as the 650 Nighthawk's, but of a different design sharing no parts. [...] The bike also featured shaft drive, electronic ignition, a digital gear indicator, an automatic cam <b>chain</b> <b>adjuster,</b> a spin-on automobile-style oil filter, and Honda’s second-generation TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control) front end control system. Tire size in both front and rear was 16 inches. Brakes were double disc in front, drum in rear.|$|E

They found that sea bream from the three origins competed in an undifferentiated market, where price changes by one competitor were replicated by the others. The ex-farm prices of sea bream in Spain were partially affected by international competition, but retailers adjusted pricing according to farmers’ costs and also responded to consumer demand.

50|$|The {{speedometer}} drive mechanism operated {{from the rear}} wheel, with a long cable to the speedometer. This drive mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary chain tensioning bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear <b>chain</b> <b>adjusting</b> bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{case studies}} on {{supply chain management}} (SCM) in twelve Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry companies. The companies were recipients of Australian government assistance aimed at enhancing supply chain and global competitiveness in the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear and Leather (TCF&L) industry. The findings {{are similar to those}} in academic literature and government reports that an increased strategic and global focus by the supply chain needs to be supported by adequate information flow, appropriate value-adding processes, of suitable leading technology application and people-valuing and innovation-fostering company environment. Important too, for, company prosperity is continuous reduction of waste and cost. The findings further reflect the general instability of trading arrangements in the Australian TCF&L industry as companies, and hence the respective supply <b>chains,</b> <b>adjust,</b> not always with success, to global competition and a shrinking industry infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|We used {{scattering}} dichroism {{to study}} the combined effects of viscous and magnetic forces on the dynamics of dipolar chains induced in magnetorheological suspensions under rotating magnetic fields. We found that the <b>chains</b> <b>adjust</b> their size to rotate synchronously with the field but with a constant phase lag. Two different behaviors for the dichroism (proportional to {{the total number of}} aggregated particles) and the phase lag are found below or above a critical frequency. We obtained a linear dependence of the critical frequency with the square of the magnetization and with the inverse of the viscosity. The Mason number (ratio of viscous to magnetic forces) governs the dynamics. Therefore there is a critical Mason number below which, the dichroism remains almost constant and above which, the rotation of the field prevents the particle aggregation process from taken place being this the mechanism responsible for the decrease of dichroism. Our experimental results have been corroborated with particle dynamics simulations showing good agreement. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, submitted to JCI...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel multi-time-stage input-output-based modeling framework for simulating {{the dynamics of}} bioenergy supply chains. One of the key assumptions used in the model is that the production level at the next time-stage of each segment of the energy supply <b>chain</b> <b>adjusts</b> to the output surplus or deficit relative to targets at the current time period. Furthermore, unlike conventional input-output models, the technology matrix in this approach need not be square, and thus can include coefficients denoting flows of environmental goods, such as natural resources or pollutants. Introducing a feedback control term enables the system to regulate the dynamics, thus extending the model further. This is an important feature since the uncontrolled dynamic model exhibits oscillatory or unstable behavior under some conditions; in principle, the control term allows such undesirable characteristics to be suppressed. Numerical simulations of a simple, two-sector case study are given to illustrate dynamic behavior under different scenarios. Although the case study uses only a hypothetical system, preliminary comparisons are made between the simulation results and some broad trends seen in real bioenergy systems. Finally, {{some of the main}} policy implications of the model are discussed based on the general dynamic characteristics seen in the case study. In particular, insights from control theory can be used to develop policy interventions to impart desirable dynamic characteristics to nascent or emerging biofuel supply chains. These interventions can be used to guide the growth of bioenergy supplies along final demand trajectories with minimal fluctuation and no instability.

30|$|During {{the period}} of the ninth five-year {{national}} economic plan, with the cooperation of Zhangjiakou and Northwestern Coal Mining Equipment Manufactory, using CAD technology, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute developed the first scraper conveyors for LTCC face with retractable end <b>chain</b> <b>adjusting</b> device. They were the SGZ 960 / 750 front scraper conveyor and the SGZ 900 / 750 rear scraper conveyor, and also stage loader and crusher. The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 – 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front scraper conveyor and rear scraper conveyor. Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable rear scraper conveyor is an ultra-heavy scraper conveyor for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment hydraulic coupler and compact chain. In the 1990 s, its main specifications reached an advanced level accepted worldwide. The SGZ 1000 / 1200 front scraper conveyor is currently the largest front scraper conveyor, and can be integrated with various powerful shearers and hydraulic supports. Its installed power is 2  ×  600  kW. The development of the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 scraper conveyors enables not only the technical advance in scraper conveyor technology, but also in LTCC technology.|$|R
40|$|Economic {{subjects}} {{give more}} and more consideration to decisions connected to the measurement of performances and supply chain metrics. This paper explains the performances of categories within the supply chain which can be measured and according to that, influence on the continuous improvement of business processes. As the market is constantly changing, the supply <b>chain</b> <b>adjusts</b> to the fast changes thus ensuring a better position on the market. In order to be competitive and sustainable, economic subjects within the supply chain must {{also be able to}} adjust and quickly respond to the changes in their surroundings. Besides the presentation of the performances, measured in four categories (customer service, internal efficiency, demand flexibility and product development) and considered from a theoretical point of view, the paper also analyses the application of the same on concrete examples. The importance and the role of metrics results from the following: the measurement of performances gives a diagnosis of their current position, determines the future goals of all participants in the supply chain for the purpose of achieving greater efficiency in sum and furthermore, it gives the results which identify the current state of each individual category. It should be mentioned that the obtained results will also suggest the areas which can be improved and thus result in certain changes in the method of work. Economic subjects which think in accordance with the trends on the market will try not just {{to be a part of}} the supply chain in order to reduce business expenses and increase profit, but will also consider metrics as an important tool in supply chain management. supply chain, metrics, measurement of performances, efficiency of management...|$|R
