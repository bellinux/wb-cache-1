5000|$|Before the 1840s simple {{surface drains}} or covered drains {{were used in}} towns. Surface drains carried off surface water by making the road section higher in the centre than at the sides. The {{simplest}} form of <b>covered</b> <b>drain</b> was the box drain that had a broad flat bottom. These drains caused problems because it was common for the entire volume of the drain to be completely filled and blocked. Another type of <b>covered</b> <b>drain</b> was the circular or barrel drain. They were rarely used, as they were more expensive and less effective than box drains. With {{the development of the}} ovoid or [...] "egg-shaped" [...] drains there was a dramatic improvement in the effectiveness of drainage systems. John Phillips designed the first ovoid drain in the 1840s and advocated that in order to have proper drainage of towns, separate drainage systems should be used for stormwater and sewage. The ovoid drains concentrated the flow of the water {{to the bottom of the}} drain and therefore decreased the likelihood of silting and blockage. In the beginning, these drains were made of stone but by the 1870s they were mainly built of cheaper brick ...|$|E

Glynn argued that the sample came from soil contaminated by Pattee era sediments which intermixed with earlier sediments in the drain. This was one of two C-14 dates from this excavation.

40|$|My {{final year}} project {{is about to}} design and {{fabricate}} a home <b>drain</b> <b>cover.</b> Home <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> is important equipment because it protects and prevents someone from fall into the drain. Furthermore, the <b>drain</b> <b>cover</b> can help us to cross the drain easily. However, former home <b>drain</b> <b>covers</b> existing in the market do not have security features that can prevent any pets from come in through the front yard of the drain into our home area.

Waterfowl could be caught in the swamplands near Towra Point and the variety of soils supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants.
