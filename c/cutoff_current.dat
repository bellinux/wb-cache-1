40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{fabricate}} a low noise N-type Metal-Oxide- Semiconductor (NMOS) imager in the Grand Valley State University (GVSU) Cleanroom {{with a focus on}} reducing pixel dark current. Previous research suggests Photodiode (PD) shape affects dark current and charge transfer characteristics of the pixel. Five PD shapes were designed to determine an optimized pixel shape with respect to dark performance. PN junction PDs with the Three Transistor (3 T) pixel architecture were found to be the most suitable for imager fabrication in the GVSU cleanroom. The integrated circuit layout of several 8 x 8 pixel arrays was designed to test the influence of PD shape on dark current. The fabricated PDs exhibited dark current in the range of 9 - 18 uA/cm 2. The results indicate PDs with “rounder” geometry exhibit improved dark response; however, small saturation to <b>cutoff</b> <b>current</b> ratios prevented imager functionality. Improved charge transfer as a result of triangular PD shape was suggested but may have been masked by higher dark currents in these shapes. A low noise Voltage and Sample and Acquisition Controller (VSAC) was developed to capture the output from the imager die and transfer the data to a computer. The VSAC was designed for flexible timing and voltage control while exhibiting low noise. Analysis with a logic analyzer verified timing flexibility which allowed the integration, reset, and other control pulses to be optimized for the application. Reset voltage control circuitry allowed a wide range of analog voltages to be supplied to the imager reset transistors. This prevented image lag due to incomplete reset. The noise performance of the VSAC was characterized by sampling a known voltage and observing the output deviation. With an output voltage accuracy of 99 percent to the input signal and less than 3. 6 mVRMS output noise, the VSAC exhibited excellent low noise operation...|$|E

However, it is possible to improve existing tests by altering the cutoff value chosen to distinguish infected individuals from uninfected individuals.

A method of determining the financial gain from using the preferred rather than the <b>current</b> <b>cutoff</b> value and a decision analysis method to assist in determining the optimal cutoff value when critical population parameters are not known with certainty are demonstrated.

Dynamics of electrons and holes in the diode structure was cal-culated using a basic system of equations, including the equations of continuity for electrons and holes and the Poisson equation for electric field. The cal-culations were performed taking into account a real distribution of dopants in the structure, proc-esses of impact and tunnel generation, and mobil-ity-electric field relation. Both opening and closing switching processes have been studied. It is shown that in the opening switch regime the subnanosecond <b>current</b> <b>cutoff</b> stage {{with a time of}} about 700 ps is realized at p-n junction depth of ∼ 220 μm, forward pumping time less than 60 ns, reverse pumping time of about 10 – 15 ns, and re-verse current density of 1 – 10 kA/cm 2.

However, there is conflicting {{evidence about the}} impact of maternal work hours scheduled at nonstandard times (for example, evenings, nights or weekends), and no previous examination of paternal work schedules and child weight. We examined the associations between maternal, paternal and combined parental paid work schedules and overweight/obesity in children at age 9 years. METHODS: Data were analysed from the most recent follow-up of 9 -year-old children (n¼ 434) in an Australian birth cohort study. Children were measured and classified as overweight/obese using the International Obesity Taskforce body mass index <b>cutoff</b> points. <b>Current</b> working conditions of parents were obtained from a structured interview with the primary caregiver. Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the effect of parental work schedules on child overweight/obesity with adjustment for a range of sociodemographic and household factors associated with parental employment and child weight. RESULTS: At 9 years of age, 99 children (22. 8 %) were overweight or obese. When parental work schedules were examined separately, child overweight/obesity was significantly associated with paternal nonstandard work schedules (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1. 97, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 08 [...] 3. 61).

However, their reliability to predict other CMM (index tests) in young Mexicans has not been studied in depth. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study evaluating several anthropometric, physiological and biochemical CMM from 295 young Mexicans was performed. Sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and Youden’s index (J) of reference BMI/WC cutoffs toward other CMM (n[*]=[*] 14) were obtained and their most reliable cutoffs were further calculated at Jmax.

BMI explained 81  % of WC’s variance [Se (97  %), Sp (71  %), J (68  %), Jmax (86  %), BMI[*]=[*] 30 kg/m 2] and 4 – 50  % of other CMM. The five most prevalent (≥ 71  %) CMM in obese subjects were high WC, low HDL-C, and three insulin-related CMM [Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI]. For a BMI[*]=[*] 30 kg/m 2, J ranged from 16  % (HDL-C/LDL-C) to 68  % (WC), being moderately reliable (Jmax[*]=[*] 61 – 67) to predict high uric acid (UA), metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the hypertriglyceridemic-waist phenotype (HTGW). Corrected WCM/WCF were moderate-highly reliable (Jmax[*]=[*] 66 – 90) to predict HTGW, MetS, fasting glucose and UA. Most CMM were moderate-highly predicted at 27 [*]±[*] 3 kg/m 2 (CI 95  %, 25 – 28), 85 [*]±[*] 5 cm (CI 95  %, 82 – 88) and 81 [*]±[*] 6 cm (CI 95  %, 75 – 87), for BMI, WCM and WCF, respectively. Conclusion BMI and WC are good predictors of several CMM in the studied population, although at different <b>cutoffs</b> than <b>current</b> reference values...|$|R
