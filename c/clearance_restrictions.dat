40|$|Railway tunnel {{clearance}} {{is directly}} related to the safe operation of trains and upgrading of freight capacity. As more and more railway are put into operation and the operation is continuously becoming faster, the railway tunnel clearance inspection should be more precise and efficient. In view of the problems existing in traditional tunnel clearance inspection methods, such as low density, slow speed and a lot of manual operations, this paper proposes a tunnel clearance inspection approach based on 3 D point clouds obtained by a mobile laser scanning system (MLS). First, a dynamic coordinate system for railway tunnel clearance inspection has been proposed. A rail line extraction algorithm based on 3 D linear fitting is implemented from the segmented point cloud to establish a dynamic clearance coordinate system. Second, a method to seamlessly connect all rail segments based on the railway <b>clearance</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and a seamless rail alignment is formed sequentially from the middle tunnel section to both ends. Finally, based on the rail alignment and the track clearance coordinate system, different types of clearance frames are introduced for intrusion operation with the tunnel section to realize the tunnel clearance inspection. By taking the Shuanghekou Tunnel of the Chengdu–Kunming Railway as an example, when the clearance inspection is carried out by the method mentioned herein, its precision can reach 0. 03 m, and difference types of clearances can be effectively calculated.

40|$|Little or no {{evidence}} {{is available on}} the impact of the first peritonitis episode on peritoneal transport characteristics. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the importance of the very first peritonitis episode and distinguish its effect from the natural course by comparison of peritoneal transport before and after infection. We analyzed prospectively collected data from 541 incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, aged > 18 years, between 1990 and 2010. Standard Peritoneal Permeability Analyses (SPA) within the year before and within the year after (but not within 30 days) the first peritonitis were compared. In a control group without peritonitis, SPAs within the first and second year of PD were compared. SPA data included the mass transfer area coefficient of creatinine, glucose absorption and peritoneal clearances of β- 2 -microglobulin (b 2 m), albumin, IgG and α- 2 -macroglobulin (a 2 m). From these <b>clearances,</b> the <b>restriction</b> coefficient to macromolecules (RC) was calculated. Also, parameters of fluid transport were determined: transcapillary ultrafiltration rate (TCUFR), lymphatic absorption (ELAR), and free water transport. Crude and adjusted linear mixed models were used to compare the slopes of peritoneal transport parameters in the peritonitis group to the control group. Adjustments were made for age, sex and diabetes. Of 541 patients, 367 experienced a first peritonitis episode within a median time of 12 months after the start of PD. Of these, 92 peritonitis episodes were preceded and followed by a SPA within one year. Forty-five patients without peritonitis were included in the control group. Logistic reasons (peritonitis group: 48 % vs control group: 83 %) and switch to hemodialysis (peritonitis group: 22 % vs control group: 3 %) were the main causes of missing SPA data post-peritonitis and post-control. When comparing the slopes of peritoneal transport parameters in the peritonitis group and the control group, a first peritonitis episode was associated with faster small solute transport (glucose absorption, p = 0. 03) and a concomitant lower TCUFR (p = 0. 03). In addition, a discreet decrease in macromolecular transport was seen in the peritonitis group: mean difference in post- and pre-peritonitis values: IgG: - 8 μL/min (p = 0. 01), a 2 m: - 4 μL/min (p = 0. 02), albumin: - 10 μL/min (p = 0. 04). Accordingly, the RC to macromolecules increased after peritonitis: 0. 09, p = 0. 04. The very first peritonitis episode alters the natural course of peritoneal membrane characteristics. The most likely explanation might be that cured peritoneal infection later causes long-lasting alterations in peritoneal transport stat...|$|R
40|$|The rate of HIV- 1 {{replication}} has {{an impact}} on the viral loads patients have and the time it takes for an infection to progress to AIDS. This replication rate is defined partly by the time it takes an infected cell to begin producing new infectious virus, and this, in turn, is defined by the time required for each step of the viral life cycle inside cells. Many of the stages of the HIV- 1 life cycle have been well-characterized mechanistically, but the timing with which they occur has not. HIV- 1 is under strong pressure to replicate rapidly, yet evidence indicates that there are stages at which there is active viral auto-inhibition of the rate of replication. We therefore sought to characterize the timing of each major stage of the viral life cycle and to determine how they are correlated with one another. Using a variety of techniques including quantitative microscopy we tracked the timing of these events, both in bulk infected cultures and in single infected cells, and generated a time line of the HIV- 1 replication cycle. We find that there is a delay of about 11 hours between integration and gene expression, whereas early and late gene expression are separated by only about 3 hours. In addition we find that a critical event prior to assembly, the virus-directed removal of the host restriction factor APOBEC 3 G, takes place within 2. 5 hours following late gene expression. One of the major processes HIV- 1 must complete before it can produce new virions is the <b>clearance</b> of antiviral <b>restriction</b> factors that can block the production of new infectious virus. We present evidence in support of the hypothesis that the assembly and release of virions, which is inhibited by the presence of the MA domain of the Gag protein, is delayed precisely in order to allow <b>restriction</b> factor <b>clearance</b> to reach completion before the assembly process begins...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 This study {{examines}} the ecology and dynamics of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in environments experimentally altered by logging. The {{objective was to}} evaluate processes that stabilize or regulate the populations. Two small watersheds in Oregon's Coast Range were logged in 1966, one clear-cut, the other patch-cut. A third adjacent watershed was left uncut as a control. The influence of these treatments on the biology of the coho was assessed. Attention was concentrated on populations of the six year classes 1963 to 1968. The natural variability of streamflow-related conditions influencing both the magnitude and pattern of coho recruitment each year was increased in the logged watersheds. Peak flow during storms increased; intragravel dissolved oxygen levels decreased in the stream draining the clear-cut watershed. These changes, however, were apparently {{within the range of}} variation that the coho naturally experience. Increased stream temperatures and mortalities, due to the logging effects, altered the post-recruitment life conditions of the coho in that stream but did not significantly affect the final smolt yield. The nocturnal behavior of recently emerged fry leads to recruitment along the stream length. Fry tend to emerge en masse from the redds at night, and large numbers proceed immediately to disperse downstream. This migration continues for several successive nights, beginning each night soon after dark. Evidence is presented indicating that fry emigration is primarily a dispersal mechanism that distributes fry from redd sites to nursery areas. It is hypothesized that the series of events leading from fry dispersal to be quiescent behavior at night, characteristic of resident fry, is a developmental sequence involving the physiology and maturity of the fry, modified by agonistic activity. Adjustments in coho population size were largely accomplished by fall, resulting in stable and characteristic population levels in each stream. A stable smolt yield was a further result. These adjustments are accomplished through high mortality during the months of the first spring and summer. This mortality is likely density dependent and related to the territorial and agonistic behavior of the fish. Growth, biomass, and net production varied greatly during each year. Seasonal changes in growth rate resulted in seasonal variations in biomass that were in contrast to the stabilized trends of population number. The pattern of net production rate was also largely determined by the seasonal growth pattern, and like biomass, did not show: a tendency to stabilize with time. It averaged 5 g/m² among the three streams for the period June 1 to April 15. The coho populations seem naturally regulated most importantly with respect to number. The patterns of biomass and rate of net production may be understood as an interaction of seasonally variable growth rate with stabilizing population numbers. This study has shown that coho streams normally produce characteristic levels of smolt yield in spite of large natural variations in fry input and conditions for growth. The range of environmental variation for which this result holds may include short-term changes due to logging. However a normal population response to such a severe alteration as occurred on Needle Branch is very likely conditional upon a program that at least includes vigorous stream <b>clearance,</b> the <b>restriction</b> of additional mortality to early summer, when population adjustments are far from complete, and the encouragement of streamside revegetation. A streamside buffer strip of trees is an effective way of protecting aquatic resources...|$|R
