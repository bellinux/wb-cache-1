5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the <b>conceptus</b> or to participate in transplacental transport.|$|E

The ratio of live males to females at birth (normal, 107 males to 100 females) is apparently reduced with abdominal pregnancy to as low as 60 males to 100 females (as reported by Masukume) because males {{are more likely to}} die in harsh environments (for example in abdominal pregnancy) compared to females.|$|E

2500|$|The {{gestation}} period lasts for about eleven months, or about 340 days (normal average range 320–370 days). During {{the early days}} of pregnancy, the <b>conceptus</b> is mobile, moving about in the uterus until about day 16 when [...] "fixation" [...] occurs. Shortly after fixation, the embryo proper (so called up to about 35 days) will become visible on trans-rectal ultrasound (about day 21) and a heartbeat should be visible by about day 23. After the formation of the endometrial cups and early placentation is initiated (35–40 days of gestation) the terminology changes, and the embryo is referred to as a fetus. True implantation - invasion into the endometrium of any sort - does not occur until about day 35 of pregnancy with the formation of the endometrial cups, and true placentation (formation of the placenta) is not initiated until about day 40-45 and not completed until about 140 days of pregnancy. The fetus sex can be determined by day 70 of the gestation using ultrasound. Halfway through gestation the fetus is the size of between a rabbit and a beagle. The most dramatic fetal development occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy when 60% of fetal growth occurs.|$|E

6000|$|In a {{preceding}} page I have {{justified the}} use of technical terms in philosophy, whenever they tend to preclude confusion of thought, and when they assist the memory by the exclusive singleness of their meaning more than they may, for a short time, bewilder the attention by their strangeness. I trust, that I have not extended this privilege beyond the grounds on which I have claimed it; namely, the conveniency of the scholastic phrase to distinguish the kind from all degrees, or rather to express the kind with the abstraction of degree, as for instance multeity instead of multitude; or secondly, {{for the sake of}} correspondence in sound in interdependent or antithetical terms, as subject and object; or lastly, to avoid the wearying recurrence of circumlocutions and definitions. Thus I shall venture to use potence, in order to express a specific degree of a power, in imitation of the Algebraists. I have even hazarded the new verb potenziate, with its derivatives, in order to express the combination or transfer of powers. It is with new or unusual terms, as with privileges in courts of justice or legislature; there can be no legitimate privilege, where there already exists a positive law adequate to the purpose; and when there is no law in existence, the privilege is to be justified by its accordance with the end, or final cause, of all law. Unusual and new- coined words are doubtless an evil; but vagueness, confusion, and imperfect conveyance of our thoughts, are a far greater. Every system, which is under the necessity of using terms not familiarized by the metaphysics in fashion, will be described as written in an unintelligible style, and the author must expect the charge of having substituted learned jargon for clear conception; while, according to the creed of our modern philosophers, nothing is deemed a clear conception, but what is representable by a distinct image.

5000|$|Use of {{the terms}} preembryo and proembryo, {{in the context of}} human development, has drawn {{criticism}} from opponents of embryo research, and from scientists who have considered this categorization invalid or unnecessary. [...] One rationale that has been advanced for distinguishing an early fertilized human <b>conceptus</b> from an embryo {{is that there is a}} potential for the <b>conceptus</b> to split into identical twins prior to implantation, and so (the argument goes) the <b>conceptus</b> cannot be regarded before implantation as a single human being. However, the <b>conceptus</b> before implantation exhibits self-actuated activity, which has led to the assertion that it is an embryo. Further, identical twinning is an instance of asexual reproduction whereby a <b>conceptus,</b> without ceasing to be what it is (a new human being), provides a cell or cells as a new <b>conceptus,</b> entirely separated or partially separated (a 'siamese' twin) from the original <b>conceptus,</b> but in any event self-actuated in its development from the moment that the act of asexual reproduction (twinning) is complete.

40|$|Abstract Background Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) {{were first}} described for {{their roles in}} bone formation, but they now also are known to possess additional activities, including those relating to embryogenesis. The objectives of this work were to 1) determine if peri-attachment bovine <b>conceptuses</b> and bovine trophoblast cells (CT 1) contain transcripts for BMP 2 and 4, an innate inhibitor noggin (NOG), and BMP 2 / 4 receptors (BMPRII, ACVR 1, BMPR 1 A, BMPR 1 B), and 2) determine if BMP 2 or 4 supplementation to CT 1 cells affects cell proliferation, differentiation or trophoblast-specific gene expression. Methods RNA was isolated from day 17 bovine <b>conceptuses</b> and CT 1 cells. After RT-PCR, amplified products were cloned and sequenced. In other studies CT 1 cells were treated with BMP 2 or 4 at various concentrations and effects on cell viability, cell differentiation and abundance of IFNT and CSH 1 mRNA were evaluated. Results Transcripts for BMP 2 and 4 were detected in bovine <b>conceptuses</b> and CT 1 cells. Also, transcripts for each BMP receptor were detected in <b>conceptuses</b> and CT 1 cells. Transcripts for NOG were detected in <b>conceptuses</b> but not CT 1 cells. Cell proliferation was reduced by BMP 4 but not BMP 2 supplementation.

40|$|The {{question}} of how exposure to dioxins might affect only males and why it affects preferentially male embryos in the Seveso data presented by Mocarelli et al. remains intriguing. This enigma {{can be explained by}} the ovopathy concept, which addresses the determination of both the sex and the condition of the progeny. Antiandrogenic properties of dioxin alter the sperm-transit time and mating behavior, which provoke delay of fertilization of the oocyte (postovulatory overripeness of the oocyte). Antiestrogenic properties of dioxin during mid-cycle compromise both mucus liquefaction and maturation of the oocyte (preovulatory overripeness ovopathy).

Low levels of protein-S-SG (25. 0 ± 6. 6 pmoles resolved GSH/conceptus) were found in <b>conceptuses</b> under normal culture conditions. Incubation of the <b>conceptuses</b> with 75 - 500 ΜM diamide (a thiol oxidant) resulted in rapid increases in protein-S-SG (to 2 - to 16 - fold that of control values) in a dose-dependent manner during 30 min of the culture period. Approximately 20 % of the observed cytosolic glutathione (GSH) depletion following diamide (500 ΜM) could be accounted for as mixed disulfides of protein sulfhydryls, when determined in whole conceptual tissues after 15 min. The most extensive S-thiolation of protein sulfhydryls by GSH was observed in visceral yolk sac (VYS) when compared to embryo proper and ectoplacental cone. This result indicates that the most abundant, sensitive, or accessible protein sulfhydryls {{were found in the}} VYS. Inhibition of glutathione disulfide reductase activity by pretreatment of the <b>conceptuses</b> with 25 ΜM BCUN for 2 hr potentiated protein-S-SG formation elicited by 75 ΜM diamide. Reincubation of the <b>conceptuses</b> in fresh media, following the 15 -min treatment with 500 ΜM diamide, reversed both the GSH depletion and the protein-S-SG formation in conceptal tissues. The reduction of the protein-S-SG was dependent on adequate intracellular GSH levels and was inhibited when GSH was rapidly depleted by subsequent addition of N -ethylmaleimide (NEM, 100 ΜM). Under the same experimental conditions, addition of 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) did not significantly enhance the GSH restoration rate nor the protein-S-SG reduction rate.
