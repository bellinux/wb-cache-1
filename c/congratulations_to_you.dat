On 1September, he destroyed a Bf109 and damaged two others during the Battle of Alam el Halfa, east of El Alamein. He claimed No.3 Squadron's 200th victim, a Bf109F, during the Battle of El Alamein on 28October. [...] Air Marshal Sir Peter Drummond, Deputy Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Middle East, sent him a signal reading [...] "Heartiest <b>congratulations</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and all ranks in the squadron on the achievement of your double century—not out". Around this time Gibbes also managed to fly Bf109F and G fighters captured from the Germans, and came away impressed. He was credited with another Bf109 on 17 November. On 21December, he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near Hun, Libya, to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down. Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his passenger and lost part of his undercarriage taking off, necessitating a one-wheeled landing back at base. Recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action, he was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Order, which was promulgated on 15January 1943 and cited his [...] "outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm". Gibbes himself crash landed behind enemy lines on 14January 1943, walking [...] in the desert before being {{picked up by a}} British Army patrol. He was awarded a bar to his DFC for this feat, and for his [...] "exceptional leadership, skill and courage, contributing in a large measure {{to the success of the}} squadron he commands".

5000|$|Mr. President, I {{have the}} honour {{to take the}} floor today {{on behalf of a}} diverse group of 42 {{developing}} countries from Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, who are united by a common cause - to achieve lasting and comprehensive reforms of the UN Security Council.Our Group is bound by the firm conviction that expansion in both the permanent and non-permanent categories of membership of the Security Council is imperative to better reflect contemporary world realities, and achieve a more accountable, representative, transparent and more importantly a 'relevant' Security Council. Let me first express our Group’s <b>congratulations</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on your election as the new Chair of the Intergovernmental Negotiation Process. Your appointment is a most welcome development as it brings not only fresh leadership but, hopefully, innovative ideas to what has been largely a stalled process. Mr. President,In your letter of 16 January by which you invited us to this meeting, you have identified the purpose of this meeting as providing member states with an “opportunity to exchange ideas on how to best structure our work in advance of the resumption of the IGN”.While we do believe that it is entirely the prerogative of the Chair of the IGN to decide on how he would like to structure the sessions of the IGN, it is indeed a very nice gesture on your part to have involved the member states in that process. Without elaborating on the substance of the positions held with respect to the question of UN Security Reform per se, and in the spirit with which this invitation was made to the member states, the L.69 Group would like to offer the following suggestions regarding the best way of structuring our work in the upcoming round of negotiations:One, The IGN was mandated to commence 'text-based negotiations' right from its very inception. The Chair at that time wanted this explicit assurance from member states themselves and to that end more than 138 countries, way more than two-thirds majority, made a formal and written submission to the Chair in 2009 asking him to table a negotiation text, in his capacity as Chair of the IGN process, which could then serve as a basis for our discussions. So, the mandate from {{more than two-thirds of the}} membership has already been granted thus making way for you to do what is the only logical next-step to move this process forward. Two, What is put inside that text is entirely at the discretion of the Chair, indeed it is your prerogative, provided that it is merely a starting point that is not be cast in stone but open to suggestions, amendments and edits from the floor. This will allow for the commencement of actual line by line and para by para negotiations. Such an approach should give those delegations who are concerned about omissions and positions not reflected as intended the assurance that the negotiation text is an evolving document with the flexibility to accommodate constructive views. Three, We propose that there should be a fixed schedule of meetings, commencing no later than the end of this month, whereby we can discuss each clause of the negotiation text, cluster by cluster, as was enunciated in UNGA Decision 62/557. Four, We must be very clear of our end objective while structuring the next steps. It cannot be an interminable process. The objective of this IGN process would be like all other Intergovernmental Processes which gradually narrow down the points of differences by arriving at what should be, ideally, a least bracketed text with the maximum possible convergences of opinions, as far as possible. Five, This is of particular importance! Because this year is a landmark year in the history of the United Nations, and if the United Nations is to be made “fit for purpose”, then its fitness for purpose should begin from its premier arm --- the UN Security Council. All our Heads of States and Governments unanimously called for “early reforms” way back in 2005 and expected a report on their collective call by the end of that session of the GA. However, ten years hence, we are yet to report back to them on what have we achieved. We must correct this for the 70th Anniversary Summit and we must ensure that we have an outcome to show to our leaders when they meet later this year. Mr. President, these, in a nutshell, are a few of our key submissions for your consideration. But before I conclude, please allow me to also flag a couple of other issues that may pose a challenge in building the momentum that you are trying to give to this process.One such issue is the often repeated call for “consensus to emerge even before the commencement of negotiations” as a pre-condition for beginning text-based negotiations. It is simply an anti-reform position, which suits only the interests of a limited minority of naysayers. No other process in the United Nations has ever been held back for complete consensus to be established before the Chair tables his zero draft. We, therefore, hope that you would choose to go by what Chairs are normally supposed to do and based on the mandate of the task assigned. In this case, the mandate given to you from the President of the General Assembly is very clear. H.E. Sam Kutesa, has on more than one occasion, emphasized the imperative of moving to text-based negotiations as the next logical step and has empowered you to proceed on that basis.Second, it is possible that there may be retrogressive calls asking for us to go back to Rev-2, a compilation dated in 2011. We would like to raise the point that the position of the L.69 Group to fully support the African Common Position is only reflected in the Rev-3 and not Rev-2, and therefore such calls would be tantamount to holding a veto over other Groups positions, which would be inimical and counterproductive to the process. In addition, the Revs remain a compilation text at best, a compendium of all existing positions, repeated several times over, and therefore, cannot be a substitute for a negotiation text. To conclude, we welcome this invitation to hear our views on structuring your work forward. You also are well aware that, barring one group, everyone in this room is on the same page with respect to offering ideas. However, we do hope that when it comes to making that decision on which ideas you chose to go by, you make a decision that is pragmatic and reflective of the majority.The L69 Group is committed to playing its part in ensuring your success, and we look forward to receiving a Chair’s proposal for a negotiation text at the first meeting of the IGN later this month. I thank you, Mr. President. Ambassador Inga Rhonda King, on Behalf of the L.69 Group, 11 February 2015 ...|$|E
