5|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person {{perspective}} {{and most of its}} levels are navigated on foot. The story is arranged in chapters, which players complete in order to progress. A morality choice in the prologue alters the game's entire storyline; some characters and small plot points are replaced throughout the timelines. The game features a variety of weapons, most of which can be dual wielded. A <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> is also present.|$|E
5|$|The game's <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> allows {{players to}} move between cover, to fire blindly, aim freely, and target a {{specific}} enemy. Individual body parts {{can also be}} targeted. Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. Body armour {{can be used to}} absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn at the nearest hospital.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Mass Effect is squad-based and two squad members {{accompany}} the {{player on the}} battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different talent abilities for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and features a <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> which allows players to strategically hide behind objects while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue orders to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind an object, scout ahead, regroup, or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
40|$|Soil <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> are {{routinely}} {{used to reduce}} acid rock drainage (ARD) from mine waste rock dumps and tailings impoundments. A technology for the analysis, design, instrumentation and monitoring of barrier-type (oxygen limiting) and store/release type covers has rapidly developed {{and the number of}} covers under construction has grown extensively during the past ten years. Mine operators are currently investing in this relatively new technology with the expectation that these covers will reduce long-term liability with respect to acid generation, drainage and treatment costs. While the design life for <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> may extend into hundreds of years, we have less than ten years of construction experience and proven performance. Some cover designs appear to be functioning well; however, the performance of many more is now being called into question. The paper presented herein evaluates the integrity of <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> from a global perspective. Soil <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> for the control of ARD are being constructed at mine sites located within high rainfall equatorial regions, deserts ranging from low to high latitude, humid temperate regions, and cold-continental climates. While the technology for analysis and design of soil <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> is well developed, factors that compromise the performance of <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> (in addition to the paramount issue of climate) relate to material selection and availability, cost and experience. Long-term performance is also strongly affected by physical stability (ie erosion), volume change (ie cracking, desiccation, settlement and freeze/thaw cycling), vegetation, soil evolution and ecological stability. This paper provides a review of the application of soil <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> for the control of ARD. Cases where <b>cover</b> <b>systems</b> have been constructed with both success and failure are illustrated. General criteria and recommendations for cover selection, design, construction, and maintenance are provided...|$|R

5|$|Perfect Dark Zero is a first-person shooter where players {{control the}} player {{character}} mostly from a first-person perspective. The combat features mechanics {{such as an}} evasive dodge roll and a <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> in which the gameplay switches to a third-person perspective, allowing the player to strategically aim without taking damage and be {{more aware of the}} surroundings. Players cannot jump but have the ability to automatically climb obstacles {{as long as they can}} reasonably reach them. It is also possible to climb ladders. By doing so, the camera shifts into a third-person perspective. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. The health can recharge a bit if the player steps out of the line of fire for a few seconds, but it may not necessarily refill completely depending on how much damage the player took.|$|E
5|$|Sunset Overdrive {{is an open}} world third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One. It was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, and released worldwide in October 2014. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any <b>cover</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players have the option to skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. Players can also ask the partner for directions. In addition to storyline cases, players may engage in an optional 40 side-investigations, known as Street Crimes, that are not related to the case that they are working on. Some street crimes will feature characters from previous cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} {{fight with a}} knife {{received}} {{early in the game}} and later with firearms that feature auto-aim. There are also sequences where the player can snipe enemies with a sniper rifle. Enemies do not hide {{due to a lack of}} a <b>cover</b> <b>system.</b> The player can earn money by finishing missions and robbing pedestrians, which can then be used to buy food, weaponry, spray paint, and accessories for the character's home. The mobile game features minigames for robbing pedestrians, stealing, and hijacking vehicles. While robbing, the player taps happy and angry face icons to terrorize the victim into giving more money. When stealing, a Tetris clone lets the player fit more items into the truck, and the carjacking minigame lets the player earn more money for scaring the captive passenger by driving at high speeds.|$|E
5|$|A <b>cover</b> <b>system</b> {{can be used}} {{in combat}} as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us Remastered changes {{little from}} the basic {{gameplay}} {{of the original}} version. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a <b>cover</b> <b>system.</b> For most of the game, players control Joel; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence. Remastered uses the DualShock 4's touchpad to navigate inventory items, and the light bar signals health, scaling from blue to orange and red when taking damage. In addition, audio recordings found in the game world can be heard through the controller's speaker; the original version forced players to remain in a menu while the recordings were played. The game's Photo Mode allows players to capture images of the game by pausing gameplay and adjusting the camera freely. In the menu, players {{have the ability to}} watch all cutscenes with audio commentary featuring creative director Neil Druckmann, Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Joel and Ellie, respectively.|$|E

5|$|The Last of Us: Left Behind {{is similar}} to the basic {{gameplay}} of The Last of Us. As such, it is an action-adventure survival horror game that uses a third-person perspective. The game involves gunfights, melee combat and a <b>cover</b> <b>system.</b> Players control Ellie. An added feature in combat is the ability to focus the attention of the Infected towards human enemies, by throwing objects to distract them. This results in a lower number of enemies to encounter, giving players a tactical advantage. Throughout the game, players encounter locations and activities around the mall, such as a carousel, photo booth, video arcade, mask store and water guns. All of these locations and activities have some level of interactivity, allowing players to use them in different ways; for example, the photo booth allows players to select different mannerisms in which to pose for a picture, while using the water guns prompts players to soak Riley.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the <b>cover</b> <b>system,</b> lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although {{they may not be able}} to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E

To progress through the linear story, players take on enemies throughout levels. The game features interactive cutscenes which transition seamlessly into continuing gameplay; there are no loading screens across gameplay and cutscenes.|$|E
25|$|According to Rod Fergusson, {{the game}} was at one point {{intended}} to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers, Resident Evil 4 and Kill Switch. A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from Resident Evil 4 and the tactical-cover system from Kill Switch; Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commandos influence on the <b>cover</b> <b>system,</b> equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of swinging from platform to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, including its storytelling and world-building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments. The game's title itself is a homage to Metal Gear, an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total cost of development was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and only 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. The game also includes a content filter, which will turn off the blood and gore, and the usage of profanity. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3.|$|E
