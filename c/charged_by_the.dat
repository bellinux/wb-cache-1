5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar ball is <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one ball is <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A {{solution was to}} build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E
5|$|By 26, {{the emperor}} had {{withdrawn}} from politics altogether {{and moved to}} Capri, leaving {{the management of the}} empire to Sejanus who then began eliminating other members of the imperial family. In 28/29, Nero was <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Senate with homosexuality for which he was exiled to the island of Ponza. Germanicus' son Drusus was imprisoned within the dungeon under the Imperial palace on the Palatine Hill, where he starved to death not long after. Nero died in exile in 33.|$|E

5|$|Costa scored his tenth goal of {{the league}} season to give Chelsea a 2–1 win away to Liverpool on 8 November, {{preserving}} their unbeaten start to the campaign. In January, Costa was <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> FA {{in relation to a}} stamp on Emre Can during Chelsea's win over Liverpool in the League Cup semi-finals, and was given a three-match ban.

5|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad was {{completed}} between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in 1854. During the 1880s, the South Pennsylvania Railroad was proposed {{to compete with}} the Pennsylvania. It received the backing of William Henry Vanderbilt, head of the New York Central Railroad (the Pennsylvania's chief rival). Andrew Carnegie also provided financial support, since he was unhappy with rates <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Railroad. Construction began on the rival line in 1883, but stopped when the railroads reached an agreement in 1885. After construction halted, the only vestiges of the South Pennsylvania were nine tunnels, some roadbed and piers for a bridge over the Susquehanna River in Harrisburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{highlights}} of the match included the sending-off of Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira for a second bookable offence, for an incident that also brought about a booking for Manchester United centre-forward Ruud van Nistelrooy, and the decision by referee Steve Bennett to award Manchester United a penalty kick in the last minute of the match. Players from both teams were <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>The</b> Football Association (the FA) for their reactions {{at the end of}} the game, five Arsenal players and two Manchester United players were forced to pay fines.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Sharif Hussein, {{trying to}} garner {{support for his}} planned {{uprising}} against the Ottomans, sent his son Faisal to Damascus to lobby the Syrian notables on his behalf. Faisal, a member of al-Fatat himself, met secretly {{with other members of}} the society, including Quwatli, in the house of Nasib al-Bakri. When the Ottoman authorities learned of the meeting, they ordered the arrest of al-Bakri and his two brothers, Fawzi and Sami, accusing them of treason. Quwatli was <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> al-Fatat leadership with the task of facilitating their escape, in which he succeeded. In retaliation, Ottoman authorities placed him under arrest, in which he was subjected to torture and humiliation. Nevertheless, Quwatli refused to confess to anything, and his captors failed to implicate him in the operation so they released him a month later. The tremendous pressure of that experience, however, took its toll on the young Quwatli, and upon his release he retired to his country house in Saidnaya and stopped all contacts with members of al-Fatat and the opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after the bank and three of its employees were <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

5|$|LOCOG faced further {{criticism}} for how it handled {{the sale of}} tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas {{was replaced by a}} dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1944, Göth was {{relieved}} {{of his position}} and <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Administration of the camp at Płaszów {{was turned over to}} SS-Obersturmführer Arnold Büscher. Göth was scheduled for an appearance before SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, but due to the progress of World War II and Germany's looming defeat, the charges against him were dropped in early 1945. SS doctors diagnosed Göth as suffering from mental illness, and he was committed to a mental institution in Bad Tölz, where he was arrested by the United States military in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of a small hill on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view {{at the end of the}} ravine, they were <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E

5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation. The chrysalis eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and Terran genetics. Raynor, drawn to Char by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} protect his retreat, Archduke Charles of Austria reunited his entire cavalry reserve, 44 squadrons in all, {{on either side of}} the Ratisbon road, next to the village of Eggolsheim. Between 19:00 20:00 in the evening, Napoleon ordered his cavalry to {{disperse}} the enemy horse from this position. In preparation of the charge, Nansouty formed five of his regiments in two lines: three regiments in the first line and two in the second line, leaving his remaining regiment with Saint-Sulpice. Saint-Sulpice's division was on Nansouty's right and it remained formed in regiment column formations, while the light cavalry was protecting the flanks of the whole. In all, the French had 48 squadrons, and, as they advanced, they were met by intense artillery fire from the Austrian batteries and then vigorously <b>charged</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Gottesheim cuirassier regiment. Seeing the enemy charging, Nansouty ordered his squadrons forward towards the enemy, but at a gentle trot. Then, as soon as the Austrians were at about one hundred paces, the frontline regiment of Carabiniers-à-Cheval halted, loaded their carbines and fired a salvo from thirty or forty paces, then drew their swords and joined their fellow cuirassiers in an energetic charge. As Nansouty led, Saint-Sulpice followed and, despite the vigour and determination of the Austrian cavalry, they were repulsed after a brief hand-to-hand combat. Coming in support of the Gottesheim Cuirassiers, the Kaiser Cuirassier regiment shared the same fate, with the Stipsicz Hussars and Vincent Chevau-légers also repulsed. A generalised and bloody mêlée then occurred under the moonlight, with the sabre hits on the steel cuirasses producing sparkles in the night. Austrian General Andreas von Schneller was wounded during this action and General Karl Wilhelm von Stutterheim, commanding the entire Austrian cavalry, only just escaped capture. The Austrian cavalry was repulsed and pushed into the marshes beyond, subsequently retreating towards Köfering, with the bulk of Archduke Charles's forces retreating towards Ratisbon.|$|E
