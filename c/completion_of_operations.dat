Eisenhower on 13 February 1945 had told his two American army group commanders—Generals Omar Bradley and Jacob L. Devers—to begin {{planning}} for a joint drive to sweep the Saar-Palatinate. Assigned a target date of 15 March, the offensive was to begin only after the 21st Army Group had reached the Rhine. It was to be designed both to draw enemy units from the north and to provide an alternate line of attack across the Rhine should the principal Allied drive in the north fail. The main effort, SHAEF planners contemplated, was to be made by the Sixth Army Group's Seventh Army, which was to be augmented by transferring one armored and three infantry divisions from the U.S. Third Army.|$|E

After successful <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> in Kohat, the Battalion was tasked to occupy, a very important, yet difficult piquet on the Spin Ghara Ridge near Kotkai. In the consequent onslaught by Mashuds on 2 Jan 1920, the Company Commander, Lt WD Kenny held his piquet under heavy fire and waves of fanatic tribals. The company suffered quite a few casualties. When the piquet was finally ordered to withdraw, the party was continuously ambushed thus, resulting in further casualties. Lt Kenny, though badly wounded, helped in evacuation of his men while giving bold battle to the tribals till he eventually collapsed and succumbed. For his conspicuous bravery against overwhelming numbers of Mahsuds, Lt WD Kenny was posthumously awarded the third Victoria Cross. The famous Spin Ghara Ridge was renamed and was subsequently remembered as ‘The Garhwali Ridge’.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} most {{high-level}} synthesis efforts {{to date has}} been at the level of a single behavioral model represented as a control/data-flow graph. The communication between concurrently executing processes and its requirements in terms of timing and resources have largely been neglected.

This paper describes a methodology for the synthesis of interfaces in concurrent systems under detailed timing constraints. We model inter-process communication using blocking and nonblocking messages. We show how the relationship between messages over time can be abstracted as a constraint graph that can be extracted and used during synthesis.

40|$|Our work is {{concerned}} with the scheduling problem for medium sized (5 - 10 machines or workplaces) flexible manufacturing systems which are part of a larger production process. A two-layer control structure for the overall control problem is considered. The general philosophy is to divide the scheduling problem into a number of local decentralized problems: the optimal sequencing and routing of the jobs within flexible manufacturing system or small workshops. The subsystems are coordinated by an upper level scheduler. It assignes the due dates for the <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> in the subsystems and determines the earliest possible starting times from the dependencies among the operations and the externally determined starting conditions. The predominant goal of the local on-line scheduling algorithms must be the minimization of the lateness of the local jobs, despite the inevitable disturbing factors. The better this goal is achieved (under the restriction of efficient use of the availab le ressources), the easier is the coordination of the subsystems. We therefore investigate in this paper the behaviour of local on-line scheduling algorithms. The local control laws are based on priority rules augmented by look-ahead strategies. Their effectivity is compared for a real-world example...|$|E

40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{of renewable}} resources from an operations scheduling viewpoint is introduced, and a harvesting scenario arising {{in the agricultural}} context involving a commercial contracting enterprise that travels from farm-to-farm harvesting crops is discussed. This paper {{is an extension of}} previous work by two of the authors from the one-farm to the multi-farm case. In both cases, the duration of each operation is dependent upon the combination of constrained resources allocated to it, equipment and worker allocation is restricted, and minimum or maximum time lags on the start and <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> may be imposed. The present case incorporates harvesting at more than one farm and thus the sequence in which the farms are visited and the inter-farm travel times must be taken into account. We report on a harvesting scheduling model and solution procedures designed specifically for large-scale versions of the multi-farm case. The computational times experienced in solving general instances of the model of small-to-medium practical size by a commercial integer programming package are encouraging. Greedy and tabu search heuristics, which are capable of solving problems of relatively large dimensions in reasonable computational time are also included.

40|$|The Savannah River Site {{is part of}} the U. S. Department of Energy complex. It was {{constructed}} during the early 1950 s to produce basic materials (such as plutonium- 239 and tritium) used in the production of nuclear weapons. The 310 -square-mile site is located in South Carolina, about 12 miles south of Aiken, South Carolina, and about 15 miles southeast of Augusta, Georgia. Savannah River Site (SRS) has approximately 200 facilities identified as inactive. These facilities range in size and complexity from large nuclear reactors to small storage buildings. These facilities are located throughout the site including three reactor areas, the heavy water plant area, the manufacturing area, and other research and support areas. Unlike DOE Closure Sites such as Hanford and Rocky Flats, SRS is a Project Completion Site with continuing missions. As facilities complete their defined mission, they are shutdown and transferred from operations to the facility disposition program. At the SRS, Facilities Decontamination and Decommissioning (FDD) personnel manage the disposition phase of a inactive facility's life cycle in a manner that minimizes life cycle cost without compromising (1) the health or safety of workers and the public or (2) the quality of the environment.

The CAMU follows recent regulatory guidance that allows for cost-effective, expedient cleanup of contaminated sites and management of hazardous remediation wastes. The CAMU was designed to store, treat, and provide long-term management for Environmental Restoration (ER) derived wastes. The 154 square meter CAMU site at Sandia National Laboratories, New Mexico (SNL/NM), includes facilities for storing bulk soils and containerized wastes, for treatment of bulk soils, and has a containment cell for long-term disposition of waste. Proposed treatment operations include soil washing and low temperature thermal desorption. The first waste was accepted into the CAMU for temporary storage in January 1999. Construction at the CAMU was completed in March 1999, and baseline monitoring of the containment cell has commenced. At <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> the facility will be closed, the waste containment cell will be covered, and long-term post-closure monitoring will begin.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Degree of Master of Business of Administration in Information TechnologyIn the Port of Colombo 65 % of the container business depends on transshipment. As such {{it is very important}} to understand the key factors that promote customer satisfaction and productivity, because unsatisfied customers may change their operational base for transshipment to other more attractive ports or terminals in the region following the recent developments in the ports in the Indian subcontinent. / The <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> for a container vessel within a planned period is one of the prime requirements that the customer expects from the terminal operators, which otherwise will cost them heavy expenditure. Two main reasons for the failure to achieve the above objective are the non-availability of container handling cranes, which may occur suddenly in the midst of operations, and low productivity resulting from various other causes such as breakdowns or faults, accidents, planning problems, weather conditions and so on. In this scenario, ICT systems used in container- handling equipment play a major role, since ICT systems installed in the crane will help to solve many of the problems mentioned above. / In this research the main objectives are to find out the relationship between the ICT level used in container handling cranes and the availability of such cranes and also how ICT systems are used to improve productivity of the quay cranes. The results of the research will help to take strategic decisions on the future procurement of cargo handling equipment. Further this will also give an indication for the replacement of old cranes with state of the art new equipment. / Most of the developed ports in the world use ICT systems in almost every segment in the cargo export and import processes and they continue to invest on further improvements. But we are still reluctant to use, and less prepared for it, although customers demand more from the seaports and the terminal operators.

40|$|The {{focus of}} mining project {{feasibility}} studies and operations {{is still on}} short-term profitability with little view to a post-closure landscape and liability. The faults of both the original and the operation’s mine planners are therefore vested upon the closure teams who must deal with these planning decisions. Following <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> <b>operations,</b> most mining companies that have not adequately prepared for mine closure will face an inability to relinquish their project leases {{as a result of}} closure planning process shortfalls. Following from our own closure project experiences and of recent international mine closure conferences, we propose seven key lessons still to be learned if successful mine closure is to be achieved. Firstly, a paucity of baseline environmental monitoring data often incapacitates good closure planning from the outset with a failure to understand key closure risks and risk drivers for the site. Well-characterised environmental information prior to mining disturbance and monitored progressive rehabilitation is a great strategy to address this fault. An insufficient understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics and volumes of waste materials is a second critical fault of closure processes. A third significant issue is contaminated mine waters such as acid and metalliferous drainage (AMD). AMD is arguably one of the single biggest liabilities and management issue post-closure. Failure to engage stakeholders in a documented process is a fourth prime failing often seen with the fifth of mine closure procrastination. Like all of these causes, this problem often arises from thinking mine closure is an activity at end of life-of-mine rather than as a process that begins with the initial mine plan and then regularly continues throughout mine life. Diligent attention to regular planning assessment and stakeholder consultation from an early operational phase may fend off later criticisms, lead to closure outcomes better directed by years of underpinning work and also reduce end of mine costs. A sixth significant closure planning error is the failure to account for the long temporal scales that closure planning must accommodate, particularly so when costing closure. This failure is often due to closure views being short-term, to meet immediate regulatory and operational planning needs rather than focussed on the future. A seventh lesson from historic closure planning is the simple failure to have clear closure objectives and approaches to identified outcomes. This may result in a focus on technical studies that fail to provide better closure understanding, whilst expending hard-won closure-aimed budgets. Driving closure planning by well defined goals through corporate tools such as closure standards designed to meet both internal requirements and relevant closure guidelines is an ideal solution to avoiding wasted closure resources such as time and finances. Whilst learning and addressing these key closure lessons is no guarantee of successful relinquishment, recognition of these issues and judicious planning to overcome them is more likely to present well considered closure plans with greater chance of closure relinquishment in a sustainable socio environmentally manner that maintains a company’s and the broader mining industry’s licence to operate into the future...|$|E
