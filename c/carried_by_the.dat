50|$|The 1922 and 1934 censuses were <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{independent}} Republic of Estonia.

5|$|New {{fires were}} reported: Count Adam Christoffer Knuth's house in Pustervig, a cellar in Købmagergade (Market Street) and a haystack at Nørreport (Northern Gate) all {{broke out in}} flames; the latter likely ignited by embers <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind.|$|E

5|$|Adult dragonflies hunt on {{the wing}} using their {{exceptionally}} acute eyesight and strong, agile flight. They are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating {{a wide variety of}} insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies, moths, damselflies, and smaller dragonflies. A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> legs to a perch. Here, the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first. A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day.|$|E
5|$|After its retirement, 4859 was {{purchased}} in for $13,000 by the Harrisburg {{chapter of the}} National Railroad Historical Society and donated to the Harrisburg Redevelopment Authority. It {{was sent to the}} Pennsylvania Railroad Museum in Strasburg in the early 1980s, where restoration of 4859 was <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> workshops of the nearby Strasburg Rail Road. The body and chassis were sandblasted, primed and repainted back to its original 1938 appearance. The main transformer was removed and drained of the hazardous polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) used as coolant.|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E

5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Eight Union sailors {{were killed}} and 44 were wounded while the Confederates lost none. (Captain Joseph Dixon of the river {{batteries}} had been killed the previous day during Carondelets bombardment.) On land the well-armed Union soldiers surrounded the Confederates, while the Union boats, although damaged, still controlled the river. Grant realized that any success at Fort Donelson {{would have to be}} <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> army without strong naval support, and he wired Halleck that he might have to resort to a siege.|$|E

5000|$|Abduction and {{adduction}} of {{the shoulder}} (frontal plane). Abduction is <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> deltoid and the supraspinatus in the first 90 degrees. From 90-180 degrees it is the trapezius and the serratus anterior. Adduction is <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> pectoralis major, lattisimus dorsi, teres major and the subscapularis.|$|R
5000|$|The Anuradhapura {{massacre}} {{occurred in}} Sri Lanka in 1985 and was <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers are <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ocean {{currents}} {{for up to}} 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Jifna {{experienced}} {{a wave of}} emigration, with about half of its population leaving the town to pursue better livelihoods elsewhere. The first census <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) shows that Jifna had a population of 961, of whom 623 (64.8%) were classified as refugees in 1997. The gender distribution was 465 males (48.4%) and 494 females (51.6%). The age distribution was: Under 15, 330 (34%); 15–29, 275 (29%); 30–65, 304 (32%); Over 65, 50 (5%).|$|E
5|$|In {{cold water}} diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant {{thermally}} insulating dive suit {{has a large}} excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> diver.|$|E
5000|$|Medial {{and lateral}} {{rotation}} of shoulder (also known as {{internal and external}} rotation). Medial rotation is <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> anterior fibres of the deltoid, teres major, subscapularis, pectoralis major and the lattissimus dorsi. Lateral rotation is <b>carried</b> out <b>by</b> <b>the</b> posterior fibres of the deltoid, infraspinatus and the teres minor.|$|R

5|$|Juvenile loggerheads {{share the}} Sargassum habitat {{with a variety}} of other organisms.

Some of the prey, such as ants, flies, bugs, leafhoppers, and beetles, are <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind to these areas. plant prey of the mats include barnacles, small crab larvae, fish eggs, and plantonn colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, also inhabit the mats.|$|E
5|$|Kurama {{attended}} the Coronation Fleet Review of King George V in Spithead on 24 June 1911. She was at Yokosuka in August 1914 and {{was assigned to}} the 1st South Seas Squadron to search for the East Asia Squadron. They departed there on 14 September and reached Truk on 11 October as troops <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> squadron occupied the Carolines. The squadron was based in Suva, Fiji in November in case the East Asia Squadron decided to double back into the Central Pacific. Kurama was flagship of the 2nd Squadron in 1917 and was transferred to the 5th Squadron the following year. Like her sister, she was disarmed in 1922, stricken in 1923 and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma {{has been}} {{politically}} conservative {{for much of}} its history, especially recently. During the first half century of statehood, it was considered a Democratic stronghold, being <b>carried</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Republican Party in only two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). During this time, it was also carried by every winning Democratic candidate up to Harry Truman. However, Oklahoma Democrats were {{generally considered to be}} more conservative than Democrats in other states.|$|E
