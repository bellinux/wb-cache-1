40|$|Article dans revue scientifique avec comité de lecture. This paper {{addresses}} the forbidden state problem of general marked graphs with uncontrollable transitions. The models need {{not to be}} safe nor cyclic. Control requirements are expressed as the conjunction of General Mutual Exclusion Constraints (GMEC) of markings of so-called <b>critical</b> <b>places.</b> Structural properties such as influence paths and influence zones are proposed to perform the worst-case analysis for each GMEC specification with any given initial marking when only uncontrollable transitions are allowed. Efficient solutions are proposed for {{the determination of the}} maximal uncontrollably reachable marking of any <b>critical</b> <b>place,</b> and this for many possible, more or less general, configurations of the net structure, even for the case of overlapping paths of <b>critical</b> <b>places.</b> Besides, we demonstrate that these results can be easily extended to unbounded nets and when <b>critical</b> <b>places</b> have negative weights. For the most general case, when analytical solution is not available, a linear programming approach is proposed. The great advantage of the proposed approach over existing methods is emphasized by using it to solve the supervisory control problem of the automated manufacturing system of AIP-RAO of Lyon, France (Atelier Inter-établissements de Productique Rhône Alpes Ouest) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a control synthesis approach for discrete event systems modelled by partially observable marked graphs. It solves the forbidden state problem for discrete event systems modelled by partially observable event graphs subject to Marking Exclusion Constraints (MEC). Two kind of MEC specifications are considered: MEC-AND or MEC-OR. The main advantage of MEC specifications is an increased modelling power regarding to General Mutual Exclusion Constraints GMEC. We provide a simple optimal controller to enforce MEC specifications with independent <b>critical</b> <b>places.</b> We also propose a suboptimal controller for MEC-OR with dependent <b>critical</b> <b>places</b> {{belonging to the}} same direct path...|$|R
