500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912, {{in search of a}} change from his unrewarding {{clerical}} job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket. He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, {{he would be able to}} finance his winter studies of music and literature. His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright. Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school's headmaster: [...] "Because of Alington I <b>call</b> <b>myself...</b> an old Salopian". Alington first detected Cardus's intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray's translation of Euripides's drama Medea. In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington's secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking how? I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 1995 interview, however, {{he insisted}} that [...] "I still <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> a communist, because {{communism}} is no more what Russia made of it than Christianity is what the churches make of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I should <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> an Afrikaner, {{were it not}} for the {{tendency}} to confine that term to those whose ancestors landed here before the British occupation, and to such newer arrivals as are animated by the 'South African spirit'. I have neither Voortrekker nor Huguenot blood in my veins, and 'the South African spirit', as understood by those who extol it, implies a view on the native question which I cannot share. But I am proud to be a South African, and I claim to stand on the same national footing as if my forebears had landed with Van Riebeeck or followed Piet Retief over the Drakensberg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Supposing {{there to}} be fifty {{thousand}} people in Sydney,--as to which I know nothing. Or why ever so many million fools in London? If I <b>called</b> <b>myself</b> Mrs. Smith nobody would come and see me. If I <b>called</b> <b>myself</b> Madame Cettini, not nearly so many would come. You have got to inculcate into {{the minds of the}} people an idea that a pure young girl is going to jump about for their diversion. They know it isn't so. But there must be a flavour of the idea. It isn't nice, but one has to live.' ...|$|R

It's kinda awkward to be famous for a name that you've never been called before in your life. If you want me to know that you don't know me, call me T.I. It's the weirdest most awkward thing." [...] During the interview he also spoke on the benefit of not having to deal with a major label and how he couldn't have released Da' Nic if he wasn't independent.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1953, {{after the}} {{fighting}} ceased, Nichols' 6004th Air Intelligence Service Squadron was dubbed the [...] "primary [...] collection agency of FEAF [...] ". Despite {{the fact that}} the Air Force effort was as large as the CIA and Naval intelligence units in Korea, the relatively junior Nichols remained entrusted with command. However, throughout the war, agent casualties had steadily climbed as the communists increased their security measures. From the end of 1952 onwards, insertions into the north had become virtual suicide missions. Nichols was haunted by the situation: [...] "I hate to <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> a man. I had {{to be the one to}} give the orders when I knew someone was going to be killed." ...|$|E

[...] At the age of fifteen, her relationship with the Catholic Church changed, after learning that Michael was gay. She said: [...] "I realized my older brother was gay, and I couldn't support a religion that didn't support my brother. Now I <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> a non-denominational Christian, because I haven't found the religion for me." [...] The year prior, in 2009, she stated that her religious beliefs are [...] "a work in progress".|$|E

2500|$|... "Dumb Head" [...] was Arnell's fifth solo single, {{released}} {{over three}} years after her solo debut, and her second for MGM Records, following [...] "Trouble's Back In Town". [...] Her earlier records had been commercial failures, never charting and receiving little press. [...] The record company teamed her with arranger Al Gorgoni and producer Jim Vienneau. [...] Arnell initially disliked the song [...] "Dumb Head", later saying in an interview:I said to my manager, [...] "I'm {{not so sure about}} this song." [...] I didn't like calling myself a dumb head, especially as I had just graduated high school with high honours. [...] How could I <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> dumb and feel good about it? [...] But when we recorded it, with the kazoos in the background and all, it was fun. [...] It came out really good...|$|E
2500|$|Irwin [...] "takes {{the humor}} very seriously... I {{remember}} {{being a little}} kid wondering why we laugh and what makes me laugh. I always was a class clown. I was always interested in what makes laughter happen and now I get to dig into the theory of it every day." [...] Irwin thinks {{of himself as a}} fiction writer and refers to himself as a humorist, [...] and states, [...] "I <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> a humorist and storyteller instead of a comedian because I play in libraries and there's no three-drink minimum." [...] Irwin's stories often reflect life in a small Southern town with recurring themes of growing up and growing old, the bonds of family, the complexities of racial relations in the Deep South, especially during the 1960s and the important art of the practical joke.|$|E
2500|$|Pacelli {{took the}} same papal name as his predecessor, a title used {{exclusively}} by [...] He was quoted as saying, [...] "I <b>call</b> <b>myself</b> Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially {{as a sign of}} gratitude towards Pius XI." [...] On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying [...] "He is in your midst." [...] He had previously been quoted as saying: [...] "When today the Pope dies, you'll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one.

2500|$|Hitchens {{supported}} Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election.

[...] He was critical of both main party candidates, Obama and John McCain, but wrote that Obama would be the better choice. Hitchens went on to call McCain [...] "senile", and his choice of running mate Sarah Palin [...] "absurd", calling Palin a [...] "pathological liar" [...] and a [...] "national disgrace".

Hafeez visited university campuses around the UK presenting his talk, [...] "The Day I Stopped Hating Israel – Confessions of an ex-Radical." [...] In {{an interview with the}} Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: [...] "It's not about being pro-Israel or pro-truth, I just want the facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world {{and then there is the}} reality of the actual conflict. In the UK, most of us can't impact what will happen in Israel, we can't stop rockets falling from Gaza or forge a peace process, but we can tackle the delegitimisation and demonisation of Israel." ...|$|E
