5|$|Carrington Moss is a lowland raised bog. The area drains slowly, which {{slows the}} {{decomposition}} of plant life {{and leads to}} the accumulation of peat. Over thousands of years this raises the level of peat and forms a gently sloping dome (hence, raised). Such areas support {{a wide range of}} flora and fauna; Sphagnum balticum, a medium-sized bog moss, was recorded on Carrington Moss in the 1880s, although locally it is now presumed to be extinct. Lancashire- or bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba), cranberries, bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), and the cotton sedge have also been recorded. In 1923 species of trees recorded by E. Price Evans for the Journal of Ecology included English oak (Quercus robur), and common ash (Fraxinus excelsior). Undergrowth included common hazel (Corylus avellana), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus), and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Several species of ground vegetation included <b>creeping</b> <b>soft</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus mollis), common bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), common foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), iris (Iris pseudacorus), mad-dog weed (Alisma plantago-aquatica), and cat-o'-nine-tails (Typha latifolia).|$|E
50|$|Holcus mollis, {{known as}} <b>{{creeping}}</b> <b>soft</b> <b>grass</b> or creeping velvet grass, is {{a species of}} grass, native to Europe and western Asia.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} grasses, {{primarily}} Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca arundinacea and <b>Creeping</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>Grass.</b> The mine is flat and translucent and can run either up or down. They are dirty yellow, but grey green above. The head is brown. Larvae {{can be found}} in early spring.|$|E

50|$|Alder {{is often}} not as {{abundant}} {{as in the previous}} types. Ash and/or silver birch are frequent with mixtures of common sallow, hazel and hawthorn in the shrub layer. Ground flora includes meadow sweet, yellow pimpernell, lady fern, rough stalked meadow grass, <b>creeping</b> <b>soft</b> <b>grass,</b> creeping buttercup and/or golden saxifage. These are found on base rich flushes with gleyed mineral soils.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in strings on the stems of grasses where they remain over the winter. The Essex skipper's favoured foodplant is cock's-foot (Dactylis glomerata), and it rarely uses the small skipper's favoured foodplant Yorkshire fog. Essex skippers' other foods include <b>creeping</b> <b>soft</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus mollis), couch grass (Elymus repens), timothy-grass (Phleum pratense), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum) and {{tor-grass}} (Brachypodium pinnatum). This skipper's caterpillars {{emerge in the}} spring and feed until June before forming shelters from leaves tied with silk {{at the base of the}} foodplant to pupate. Adults fly from July through August. Like most skippers, they are fairly strictly diurnal, though individuals are very rarely encountered during the night.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} loosely inside grass sheaths of the {{caterpillars}} food plants from July to August. The newly hatched caterpillars eat their own eggshell before entering hibernation individually in a protective cocoon of a grass sheath sealed with silk. In the spring the caterpillar begins feeding. The favoured food plant is Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), although other recorded food plants include timothy (Phleum pratense), <b>creeping</b> <b>soft</b> <b>grass</b> (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis) and cock's foot (Dactylis glomerata). The caterpillars pupate {{near the base}} of the food plant in June with the first adults on the wing at the end of June, a week or two before the first Essex skippers. They are strongly attracted to purple flowers such as thistles and knapweeds.|$|E

5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps.

5000|$|It {{is common}} to leave landing gear off smaller planes (roughly 36" [...] or smaller) {{in order to save}} on weight, drag and {{construction}} costs.
