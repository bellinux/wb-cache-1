The seismic inputs are modelled as incompletely specified vector Gaussian random processes with known autospectral density functions but unknown <b>cross</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>densities</b> and these unknown functions are determined {{such that the}} steady state response variance of a given linear system is maximized. The resulting <b>cross</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> functions are shown {{to be dependent on}} the system properties, autospectra of excitation and the response variable chosen for maximization. It emerges that the highest system response is associated neither with fully correlated support motions, nor with independent motions, but, instead, specific forms of <b>cross</b> power <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> functions are shown to exist which produce bounds on the {{response of}} a given structure. Application of the proposed results is demonstrated by examples on a ground based extended structure, namely, a 1578 m long, three span, suspension cable bridge and a secondary system, namely, an idealized piping structure of a nuclear power plant.

40|$|A {{control method}} for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) non-Gaussian random {{vibration}} test with cross spectra consideration is {{proposed in the}} paper. The aim of the proposed control method is to replicate the specified references composed of auto <b>spectral</b> <b>densities,</b> <b>cross</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>densities</b> and kurtoses on the test article in the laboratory. It is found that the <b>cross</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>densities</b> will bring intractable coupling problems and induce difficulty for {{the control of the}} multi-output kurtoses. Hence, a sequential phase modification method is put forward to solve the coupling problems in multi-input multi-output non-Gaussian random vibration test. To achieve the specified responses, an improved zero memory nonlinear transformation is utilized first to modify the Fourier phases of the signals with sequential phase modification method to obtain one frame reference response signals which satisfy the reference spectra and reference kurtoses. Then, an inverse system method is used in frequency domain to obtain the continuous stationary drive signals. At the same time, the matrix power control algorithm is utilized to control the spectra and kurtoses of the response signals further. At the end of the paper, a simulation example with a cantilever beam and a vibration shaker test are implemented and the results support the proposed method very well.

Along with the parametric study, an estimate of the dependence of the noise radiation on plate boundary conditions based on a consideration of the wavenumber-frequency selectivity of the plate is presented.

40|$|The {{development}} of efficient protocols for pure and mixed states preparation is challenging task. Most {{of the theory}} of quantum information applications has been developed for fully coherent or completely incoherent light. However, in many situations of interest partially coherent light has been proved to be a more robust model of radiation. In this paper the underpinning theory of two photon amplitude functions for down-converted fields with partially coherent pump beams is investigated. By using the generalised Siegert relations and the coherent mode representation of the <b>cross</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>density</b> matrix the two photon amplitude is fully characterised for partially coherent beams. A number of correlation properties from modern coherence theory are demonstrated to be preserved under parametric down-conversion. Based on the generalised Siegert relations and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality a measure of entanglement for the two photon amplitude is proposed. Upper bounds for this measure are found in terms of the golden ratio for maximally entangled states.

We then calculate the number-density and velocity-divergence fields of proto-haloes and estimate their auto <b>spectral</b> <b>densities.</b> We also measure the corresponding <b>cross</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>densities</b> with the linear matter distribution. We use our results to test a Lagrangian-bias model presented by Desjacques and Sheth {{which is based on}} the assumption that haloes form out of local density maxima of a specific height. Our comparison validates the predicted functional form for the scale-dependence of the bias for both the density and velocity fields. We also show that the bias coefficients are accurately predicted for the velocity divergence. On the contrary, the theoretical values for the density bias parameters do not accurately match the numerical results as a function of halo mass. This is likely due to the simplistic assumptions that relate virialized haloes to density peaks of a given height in the model. We also detect appreciable stochasticity for the Lagrangian density bias, even on very large scales. These are not included in the model at leading order but correspond to higher order corrections.
