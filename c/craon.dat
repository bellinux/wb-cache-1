5|$|In 1392 however, Carrouges {{was present}} {{for one of}} the more notorious occurrences in fourteenth century France; the first descent into madness of King Charles VI. As a chevalier d'honneur, Carrouges {{accompanied}} the King on campaign and thus was present when the Royal Army entered Brittany to hunt for Pierre de <b>Craon,</b> a noble who had fled Paris following a failed attempt to murder Olivier de Clisson, Constable of France. As the army passed Le Mans on 8 August 1392, a loud noise within his entourage startled the French King, who believing himself to be under attack, lashed out at the nearest person to him. The man happened to be his brother Louis of Valois, who turned and fled from his brother's sword. Killing several pages who attempted to calm his temper, the King set off on full pursuit of Louis, leaving the army strung out across the countryside behind him. The pursuit continued for hours until the exhausted King was eventually subdued by his bodyguard, including Jean de Carrouges.|$|E
25|$|Gilles de Rais was {{probably}} born in late 1405 to Guy II de Montmorency-Laval and Marie de <b>Craon</b> {{in the family}} castle at Champtocé-sur-Loire. He was an intelligent child, speaking fluent Latin, illuminating manuscripts, and dividing his education between military discipline and moral and intellectual development. Following the deaths {{of his father and}} mother in 1415, Gilles and his younger brother René de La Suze were placed under the tutelage of Jean de <b>Craon,</b> their maternal grandfather. Jean de <b>Craon</b> was a schemer who attempted to arrange a marriage for twelve-year-old Gilles with four-year-old Jeanne Paynel, one of the richest heiresses in Normandy, and, when the plan failed, attempted unsuccessfully to unite the boy with Béatrice de Rohan, the niece to the Duke of Brittany. On 30 November 1420, however, <b>Craon</b> substantially increased his grandson's fortune by marrying him to Catherine de Thouars of Brittany, heiress of La Vendée and Poitou. Their only child Marie was born in 1429.|$|E
25|$|Charles's {{first known}} episode {{occurred}} in 1392 when {{his friend and}} advisor, Olivier de Clisson, {{was the victim of}} an attempted murder. Although Clisson survived, Charles was determined to punish the would-be assassin, Pierre de <b>Craon,</b> who had taken refuge in Brittany. John V, Duke of Brittany was unwilling to hand him over, so Charles prepared a military expedition.|$|E
25|$|A League and Spanish force {{defeated}} an Anglo Royal army at <b>Craon</b> on 21 May but elsewhere {{they were}} less successful. By Winter of that year Henry gave up campaigning but for him at least and the Protestant army Parma {{was no longer a}} serious threat. In December Henry disbanded his army but was no closer to recapturing his kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Since 1562, France was in {{the grip}} of the French Wars of Religion in which Spain had {{regularly}} intervened in favour of the Catholic League of France, most notably in the siege of Paris (in 1590) or the Rouen (in 1591), and other battles as <b>Craon</b> in 1592, or the Relief of Blaye in 1593. But only, in 1595, the war was officially declared between the two countries by the new King Henry IV of France (French: Henri de Bourbon), who had the year before converted to Catholicism and been received into Paris to be crowned.|$|E
25|$|Gian Gastone, {{the last}} Medici, {{resigned}} the grand duchy to Francis Stephen of Lorraine. Under him, Tuscany was {{ruled by a}} viceroy, Marc de Beauvau-Craon, Prince de <b>Craon.</b> Francis Stephen altered the laws of succession in 1763, when he declared his second son, Leopold, heir to the grand duchy. If Leopold's line were to become extinct, it would revert to the main line. Every grand duke after Leopold resided in Florence. The grand duke Leopold II agreed to ratify a liberal constitution in 1848. The grand duke was briefly deposed by a provisional government in 1849. He was restored the same year by Austrian troops. The government was finally dissolved upon its annexation to the United Provinces of Central Italy in 1859.|$|E
25|$|Spain under King Philip II of Spain had intervened {{regularly}} in the Wars of Religion in favour of the Catholic League against the Protestant Huguenots, most notably in the Siege of Paris (1590), the Siege of Rouen (1591), and the Battle of <b>Craon</b> in 1592. However, only in 1595 was war officially declared {{between the two countries}} by the new King Henry IV of France, who had converted to Catholicism and been received into Paris the year before to be crowned with popular support. From then on, the civil war began to turn against the hardliners of the Spanish supported Catholic League, including two major royal French victories over the Spanish at Fonatain-Francais and Ham in 1595. The Spanish responded to the faltering of the League and their own defeats with a great campaign that year and the next, capturing Le Catelet, Doullens, Cambrai, Calais and Ardres.|$|E
500|$|In 1392 Charles {{suffered}} {{the first in}} a lifelong series of attacks of insanity, manifested by an [...] "insatiable fury" [...] at the attempted assassination of the Constable of France and leader of the Marmousets, Olivier de Clisson—carried out by Pierre de <b>Craon</b> but orchestrated by John V, Duke of Brittany. Convinced that the attempt on Clisson's life was also an act of violence against himself and the monarchy, Charles quickly planned a retaliatory invasion of Brittany with the approval of the Marmousets, and within months departed Paris with a force of knights.|$|E
500|$|Gian Gastone {{died from}} [...] "an {{accumulation}} of diseases" [...] on 9 July 1737, surrounded by prelates and his sister. Anna Maria Luisa {{was offered a}} nominal regency by the Prince de <b>Craon,</b> the Grand Duke's envoy, until Francis III could arrive in Florence, but declined. At Gian Gastone's demise, all the House of Medici's allodial possessions, including £2,000,000 liquid cash, a vast art collection, robes of state and lands in the former Duchy of Urbino, were conferred on Anna Maria Luisa. In regards to this, her most notable act was the Patto di Famiglia ("Family Pact"), signed on 31 October 1737. In collaboration with the Holy Roman Emperor and Francis of Lorraine, she willed all the personal property of the Medici's to the Tuscan state, provided that nothing was ever removed from Florence.|$|E
500|$|The Council of Acre {{was called}} with the Haute Cour of Jerusalem at Acre on 24 June. This {{was the most}} {{spectacular}} meeting of the Cour in its existence: Conrad, Otto, Henry II, Duke of Austria, future emperor Frederick, and William V, Marquess of Montferrat represented the Holy Roman Empire. [...] Louis, Thierry of Alsace, and various other ecclesiastical and secular lords represented the French. From Jerusalem King Baldwin, Queen Melisende, Patriarch Fulk, Robert de <b>Craon</b> (master of the Knights Templar), Raymond du Puy de Provence (master of the Knights Hospitaller), Manasses of Hierges (constable of Jerusalem), Humphrey II of Toron, Philip of Milly, Walter I Grenier, and Barisan of Ibelin were among those present. Notably, no one from Antioch, Tripoli, or the former County of Edessa attended. Both Louis and Conrad were persuaded to attack Damascus.|$|E
500|$|Sérurier's {{regiment}} {{was ordered}} to Bayonne where it joined a force under Charles Juste de Beauvau, Prince of <b>Craon.</b> These troops entered Spain on 3 June 1762 {{to take part in}} the Spanish-Portuguese War. The first battalion, in which Sérurier served, participated in the siege of Almeida which fell to the Franco-Spanish on 25 August 1762. The unit returned to France in November that year and after the Treaty of Paris was renamed the Beauce Regiment. After the peace Sérurier was demoted to sous-lieutenant and spent six years as a drill instructor. He was promoted to second lieutenant again on 21 February 1767 and was shipped to Corsica in 1770. The Republic of Genoa transferred Corsica to France in 1764 but Pasquale Paoli led an insurrection against the occupiers which resulted in a few skirmishes. His superiors called Sérurier an [...] "excellent officer" [...] but he was not promoted to first lieutenant until 28 February 1778. A year later he was promoted to captain. He married Louise-Marie-Madeleine Itasse on 3 July 1779. Her father was the Registrar of the bail bondsmen of Laon.|$|E
500|$|When the Protestant Henry IV {{inherited}} the French throne in 1589, Elizabeth sent him military support. It {{was her first}} venture into France since the retreat from Le Havre in 1563. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports. The subsequent English campaigns in France, however, were disorganised and ineffective. Lord Willoughby, largely ignoring Elizabeth's orders, roamed northern France to little effect, with an army of 4,000 men. He withdrew in disarray in December 1589, having lost half his troops. In 1591, the campaign of John Norreys, who led 3,000 men to Brittany, was {{even more of a}} disaster. As for all such expeditions, Elizabeth was unwilling to invest in the supplies and reinforcements requested by the commanders. Norreys left for London to plead in person for more support. In his absence, a Catholic League army almost destroyed the remains of his army at <b>Craon,</b> north-west France, in May 1591. In July, Elizabeth sent out another force under Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to help Henry IV in besieging Rouen. The result was just as dismal. Essex accomplished nothing and returned home in January 1592. Henry abandoned the siege in April. As usual, Elizabeth lacked control over her commanders once they were abroad. [...] "Where he is, or what he doth, or what he is to do," [...] she wrote of Essex, [...] "we are ignorant".|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Lorrainers," [...] as the occupying {{forces were}} dubbed, were popularly loathed. The Viceroy, the Prince de <b>Craon,</b> whom the Electress disliked for his [...] "vulgar" [...] court, allowed the Electress to live {{undisturbed}} {{in her own}} wing of the Pitti, living in virtual seclusion, only on occasion receiving a select-number of guests under a black dais in her silver-clad audience room. She occupied herself financing and overseeing {{the construction of the}} Cappella dei Principi—started in 1604 by Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany—to the tune of 1,000 crowns per week, and she donated much of her fortune to charity: £4,000 per annum. [...] This is equivalent to £ in present-day terms. On 18 February 1743, Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, Dowager Electress Palatine, died of an [...] "oppression on the breast". Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet, a British resident in Florence, recalled in a letter that [...] "The common people are convinced she went off in a hurricane of wind; a most violent one began this morning and lasted for about two hours, and now the sun shines as bright as ever..." [...] The royal line of the House of Medici became extinct with her death. Her will, having been completed just months before, according to Sir Horace Mann, left £500,000 worth of jewellery to the Grand Duke Francis and her lands in the former Duchy of Urbino to the Marquis Rinuccini, her main executor and a minister under her father, Cosimo III. She was interred in the crypt that she helped to complete in San Lorenzo; although not entirely finished {{at the time of her}} death, her testament stipulated that part of the revenue of her estate should [...] "be used to continue, finish and perfect...the said famous chapel San Lorenzo".|$|E
