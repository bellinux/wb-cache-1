40|$|Objectives: Colonoscopy {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{procedures}} in gastroenterology. Since the procedure is operator dependant, Quality of each procedure is the main element of reliable outcome. One of the elements is the <b>completion</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>Completion</b> <b>rate</b> of endoscopy unit is a reliable measure to improve the quality of the procedure. Methodology: We here reviewed retrospectively our endoscopy database from the main tertiary hospital in Qassim province, central part of Saudi Arabia. The recommended completion based on several professional societies range from 90 – 95 % <b>completion</b> <b>rate</b> according to the indication. We retrospectively reviewed our endoscopy database over the period from 2005 to 2008 in King Fahad Specialist Hospital. Results: Our adjusted <b>completion</b> <b>rate</b> was 85. 3 %. The main reason of incompletion was poor preparation. Our <b>completion</b> <b>rate</b> was comparable throughout the study period. Conclusion: our <b>completion</b> <b>rate</b> is below recommended range. We think this result will stimulate the efforts to incorporate more quality measures in the endoscopy unit...|$|R

25|$|A {{key issue}} in CCBT use is low uptake and <b>completion</b> <b>rates,</b> {{even when it}} has been clearly made {{available}} and explained.

Another approach to improving uptake and completion rate, as well as treatment outcome, is to design software that supports the formation of a strong therapeutic alliance between the user and the technology.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{with regard to the}} quality of {{education}} provided by the system.

The students’ performance in both the 2014 NAT and NCAE were excessively below the target mean score. Having said this, the poor quality of the Philippine educational system is manifested in the comparison of <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> between highly urbanized city of Metro Manila, which is also happens to be not only the country's capital but the largest metropolitan area in the Philippines and other places in the country such as Mindanao and Eastern Visayas. Although Manila is able to boast a primary school completion rate of approximately 100 percent, other areas of the nation, such as Eastern Visayas and Mindanao, hold primary school completion rate of only 30 percent or even less. This kind of statistic is no surprise to the education system in the Philippine context, students who hail from Philippine urban areas have the financial capacity to complete at the very least their primary school education.|$|E

In 2001, 86.5% of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in elementary or secondary school had completed high school. Status <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> increased from 82.8% in 1972 to 85.6% in 1990. Since 1991, the rate has shown no consistent trend and has fluctuated between 84.8% and 86.5%. High school status <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> for white and black young adults increased between the early 1970s and 1990 but has remained relatively the same since 1990. Specifically, status <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> for white students increased from 86.0% in 1972 to 89.6% in 1990. Since 1990, white <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> have remained {{in the range of}} 89.4-91.8%. In 2001, 91.0% of white and 85.6% of black 18- through 24-year-olds had completed high school. The percentage of black students completing high school rose from 72.1% in 1972 to 85.6% in 2001. The gap between black and white <b>completion</b> <b>rates</b> narrowed between 1972 and 2001. In 2001, 65.7% of all Hispanic 18- through 24-year- olds completed high school. This percentage compares to 91.0% of whites, 85.6% of blacks, and 96.1% of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Essentially, in 2001, whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders were more likely than their black and Hispanic peers to have completed high school. Also, whites completed high school at a higher rate than both blacks and Hispanic students. Black students completed high school at a higher rate than Hispanics.|$|E
