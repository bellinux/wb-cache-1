50|$|A large heron, the cocoi {{can measure}} 95 - 127 cm in length, {{stand up to}} 100 - 130 cm in height and weigh 1.14 - 3.2 kg. Its {{markings}} are not dissimilar to a grey heron's, but it is darker with a longer neck and crest. It has a bright orange beak and dull orange legs, and whilst perched holds its neck in an S shape characteristic of all herons. In flight, it is slow and graceful but appears scrawny due to its neck and large wings. The <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> is extremely similar to its North American and European counterparts, the great blue heron and grey heron, with which the <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> forms a superspecies.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the birds}} {{reported}} in the area are: the Andean tinamou, the Pacific pygmy owl, the pale-browed tinamou, the king vulture, the Tumbes sparrow, the red-masked parakeet, the Andean condor, the great egret, the <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron,</b> the ochre-bellied dove, the long-billed starthroat, etc.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{recorded}} {{from the}} reserve include the fulvous whistling duck, blue-winged teal, osprey, wattled jacana, black-necked stilt, <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron,</b> striated heron, anhinga and neotropic cormorant. Of special interest are the grayish piculet, apical flycatcher, bar-crested antshrike and the scrub tanager. The reserve also supports {{the only remaining}} population of the horned screamer in the region.|$|E
50|$|Some {{members of}} Ardea are clearly very closely related, {{such as the}} grey, great blue, and <b>cocoi</b> <b>herons,</b> which form a superspecies. However, the great egret, in particular, has been placed in other genera by various authors as Egretta alba and Casmerodius albus. Nevertheless, this species closely resembles the large Ardea herons in {{everything}} but color, whereas it shows fewer similarities to the smaller white egrets.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{seasonal}} variations in habitat selection and abundance of Ciconiiformes species in four foraging habitats (rivers, channels, connected and disconnected lagoons) on the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil, and to conduct the surveys of wading birds in 2002 and 2003. The largest number of species and highest abundances of most species were observed in the connected lagoons. Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), Roseate Spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and Jabirus (Jabiru mycteria) frequently used connected lagoons (habitat with the highest fish abundance) and abandoned the areas during floods, suggesting that they were able to find high quality patches for foraging. <b>Cocoi</b> <b>Herons</b> (Ardea <b>cocoi),</b> Great Egrets (Ardea alba), and Rufescent Tiger-Herons (Tigrisoma lineatum) used habitats with lower fish abundance and did not totally abandon these areas during floods, suggesting they were not dependent on high quality patches. Differences in foraging techniques and social behavior explained the difference between the two groups. The results showed that opportunism did not totally explain the foraging habitat selection and in low water level seasons there were higher differences in foraging behavior among the species...|$|R
50|$|Birds {{adapted to}} the {{mangrove}} environment include orange-winged amazon (Amazona amazonica), <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cocoi), rufous crab hawk (Buteogallus aequinoctialis), striated heron (Butorides striata), semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla), great egret (Ardea alba), green kingfisher (Chloroceryle americana), bicolored conebill (Conirostrum bicolor), greater ani (Crotophaga major), little blue heron (Egretta caerulea), scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and wattled jacana (Jacana jacana).|$|E
50|$|The <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cocoi) is {{a species}} of heron in the family Ardeidae. It is common and {{widespread}} throughout most of South America including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. It is a non-breeding visitor to Trinidad and Tobago and a vagrant to the Falkland Islands and Tristan da Cunha. Its natural habitats are rivers, swamps, and freshwater lakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{great blue}} heron is {{replaced}} in the Old World by the very similar grey heron (Ardea cinerea), which differs in being somewhat smaller (90 - 98 cm), with a pale gray neck and legs, lacking the browner colors that {{great blue heron}} has there. It forms a superspecies with this and also with the <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> from South America, which differs in having more extensive black on the head, and a white breast and neck.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} park (Queulat mountain pass), wildlife includes mammals such as pudú, kodkod, {{and a variety of}} birds species including chucao tapaculo, Chilean pigeon, Magellanic woodpecker, black-throated huet-huet and thorn-tailed rayadito. The northern sections of the park are home to nearshore wildlife including semi-aquatic mammals as are southern river otter and coypu. Birds found in this area include Magellan goose, Chiloe wigeon, yellow-billed pintail, red shoveler, flying steamer duck, rosy-billed pochard, red-gartered coot, ringed kingfisher, great egret, <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron,</b> black-crowned night heron, torrent duck, sedge wren, Chilean flicker and black-necked swan.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this protected area is to provide a sanctuary for Nearctic migratory birds, as it is a unique habitat on almost 2000 km of coast on the Pacific Ocean. A total of 200 species of resident and migratory birds {{can be found in the}} park including: the grey gull, the sanderling, the Black skimmer, Belcher's gull, the kelp gull, the Grey-headed gull, the White-tufted grebe, the Great grebe, the White-cheeked pintail, the Cinnamon teal, the Common moorhen, the Virginia rail, the <b>Cocoi</b> <b>heron,</b> the Snowy egret, the Little blue heron, the Chilean flamingo, among others.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is closely}} related and similar to the North American great blue heron (Ardea herodias), which differs in being larger, and having chestnut-brown flanks and thighs, and to the <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cocoi) from South America that forms a {{superspecies}} with. Some authorities believe that the subspecies A. c. monicae {{should be considered a}} separate species. It has been known to hybridise with the great egret (Ardea alba), the little egret (Egretta garzetta), the great blue heron and the purple heron (Ardea purpurea). [...] The Australian white-faced heron is often incorrectly called a grey heron. In Ireland, the grey heron is often colloquially called a [...] "crane".|$|E
50|$|Mangroves are an {{essential}} part of the bay ecosystem and habitats. These mangroves are crucial to the local bird species’ long term survival, as they provide shelter and nutrients to the local bird species. Over 20 species were documented in the bay at over 57 locations, mostly in the Pearl Island region. Brown Pelicans are the most abundant birds in the bay, with Cattle Egrets and Great Egrets also populating a large portion. The other most plentiful birds in the bay include: The Sooty Tern, Bridled Tern, White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, Little Blue Heron, <b>Cocoi</b> <b>Heron,</b> Bare-Throated Tiger Heron, Black Crowned Night Heron, Blue Footed Booby, Brown Booby, Magnificent Frigatebird, Great Egret, and Snowy Egret. The Seabirds also are an indicator of the health of the fish, which rely on the nutrient rich debris of the mangroves to survive.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "great white heron" [...] {{could be}} {{confused}} with great egret, but is larger, with yellow legs {{as opposed to the}} great egret's black legs. The reddish egret (Egretta rufescens) and little blue heron (Egretta caerulea) could be mistaken for the great blue heron, but are much smaller, and lack white on the head and yellow in the bill. In the southern reaches of its range, the great blue sometimes overlaps in range with the closely related and similarly sized <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> (A. cocoi). The cocoi is distinguished by a striking white neck and solid black crown, but the duller juveniles are more easily confused. More superficially similar is the slightly smaller grey heron, which may sometimes vagrate to the northern coasts of North America. The grey heron (which occupies the same ecological niche in Eurasia as the great blue heron) has very similar plumage, but has a solidly soft-gray neck. Erroneously, the great blue heron is sometimes referred to as a [...] "crane".|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} the role of different habitat components and their relationship with microhabitat use by three species of egret: <b>Cocoi</b> <b>heron</b> (Ardea cocoi), Great egret (Ardea alba), and Cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis), in wetlands of southern Brazil. Ardea alba and A. cocoi were not habitat-specific (e. g. vegetation cover and flooding level). Conversely, B. ibis was associated with drier microhabitats. Relative air humidity and air temperature were the main variables which correlated with the occurrence of these species and supported the plasticity of B. ibis and its predominance in drier habitats...|$|E
40|$|Dolichorchis lacombeensis sp. nov., a digenean {{parasite}} of the gut of the <b>cocoi</b> <b>heron,</b> Ardea cocoi (L.), {{is described}} as a new species from Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. This new species most closely resembles D. buteii and D. tregenna in the dis-tribution of the vitelline follicles, which reach the intestinal bifurcation in the forebody. D. buteii can be distinguished from D. lacombeensis sp. nov. by the distribution of the vitelline follicles in the hindbody, which are concentrated in midline, by the presence of a sphincter in genital pore and by the size of holdfast organ and posterior testis, which are larger, (240 – 400 × 176 – 240 and 315 – 464 × 240 – 410 µm, respectively). D. tregenna differ from the new species by their larger measurements (pseudosuckers ’ length 90 – 100, pharynx 52 – 90 × 50 – 70 and eggs 89 – 104 × 48 – 68 µm) ...|$|E
