5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion.</b> Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|There {{is general}} {{consensus}} that many factors helped trigger the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> {{but there is}} no generally accepted consensus about the combination and the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> continues to be an area of controversy and research over why so rapid, why at the phylum level, why so many phyla then and none since, and even if the apparent fossil record is accurate.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> {{there have}} been five {{distinctly}} identifiable mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
50|$|On 17 May 1965, {{a second}} major mining {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} <b>Cambrian</b> Colliery. An <b>explosion</b> caused by firedamp, after poor ventilation allowed a build-up of flammable gas, killed 31 miners. The ignition point was later identified as an electric arc on an open switch panel which was being worked on. This was the last major mining disaster in South Wales history.|$|R
40|$|The {{geological}} record {{indicates that}} the major animal phyla began biomineralizing {{in a relatively short}} interval of time during the <b>Cambrian</b> evolutionary <b>explosion,</b> about 525 Myr ago. Because these phyla diverged well before this biomineralization event, it was triggered either by an unprecedented lateral genetic transfer, or was the result of parallel exaptation of an ancestral biomineral system in many separate lineages. As magnetite (Fe_ 3 O_ 4) biomineralization is the most ancient matrix-mediated system, and is present in most animal groups, it may have served as this ancestral template for exaptation. Complete sequencing of the genome of a magnetotactic bacterium, and identifying the magnetite operon, might provide a 'road map' for unraveling the genetics of biomineralization in higher organisms, including humans...|$|R
40|$|The time {{of origin}} of the animal phyla is controversial. Abundant fossils from the major animal phyla {{are found in the}} Cambrian, {{starting}} 544 million years ago. Many paleontologists hold that these phyla originated in the late Neoproterozoic, during the 160 million years preceding the <b>Cambrian</b> fossil <b>explosion.</b> We have analyzed 18 protein-coding gene loci and estimated that protostomes (arthropods, annelids, and mollusks) diverged from deuterostomes (echinoderms and chordates) about 670 million years ago, and chordates from echinoderms about 600 million years ago. Both estimates are consistent with paleontological estimates. A published analysis of seven gene loci that concludes that the corresponding divergence times are 1, 200 and 1, 000 million years ago is shown to be flawed because it extrapolates from slow-evolving vertebrate rates to faster-evolving invertebrate rates, as well as in other ways...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> {{took place}} around 540 to 520 {{million years ago}} (Mya). In this geologically brief period, all the major animal phyla diverged and these {{included}} the first creatures with mineralized skeletons. Brachiopods and bivalves made their appearance at this time, and left their fossilized remains behind in the rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} geological {{period of}} the Paleozoic era, the Cambrian, {{takes its name from}} the Cambrian Mountains, where geologists first identified Cambrian remnants. In evolutionary studies the Cambrian is the period when most major groups of complex animals appeared (the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion).</b> The older rocks underlying the Cambrian rocks in Wales lacked fossils which could be used to differentiate their various groups and were referred to as Pre-cambrian.|$|E
5|$|A true {{ocean basin}} {{developed}} to the west, breaking all the earlier formations along a steep front. A wedge of clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion</b> of life.|$|E
40|$|The Estonian black argillites {{formed in}} Late Cambrian and Early Ordovician (Tremadoc) {{just after the}} <b>Cambrian</b> {{evolutionary}} <b>explosion,</b> nicely illustrated by the famous Burgess shales. The abundant new Cambrian lifeforms were well able to thrive in anoxic poisonous and strongly radioactive waters, rich in U 235. They belong to the extensive formation of the Cambrian-Ordovician black shales which form patches in the latitudinal zone extending from Lake Ladoga in the east to the Jutland Peninsula in the west. In the black mud-stones at Sillamäe the most enriched elements are, {{in the order of}} biocapture efficiency, molybdenum, carbon, rhenium, antimony, uranium and arsenic. It appears that not only the most unusual chemical composition, but also the very large compositional variability might depend upon even faraway meta-morphic processes and long-transported allochtons during the Finnmarkian and Caledonian orogenies. The Sillamäe black shale is certainly a better metalliferous ore than the comparable product from Jämtland, Sweden. It is also a very good future fuel, but only nuclear. The carbon content is too low for anything except providing process heat for production of rare metals...|$|R
40|$|Bilateria are {{currently}} subdivided into three superclades: Deuterostomia, Ecdysozoa, and Lophotrochozoa. Within this new taxonomic frame, acoelomate Platyhelminthes, {{for a long}} time held to be basal bilaterians, are now considered spiralian lophotrochozoans. However, recent 18 S rDNA [small subunit (SSU) ] analyses have shown Platyhelminthes to be polyphyletic with two of its orders, the Acoela and the Nemertodermatida, as the earliest extant bilaterians. To corroborate such position and avoid the criticisms of saturation and long-branch effects thrown on the SSU molecule, we have searched for independent molecular data bearing good phylogenetic information at deep evolutionary nodes. Here we report a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences from the myosin heavy chain type II (myosin II) gene from a large set of metazoans, including acoels and nemertodermatids. Our study demonstrates, both for the myosin II data set alone and for a combined SSU + myosin II data set, that Platyhelminthes are polyphyletic and that acoels and nemertodermatids are the extant earliest bilaterians. Hence, the common bilaterian ancestor was not, as currently held, large and complex but small, simple, and likely with direct development. This scenario has far-reaching implications for understanding the evolution of major body plans and for perceptions of the <b>Cambrian</b> evolutionary <b>explosion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{incredible}} {{diversity of}} life on Earth veils the tumultuous history of biodiversity loss over deep time. Six mass extinction events since the <b>Cambrian</b> species <b>explosion</b> (including the current Anthropocene), and many smaller extinction spasms, have terminated 99 % of all species that have ever existed. Evolution and extinction, as universal processes, have been unified previously under James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis, and most recently, under Peter Ward's Medea hypothesis. Gaia (the Greek Earth mother) posits that life on Earth functions like a single, self-regulating organism, whereas Medea (siblicidal wife of Jason of the Argonauts) describes instead a self-destructive feedback where life "seeks" to destroy itself. We argue that these contrasting views are actually extremes of a scale-invariant stability entropy spectrum of speciation and extinction for all life on Earth, much as the abundance and stability of a metapopulation of an individual species is the emergent property of births, deaths and migration. In this context, we propose a new metaphor called the Cronus hypothesis (patricidal son of Gaia) to explain how these processes can be quantified with existing mathematical tools and so be {{used to describe the}} ebb and flow {{of life on}} Earth along a thermodynamic spectrum. We also argue that Cronus provides a broader framework with which to link the natural history research domains of evolutionary, ecological and extinction biology. Corey J. A. Bradshaw and Barry W. Broo...|$|R
5|$|During the Paleozoic era, {{the western}} part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion</b> of life took place over about 15million years {{in this part of the}} world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550million years ago. As its {{shoreline}} moved east, the ocean began to concurrently deposit the three formations of the Tonto Group.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{paleontology}} {{that has}} {{seen a lot of}} activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D. Ward and Donald Brownlee {{have argued that}} some form of animal life may {{continue}} even after most of the Earth's plant life has disappeared. Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion,</b> and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun and declining oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
40|$|Brachiopods {{dominated}} the benthic Palaeozoic marine realm, {{both in terms}} of relative abundance and also species diversity. The Ordovician represented a pivotal period for brachiopods, with the phylum under taking a spectacular surge in biodiversity driven by an exponential increase in numbers at family, genus and species levels. However, brachiopods had a significant history prior to the Ordovician, with the majority of higher-level taxa already established during the Cambrian 'explosion'. Calcareous rhynchonelliform brachiopods tended to be a minor and relatively short-lived component of these Cambrian communities and there is a significant time lag between their appearance in the early <b>Cambrian</b> and the <b>explosion</b> of genera in the Ordovician. The relationship of many Cambrian rhynchonelliform brachiopods is poorly understood, with many genera displaying a combination of morphological features that are taxonomically confusing. Yet, the study of middle Cambrian [...] early Tremadocian brachiopods is pivotal to fill the interval between the two major radiation phases in the early Palaeozoic. Here we present a parsimony analysis of a wide selection of Cambrian and Ordovician brachiopod genera with a particular focus on the evolution and phylogeny of the Billingsellida, a group considered by many to represent the ancestral stock of several Ordovician brachiopod lineages. The analyses portray the polytoechioids as derived billingselloids separate from the clitambonitoids that form a sister group. The enigmatic Roanella is interpreted as ancestral to the clitambonitoids within a new monogeneric family, Roanellidae nov. and the recently reappraised clitambonitoid Arctohedra is interpreted as a basal member of the entire order Billingsellida. 1 page(s...|$|R
5|$|The {{last half}} of the 19th century saw a {{tremendous}} expansion in paleontological activity, especially in North America. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in China {{near the end of the}} 20th century. Many transitional fossils have been discovered, and there is now considered to be abundant evidence of how all classes of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The last few decades of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth. There was also a renewed interest in the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian.|$|E
25|$|Animal phyla {{appeared}} in the fossil record as marine species during the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> about 542 million years ago. Animals emerged as a clade within Apoikozoa as the sister group to the choanoflagellates.|$|E
25|$|Ediacara biota bear little {{resemblance}} to modern lifeforms, and their relationship even with the immediately following lifeforms of the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> is rather difficult to interpret. More than 100 genera have been described, and well known forms include Arkarua, Charnia, Dickinsonia, Ediacaria, Marywadea, Onega, Pteridinium, and Yorgia.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the more}} than 65,000 living species of chordates, about half are bony fish of the {{superclass}} Osteichthyes. The world's largest and fastest animals, the blue whale and peregrine falcon respectively, are chordates, as are humans. Fossil chordates are known from at least {{as early as the}} <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|Aside from them, most known animal phyla {{make a more}} or less {{simultaneous}} appearance {{during the}} Cambrian period, about 542 million years ago. It is still disputed whether this event, called the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> is due to a rapid divergence between different groups or due to a change in conditions that made fossilization possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{rate of the}} {{evolution}} of life as recorded by fossils accelerated in the Cambrian period (542–488Ma). The sudden emergence of many new species, phyla, and forms in this period is called the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion.</b> The biological fomenting in the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion</b> was unpreceded before and since that time. Whereas the Ediacaran life forms appear yet primitive and not easy to put in any modern group, {{at the end of the}} Cambrian most modern phyla were already present. The development of hard body parts such as shells, skeletons or exoskeletons in animals like molluscs, echinoderms, crinoids and arthropods (a well-known group of arthropods from the lower Paleozoic are the trilobites) made the preservation and fossilization of such life forms easier than those of their Proterozoic ancestors. For this reason, much more is known about life in and after the Cambrian than about that of older periods. Some of these Cambrian groups appear complex but are quite different from modern life; examples are Anomalocaris and Haikouichthys.|$|E
25|$|While {{the dates}} given {{in this article are}} {{estimates}} based on scientific evidence, there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased biodiversity through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> there was great diversity.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{may have}} evolved from an animal {{similar to a}} coral-like sea squirt (a tunicate), whose larvae {{resemble}} early fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea squirts do today), Vertebrates, among them the first fishes, originated about 530 million years ago during the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> which saw the rise in organism diversity.|$|E
25|$|The Proterozoic eon {{lasted from}} 2.5Ga to 542Ma (million years) ago. In this time span, cratons grew into continents with modern sizes. The change to an {{oxygen-rich}} atmosphere {{was a crucial}} development. Life developed from prokaryotes into eukaryotes and multicellular forms. The Proterozoic saw a couple of severe ice ages called snowball Earths. After the last Snowball Earth about 600Ma, the evolution of life on Earth accelerated. About 580Ma, the Ediacaran biota formed the prelude for the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of Vernanimalcula {{so early in}} the fossil record was believed to have had important implications if it were really bilaterian. The radiation of animals into many phyla would have occurred before any animal became much larger than microscopic size, making the sudden {{appearance of}} many animal phyla in the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> an illusion and merely represented a (geologically) sudden increase in size and the development of easily fossilised body parts by species in existing phyla.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of multicellularity was a pivotal {{point in the}} evolution of life on Earth. Shortly after multicellularity arose, there was an immense increase in the diversity of living organisms {{at the beginning of the}} Cambrian Era, called the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>Explosion.</b> Multicellularity is believed to have evolved multiple times on Earth because it was a beneficial life strategy for organisms. For multicellularity to occur, cells need to be capable of self-replication, cell-cell adhesion and cell-cell communication. There also must have been available oxygen and selective pressures in the environment.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{scientists}} Hartman and McKay {{argue that}} plate tectonics {{may in fact}} slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it). Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen {{from the effects of}} complex life's emergence, {{rather than the other way}} around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water. Kasting argues that if oxygenation caused the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> then any planet with oxygen producing photosynthesis should have complex life.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of fish began about 530 {{million years ago}} during the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion.</b> It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column, leading to the first craniates and vertebrates. The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha, or jawless fish. Early examples include Haikouichthys. During the late Cambrian, eel-like jawless fish called the conodonts, and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms, first appeared. Most jawless fish are now extinct; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata, which includes the extant hagfish, and this group may have split early on from other agnathans.|$|E
25|$|Some palaeontologists {{suggest that}} animals {{appeared}} {{much earlier than}} the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> possibly as early as 1 billion years ago. Trace fossils such as tracks and burrows found in the Tonian period indicate the presence of triploblastic worms, like metazoans, roughly as large (about 5mm wide) and complex as earthworms. During {{the beginning of the}} Tonian period around 1 billion years ago, there was a decrease in Stromatolite diversity, which may indicate the appearance of grazing animals, since stromatolite diversity increased when grazing animals became extinct at the End Permian and End Ordovician extinction events, and decreased shortly after the grazer populations recovered. However the discovery that tracks very similar to these early trace fossils are produced today by the giant single-celled protist Gromia sphaerica casts doubt on their interpretation as evidence of early animal evolution.|$|E
25|$|Interest in the area's fossil beds faded after Raymond's 1930s expeditions. In {{the early}} 1960s Harry B. Whittington was persuaded that further {{investigation}} was required, and organised surveys {{in partnership with}} the Geological Survey of Canada. These new specimens led him to set up a team to re-examine Walcott's fossils, which had languished in a store-room at the Smithsonian since Walcott's death in 1927. In the early 1970s the team published papers that diagnosed many of the specimens as fossils of previously unknown types of animals, some possibly belonging to new phyla. These analyses heightened interest in the existing debate about whether the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> represented a truly abrupt evolution of recognisable animals or {{was the result of a}} longer development, most of which was hidden by gaps in the known sets of fossils that had been found.|$|E
25|$|Excluding a few contested {{reports of}} much older forms from North America and India, the first complex {{multicellular}} life forms {{seem to have}} appeared at roughly 1500 Ma, in the Neoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic eon. The oldest fossil evidence from that era of such complex life comes from the Lantian formation of the Ediacarian period, at least 580 million years ago. A very diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is found {{in a variety of}} locations worldwide and date to between 635 and 542 Ma. These are referred to as Ediacaran or Vendian biota. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic era. By the middle of the following Cambrian period, a very diverse fauna is recorded in the Burgess Shale, including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa. The increase in diversity of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> of life.|$|E
25|$|While the Japanese {{video game}} {{industry}} {{has long been}} viewed as console-centric in the Western world, due to the worldwide success of Japanese consoles beginning with the NES, the country had in fact produced thousands of commercial personal computer games from the late 1970s up until the mid-1990s, in addition to dōjin soft independent games. The country's computer market was very fragmented at first; Lode Runner, for example, reportedly required 34 conversions to different hardware platforms. The market eventually became dominated by the NEC PC-8801 and PC-9801, though with some competition from the Sharp X1 and X68000; FM-7 and FM Towns; and MSX and MSX2. A key difference between Western and Japanese systems {{at the time was}} the latter's higher display resolutions (640x400) in order to accommodate Japanese text which in turn influenced game design. Japanese computers also employed Yamaha FM synthesis sound boards since the early 1980s, allowing video game music composers such as Yuzo Koshiro to produce highly regarded chiptune music for RPG companies such as Nihon Falcom. Due to hardware differences, {{only a small portion of}} Japanese computer games were released in North America, as ports to either consoles (like the NES or Genesis) or American PC platforms (like MS-DOS). The Wizardry series (translated by ASCII Entertainment) became popular and influential in Japan, even more so than at home. Early Japanese RPGs were also influenced by visual novel adventure games, which were developed by companies such as Enix, Square, Nihon Falcom and Koei before they moved onto developing RPGs. In the 1980s, Japanese developers produced a diverse array of creative, experimental computer RPGs, like a <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion,</b> prior to mainstream titles such as Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy eventually cementing genre tropes.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Cambrian</b> <b>explosion</b> was the {{relatively}} rapid appearance around [...] of most major animal phyla {{as demonstrated in}} the fossil record, and many more phyla now extinct.

This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which allowed the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues today.|$|E
