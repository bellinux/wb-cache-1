Individual authors will introduce their own chapters. The book will be available for sale at discounted prices. Discussan...|$|R
40|$|WWW. HR is a Web-based {{information}} service project {{supported by the}} Croatian Academic and Research Network (CARNet). WWW. HR {{tends to be a}} thematic portal, providing regional information specifically concerning <b>Croatia.</b> WWW. <b>HR</b> consists of two services: general info on Croatia and a directory of the Croatian Web sites. Besides a touch-sensitive map of the Republic of Croatia, general info on Croatia provides “Short info about Croatia”, covering national history, tourism, economy, nature, geography, politics, arts, culture, sport and Internet resources. A directory of Croatian Web sites is hierarchically organized in 15 categories and 344 subcategories. The content of the directory is fully searchable by keyword and/or by Boolean expression. Sites are added based on submissions from webmasters. All newly submitted sites are reviewed by the administrator and added to the directory. This article presents WWW.

40|$|The aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comprehensive}} literature search to the fertility of Pedunculate oak in Vranovice and Croatia and {{on the basis of}} investigation to compare the basic structural features of adult economic floodplain forests with oak summer in the Czech Republic (CZ) and <b>Croatia</b> (<b>HR)</b> as a prerequisite for fertility and subsequent natural recovery. While in the long term prevails CZ clear-cutting method of farming with artificial regeneration of oak is used in HR undergrowth economic way with natural regeneration of oak and other trees. Despite the different natural conditions in both countries was found similar stand stocks ranging 500 - 700 m 3. ha- 1.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the colony development cycle (unsealed and sealed worker brood, drone brood, pollen and colony strength) of two Apis mellifera carnica subpopulations in two distinct environments (alpine and continental). At each test location were two sub groups of 12 colonies headed by naturally mated sister queens from either the Institute of Apiculture Lunz am See, Austria (AT) or from the Faculty of Agriculture University of Zagreb, <b>Croatia</b> (<b>HR).</b> Colony development was monitored every 14 days. The HR genotype, adapted to a continental climate, had faster spring brood development in both environments. During spring and early summer the AT genotype maintained the number of sealed brood cells at a constant level in the more favourable conditions, although the amount of unsealed brood reached its maximum in early June. The environment influenced colony development, food stores and colony strength. Interaction between genotype and environment did not affect the number of unsealed brood cells, but the difference was statistically significant for the number of sealed brood cells. The study indicated the presence of a number of genotype and environment interactions between the two honey bee genotypes and their colony traits.

40|$|Background and Purpose: The study aims at {{comparing}} two (over 100 years old) floodplain oak-predominated {{forests in}} the Czech Republic (CZ) with two in of <b>Croatia</b> (<b>HR)</b> with regards to: i) their structure and yield and, more specifically, ii) individual oak tree characteristics including acorn production. Materials and Methods: In both countries a different silvicultural concept is preferred (CZ: clear-cutting management with artificial regeneration, HR: shelterwood management with natural regeneration). The main research goal {{was to create a}} basic decision tool for forest managers and open some questions for future research. Results: Despite the different natural and management practices, the total standing volume of floodplain forest was found to be similar in both countries, ranging from 500 to 700 m 3 ·ha- 1 (basal area: 34 - 41 m 2 ·ha- 1). In CZ generally more poor structure diversity was detected. Although in CZ the number of crop oaks (130 - 160 oaks per hectare) was almost double as compared with HR, the CZ oaks had shorter crowns, almost twice smaller crown projection, lower mean volume and lower share of valuable assortments. Conclusions: Despite the total standing volume of oaks in HR being lower than in CZ, the total yield was observed in Croatia (loss in CZ ca. 22, 000 €·ha- 1). The acorn density and quality were generally higher in HR with a more even distribution as well. Despite more favourable climatic conditions in HR, the currently used management system in CZ floodplain forests should be gradually converted to the Croatian model with a multi-layered forest structure, more focused on individual tree growth and stability with high economical value and high reproductive potential...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{sources of}} competitiveness, such as {{production}} capacities, financial resources, raw materials, distribution channels etc., are considered necessary, {{but no longer}} sufficient for organizational success. Human resources, their knowledge, skills and competencies as well as synergy among them, become the most valuable asset, the new source of wealth, and the key ingredient of competitive advantage. Consequently, the human resources function, which deals with recruiting, developing, and keeping the best people, now {{has the opportunity to}} move out of the background into the mainstream of organizational strategy and management. In other words, in a world in which all work is knowledge work and intellectual capital is crucial for economic success, it is logical that the ability to attract, retain, and use the talents of people provides a competitive edge. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the quality of HRM in <b>Croatia,</b> as excellent <b>HR</b> policies, programs and activities enable enterprises to be competitive through people. Therefore, the empirical research was conducted. The population were Croatian enterprises with more than 200 employees, out of which 80 form the final sample (response rate of 14. 3 %). In order to assess the value of HRM, the audit approach based on HR indicators was used. 55 HR indicators (26 quantitative and 29 qualitative ones) were analyzed, using 10 Croatian enterprises as benchmarks. The list of benchmark enterprises was generated using expert method. Precisely, enterprises from the sample that have the best HR practice were identified by the best Croatian HRM theoreticians. Results indicate that Croatian enterprises on average have insufficient HR activities. Precisely, independent samples t-test showed that 61. 82 % of analyzed HR indicators were significantly better for enterprises that were used as benchmarks, as well as that those enterprises have better absolute values for all of analyzed indicators. Consequently, HRM in Croatia could not be considered a solid ground for achieving competitiveness through people.

40|$|The {{text of the}} International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks {{was finally}} adopted at the International Conference held from 14 to 18 May, 2007 in the United Nations Office at Nairobi in Kenya (UNON). The Convention shall enter into force twelve months after having been signed and {{approved}} by ten States. The new Convention will provide a legal frame for the States Parties in removing existing and future wrecks located beyond the territorial sea (within their sovereign rights). First of all it is the exclusive economic zone which we discuss in the paper, or if a state has not established the Zone, it is the territory just beyond the territorial seas which extends not more than 200 NM from the starting lines for determining the size of territorial seas. Although the number of maritime accidents has been reduced recently, {{it has been estimated}} that there are more than 1 300 abandoned wrecks around the world today that pose potential hazards to safe navigation, utilization of the living resources, as well as to the marine environment. In accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Republic of Croatia established Protected Ecological and Fishing Zone comprising sovereign rights characteristic for exclusive economic zones such University of Split, Faculty of Maritime Studies, Split, <b>Croatia</b> e-mail: ranka@pfst. <b>hr</b> a. Adriatic Institute Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, Zagreb, Croatia as sovereign right of researching, utilization and conservation of the living resources beyond the outer borders of the territorial sea, as well as their management, and the jurisdiction with regard to the scientific research of the sea and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The Adriatic Sea falls into the category of closed or semi-closed seas by the definition of the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, and therefore if compared with larger seas, the consequences of pollution would be much greater due to its small size. That is why the adoption of the Convention on the Removal of Wrecks is of great importance to Croatia. The provisions of the Convention oblige the master and the operator of a ship to notify the endangered state party immediately about the accident which may cause a shipwreck, and the state must inform the mariners and other coastal states about the hazard posed by wrecks. The most important fact is that the Convention requires compulsory security for vessels of 300 BT. The vessels of 300 BT are obliged to have the certificate of insurance, or some other financial security as a cover for owner’s liability for the damage caused by the removal of the wreck...|$|R
