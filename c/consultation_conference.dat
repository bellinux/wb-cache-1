40|$|In {{a system}} of {{tripartite}} consultation, workers, employers, and the government work together to improve labor standards and protect workers’ rights. The International Labor Organization (ILO) has advocated for this system {{since its founding in}} 1919. China’s transition toward a market economy and World Trade Organization (WTO) accession calls for a new labor relations consultation mechanism, which is more market‐oriented, globalized, diversified, and flexible. In this context, China implemented its own form of tripartite consulta‐ tion in 2001, with the founding of the State Labor Relations Tripartite   <b>Consultation</b> <b>Conference.</b>   The tripartite system in China has been widely adopted and has been an innovative development in Chinese labor relations. However, many argue that it does not meet the standards of the ILO tripartite system. Indeed, China’s tripartite consultation mechanism differs from that advocated by the ILO. The tripartite consultation mechanism in China lacks neutrality, enforceability of consultation outcomes, trade union independence and workers’ representation. Nonetheless, the tripartite mechanism currently utilized in Chinese labor relations is a first step toward a more authentic tripartite   consultation mechanism by ILO standards. This is an important development in Chinese labor relations. As the beginning of social dialogue, the Chinese tripartite mechanism has the potential to impact both informal systems and the way labor law is structured...|$|E

Personal consults are {{an important component of}} quality control (QC) /quality assurance (QA) in our Section of Histopathology. In addition, the College of American Pathologists recommends a daily in-house consensus conference, which is a prospective system by which all difficult and problematic cases are reviewed and discussed and signed out by consensus. Design: In-house consensus conference is held daily using a multi-headed microscope. This collegial session is run by the seniormost consultant in the section and is attended by all histopathology consultants and residents. The consultants and residents present cases of their choice for discussion. The cases may be selected due to diagnostic difficulty, unusual nature of a case, management purposes such as performance of additional biopsies, special studies, etc., or request on the part of clinician or patient. Cases may be shown once or, in case of lack of consensus or difficulty in diagnosis, more than once after additional work-up suggested by the conference. Results: In a 4 -month period, 774 (4. 1 &#x 0025;) cases of a total of over 14, 000 well-mixed surgical cases were brought to the in-house daily <b>consultation</b> <b>conference.</b> Four hundred ninety-three cases (63. 7 &#x 0025;) were conclusively decided the first time while 198 cases (25. 5 &#x 0025;) were decided by consensus after being shown twice. In 83 cases (10. 7 &#x 0025;), a definite diagnosis could not be given. The cases on which a definite diagnosis was not possible represents 0. 59 &#x 0025; of all cases received in the department during the study period.

40|$|This {{report shows}} {{the results of}} a study {{investigating}} the activities of the palliative care team, the role of care workers in the team and care workers at wards who receive instructions from liaison psychiatrists. The core activities are as follows: <b>consultations,</b> <b>conferences,</b> and study meetings on palliative care. The teams need to share all available information and plan ahead so as to participate without confusion at the clinic or for patients and their families. Therefore, nurses need to take part as coordinators between the clinic and the teams and to hold conferences or study meetings periodically. Nurses working for terminal patients at the acute stage ward undergo various kinds of pressure while caring for their patients. Nurses have accepted facts that the counsel of the teams helps symptom to palliate and that circumstantial assessment and the problems are settled. With getting judgment on psychology phases of patients, especially terminal patients, about receiving their disease and getting solution for the mental phases, it seemed to become easier to communicate with patients.

Daniel, who did not care for his wound so much as he should have done, was with Mr. Goffe on the following morning, and heard a lengthy explanation from the attorney. The Solicitor-General had been consulted;--this Mr. Goffe said, feeling that a tailor would not have a word to say against so high an authority;--the Solicitor-General had been consulted, and was of opinion that Lady Anna's interests should be guarded with great care.

40|$|The central {{questions}} for the review have been: what should the curriculum contain and how should the content and the teaching of it change to foster children’s different and developing abilities during primary years? In looking to build a curriculum that answers these questions and is fit for primary children’s education {{now and in the}} future, excellent teaching of communication skills, leading to the achievement of high standards of literacy and numeracy, must remain a priority. So must the achievement of high standards of behaviour and other vital aspects of ‘personal development’. In this day and age, the primary curriculum also needs to give serious attention to building children’s capability with information technology. Our best primary schools already demonstrate that, far from narrowing learning, these priorities – literacy, numeracy, ICT skills and personal development – are crucial for enabling children to access a broad and balanced curriculum. Excellence in the basics supports the achievement of breadth and balance in primary education. Our primary schools also show that high standards are best secured when essential knowledge and skills are learned both through direct, high-quality subject teaching and also through this content being applied and used in cross-curricular studies. Primary schools have long organised and taught much of the curriculum as a blend of discrete subjects and cross-curricular studies in this way. It is the best of this work that Dear Secretary of State This is the final report of the independent review of the primary curriculum which you invited me to undertake in January 2008.
