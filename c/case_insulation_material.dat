40|$|Abstract. Thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> {{are among}} the {{simplest}} ways of decreasing heat loss in the buildings. When <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> are installed in the walls, floors and roof of a building to prevent heat loss from the building, materials must be used with the appropriate structural and thermal properties. In this paper, a laboratory test of the thermal conductivity and cell structure of building <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> was conducted. From the experiment results, the correlation expression between thermal conductivity and density was derived. In the <b>case</b> of the <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> that were made of expanded polypropylene (EPP), as the density increased, the thermal conductivity tended to decrease; {{and in the case}} of ethylene-vinyl acetate co-polymer (EVA) and polyethylene (PE), as the density of the <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> increased, the thermal conductivity tended to also increase...|$|R
40|$|The built {{environment}} increasingly includes innovative material aimed at drastically reducing energy consumption. Various types of phase change material (PCM) products are available {{but under the}} current fire safety guidelines their usage may be restricted due to their flammability, as is the <b>case</b> for some <b>insulation</b> <b>materials.</b> This study assesses the quantified fire performance of two different PCM plasterboards, a PCM-polymer sheathed in aluminium, and a polymeric macroencapsulated PCM <b>insulation</b> <b>material.</b> <b>Insulation</b> <b>materials</b> are shown to release much greater amounts of energy and are highly ignitable, and thus often require a suitable fire barrier. The thickness and thermal properties {{of this can be}} specified for the specific application to prevent ignition of the PCM. Lining materials have similar normalised burning rates for different PCM loadings and thus the optimal energy savings can be defined. Designers can select the maximum quantity of PCM loading for an acceptable fire risk, thus allowing the greatest potential for saving energy. The use of this knowledge allows designers to select the most suitable PCM for their need, and can enable the usage of materials where they are currently restricted. ...|$|R
