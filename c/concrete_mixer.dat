500|$|On 5 November 2010, a <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> {{went over}} the edge of a bridge over the railway line near Oxshott station, landing on the 15:05 South West Trains service from Guildford to London Waterloo. The train was formed of two Class 455 units, 455741 and 455913. The end of the roof of the sixth {{carriage}} was severely crushed. Further damage was sustained to the fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth carriages, with the latter being derailed at its trailing bogie, although the train remained upright. The lorry driver and one passenger suffered serious injuries; a further five passengers suffered minor injuries. Unit 455913 was repaired at Wolverton railway works and returned to service in July 2013. It has been fitted with an ex [...] driving vehicle which has been converted to an intermediate vehicle whilst retaining its existing number of 67301. Original vehicle 62838 was damaged beyond repair in the accident and was scrapped.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{portion of}} I-8 {{bypassing}} Holtville began construction in December1969, and was nearing completion in May1971, {{to result in}} a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from Crestwood in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2million (about $ in [...] dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SR115 providing the only access to {{the eastern part of the}} city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the Highline Canal overpass involved a [...] steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> malfunctioned. That same year, bids for an Arizona plant inspection station near Winterhaven, next to the California agricultural inspection station, were submitted.|$|E
50|$|These <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers</b> {{are further}} divided {{based on their}} loading mechanism. Cement, sand and other {{aggregates}} are loaded in a hydraulically operated hopper and then poured in the mixing drum for final mixing and then can be unloaded by tilting the drum. While in Hand Feed <b>Concrete</b> <b>Mixers,</b> cement, sand and other aggregates are directly added to the mixing drum manually. These both type of <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers</b> are highly popular and used in regular construction activities in Africa, some Middle Eastern Countries and in the Indian subcontinent.|$|R

2500|$|On Tuesday, August 9, 1898, the {{concrete}} contractor, John Crawford, {{said that the}} work would be pushed henceforward and that a 40-horsepower boiler and steam engine were {{to be in place}} to operate the <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer</b> and other equipment. Two work gangs would be placed on the project, one by day and one by night. [...] Part of the plan was to install an electric light plant if one could be found at a reasonable cost. [...] Crawford said it would take about 60 days to finish the work.|$|E
2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts per kilogram of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional <b>concrete</b> <b>mixer.</b> In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E

Various health problems and progressive complications {{have been reported to}} result from long term cement exposure. Recent studies suggest that occupational exposure to cement dust may have deleterious effect on lung, liver and epithelial tissues. The present study comprises 633 cases which include masons, helpers, <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers,</b> tile workers and loading and unloading workers. Seventy four percent cases have more than 10 years of exposure in cement work and 16 % over 20 years. Forty three percentages of individuals are masons, 15 % helpers, 9 % <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers,</b> 6 % tile workers and 27 % loading and unloading workers. Masons and tile workers have high frequency of cutaneous problems. Pulmonary impairment and skin related problems are reported by most of helpers and <b>concrete</b> <b>mixers.</b> Loading and unloading workers have all these symptoms in higher percentage...|$|R
