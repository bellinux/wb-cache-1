5|$|The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau {{when his}} {{expedition}} {{was the first}} to reach South Pole on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole, including all the land above latitude 85°S. However, roughly the same area had been <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian government.|$|E

5|$|A furious Holiday Inn {{management}} {{presented the}} groups {{with a bill}} for $24,000, which was reportedly settled by Herman's Hermits tour manager Edd McCann. Townshend claimed that the Who were banned for life {{from all of the}} hotel's properties, but Fletcher wrote that they stayed at a Holiday Inn in Rochester, New York a week later. He also disputed a widely held belief that Moon drove a Lincoln Continental into the hotel's swimming pool, as <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> drummer in a 1972 Rolling Stone interview.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent and {{now serving}} as an annex to the Palazzo dei Conservatori is Palazzo Caffarelli Clementino; here, {{short-term}} exhibitions are held. The palazzo was built between 1576 and 1583 by Gregory Canonico for Gian Pietro Caffarelli II. Until the cessation of World War I, the palazzo served as the German Embassy to Rome. Following the war, it was <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Comune di Roma, which demolished a large section of the palazzo's east wing to create the Caffarelli Terrace.|$|E

On March 22, a Sacred Band unit from Bilisht reached the outskirts of Korçë and joined the local guerillas, and fierce street fighting took place. For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements.|$|E

Grabner {{attended}} the Panthers training camp, but {{failed to make the}} team.

5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part}} of the Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite guano mining, copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up {{a large majority of}} people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the eastern half of Australia <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E

He had three hits, including a home run, in nine at-bats. The Browns finished {{in last place}} in the AL. That year, Hornsby began operating a baseball school in Hot Springs, Texas, which he ran on and off between 1933 and 1951 with various associates.|$|E
5|$|In 1753 the French began {{expanding}} their military control into the Ohio Country, a territory already <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania.

On Saturday, December 8, Recchi was <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Atlanta Thrashers, with whom he joined the following Tuesday. The Penguins and the Thrashers would split the remaining cost of his US$1.75 million contract.|$|E
5|$|Patras, on {{the northwestern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, is <b>claimed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Chronicle of Monemvasia—a work of highly disputed {{accuracy}} and chronology, but an essential source for the period—to {{have been one of}} the cities abandoned c. 587/8 as a result of the Slavic depredations, its population fleeing to Rhegion in Calabria. This was followed by 218 years of independent Slavic rule in the Peloponnese, until around 804/5. The archaeological record on the other hand shows Patras to have remained in Byzantine control throughout the period, although it is possible that part of the population indeed emigrated to Italy.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} Tudor monarchs, {{including}} Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they <b>claimed,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> grace of God alone.

These included acts of diplomacy (including royal marriages), declarations of war, management of the coinage, the issue of royal pardons {{and the power to}} summon and dissolve parliament as and when required. Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him to work closely with both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E
