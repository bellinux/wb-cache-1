5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead levels may have no symptoms. Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as lead builds up in the body during a <b>chronic</b> <b>exposure,</b> but acute symptoms from brief, intense exposures also occur.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum exposure in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposure</b> to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of <b>chronic</b> <b>exposure</b> to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
40|$|Personal {{protection}} a b s t r a c t For {{the use of}} topical insect repellents, DEET and picaridin, {{human health}} risk assessments were con-ducted for various population subgroups. Acute, subchronic, and <b>chronic</b> dermal <b>exposures</b> were exam-ined. No-observed-effect-levels (NOELs) of 200, 300, and 100 mg/kg body weight (BW) were used as endpoints for DEET for acute, subchronic, and <b>chronic</b> <b>exposures,</b> respectively. For picaridin, a NOEL of 2000 mg/kg BW/day for acute exposure and a NOEL of 200 mg/kg BW/day for subchronic and <b>chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> were used. Daily exposures to several population subgroups were estimated. Risks were char-acterized using the Margin of Exposure (MOE) method (NOEL divided by the estimated exposure), whereby estimated MOEs were compared to an MOE of 100. Estimates of daily exposures ranged from 2 to 59 mg/kg BW/day for DEET and 2 to 22 mg/kg BW/day for picaridin. Children had the lowest MOEs. However, none of the estimated exposures exceeded NOELs for either repellent. At 40 % DEET for acute exposure, children 612 years had MOEs below 100. For subchronic and <b>chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> children at P 25 % DEET and at 15 % picaridin had MOEs below 100. Therefore, we found no significant toxicological risks from typical usage of these topical insect repellents. 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R
40|$|Roads {{are known}} to {{negatively}} affect many vertebrate species and populations. This research quantified a number of effects of roads on Nova Scotia amphibians. The greatest mean Cl- concentrations in roadside ponds occurred in spring, least in early summer, and a rising trend in late summer, probably due to late summer evaporation. Cl- in some ponds exceeded recommendations {{for the protection of}} aquatic life. Amphibian species richness had a negative relationship with Cl- concentration in ponds. Wood frogs, spotted salamanders, and pickerel frogs occupied low Cl- ponds while green frogs, spring peepers, American toads, blue-spotted salamanders, and leopard frogs occupied low and high chloride ponds equally. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> of amphibian eggs to road salt indicate no negative effects on hatching success or development with green frogs and spotted salamanders, but significant effects on hatching and development with wood frogs and American toads. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> of spotted salamander larvae to road salt showed lengthened larval period, decreased weight at metamorphosis, and mortality in high salt treatments. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> of wood frogs and toad tadpoles to road salt showed n...|$|R
50|$|Chronic {{tests are}} {{long-term}} tests (weeks, months years), {{relative to the}} test organism’s life span (>10% of life span), and generally use sub-lethal endpoints. In <b>chronic</b> <b>exposures,</b> organisms {{come into contact with}} low, continuous doses of a toxicant. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposures</b> may induce effects to acute exposure, but can also result in effects that develop slowly. Chronic tests are generally considered full life cycle tests and cover an entire generation time or reproductive life cycle (“egg to egg”). Chronic tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 20%. These results are generally reported in NOECs (No observed effects level) and LOECs (Lowest observed effects level).|$|R
5|$|The {{major source}} of nickel {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as nickel is essential to plants. Nickel is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump nickel into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release nickel into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of <b>chronic</b> <b>exposure</b> is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. <b>Chronic</b> <b>exposure</b> {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of TWA 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with <b>chronic</b> <b>exposure</b> to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
40|$|Withdrawal anxiety {{following}} <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> {{is often}} associated with relapse in recovering alcoholics. It is likely that brain regions regulating anxiety-like behaviors adapt during <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> to ultimately regulate such behaviors. The central amygdala contains numerous neurotransmitter systems that have been implicated in the regulation of anxiety-like behavior, including corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and NMDA-type glutamate receptors. <b>Chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> causes functional adaptations in both CRF and NMDA receptors that are likely to regulate anxiety-like behaviors expressed during withdrawal. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these adaptations remain unexplored. We therefore evaluated these neurotransmitter systems in Sprague–Dawley rats during chronic ingestion of an ethanol-containing liquid diet. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR demonstrated that preproCRF mRNA was significantly upregulated by <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure,</b> whereas mRNA expression of CRF binding protein did not change. There were also no significant changes observed in any of the NMDA subunit mRNAs, although there was a trend toward greater NR 2 A mRNA expression during <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure.</b> Using Western blotting analysis we measured NMDA receptor subunit protein expression. <b>Chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> did not affect protein levels of the NR 1 and NR 2 B subunits. Like the mRNA measures, <b>chronic</b> ethanol <b>exposure</b> did influence NR 2 A protein levels but the effects were modest.

40|$|Chronically high insulin {{levels and}} {{increased}} circulating {{free fatty acids}} released from adipose tissue through lipolysis are two features associated with insulin resistance. The relationship between <b>chronic</b> insulin <b>exposure</b> and adipocyte lipolysis has been unclear. In the present study we found that <b>chronic</b> insulin <b>exposure</b> in 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, {{as well as in}} mouse primary adipocytes, increased basal lipolysis rates. This effect of insulin on lipolysis was only observed when the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was inhibited by rapamycin in the adipocytes. In addition, amino acid deprivation in adipocytes phenocopied the effect of rapamycin in permitting the stimulation of lipolysis by <b>chronic</b> insulin <b>exposure.</b> The phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase-Akt pathway {{does not appear to be}} involved in this insulin effect. Furthermore, we found that triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) activity was required for the stimulation of lipolysis by combined exposure to insulin and rapamycin.

40|$|Definitive {{information}} on the <b>chronic</b> effects of <b>exposure</b> to ozone (03) in humans is not available. There is a strong concern that ozone could produce chronic lung damage in humans {{on the basis that}} exposures are ubiquitous at levels that produce transient symptoms, function deficits, and lung inflammation in humans and chronic lung damage in laboratory animals. Both prospective and national population surveys suggest an association between <b>chronic</b> 03 <b>exposure</b> and reduced lung function, and a pilot investigation of autopsied lungs of accident victims in Los Angeles reported an unexpectedly high incidence of disease in the centriacinar region, the lung region known to receive the highest dose of inhaled 03. This paper discusses the advantages and limitations of further studies of structural changes in human lung tissue in relation to <b>chronic</b> 03 <b>exposure.</b> The major advantages of such studies are that a) measurable effects may be related to realistic <b>chronic</b> <b>exposures,</b> b) the effects may be described quantitatively and compared directly to those obtained in <b>chronic</b> animal inhalation <b>exposures,</b> and c) evidence for chronic effects may be obtained much more rapidly than in prospective studies. The major limitations are the difficulties in obtaining sufficient reliable {{information on}} residential history, physical activity out-of-doors, and smoking and other confounding exposures to lung irritants from next of kin, and limited availability of adequate air quality data for determining ambient concentrations at places of residence and/or outdoor exercise.
