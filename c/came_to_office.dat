5|$|He {{appears to}} have taken little {{interest}} in his official duties both as paymaster and inspector-general, leaving affairs {{in the hands of}} Edmund Waters. Waters had been his private secretary, and when Villiers <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> as paymaster, Waters was appointed chief clerk in that department, rising to deputy paymaster in 1797. Waters and Villiers invested in real estate with some of the money passing through the office; unfortunately for Villiers, Waters was also diverting some of the funds to his own interest in the Opera House, and the accounts of the office were in a shambles.|$|E
5|$|The Radical Republicans did {{create some}} {{improvement}} within the state. Levees were constructed and railroads were built. Also, Arkansas' first {{public school system}} was created. The administration and its supporters formed the Arkansas Industrial University, {{the basis for the}} future University of Arkansas in Fayetteville; what would become the Arkansas School for the Deaf; and the Arkansas School for the Blind, which relocated from Arkadelphia to Little Rock. However, state debt increased dramatically.

25|$|The year 1999 {{was seen}} by the Social Democrats as the vindication for the tough fiscal {{policies}} pursued since they <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> in 1994: GDP growth was estimated at about 3.6%, well above the European average, inflation remained subdued, and the budget was in surplus {{for the first time}} in the 1990s.

25|$|Although the Tories were re-elected in 1988 campaigning on free trade, {{they won}} with only 43% {{of the popular}} vote, {{compared}} to 52% of the vote which went to the Liberals and the New Democratic Party who campaigned mostly against the agreement. However, when the Liberals under Jean Chrétien <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> in 1993 promising to re-negotiate key parts of the agreement, they continued the deal with only slight changes, and signed the North American Free Trade Agreement which expanded the free trade area to include Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Exit polls of Nicaraguans {{reported}} Chamorro's {{victory over}} Ortega was achieved with a 55% majority. Chamorro {{was the first}} woman president of Nicaragua. Ortega vowed he would govern desde abajo (from below). Chamorro <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> with an economy in ruins, primarily because of the financial and social costs of the contra war with the Sandinista-led government. In the next election, the Nicaraguan general election, 1996, Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas of the FSLN were defeated again, this time by Arnoldo Alemán of the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC).|$|E
25|$|When he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office,</b> {{the state}} was still in a poor {{financial}} condition because the state's bank failures caused by the Panic of 1819 and the ensuing collapse of the modest internal improvement programs. The state's bonds had been depreciated in 1821 and severely hurt the state's credit and ability to borrow funds. The state budget was still in deficit, and the state's sparse population was producing very little revenue. The situation was resolved by selling public land {{to raise money to}} pay off {{a significant portion of the}} outstanding debt, and government accounts were moved to the Second Bank of the United States since there were no banks operating in Indiana.|$|E

25|$|But it {{remained}} structurally sound, and residents fought {{to preserve it}} from demolition. Congregants at the Old Dutch Church saved the plaster lunettes depicting the city's history that had decorated the council chamber and stored them in the church's basement. Eventually, a young new mayor, T.R. Gallo, <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> sharing those concerns, in 1994. After a first term of initiatives to renew the city, he was re-elected and proposed to restore City Hall and move the government back there. Council voted to authorize a bond issue in 1998, and along with private contributions and state and federal grants a total of $6.5 million was raised and spent. The building reopened in 2000, and has been occupied since then.|$|E
25|$|The judges {{decided to}} seize 46billion {{differences}} in value of Shin Corp. shares {{from the date}} when he <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> and the value when the shares were sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in early 2006. Note that, Thaksin had declared around 500 million baht in assets and Pojaman had 8billion to 9billion baht while Thaksin served as prime minister. Nevertheless, during that period, Shin shares gained 121%, compared with a 128% gain in the benchmark SET index, while Siam Cement, one of Thailand's premier blue chip companies, gained 717%. The judges did not find that Thaksin was guilty of malfeasance. They also noted that any benefit to the government from Thaksin's policies was irrelevant to the ruling. The government reaped approximately 100billion baht in increased revenue from changes in the concession agreements alone.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 July 31, 1875) was the 17th President of the United States, serving from 1865 to 1869. Johnson became {{president}} {{as he was}} {{vice president at the}} time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, Johnson <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> as the Civil War concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the former slaves, and he came into conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.|$|E
500|$|Citing {{continuing}} {{divisions within}} the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the boom and bust cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: [...] "After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as when he first <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office...</b> Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still." [...] When he left office in 1953, Truman {{was one of the}} most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.|$|E
500|$|Gillard <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> in the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis of 2007–2008. Government receipts fell during the international downturn and the Rudd Government had employed pump priming expenditure. Upon taking over as leader of the Labor Party on 24 June 2010, Gillard said she could [...] "assure" [...] Australians that the Federal Budget would be in surplus in 2013. The Government continued to promise this outcome until December 2012. Gillard initially ruled out a [...] "carbon tax" [...] but said that she would build community consensus for a price on carbon and open negotiations with the mining industry for a re-vamped mining profits tax. Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the Labor Party elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the Clean Energy Act 2011. The government also introduced a revised Minerals Resource Rent Tax and the Queensland Flood Levy.|$|E

500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay with {{me for the rest of}} my life. You know, I <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>office</b> as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
