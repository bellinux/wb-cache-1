The new <b>law</b> placed <b>cooperatives</b> back as a purely economic institution and to undo the previous <b>cooperatives</b> <b>law,</b> does not approve of discrimination based on political beliefs amongst its leadership. The new law also called for the Government to guide, assist, supervise and protect cooperatives in its policies. This in effect, gives the Government authority over cooperatives although considerable autonomy was still given to the cooperatives.|$|R

The situation is further complicated by the fact that Cooperatives is a State subject under the Constitution of India and State <b>cooperative</b> <b>laws</b> and their implementation have vastly differed. The global economy, and in particular the Indian economy, has gone through transformation. The positive dimension of globalization included liberal economic policies, reduction of state intervention, and easy access to monetary capital and consequently new opportunities for economic participation. This is already evidenced in India in the form of increased economic growth and State withdrawal from many economic and social domains. Cooperatives are the best channels to keep the spirit of collectivism and democracy afloat. The presence of a large network of social organizations, like cooperatives, would aid in the generation and utilization of social capital and 'greater the social capital greater would be the possibility of development'.

5000|$|While a study {{carried out}} by the ILO found that <b>cooperative</b> <b>laws</b> are [...] "gender neutral" [...] and do not {{directly}} discriminate against women. This is often not how things play out in reality when laws intended to protect women are ignored in favor of cultural norms or maneuvered around. Most legal barriers to women's cooperative membership are largely indirect and written into cooperative bylaws, such as rules that only one member per family can have membership when the cultural norm encourages male membership as a first choice. In agricultural cooperatives, it is often the case that membership requires land ownership, and since women are severely underrepresented in land ownership the world over, this serves to inhibit women from joining.|$|R
50|$|Cooperative {{societies}} in Japan were initiated during {{the era of}} Taisho democracy. In 1900, the Industrial Association Law was enacted and under its provisions consumer cooperatives like Nada Consumer Cooperative and Kobe Consumer Cooperative were formed.

At the end of WWII in 1945, severe food shortages and inflation stimulated the growth and expansion of cooperatives once again. In 1948, the Consumer <b>Cooperative</b> <b>Law</b> replaced the Industrial Association Law of 1900 which provided limitations on the operation of consumer cooperative societies within prefectures and prevented the merger of cooperatives across prefecture borders. In 1951, Toyohiko Kagawa founded the Japanese Consumers’ Cooperative Union, or JCCU, which was established to represent and serve all the consumers’ cooperative societies of Japan.|$|E

Many sex workers now have voters identity cards, health insurance and even bank accounts. In 1995, its consumer cooperative society and micro-credit programme, 'Usha' (literally meaning light), ensured that the Government of West Bengal altered the state's <b>cooperative</b> <b>law</b> to register it as a sex workers cooperative, instead of a 'housewives cooperative' under the prevalent state laws.

40|$|Cooperative-type {{financial}} institutions {{are required by}} law to specify a certain geographic "area" in the articles of association and the members of each institution must have a certain degree of association with its designated area such as being a resident of the area. As such, the designation of such an area serves as a factor that effectively restricts the qualification of members, thereby indirectly restricting the area in which each cooperative financial institution can operate. It is often pointed out that local {{financial institutions}}' loan portfolios are prone to concentration in a specific business sector. In this regard, the way in which cooperative financial institutions operate - providing financial services within or to those associated with their designated areas - can potentially be seen as problematic in terms of maintaining safe and sound management. This paper attempts to make clear why cooperative banks were made subject to the requirement regarding area designation in the first place, seeking clues in documents on the now-defunct Industrial <b>Cooperatives</b> <b>Law</b> enacted in 1900. The reasons have two aspects: (1) organizational factors inherent to cooperative financial institutions and (2) factors related to administrative and financial supervision. The first type of factor can be further classified into two types, namely, factors related to the need to secure personal links as a cooperative organization and factors related to the need to implement strict control over loan management. The Industrial <b>Cooperatives</b> <b>Law</b> sought locality connection as a basis for personal links by mandating cooperative banks to set their respective designated areas. With this, the law aimed to enable cooperative banks to collect qualitative information necessary to properly extend unsecured loans and to assure ex-post loan management. In the light of these reasons, this paper argues that the necessity of area designation has ceased to be relevant to many cooperative financial institutions operating today. ...|$|R
