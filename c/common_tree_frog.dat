5|$|The {{main reason}} for calling is to allow male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call {{individually}} or {{there may be a}} chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the <b>common</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Polypedates leucomystax), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.|$|E

Many past authors have united it with the common Indian tree frog in P. maculatus (or Rhacophorus maculatus, as was common in older times), but today they are generally considered distinct species. In its native range, it is also called [...] "white-lipped tree frog", but this name is otherwise applied to a species of true tree frogs (family Hylidae).|$|E

50|$|Shallow water depth, warm, stable temperature, {{and rich}} {{nutrient}} supply from mangrove forests and several rivers running into Phang Nga Bay result in abundant plankton and other marine life. The bay island hosts 26 species of reptiles, 24 species of fish, 14 species of shrimp, 15 species of crab, and 16 species of manta rays, sharks, and game fish. Most fishes {{are typical of}} coral reefs, such as butterflyfish.

40|$|We {{conducted}} static {{experiments to}} assess the effects of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on embryos and larvae of six European amphibians: sharp-ribbed salamander (Pleurodeles waltl), Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi), western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes), common toad (Bufo bufo), natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), and <b>common</b> <b>tree</b> <b>frog</b> (Hyla arborea). Embryos were exposed to different and environmentally relevant concentrations of ammonium nitrate (0 to 200 mg NO 3 –/L) for 15 days. Hatching {{took place during the}} experiments. H. arborea was extremely sensitive and had high mortality after 8 days of exposure even at the lower fertilizer levels. D. galganoi and B. bufo were also very sensitive and had significant mortality after 15 days of exposure. The rest of the species did not suffer lethal effects but suffered abnormalities or decreased growth at the highest fertilizer concentrations. Chemical fertilizers or manure could have contributed to the observed decrease of B. bufo and D. galganoi in agricultural areas of the Iberian Peninsula during recent years. H. arborea was the most sensitive species studied. The results of our study showed that environmentally relevant levels of ammonium nitrate can induce mortality and might affect population dynamics of this species in agricultural environments.
