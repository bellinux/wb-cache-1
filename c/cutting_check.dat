40|$|Pea weevil (Bruchus pisorum) is an {{important}} potential pest of peas grown in New Zealand and imports containing the pest must be intercepted. Detecting immature stages inside dried peas is difficult. However soaking peas in water allows them to swell and soften, and facilitates <b>cutting</b> and <b>checking</b> peas internally for immature stages of the bruchid. This increases the efficiency of detection compared to visua...|$|R

40|$|Roots from Grimm alfalfa {{that had}} been {{subjected}} to different cutting treatments were collected during summer, fall, and winter {{and the amount of}} reserves determined;Frequent <b>cutting</b> <b>checked</b> root growth 50 percent or more. The root reserves were higher in the uncut plants than in the cut plants. The period of greatest difference was during October and November;The amount of reserve materials in the roots of cut and uncut plants was positively correlated with cold resistance in both artificial freezing tests and in field tests;The starch and dextrin decreased in autumn and early winter. The non-reducing sugars increased as fall progressed;The soluble nitrogen increased during fall, dropped during winter and increased again in the spring. The colloidal nitrogen remained fairly constant during the winter and spring;The amount of fall top growth of hardy and non-hardy varieties of alfalfa was inversely proportional to hardiness. The hardy varieties made very little top growth in late fall; the tender varieties made extensive fall growth;Tests on the stability of the protoplasm were made and no consistent relation was found between the amount of nitrogen precipitated by freezing a watery extract of alfalfa proteins and cold resistance;Six varieties of alfalfa were analyzed for their content of root reserves. No variety was so different from the others that it could be placed in its proper hardiness group on the basis of reserves. The trend of the root reserves was quite similar in all varieties during fall, winter and spring;A pectic-like constituent was isolated from alfalfa roots, but showed no clear cut relation to cold resistance...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the draft}} horse and some harness breeds the tail is cut very short {{to keep it}} from being tangled in a harness. The term [...] "docked" [...] or [...] "docking" [...] may simply mean cutting the hair of the tail skirt very short, just past the end of the natural dock of the tail. However, it can also refer to partial tail amputation. This type of docking is banned in some places, and either type of docking can make it {{difficult}} for a horse to effectively swat flies. Another controversial practice, tail setting, involves placing the dock of the tail in a device that causes it to be carried at all times in an arched position desired for show. The set is used when the horses are stalled, and removed during performances. It stretches the muscles to keep the tail in position, and is not used after the horse is retired from competition. Sometimes the process is sped up by the controversial practice of nicking or <b>cutting</b> the <b>check</b> ligament that normally pulls the tail downward. This practice is generally only used for a few breeds, such as the American Saddlebred.|$|R
50|$|B. caryophylli {{cannot be}} {{directly}} {{controlled by a}} chemical means, simply because no chemical products are available that can control the bacterial wilt of carnations. However, sanitary procedures can prevent further infestation. These procedures include {{but are not limited}} to picking up infected host debris and careful handling of tools. Checking for signs of infected plant before plant <b>cutting</b> and <b>checking</b> the soil for the presence of bacteria will ensure that further dissemination is significantly decreased, if not prevented. In checking for the presence of disease before further planting, induced high temperatures should be employed to accelerate bacterial growth and symptoms. At an early stage of disease, the “KPV-Metoden” testing method can be used to detect infections present in carnation cuttings. Although there are no commercial varieties of Dianthus caryophyllus that are resistant to the bacterial pathogen, B. caryophylli, there are some wild species that may have genes which display a resistance. Under a testing method that used cut-root soaking to inoculate different species of Dianthus plants with B. caryophylli, D. capitatus spp. Andrzejowskianus and D. henteri were two wild type species which did not show any symptoms usually caused by B. caryophylli. Five other wild type species along with D. capitatus spp. Andrzejowskianus and D. henteri were also labeled as resistant due to a very low percentage of wilted plants.|$|R
50|$|The Springfield Elementary School Math team is {{competing}} against Waverly Hills Elementary's Math team, in an event organized by Benjamin, Doug and Gary. Lisa boasts that their poor school will surprise them all, {{which they do}} by scoring no points at all. Lisa is especially despondent, because Waverly Hills Elementary is much richer than Springfield Elementary, and thus can afford the latest in technology, while Springfield Elementary is stuck using antiquated tools. After this educational embarrassment, the nerds decide to modernize Springfield Elementary School by <b>cutting</b> a massive <b>check</b> directly to Skinner (similar to Mark Zuckerberg's $100 million direct donations to the public schools of Newark, NJ) which enables each student to receive a tablet connected to a school network, replacing the blackboards with a giant touch screen device and even building a 3D printing lab.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the effect of the drill {{geometry}} on the drilling of woven Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer composite (CFRPs). Although different geometrical effects can be considered in drilling CFRPs, the present work {{focuses on the}} influence of point angle and wear because they are the important factors influencing hole quality and machining forces. Surface quality was evaluated in terms of delamination and superficial defects. Three different point angles were tested representative of the geometries commonly used in the industry. Two wear modes were considered, being representative of the wear patterns commonly observed when drilling CFRPs: flank wear and honed cutting edge. It was found that the crossed influence of the point angle and wear were significant to the thrust force. Delamination at the hole entry and exit showed opposite trends with the change of geometry. Also, <b>cutting</b> parameters were <b>checked</b> showing the feed’s dominant influence on surface damage...|$|R
40|$|A great {{advantage}} of Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics (LTCC) yields {{the possibility of}} channel and air cavity fabrication. Such empty spaces have numerous applications, for example, in microfluidics, microwave techniques and integrated packaging. However, improper geometry of these structures can degrade {{the performance of the}} final device. The processing parameters recommended by the LTCC tape supplier are relevant for the production of multilayer circuits but not surface embedded channels and/or cavities. Thus, it is important to examine which factors of the fabrication process are the most significant. In our study, special {{attention has been paid to}} the geometric performance of the channel structure resulting from the applied processing parameters. Laser <b>cutting</b> parameters were <b>checked</b> to obtain the structures with great fidelity. The impact of an isostatic lamination on the quality of the final structure was analyzed. The influence of pressure and temperature of the lamination process on the channel geometry and tape shrinkage were examined. The performed experiments showed that some improvements in channel/cavity geometry may be achieved by optimizing the processing procedures. The microscopic observations combined with the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed which combinations of the processing parameters are the best for achieving a channel/cavity structure with the desired geometry...|$|R
40|$|Titanium alloys {{are widely}} used in {{aerospace}} industry but also in other industry sectors. Details for compressors used for generation and petrochemical plants and medical devices can be mentioned as a few examples. Plastic deformation during forming of the metals introduces residual stresses. Fatigue, creep and corrosion are typical failure mechanisms that are stopped or accelerated {{in the presence of}} tensile residual stress. Metal cutting as a manufacturing method generates residual stresses in the surface layer. The stress state in the near-surface zone of components is of special interest as the surface often suffers loads and consequently the cracks initiate and begin to grow at that location. The scope of this thesis is to investigate the properties of the machined surface with regards to measurement of residual stresses. The results achieved by X-ray diffractometry were compared with the results using a simulating method with the same <b>cutting</b> data for <b>checking</b> the accuracy of these two methods. This review highlighted the residual stress character and how they can be measured by X-ray diffractometry in two different directions, the transversal, the cutting direction, and longitudinal, the feed direction. For measurement of residual stress under the surface, the material was removed by an electro-chemical polishing method for not introducing more stress. The same procedure was checked using Finite Element simulations. The results obtained from the investigation clarified that: The residual stress measurement by X-rays was quite accurate in comparison with finite element simulation on the surface generated by turning on titanium alloy. There were compressive residual stresses in the cutting and feed directions of the cut. Residual stress is beneficial for delay of crack propagation. High-pressure cooling produced and increased compressional residual stresses. Godkänd; 2005; 20061218 (haneit...|$|R
