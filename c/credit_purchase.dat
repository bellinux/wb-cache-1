5000|$|The HERO card is a {{tool for}} {{consumers}} to create savings and wealth by depositing cash rebates into a private account {{in the name of}} the card holder. HERO cards were to be distributed free to all credit card holders and even those who preferred cash purchases. When a purchase was made by the consumer (either credit cards, debit or cash), a rebate would have been deposited into the HERO account for accrual and interest. The exciting concept was that rebates would be available to even cash purchasing consumers and not just credit card users, and the card did not require a credit check to distribute, as it was a [...] "deposit" [...] reward card, and not a <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> card.|$|E
50|$|The VIEW Suica pairs the prepaid Suica with {{a credit}} card. Various types exist, {{including}} at least one available through JR and View, and others such as the Bic Camera Suica. These function both as a pre-paid Suica {{as well as a}} regular credit card, and provide an auto-charge feature to prevent exhausting the Suica balance unintentionally. The automatically recharged amount is added to the user's credit card bill. Thus, these cards have two balances: a prepaid Suica balance and a credit balance for which monthly bills are sent. Thus, store-related cards like the Bic Suica can include fully three separate functions: serving as a store point card, a general use Suica, and as a credit card. Any <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> (restricted, in the case of Bic, to JCB) adds a small amount to the available points on the store point card. Yet another type of Suica offered by Japan Airlines (JAL) that is called JALCARD Suica. In addition to having Suica and credit card functionalities, a JALCARD Suica can also function as an electronic boarding pass for a JAL-operated domestic flight in Japan at an airport that offers the JAL IC service.|$|E

40|$|A presente tese realizou uma pesquisa sobre o processo de tomada de decisão {{individual}} que ocorre no contexto de compra a crédito, a partir de teorias e estudos da psicologia econômica e do comportamento do consumidor. Pretendeu-se analisar o efeito do tipo de produto e das condições de pagamento na intenção de compra a prazo dos indivíduos, assim como a influência das diferenças individuais nesta relação. Assim, utilizou-se uma metodologia experimental com a qual foram realizados três experimentos, a fim de testar as hipóteses construídas a partir de um modelo teórico. No Experimento 1, com 8 grupos experimentais e uma amostra de 279 pessoas, identificou-se que há um efeito negativo na propensão de compra a prazo quando há um desconto para pagamento à vista, independentemente da cobrança de juros a prazo. Se não há o desconto à vista, a propensão de compra a prazo aumenta. Além disso, concluiu-se que os indivíduos que apresentam altos índices de materialismo e impulsividade tendem a comprar mais a prazo. Para o Experimento 2, com 8 grupos experimentais e 314 respondentes, a coleta de dados foi similar à primeira, alterando somente algumas manipulações. Como implicação, encontrou-se resultados para os quais, se há desconto nas condições, menor tende a ser a propensão de compra a prazo. Além disso, provou-se que o tipo de produto possui um efeito na compra parcelada. Já no Experimento 3, buscou verificar somente os efeitos relacionados às manipulações dos tipos de produtos, com 4 grupos experimentais, e uma amostra de 171 pessoas. Averiguou-se um efeito cruzado para a interação produto e tipo de produto, ou seja, quando o tipo de produto for hedônico, há maiores variações na média de intenção de compra a prazo pelo produto do que se ele for utilitário. Concluiu-se, também, que o produto utilitário apresentou uma maior intenção de compra a prazo. This thesis {{aimed to}} conduct a research on the individual decision-making that occurs in the <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> context, from theories and studies of economic psychology and consumer behavior. It was intended to analyze {{the effect of the}} product type and payment conditions in the <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> intention, as well as the influence of individual differences in this relationship. It was used an experimental methodology with three experiments in order to test the hypotheses from a theoretical model. In Experiment 1, with 8 experimental groups and a sample of 279 people, it was identified that there is a effect on the <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> propensity when there is a discount for cash payment, regardless of the interest rates. If there is no discount, the lower tends to be the <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> propensity i as there are no interest charges in the payments. Furthermore, it was concluded that individuals with high levels of materialism and impulsivity tend to buy more than those who have a high financial literacy. For Experiment 2, with 8 experimental groups and 314 respondents, the data collection was similar to the first, changing just the manipulations. As implication, it was found results that if there was no discount the lower tends to be the term purchase propensity, {{in the same way that}} the first one. By the way, it was proven the that the produt type influenced in the credit payment. In the Experiment 3, it was sought to verify only the effects related to the type of products, with 4 experimental groups for both products, and a sample of 171 people. It was found a crossed product interaction effect when the type of product is hedonic, so there were greater variations in the average of <b>credit</b> <b>purchase</b> intentionwhen the product was utilitarian.

40|$|In practice, a firm usually {{receives}} {{trade credit}} financing from its supplier on {{the purchase of}} inventory. Similarly, {{in order to meet}} competition and generate credit sales over and above cash sales, the firm also gives credit period to their customers. However, the decision of granting credit period may have a disintegrating effect on cash sales apart from generating new credit sales because some of the cash customers may switch to <b>credit</b> <b>purchase.</b> In addition, despite of the best credit granting policies and collection practices, the firm may incurs some amount of bad debt losses because a certain fraction of buyers will undoubtedly be unable to pay off their debt obligations and become bad debt loss to the firm. In this paper, using discounted cash flow (DCF) approach, a mathematical model is developed to jointly determine optimal inventory and credit policies under two levels of trade credit financing when demand and bad-debt losses are dependent on credit period. The objective of the model is to maximize the present value of firm’s net profit per unit time by jointly optimizing the replenishment interval and date-terms credit period. Numerical examples and sensitivity analysis are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the results are discussed...|$|E

Another objective was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} state incentives aiming at promoting private FFV adoption. The study explored a panel data of FFVs sold to private consumers in the 366 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) in the U. S. from 2007 to 2012, the number of E 85 fueling stations in the corresponding areas and period, and state incentives including tax <b>credit,</b> <b>purchase</b> rebates, purchase loans, and tax exemption. Using fixed-effects linear model, random-effects tobit model, and fixed-effects instrumental variable model with fueling station incentives and government FFV fleet incentives as instruments, the results confirmed that increasing the density of E 85 fueling stations leads to increased FFV demand. Specifically, increasing 1 station per million people increases FFVs' share in total number of vehicles sold by 0. 1 %. Moreover state income tax credit and purchase rebates are effective at stimulating FFV demand, while the results are inconclusive for purchase loans and tax exemption, due to limited variability and number of MSAs that offer these kinds of incentives. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|E

When a less educated family becomes an owner of a bank account, I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 household durable goods, and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase. Although I find that bank account ownership does not affect the mean level of financial assets, I do find evidence suggestive of an increase in {{the top half of the}} financial asset distribution which indicates that there may be heterogeneity in the savings response to owning a bank account. Overall, my findings suggest that the most important benefit of owning a bank account is access to credit and requiring lower income families to own a bank account will not reverse their low average savings levels in the short run...|$|E
