In several continental European countries empirical research in sociology of law developed strongly from the 1960s and 1970s. In Poland the work of Adam Podgórecki and his associates (often influenced by Petrazycki's ideas) was especially notable; in Sweden empirical research in sociology of law in this period was pioneered especially by Per Stjernquist, and in Norway by Vilhelm Aubert.|$|E

40|$|The EDGeS project {{provides}} an infrastructure {{that aims to}} connect Desktop Grids (DGs) to Service Grids (SGs). At {{the heart of the}} EDGeS infrastructure lays the 3 G-Bridge which enables jobs to cross the boundaries of DGs, like BOINC and XtremWeb, to SGs, like EGEE, and vice-versa. While jobs flow in one direction, corresponding results return in the opposite direction. Unfortunately, these flows impose un-desired overheads. By observing performance of the entire EDGeS in-frastructure, with particular attention to the 3 G-Bridge, we can detect and identify system’s bottlenecks. By being aware of these, system de-velopers <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> investment of their time to modify the bridge. In this paper, we present our effort to benchmark the 3 G-Bridge in the EDGeS infrastructure and we present the corresponding results. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFunction {{specialization}} is {{a compilation}} technique that consists in optimizing {{the body of}} a function for specific values of an argument. Different versions of a function are created to deal with the most frequent values of the arguments, as well as the default case. Compilers <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> optimization with the knowledge of run-time behaviour of the program. Static compilers, however, can hardly predict the exact value/behaviour of arguments, and even profiling collected during previous runs is never guaranteed to capture future behaviour. We propose a dynamic function specialization technique, that captures the actual values of arguments during execution of the program and, when profitable, creates specialized versions and include them at runtime. Our approach relies on dynamic binary rewriting. We present the principles and implementation details of our technique, analyze sources of overhead, and present our results...|$|R

After a lackluster showing in Puerto Rico, Fernandez admitted that he was unable to fire up his Hispanic base as much as he thought he could, and the lack of TV coverage of his campaign made it difficult to raise money and garner name recognition.|$|E
