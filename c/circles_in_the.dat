5|$|The {{configuration}} {{of a circle}} tangent to four <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane has special properties, which have been elucidated by Larmor (1891) and Lachlan (1893). Such a configuration is also the basis for Casey's theorem, itself a generalization of Ptolemy's theorem.|$|E
5|$|In {{political}} <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Netherlands, {{the announcement}} caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders' words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders {{not to make}} a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders' speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Also Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.|$|E
5|$|Lindemann's first gunnery officer—Lieutenant Commander Adalbert Schneider—had {{been awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 27 May 1941. Traditionally, the {{commanding}} officer would have received this award before any other crew member was so honoured. This exception had been criticized by various <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Wehrmacht. It is thought likely that Ernst Lindemann's cousin, the former General der Kavallarie (General of the Cavalry) Georg Lindemann, intervened. Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, with whom Lindemann shared a 20-year comradeship dating to {{the early days of}} the Reichsmarine, presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Mrs Lindemann on Tuesday, 6 January 1942, in Dahlem. Raeder went on to provide moral and emotional support to Lindemann's mother and widow.|$|E

50|$|Apollonian circles are two {{families}} of circles such that every <b>circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first family intersects every <b>circle</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second family orthogonally, and vice versa. These circles {{form the basis}} for bipolar coordinates. They were discovered by Apollonius of Perga, a renowned Greek geometer.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{important}} mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the {{solution to the problem of}} Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.|$|E
5|$|This {{disparity}} between the sizes of the megaliths is unparalleled among the other surviving stone <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dorset area, {{and may have been}} a deliberate choice by the circle's builders, perhaps reflecting sexual symbolism. There are a number of similar circles in south-western Scotland, for example the Loupin' Stones, Ninestane Rigg, and Burgh Hill, all of which share the architectural feature of having two taller stones on their perimeters. Potentially supporting this link between Dorset and south-western Scotland {{is the fact that the}} Grey Mare and her Colts—a chambered long barrow located two and a half miles south-west of the Nine Stones—displays architectural similarities with the Clyde-Solway tradition of chambered long barrows.|$|E
5|$|Joyce {{enrolled}} at the recently established University College Dublin (UCD) in 1898, studying English, French and Italian. He became active in theatrical and literary <b>circles</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city. In 1900 his laudatory review of Henrik Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken was published in The Fortnightly Review; {{it was his first}} publication and, after learning basic Norwegian to send a fan letter to Ibsen, he received a letter of thanks from the dramatist. Joyce wrote a number of other articles and at least two plays (since lost) during this period. Many of the friends he made at University College Dublin appeared as characters in Joyce's works. His closest colleagues included leading figures of the generation, most notably, Tom Kettle, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and Oliver St. John Gogarty. Joyce was first introduced to the Irish public by Arthur Griffith in his newspaper, United Irishman, in November 1901. Joyce had written an article on the Irish Literary Theatre and his college magazine refused to print it. Joyce had it printed and distributed locally. Griffith himself wrote a piece decrying the censorship of the student James Joyce. In 1901, the National Census of Ireland lists James Joyce (19) as an English- and Irish-speaking scholar living with his mother and father, six sisters and three brothers at Royal Terrace (now Inverness Road), Clontarf, Dublin.|$|E
