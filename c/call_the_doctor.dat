5|$|Dig Me Out is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> drummer Janet Weiss of Quasi joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has been}} caught in a strange cloud belt. They <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E

The main characters continue to fight the Daleks until they <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> to save them.

500|$|The Hot Rock is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed third album Dig Me Out, released in 1997by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars. After {{the success of}} Dig Me Out and its predecessor <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> several major record labels grew interested in the band and offered them recording contracts, but the band ultimately decided to remain on Kill Rock Stars. As singer and guitarist Corin Tucker recalls, [...] "We want to project the image that we're successful". Co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein added, [...] "And we're proud that we've {{been able to do}} that from a tiny label [...] We've been able to do it non-traditionally, and hopefully that's inspiring and encouraging to people".|$|E
500|$|Two {{songs from}} the album, [...] "One More Hour" [...] and [...] "Little Babies", were {{released}} as singles by Matador Records on June 1, 1998, and September 7, 1998, respectively. The first single features the song [...] "I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone" [...] from <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> as the B-side, while the second single features [...] "I'm Not Waiting", also from their previous album. The compact disc version of [...] "One More Hour" [...] includes a third song, [...] "Don't Think You Wanna", which was originally released on the band's debut album Sleater-Kinney. The song [...] "Dig Me Out" [...] peaked at number six on the KEXP Top 90.3 Album Chart in 1997 without being released as a single.|$|E

500|$|Musically, Dig Me Out was {{considered}} rockier than its predecessor. Weiss' drumming style {{was influenced by}} traditional rock and roll bands such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, and The Kinks, as well as numerous blues rock musicians such as Lightnin' Hopkins, Muddy Waters, Billy Boy Arnold, and Bessie Smith, among others. Both Tucker and Brownstein remarked that Weiss became {{an essential part of}} the band's sound. According to Tucker, [...] "Musically, she's completed our band. She's become the bottom end and the solidness that we've really wanted for our songwriting". In addition to playing drums, Weiss provides hand claps and tambourine in [...] "Turn It On". Dig Me Out also contains more guitar and vocal interplay by Tucker and Brownstein than <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> As Brownstein explains, [...] "If you were to separate our guitar parts I don't necessarily think they would fully stand on their own. Our songs [...] aren't really complete until the other person has put their part over it, and their vocals".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor.</b> It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of {{the science}} fiction blog io9 called Davies [...] "the gay Michael Bay" [...] and [...] "wished {{for the first time}} that Davies would stay on to produce a fifth season" [...] of Doctor Who. She [...] "loved all the silly plot devices and loopy plot twists" [...] such as Project Indigo, the Osterhagen Key, the concept of using [...] "every {{telephone}} in England" [...] to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> and the fact that Davros was unable to cultivate a Dalek army [...] "without slicing his own torso up". Anders praised Bleach's portrayal of Davros for capturing [...] "the character's mixture of curiosity, manipulativeness and mania better than anyone since [...] Michael Wisher". She also commended the [...] "super-heroics" [...] in the episode, such as Wilf's attack on a Dalek with a paintball gun, Gwen and Ianto's final scene, and the [...] "glowing nobility" [...] of Harriet Jones' sacrifice to help the Doctor: Closing her review, she expressed excitement for [...] "Journey's End", saying the final scene left her with a [...] "feeling like [...] no clue how it could be resolved, even using crazy RTD logic".|$|E

2500|$|As {{with many}} of the Church of Scientology's programs, the Volunteer Ministers have {{generated}} controversy and criticism. The organization provides [...] "spiritual relief" [...] parallel with medical treatment, but also does simple tasks such as helping cleanup or fetch food and generally assist the disaster effort as seems indicated. They have been accused of attempting to take advantage of disasters in order to promote Scientology to a grief-stricken populace. Scientology assists are given parallel to medical treatment, not in place of it. [...] Assists are generally designed to orient a person in present time. [...] The Handbook for Scientology Assists stresses in its basic guidelines: [...] "Always seek first aid and medical attention when needed. [...] An assist is not a substitute for medical attention or treatment by a qualified doctor. [...] First, <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> [...] Then assist the person as you can." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the moment}} I cursed {{the laws of}} man, I cursed myself. I accused my father.

Preoccupied with her own troubles, she gave no particular attention to the incident, but hurried on upon her errand.|$|E

60|$|We {{have all}} pretty good health, latterly, and have seldom had to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor.</b> The {{children}} {{have been in the}} open air pretty constantly for months now.

Dora did not like this at all. She was sure that the Son of Mist, as she was naughty enough to <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>doctor,</b> would only hamper them, and she was only half consoled by being told that there was no objection to her collecting a few of the children on Sunday and trying to teach them, and in the meantime acquaintance might be made with the mothers.|$|E
5000|$|AllMusic {{reviewer}} Jason Ankeny commented: [...] "Forget {{the riot}} grrrl implications {{inherent in the}} trio's music — <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> is pure, undiluted punk, and it's brilliant". Johnny Huston, writing for Spin, remarked that <b>Call</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> [...] "trades sex-worker role-playing, doll parts, gender-bending, and other common female-rock tropes for stories of everyday struggle ... Sleater-Kinney proves that punk still offers new ways to say no". The album appeared at number three in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1996.
