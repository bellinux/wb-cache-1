5|$|Reinforcements {{arrived by}} glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), {{bringing}} additional troops and heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed {{far from their}} drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing, <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wooden fuselage, {{and in some cases}} crushing personnel on board.|$|E

The two are sent flying and <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> record building, Perry using the PFT tape to latch himself safely on a flag pole in the resulting free fall, while Doofenshmirtz plummets to the ground, landing on top of a mattress placed on top of a parked truck. Unfortunately, the truck belongs to a folding mattress company and Doofenshmirtz is crushed by the mattress and then crushed by his own robot immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The mall {{was plagued}} by {{structural}} problems and leaks throughout its history. It underwent a partial structural failure on June 23, 2012, when a 12m x 24m (39'-by-79') segment of the rooftop parking deck collapsed into the building, <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> upper level lottery kiosk adjacent to the food court and escalators to the ground floor below. More than 20 people received non-life-threatening injuries and two {{people died in the}} collapse. An investigation and class action lawsuits into the collapse are ongoing and the mall has been demolished.|$|E

She goes to Jennifer's home and sees her, already recovered, picking out her next victims in her yearbook. <b>Crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{window with a}} box cutter, Needy fights Jennifer and stabs her in the heart, {{destroying}} the demon and killing her. Jennifer's mother enters and finds Needy with the box cutter {{on top of her}} daughter's body. Soon after, Needy is brought to an asylum. As she was bitten non-fatally by Jennifer, she manifests some of Jennifer's supernatural powers, such as the ability to hover in the air. Desiring revenge for what was done to her, Jennifer, and Chip, Needy escapes the mental facility and hitchhikes a ride to the hotel where Low Shoulder are staying; there, she slaughters the members, whose killings are later discovered by local authorities.|$|E
25|$|Pangolins, {{a type of}} mammal {{covered in}} thick scales, roll into a tight ball when threatened.

25|$|In 2003, the Sci Fi Channel {{sponsored}} a {{scientific study of}} the area and related records by the Coalition for Freedom of Information. The most significant finding of the scientific team was a line of damaged trees broken at the top leading to the site where some eyewitnesses said they saw the object embedded in the soil along with associated fresh tree damage. Furthermore, tree core samples dated the damage to 1965. This provided physical evidence that something airborne may have come <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trees and landed in the woods. (However, one of the scientists instead suggested ice damage to the trees.) Minor soil disturbance was also found at the alleged landing site. Another witness reported hearing a pair of loud, horrific screams {{as members of the}} military approached the object on foot.|$|E

25|$|Petrović died in {{a traffic}} {{accident}} at approximately 17:20 on June 7, 1993, {{four and a half}} months before his 29th birthday. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi truck at Denkendorf, near Ingolstadt, in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the truck driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> median barrier and finally coming to a stop blocking all three lanes of traffic in the opposite direction (Munich). Seconds later, the VW Golf carrying a sleeping Petrović in the passenger seat crashed into the truck, killing him and leaving the driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrović was romantically involved, and Hilal Edebal, a female Turkish basketball player, with grave injuries. It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and that Petrović was not buckled with a seatbelt.|$|E

Locals claimed it was the longest home run ever hit in St. Louis. Meusel then hit a single in right field, but was tagged out as he tried to head for second base. Gehrig followed with a double to the opposite side, but could not score when Lazzeri popped up to Thevenow to end the inning.|$|E

500|$|Raised to {{squadron}} leader, Scherger {{was posted}} to England in August 1934 {{to study at}} RAF Staff College, Andover. Just prior to departing, {{he was involved in}} a notorious incident at RAAF Station Laverton. A fellow squadron leader arrived home early from a mess function to find his wife sleeping with another officer, who escaped by <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> bedroom window. The squadron leader then pursued his wife with a loaded revolver, the pair eventually arriving at Scherger's quarters. Faced with the frightened woman and the enraged husband crying that he would [...] "shoot the bitch", Scherger knocked the man down with a poker. The unconscious husband was placed in the guardhouse, and the woman given shelter off the base; the officer she had slept with promptly resigned his commission.|$|E
500|$|References to Shaun of the Dead {{are also}} present in the film. In one scene, Nicholas wants to chase a {{shoplifter}} by jumping over garden fences; however, Danny is reluctant. Nicholas says, [...] "What's the matter, Danny? You never taken a shortcut before?" [...] He smiles assuredly before jumping over {{three in a row}} (according to the DVD commentary, Pegg vaulted over three fences, and a stunt man did a back flip over the fourth). When Danny attempts it, he trips and falls through the fence. This is almost identical to a scene in Shaun of the Dead, including the fall-through-fence gag, albeit with the pratfalling role reverse: in Shaun of the Dead it happens to Pegg's character rather than Frost's, and he falls over the fence rather than through it. The DVD commentary says that Frost purposely looked back at the camera after <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fence, to show that he had done the stunt rather than someone else.|$|E
500|$|... "Stress Relief" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Time magazine {{named it}} the best overall television episode of any series in 2009. [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was voted the third highest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally; the episode was rated 8.89 out of 10. Stanley's heart attack in response to Dwight's fake fire drill ranked number 10 in phillyBurbs.coms top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office. Many critics particularly praised the opening scene, in which Dwight panics his co-workers by simulating a fire. The sequence included scenes such as Kevin looting a vending machine amid the chaos, Oscar's legs <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ceiling {{as he tries to}} crawl out, Angela tossing her cat through an open ceiling tile only for it to fall through another tile, and Andy's reaction to a series of popping caps: [...] "The fire is shooting at us!" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the past}} once again, Peter {{suggests}} to Lois {{that they see}} the 1983 film Krull instead. Later, Peter and Cleveland, dressed up as Michael Jackson in the iconic red jacket of his video clip [...] "Thriller," [...] dance to the Beverly Hills Cop theme. In order to make everything right about the future, Peter and Brian decide to sneak into the prom through a vent. While inside it, Peter recites {{a line from the}} 1988 action film Die Hard. The sequence that follows is a parody of the 1985 film Back to the Future. After <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> vent to the stage, the band begins playing [...] "Earth Angel" [...] by The Penguins, and, after Peter kisses Lois, Brian sings the 1987 single [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up" [...] by musician Rick Astley. While Brian sings [...] "Never Gonna Give You Up", Rick Astley's cousin Marvin calls him to say he's found the [...] "mediocre, generic sound" [...] that Astley has been looking for, a reference to Back to the Future.

500|$|Much of [...] "Closing Time" [...] {{was filmed}} in a {{department}} store in Cardiff. As the store had to be closed, they filmed over four or five nights, sometimes going until 6:00 in the morning. Hughs {{said it was a}} [...] "drain" [...] on the production team, while Corden recalled it made the cast and crew [...] "lightheaded" [...] and [...] "hysterical". Reportedly, the department store scenes were shot in March 2011. The rest of the episode was filmed in a private home in Cardiff; the couple who owned the house allowed the filming to take place in order for it to be an experience for their two young boys. Production at the house also went into {{the early hours of the}} morning. The window of the sliding door in the house that the Doctor jumps through to save Craig from the Cybermat was too small, so the production team built another one. The new door was too big for shatterglass; instead, glass that breaks into chunks was used, wired with a small explosive that would crack the glass when Smith's stuntman jumped through it. Hughs wanted it to look as if the audience was <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window with the Doctor; he spliced together shots of Smith filmed running up to the door, the stuntman jumping through it, and Smith landing with shards of glass thrown over him.|$|E
500|$|In the center, the 82nd Airborne {{were able}} to {{consolidate}} their position at Sainte-Mère-Église {{in part due to}} the work of First Lieutenant Turner Turnbull and a squad of 43 men, who held off {{for more than two hours}} a far larger enemy force that was attempting to retake the crossroads from the north. A task force led by Colonel Edson Raff that included 16 Sherman tanks of the 746th Tank Battalion, four armored cars, and a squad of infantry worked their way up from the beach, but were stopped from reinforcing Sainte-Mère-Église by a line of German defenders [...] south of the town. Reinforcements arrived by glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), bringing additional troops and heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed far from their drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as Jeeps shifting during landing, <b>crashing</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> wooden fuselage, and in some cases crushing personnel on board. German defenders also took a toll on the glider units, with heavy losses inflicted in the area near Sainte-Mère-Église in particular. Members of the 82nd Airborne who had landed west of the Merderet were widely scattered and surrounded by enemy forces. They quickly realized that they would be unable to achieve their D-day objectives and would have to wait for reinforcements. It took several days for this to happen as the Germans set up defensive positions along the river. For 36 hours, 82nd Airborne were unable to establish radio contact with other units or with Collins aboard his command ship, [...]|$|E
