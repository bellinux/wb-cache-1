5|$|Continued drought, road competition, and {{rationalisation}} of intrastate freight {{operations have}} seen this change in recent years, {{with an average of}} only 6.1 million tonnes of intrastate freight carried from each year between 1996 and 1998; and containers now being the major traffic, with residual cement, logs, quarry, and steel trains operating. By the 1990s road transport has captured most general freight traffic, with less than carload traffic was discontinued in July 2007 {{with the end of the}} Fastrack freight service. An exception to the decline is interstate operations, with intermodal <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> growing due to competition between private operators.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Aarhus {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} ports in northern Europe with the largest container terminal in Denmark, processing more than 50% of Denmark's <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> and accommodating the largest container vessels in the world. It is a municipal self-governing port with independent finances. The facilities handle some 9.5million tonnes of cargo a year (2012). Grain is the principal export, while feedstuffs, stone, cement and coal are among the chief imports. Since 2012 the port has faced increasing competition from the Port of Hamburg and freight volumes have decreased somewhat from the peak in 2008.|$|E

40|$|As Vancouver’s ports become busier so too does local <b>container</b> truck <b>traffic.</b> Additional {{trucking}} exacerbates {{local road}} congestion during peak hours, a problem projected {{to increase in}} the future. The increased time spent in congestion also creates environmental concern as diesel trucks emit large amounts of pollutants. This study develops and assesses four policy options aimed at reducing <b>container</b> truck <b>traffic</b> in Vancouver during peak hours by using a longitudinal case study of Los Angeles. Data from Los Angeles indicate extending gate hours and charging container trucks fees during peak hours significantly shifted <b>container</b> truck <b>traffic</b> out of peak hours. Generated policy options considered in this study include: (1) continuing with the status quo; (2) initiating short-sea shipping; (3) extending terminal hours with and (4) without peak hour fees. These options are assessed and the study recommends Vancouver 2 ̆ 7 s container terminals extend gate hours and with a peak hour fee...|$|R
5|$|Nowadays, large {{quantities}} of goods are transported by sea, especially across the Atlantic and around the Pacific Rim. A major trade route passes through the Pillars of Hercules, across the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean and through the Straits of Malacca; much trade also passes through the English Channel. Shipping lanes are the routes on the open sea used by cargo vessels, traditionally making use of trade winds and currents. Over 60 percent of the world's <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> is conveyed on the top twenty trade routes. Increased melting of Arctic ice since 2007 enables ships to travel the Northwest Passage for some weeks in summer, avoiding the longer routes via the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal. Shipping is supplemented by air freight, a more expensive process mostly used for particularly valuable or perishable cargoes. Seaborne trade carries more than US $4 trillion worth of goods each year.|$|E
25|$|The Port of Oslo is {{developing}} a new container terminal at Sjursøya. There is {{a significant amount of}} <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> from the port to Alnabru, which is currently transported by road. If better infrastructure was established, this traffic could be transported by rail.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there are}} up to 22 weekday freight train {{movements}} per day through the Kaimai Tunnel, and up to 19 movements per day during the weekends.

25|$|The {{increasing}} demand for <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> {{which is more}} efficient when utilizing the double-stack car also has network effect issues with existing electrifications due to insufficient clearance of overhead electrical lines for these trains, but electrification can be built or modified to have sufficient clearance, at additional cost.|$|E
25|$|Freight {{services}} {{using the}} full length of the line fell as low as a single service each weekday, with services to/from the north routed via the SOL and then the NIMT.

30|$|The {{international}} {{factors were}} analyzed based {{on the presence of}} internationally competitive Related and Supporting Industries. (1) Cotton exports and (2) yarn exports were used to indicate how strong these industries were in the global market through its expansion into related and supporting international industries (Table  1). These two proxies were adopted also because cotton and yard consumption is heavily driving G&T industry. In addition, infrastructure for international transportation are important for improving international competiveness because they facilitate international trade transactions and increase the levels of multinational activities with higher efficiency (Daniel 2000; ITS Global 2008). Therefore, (3) <b>container</b> port <b>traffics</b> and (4) the number of registered air departures worldwide were used to represent the ability to ship goods abroad. While <b>container</b> port <b>traffic</b> measures the flow of containers from land to sea transport modes in 20 -foot equivalent units (TEU), the registered air departures provides information on the number of domestic takeoffs and takeoffs abroad of air carriers registered in the country.|$|R
25|$|Today the Trans-Siberian Railway carries about 200,000 {{containers}} {{per year}} to Europe. Russian Railways intends to at least double the volume of <b>container</b> <b>traffic</b> on the Trans-Siberian and is developing a fleet of specialised cars and increasing terminal capacity at the ports {{by a factor of}} 3 to 4.
