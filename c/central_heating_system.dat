5|$|Largely due to {{immigration}} from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish population of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, {{and then to}} 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue became too small to accommodate {{the needs of the}} ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken {{to increase the number of}} available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> was installed in 1933.|$|E
25|$|At {{customer}} {{level the}} heat network is usually {{connected to the}} <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> of the dwellings via heat exchangers (heat substations): the working fluids of both networks (generally water or steam) do not mix.

25|$|An {{efficiently}} insulated tank can retain {{stored heat}} for days, reducing fuel costs. Hot water tanks {{may have a}} built-in gas or oil burner system, electric immersion heaters. Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system,</b> or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, electric immersion elements, or a district heating scheme.|$|E
25|$|In 1814, Georgiana Whitmore, a {{daughter}} of William Whitmore and sister of the budding politician, married computing pioneer Charles Babbage. Babbage lived at Dudmaston Hall for significant periods and even engineered the <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> Their son Henry Prevost Babbage's 1910 Analytical Engine Mill was on display at Dudmaston Hall until the 1980s, after which it {{was moved to the}} Science Museum in London.|$|E
25|$|The {{house has}} 18 rooms. The Hubbards {{emphasized}} beauty and utility in the house's design.

The home {{was also one of}} the first in the area to have a telephone and electricity. Hubbard was unsure whether electricity would become standard, so he installed lights that operated on both gas and electrical power.|$|E

25|$|Event-driven SOA {{software}} {{could allow}} homeowners to customize {{many different types}} of electricity devices found within their home to a desired level of comfort or economy. The event-driven software could also automatically respond to changing electricity prices, in as little as five-minute intervals. For example, to reduce the home owner's electricity usage in peak periods (when electricity is most expensive), the software could automatically lower the target temperature of the thermostat on the <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> (in winter) or raise the target temperature of the thermostat on the central cooling system (in summer).|$|E
25|$|Because it is {{situated}} in a fairly rural area, the UConn campus at Storrs has facilities that {{allow it to be}} virtually self-sufficient. All heat on campus is steam, and where possible sidewalks were laid over the underground connectors to keep the snow off. In 2005, a cogeneration plant was activated, which generates most of the electricity for the campus, and uses the exhaust steam for the campus <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system.</b> The university owns its own public water system and waste water treatment facility. With the support {{of a growing number of}} industry leaders based in Connecticut, UConn is at the forefront of developing clean, alternative sources of renewable energy using fuel cell technology. In April 2012, UConn commissioned a fuel cell power plant at its Depot Campus that will supply the campus with clean and efficiency energy, cooling and heating. The installation of a ClearEdge Power, former UTC Power, PureCell System is the latest step by UConn to reduce its carbon footprint and build a sustainable community. The fuel cell installation was made possible through a federal stimulus grant from Connecticut’s Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority.|$|E
500|$|Inside {{the main}} {{entrance}} is a vestibule which then leads via an octagonal room, with a bowed cast-iron railed balcony and a domed ceiling, to the main auditorium. A correspondent of the Bristol Mercury, in 1846, described an ingenious <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> consisting of a cast iron stove which heated and circulated air, [...] "using {{less than half a}} cwt. [...] of Welsh anthracite in twenty-four hours", kept the interior of the building some 30 to 40°F (16 to 22°C) higher than the external temperature. Much of the interior was remodelled in the mid-20th century, although some period plaster decorations remain in the Regency room. From 1873 the main auditorium housed a large organ originally built for the Royal Panopticon of Arts and Science in Leicester Square, from where it was removed to St Paul's Cathedral and thence to the Victoria Rooms. In July 1899 it was decided to replace this with an electric organ, which could be played from a keyboard at a considerable distance from the organ itself. The organ was built by Norman & Beard, and was first played by Edwin Lemare on 31 October 1900; On 1 December 1934, a fire started under the stage of the great hall or auditorium, quickly spreading. The Times reported that [...] "The brigades were able to no more than prevent the fire from extending to the Lesser Hall and the recreation rooms. The fine electric organ was completely destroyed." ...|$|E
50|$|The pellet fuel is {{delivered}} from the storage facility {{or the day}} tank (single stoves) into the combustion chamber. With the heat generated, circuit water is heated in the pellet boiler. In <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>systems</b> the hot water then runs through the heating circuit.

2500|$|MacVicar {{designed}} the Blantyre Mission {{as a model}} of the British teaching hospital. [...] The hospital had two wards for African males and one ward for African women. [...] There were two beds for European patients. [...] There was more light in the hospital operating room than at other hospitals in the area. [...] This light served to improve the effectiveness of the doctors, but caused anxiety in the patients. [...] The African patients thought bad spirits could come through the windows. [...] It also contained a <b>central</b> <b>heating</b> <b>system</b> through an underground fire chamber. [...] MacVicar maintained detailed records of the treatments given at the hospital. [...] By 1905, the average hospital stay of patients at the Blantyre Mission was about half of what patients experienced at the UMCA hospital.
