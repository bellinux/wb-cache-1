50|$|As carrier {{networks}} are evolving to IP, customers with strict bandwidth, delay, and security requirements prefer SDH(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) networks. To retain these customers, carriers must maintain both IP and SDH networks, which incurs significant maintenance costs.

5000|$|Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is {{a network}} {{architecture}} concept that enables cloud computing capabilities and an IT service environment {{at the edge}} of the cellular network. [...] The basic idea behind MEC is that by running applications and performing related processing tasks closer to the cellular <b>customer,</b> <b>network</b> congestion is reduced and applications perform better. MEC technology is designed to be implemented at the cellular base stations, and enables flexible and rapid deployment of new applications and services for customers. Combining elements of information technology and telecommunications networking, MEC also allows cellular operators to open their radio access network (RAN) to authorized third-parties, such as application developers and content providers.|$|E
50|$|An Ethernet {{interface}} is {{much cheaper}} than a {{synchronous digital hierarchy}} (SONET/SDH) or plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) interface of the same bandwidth. Another distinct advantage of an Ethernet-based access network {{is that it can}} be easily connected to the <b>customer</b> <b>network,</b> due to the prevalent use of Ethernet in corporate and, more recently, residential networks.A typical service provider's network is a collection of switches and routers connected through optical fiber. The topology could be a ring, hub-and-spoke (star), or full or partial mesh. The network will also have a hierarchy: core, distribution (aggregation), and access. The core in most cases is an existing IP/MPLS backbone but may migrate to newer forms of Ethernet transport in the form of 10Gbit/s, 40Gbit/s, or 100Gbit/s speeds or even possibly 400Gbit/s to Terabit Ethernet network in the future.|$|E

40|$|Today’s Internet routing {{architecture}} faces many challenges, {{ranging from}} scaling problems, security threats, poor fault diagnosis to inadequate support for traffic engineering and customer multihoming. By analyzing these challenges and learning lessons from previously proposed solutions, we gain two fundamental insights for designing a secure and scal-able routing architecture: cutting a clear boundary between <b>customer</b> <b>networks</b> and transit providers, and embedding es-sential {{information in the}} address structure. We propose the Secure and Scalable Internet Routing Architecture (SIRA), a clean-slate design that separates provider <b>networks</b> from <b>customer</b> <b>networks</b> and embeds organization and location information in address structure. The resulting system pro-vides dramatic improvements in scalability, security, fault diagnosis, and multihoming and traffic engineering support. We also identify new design issues raised by SIRA and sketch out straw-man solutions. 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{address the}} {{trade-off}} between new product innovativeness and speed to market caused by customer participation activities, the author differentiates two dimensions of customer participation - customer participation as an information resource (CPI) and customer participation as a codeveloper (CPC) - and explores the moderating effects of downstream <b>customer</b> <b>network</b> connectivity and new {{product development process}} interdependence and complexity. Matched data collected from 143 customer-component manufacturer dyads indicate that CPI has a negative influence on innovativeness when downstream <b>customer</b> <b>network</b> connectivity is high but a positive effect when it is low. In contrast, CPI has {{a positive effect on}} speed to market when downstream <b>customer</b> <b>network</b> connectivity is high and no significant effect when it is low. In addition, CPC undermines new product speed to market when process interdependence is high. In contrast, CPC can improve new product speed to market but hurt new product innovativeness when process interdependence is low. The results of this article provide specific managerial guidelines as to how to manage customer participation to improve new product innovativeness and speed to market. © 2008, American Marketing Association.
