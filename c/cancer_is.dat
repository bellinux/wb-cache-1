5|$|Diagnosis of endometrial <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> made {{first by}} a {{physical}} examination and dilation and curettage (removal of endometrial tissue; D). This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer. If <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> found, medical imaging may {{be done to}} see whether the cancer has spread or invaded tissue.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> {{not widely}} {{known by the}} general populace, despite its frequency. There is low {{awareness}} of the symptoms, {{which can lead to}} later diagnosis and worse survival.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Ovarian <b>cancers</b> <b>are</b> {{histological}}ly and genetically {{divided into}} type I or type II. Type I <b>cancers</b> <b>are</b> of low histological grade, and include endometrioid, mucinous, and clear-cell carcinomas. Type II <b>cancers</b> <b>are</b> of higher histological grade and include serous carcinoma and carcinosarcoma.|$|R
50|$|A {{validation}} study found Your Disease Risk to provide well calibrated estimates of cancer {{risk in the}} general population. For individual women, the discriminatory accuracy for colon <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> 0.67, for ovarian cancer 0.59, and for pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> 0.71. For individual men, the discriminatory accuracy for colon <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> 0.71 and for pancreatic <b>cancer</b> <b>was</b> 0.72. These values exceed the performance of many other cancer risk prediction tools.|$|R

5|$|The {{population}} segment {{most likely}} to develop lung <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> people aged over 50 who {{have a history of}} smoking. In contrast to the mortality rate in men, which began declining more than 20 years ago, women's lung cancer mortality rates have been rising over the last decades, and are just recently beginning to stabilize. In the USA, the lifetime risk of developing lung <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> 8% in men and 6% in women.|$|E
5|$|About 8% of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> due to {{inherited}} factors. In {{relatives of}} people with lung cancer, the risk is doubled. This is likely due {{to a combination of}} genes. Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6 and 15 are known to affect the risk of lung cancer.|$|E

5000|$|Approximately 98% of lung <b>cancers</b> <b>are</b> carcinoma, a term {{describing}} malignancies {{derived from}} transformed cells exhibiting characteristics of epithelium. About 2% of all lung <b>cancers</b> <b>are</b> non-carcinoma (mainly sarcoma, tumors of hematopoietic origin, or germ cell tumors.

5|$|Asbestos {{can cause}} a variety of lung diseases, {{including}} lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos have a synergistic effect on the formation of lung cancer. In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> increased 45-fold compared to the general population. Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma (which is different from lung cancer).|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> located on the lip, ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Breast <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> the secondest common {{cancer in}} the world and the commonest amongst women, as well as being amongst the ten commonest chronic {{diseases}} of women, and a substantial contributor to loss of quality of life (Gronowski and Schindler, Table IV). Globally, it accounts for 25% of all cancers. In 2016, breast <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> the commonest cancer diagnosed amongst women in both developed and developing countries, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases, and worldwide accounts for one and a half million cases and over half a million deaths, being the fifth commonest cause of cancer death overall and the second in developed regions. Geographic variation in incidence is the opposite of that of cervical cancer, being highest in Northern America and lowest in Eastern and Middle Africa, but mortality rates are relatively constant, resulting in a wide variance in case mortality, ranging from 25% in developed regions to 37% in developing regions, and with 62% of deaths occurring in developing countries.|$|E

HPV-positive cancers have better prognosis, especially for nonsmokers as compared to HPV-negative cancers.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Russos' studies found similar risk rates between virgin and {{pregnancy}} interrupted rats, their research would be used to support the contention that abortion created a greater risk of breast cancer for the next twenty years.

5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> {{located in the}} upper part of the uterus, and the cervix when the <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{cervical}} <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} commonest cancer amongst women, {{particularly those of}} lower socioeconomic status. Women in this group have reduced access to health care, high rates of child and forced marriage, parity, polygamy and exposure to STIs from multiple sexual contacts of male partners. All of these factors place them at higher risk. In developing countries, cervical cancer accounts for 12% of cancer cases amongst women and is the second leading cause of death, where about 85% of the global burden of over 500,000 cases and 250,000 deaths from this disease occurred in 2012. The highest incidence occurs in Eastern Africa, where with Middle Africa, cervical <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> the commonest cancer in women. The case fatality rate of 52% is also higher in developing countries than in developed countries (43%), and the mortality rate varies by 18-fold between regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to mortality, <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> {{a cause of}} considerable morbidity in women. Women have a lower lifetime probability of being diagnosed with cancer (38% vs 45% for men), but {{are more likely to}} be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age.|$|E
5|$|Invasion of bone by <b>cancer</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} common source of cancer pain.
