5|$|Government family-friendly {{initiatives}} such {{as child}} subsidies and cheaper child <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> can also greatly decrease the gender {{difference in the}} workplace, due to the woman being able to work longer hours outside the home. In addition, when developing policies related to paid work, {{it is important to}} do gender impact assessments in order {{to assess the impact of}} a policy on both the paid and unpaid sector.|$|E
30|$|This study {{conducted}} outpatient and inpatient analyses separately.

40|$|REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE The {{objective}} of this review is to enhance understanding of {{the experiences of the}} carers of older people when the person they have been providing care for is admitted permanently into a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility.</b> A secondary objective is to use the review findings to draw recommendations for enhancing policy and programming aimed at supporting caregivers of older individuals who have moved into a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> in Australia. The review question is: What is it like for carers when the person they have been caring for is moved into a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> permanently? INCLUSION CRITERIA Types of participants This review will consider carers of older people (65 years and over) from all countries who have experienced an individual they have been caring for move into a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> permanently, as well as carers {{of people who have been}} caring for some-one under 65 years of age, who move permanently into a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> with an age related condition. Whilst most individuals who enter a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility</b> will be adults 65 years and over, there are exemptions when people are under 65 years within Australia but have an age related condition requiring them to reside in a residential aged <b>care</b> <b>facility,</b> and carers of these people will be included. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are deemed eligible for aged care assessments at 50 years of age due to their shorter life expectancy...|$|R

5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> exist only in Bangui but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed and misused benzodiazepines in the United States. A large-scale nationwide U.S. government study conducted by SAMHSA found that, in the U.S., benzodiazepines are recreationally the most frequently used pharmaceuticals due to their widespread availability, accounting for 35% of all drug-related visits to hospital emergency and urgent <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Men and women are equally likely to use benzodiazepines recreationally. The report found that alprazolam is the most common benzodiazepine for recreational use, followed by clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam. The number of emergency room visits due to benzodiazepines increased by 36% between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E

5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals <b>Care</b> <b>facilities</b> in Greater St. Louis. The team would also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white circle on their jerseys. The patch will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already wearing it as his uniform number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Canberra Hospital {{was located}} on Acton Peninsula on Lake Burley Griffin; {{it was closed}} in 1991 and was {{demolished}} in 1997 in a controversial and fatal implosion to facilitate construction of the National Museum of Australia. The city has 10 aged <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Canberra's hospitals receive emergency cases from throughout southern New South Wales, and ACT Ambulance Service {{is one of four}} operational agencies of the ACT Emergency Services Authority. NETS provides a dedicated ambulance service for inter-hospital transport of sick newborns within the ACT and into surrounding New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the exact}} extent of losses was unclear, the {{earthquake}} caused further damage to many structures in Christchurch; {{approximately half of}} the buildings in the centre of the city were already damaged or destroyed by previous strong earthquakes. Preliminary assessments indicate over 100 additional buildings were rendered beyond repair in the area. Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a road intersection in the city to collapse. Multiple hospitals and residential <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in Christchurch were left without essential services, and some reported considerable damage to infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Emergency Management Agency was {{activated}} on September 15, {{about three}} days prior to Isabel making landfall and entering the state. Officials in Hampton issued the first mandatory evacuation in the state on September 17, about 35hours prior to landfall. Elevenhours later, a mandatory evacuation was issued for some residents in Chesapeake, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach, with a recommended evacuation for some residents {{in the city of}} Suffolk and Isle of Wight, Northumberland, Richmond, and York counties. Later on September 17 Governor Mark Warner provided authorization for all recommended evacuations to become mandatory. By the time Isabel entered Virginia late on September 18, evacuations were also issued for Accomack County, Chincoteague, Gloucester County, Lancaster County, Mathews County, Newport News, Poquoson, Portsmouth, and Westmoreland County. The zones ordered to evacuate included residents along waterfronts, in areas prone to flooding, potentially affected by storm surge from a Category 2 hurricane, low-lying areas, health <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> or islands. The tools officials used to determine the evacuation zones included shelter locations, the SLOSH storm surge model, evacuation maps, and clearance times.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported {{in the rest of the}} world, with the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health <b>care</b> <b>facilities,</b> equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E
