Sixty-five mammals, comprising Didelphis albiventris, <b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous,</b> Lycalopex vetulus, Cebus apella, Dasyprocta azarae, Dasypus novemcinctus, Procyon cancrivorus and Nasua nasua, were captured. Blood samples were collected for parasite cultivation. Antibodies were investigated by direct agglutination test (DAT) using Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis as antigen. Flagellates were observed in blood cultures of 14 (35. 9 %) Didelphis albiventris.

Methods: This study aimed to evaluate the presence of Leishmania spp. and Leishmania chagasi DNA by PCR in tissue samples (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, heart, mesenteric lymph node and adrenal gland) from 70 road-killed wild animals. Results: DNA was detected in tissues of one Cavia aperea (Brazilian guinea pig), five <b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous</b> (crab-eating fox), one Dasypus septemcinctus (seven-banded armadillo), two Didelphis albiventris (white-eared opossum), one Hydrochoerus hydrochoeris (capybara), two Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater), one Procyon cancrivorus (crab-eating raccoon), two Sphiggurus spinosus (porcupine) and one Tamandua tetradactyla (lesser anteater) from different locations in the Central Western part of Sao Paulo state.

The {{aim of this study}} is to report a case of intersexuality with probable absence of gonadal tissue in the crab-eating fox (<b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous)</b> native to Brazil. The animal has male external genitalia, but its prepuce and penis were both hypoplastic. Because of a clinical suspicion of bilateral cryptorchidism, a laparotomy was performed and the absence of prostate and gonads were revealed. The procedure also revealed vas deferentia, extending laterally from the each side of the bladder basis to the right and left abdominal wall muscles. The animal died one month later, and post mortem examination confirmed the absence of prostatic and gonadal tissues. Muscular structures similar to uterine horns and cervix were founded macroscopically and confirmed by optic microscopy. In addition, post mortem findings corroborate with penis hypoplasia, since penile bone presence was observed. The vasa deferentia had a normal tissue structure, although hypoplastic.

40|$|Patterns of {{geographic}} {{variation of the}} canid <b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous</b> have historically been obscured by its remarkable intraspecific morphological variability. The observed distribution is highly associated with phytophysiognomy, a feature considered highly dynamic along geological time. In the present study, we tested whether vegetation distribution during the Holocene Glacial Maximum of South America (HGM) explains the patterns of morphological variation within <b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous.</b> The species was divided in groups according to paleohabitats that could support their presence during the HGM, and then tested for differences in skull morphometrics. The results obtained demonstrate that the climatic changes during the HGM influenced the population structure of this species, resulting in the establishment {{of geographic}}al groups with different degrees of morphological cohesion. Higher morphological cohesion found in the Northern group might be explained by the marked discontinuity between its geographical range {{and the rest of the}} species`distribution. The Eastern and Southern morphological divergence is less striking and, although this could be related to past vegetation distribution, the disappearance of those barriers leads to a population structure that could be slowly breaking down.

The objective {{of this paper was}} to provide a detailed histological description of the trachea and bronchial tree of the crab-eating fox <b>Cerdocyon</b> <b>thous</b> (Linnaeus, 1766). The specimens (one adult male and one adult female) used were provided by the Federal University of Pelotas (Pelotas, RS, Brazil) Rehabilitation Center of Wild Fauna (NURFS). Tissue samples were fixed in 10 % formalin and included in paraffin. After slicing, samples were stained with HE (hematoxylin and eosin), PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) and resorcin fuchsin. Trachea had an average diameter of 7. 87 mm, and approximately 57 % of the mucosa ciliated pseudo-stratified columnar epithelium was composed of goblet cells, mostly in the dorsal region. Bronchia and bronchioles had a mucosal fold with higher number of goblet cells. Using all these techniques there is no great remarkable differences from C. thous trachea and lung, when compared with the previous described structures for carnivores and most mammals, except for the goblet cells “regionalization”.

This animal presents seven cervical vertebrae, and from the third on, they become shorter and wider than the other ones e the spinous process was makeable from the fifth cervical vertebrae on. There are thirteen thoracic vertebrae and the spinous process of the lumbar vertebrae, which are seven, decreases from the fifth on. The sacrum is formed by two vertebrae and there are twenty or twenty one caudal vertebrae. It can be concluded that the crab-eating fox axial skeleton is similar to that of the domestic dog.
