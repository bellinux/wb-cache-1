25|$|The <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA), {{originally}} {{also called}} the Color/Graphics Adapter or IBM Color/Graphics Monitor Adapter, introduced in 1981, was IBM's first graphics card and first color display card for the IBM PC. For this reason, it also became that computer's first color computer display standard.|$|E
25|$|Most Wang PCs were {{released}} with a monochrome graphics adapter that supported a single video mode with text and graphics planes {{that could be}} scrolled independently, unlike IBM-compatible PCs of the time which required selecting a specific video mode to allow graphics. A <b>color</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> and Wang-branded color monitor were also available.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Amstrad {{entered the}} IBM PC-compatible arena with the PC1512 system. In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM graphics interface, and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the Monochrome Display Adapter or <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter.</b> Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E
50|$|In late 1982, IBM {{began work}} on the PCjr, a lower-priced variant of the IBM Personal Computer with {{improved}} graphics and sound. The PCjr's Video Gate Array video adapter could display up to 16 colors at a time—a major improvement over the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter's</b> four-color limit. The new sound chip, too, could output {{a wider range of}} tones than the PC speaker.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{after the}} launch of the IBM AT, the new Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> became {{available}} which could support 320×200 or 640×200 in 16 colors in addition to high-resolution 640×350 16 <b>color</b> <b>graphics.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Microsoft BASIC {{interpreter}} was {{supplied with}} the computer. It was highly customized for the Tandy 2000 hardware, particularly its high-resolution <b>color</b> <b>graphics.</b> Although IBM produced the Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> {{a little more}} than a year later (October 1984), the Microsoft BASIC interpreter would not support its greater color and resolution capabilities until 1988.|$|R
500|$|Bart's House of Weirdness was {{developed}} by Distinctive Software and published by Konami. It was announced by Konami at the June 1991 International Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was released in 1992 solely for the DOS platform, and was available for both <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) and Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), but not Video Graphics Array (VGA). Writers for UGO Networks have commented {{that the fact that}} Bart's House of Weirdness was released exclusively for DOS [...] "more than likely tells why its critical acclaim is zilch and fan support non-existent. It's surprising it got such a limited release, seeing it was published by Konami, who usually have no problem distributing games on a variety of platforms." [...] Similarly, a 1UP.com editor wrote that the game is [...] "unknown (there's not even a single video of it on YouTube)" [...] and that it [...] "deserves a little more coverage, if only to acknowledge its existence".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) and <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437. [...] Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. [...] Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|E
2500|$|Like the IBM PC {{with the}} {{contemporary}} <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter,</b> the video {{output of the}} BBC Micro could be switched by software between a number of display modes. These varied between 20 and 40-column text suitable for a domestic TV, to 80-column text best viewed with a high-quality RGB-connected monitor (The 80-column mode was often too blurred to view when using a domestic TV via the UHF output). [...] The variety of modes offered applications a flexible compromise between colour depth, resolution and memory economy. In the first models, the OS and applications were left with the RAM {{left over from the}} display mode.|$|E
50|$|Color {{capability}} {{was provided}} by the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> Option, which was a set of chips that were inserted into the empty sockets on the monochrome <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> provided for this purpose. Resolution for the color board was the same 640x400, non-interlaced, and eight colors out of a palette of sixteen available colors were displayable on the Tandy CM-1 monitor (~$799). This was a particularly high-resolution and colorful display for its day. The CM-1 accepted, as input from the <b>color</b> <b>graphics</b> board, digital RGBI signals (indicating separate Red, Green, and Blue signals with an Intensity bit). CGA compatibility was hit-or-miss.|$|R

5000|$|As {{computers}} increasingly became graphically oriented, successive {{generations of}} <b>graphics</b> <b>adapters</b> began {{to push the}} limits of PCI, a bus with shared bandwidth. This {{led to the development}} of AGP, a [...] "bus" [...] dedicated to <b>graphics</b> <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{original}} IBM PC placed the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) memory map and other hardware in the 384 KB upper memory area (UMA). The need for more RAM grew faster than the needs of hardware to utilize the reserved addresses, which resulted in RAM eventually being mapped into these unused upper areas to utilize all available addressable space. This introduced a reserved [...] "hole" [...] (or several holes) into the set of addresses occupied by hardware {{that could be used}} for arbitrary data. Avoiding such a hole was difficult and ugly and not supported by DOS or most programs that could run on it. Later, space between the holes would be used as upper memory blocks (UMBs).|$|E
2500|$|Early {{personal}} computers {{of the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, such as those from Apple, Atari and Commodore, did not use RGB as their main method to manage colors, but rather composite video. [...] IBM introduced a 16-color scheme (four bits—one bit each for red, green, blue, and intensity) with the <b>Color</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA) for its first IBM PC (1981), later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) in 1984. The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphic card for PCs (the TARGA) was Truevision in 1987, {{but it was not}} until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array (VGA) in 1987 that RGB became popular, mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors. Actually, it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette-driven just like EGA, although with more freedom than VGA, but because the VGA connectors were analogue, later variants of VGA (made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA) eventually added truecolor. In 1992, magazines heavily advertised truecolor Super VGA hardware.|$|E

50|$|It {{was invented}} by F. Dill, D. Ling and R. Matick at IBM Research in 1980, with a patent issued in 1985 (US Patent 4,541,075). The first {{commercial}} use of VRAM was in a high-resolution <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> introduced in 1986 by IBM for the PC/RT system, which set a new standard for graphics displays. Prior {{to the development of}} VRAM, dual-ported memory was quite expensive, limiting higher resolution bitmapped graphics to high-end workstations. VRAM improved the overall framebuffer throughput, allowing low cost, high-resolution, high-speed, <b>color</b> <b>graphics.</b> Modern GUI-based operating systems benefitted from this and thus it provided a key ingredient for proliferation of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) throughout the world at that time.|$|R
