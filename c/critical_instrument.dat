40|$|S ince the April 2004 {{release of}} the CDNA(NH&MRC) Infection Control Guidelines,greater {{attention}} has been placed within everyday infection control onto risk management strategies. Tracking of <b>critical</b> <b>instruments</b> is exactly that- a risk management action which can be taken {{on the part of}} the practice at very low cost, but which can help prevent the potentially catas-trophic consequences of the following two scenarios (amongst others) : • A trainee or junior staff member who returns a set of oral surgical instruments to circulation from the sterilizing area, thinking that they have already been sterilized, when this is not the case (they have only been cleaned and packaged in preparation for sterilization). These instruments are then used unwittingly on other patients, raising the spectre of cross-contamination between patients; or • A patient who develops a post-surgical infection and then launches litigation against the practitioner for damages, alleging that the instruments used for surgery were not sterile at the point of use. Tracking <b>critical</b> <b>instruments</b> used in certain clin-ical procedures (such as oral surgery) back to a particular autoclave cycle is an administrative pro-cess which requires several actions: • Maintaining a comprehensive log of autoclave cycles at the time of loading; • Identifying which cycles <b>critical</b> <b>instruments</b> will be processed in; • Instituting a batch numbering system, either manually or with a labeling gun; • Placing batch codes on instrument packs; • Checking packs after autoclaving for batch num-bering data; • Completing the sign-off of the cycle release based on physical and chemical indicator results; and • Entering batch codes into patient records after surgical procedures. Rationale for tracking The recommendation for tracking critical instru-ments is contained in section 3. 5 of the 2004 CDNA guidelines. Tracking is recommended only for <b>critical</b> <b>instruments,</b> i. e. those that intentionally enter or penetrate a sterile tissue, cavity or the bloodstream, because of the risk of introducing infection into these sites. Single use instruments do not require tracking, however any reusable instruments used for the following procedures should be tracked:...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Valid, {{reliable}} critical appraisal tools advance {{quality improvement}} (QI) intervention impacts by helping stakeholders identify higher quality studies. QI approaches are diverse and differ from clinical interventions. Widely used <b>critical</b> appraisal <b>instruments</b> {{do not take}} unique QI features into account and existing QI tools (e. g., SQUIRE) are intended for publication guidance rather than critical appraisal. This study developed and psychometrically tested a <b>critical</b> appraisal <b>instrument,</b> the Quality Improvement Minimum Quality Criteria Set (QIMQCS) for assessing QI-specific features of QI publications. Methods: Approaches to developing the tool and ensuring validity included a literature review, in-person and online survey expert panel input, and application to empirical examples. We investigated psychometric properties {{in a set of}} diverse QI publications (N= 54) by analyzing reliability measures and item endorsement rates and explored sources of disagreement between reviewers. Results: The QIMQCS includes 16 content domains to evaluate QI intervention publications: Organizational Motivation, Intervention Rationale, Intervention Description, Organizational Characteristics, Implementation, Study Design, Comparator Description, Data Sources, Timing, Adherence / Fidelity, Health Outcomes, Organizational Readiness, Penetration / Reach, Sustainability, Spread, and Limitations. Median inter-rater agreement for QIMQCS items was kappa 0. 57 (83 % agreement). Item statistics indicated sufficient ability to differentiate between publications (median quality criteria met 67 %). Internal consistency measures indicated coherence without excessive conceptual overlap (absolute mean inter-item correlation = 0. 19).
