5|$|At {{the time}} of Wurster's and Ganzert's visit to the site, the entire bridge was buried by river sediments up to the {{springing}} line of the vaults. No efforts to dig them up were undertaken by Wurster and Ganzert. Only two of the 28 arches were exposed enough so that direct measurements of the <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> and the pier width could be undertaken. It was, however, possible to calculate {{the dimensions of the}} remaining bays from their exposed sections.|$|E
25|$|The Rose Carousel {{is housed}} within the 700 sq m (7,534 sq ft) Children’s Pavilion, {{which has a}} dome with a 23m (75ft) <b>clear</b> <b>span,</b> a full-fronted glass façade and a roof planted with native plant species. The {{pavilion}} also has an event room {{for such things as}} children’s birthday parties.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{pointed arch}} bridge by span was the Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia with a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of 17m. Constructed in the 5th or 6thcenturyAD across a {{tributary}} of the Euphrates, the now submerged structure is one of the earliest known examples of pointed architecture in late antiquity, and may even be the oldest surviving pointed arch bridge.|$|E
50|$|Common {{sizes are}} 8’-12’ diameter, with <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> over 100’. A variety of options exist for {{material}} type, paint and internal arrangements {{to complete the}} tubular gallery.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{originally}} measured 190 m in length, {{which is}} today reduced to 181.7 m. The <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> {{of the six}} arches from the right to the left riverside are 13.6, 23.4, 28.8, 27.4, 21.9 and 13.8 m.|$|R
50|$|From 1955-59, the Air Materiel Command Flight Test Center at Larson {{tested the}} B-52 bomber. Boeing built a huge hangar, 1068 ft long, 372 ft wide, with <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of 217 ft {{and able to}} hold eight B-52s under one roof.|$|R
25|$|On {{top of the}} weir, a roadway {{supported}} by originally at least forty arches ran along its entire length of around 500m. The pointed arches which dominate visually the present-day structure, or rather its remains, are testimony to numerous reconstruction and maintenance works executed in Islamic times. The typical <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of the Pol-e Kaisar was between 6.6 and 9m.|$|E
25|$|Roebling's next project, {{starting}} in 1851, was a railroad bridge connecting the New York Central and Great Western Railway of Canada over the Niagara River. Construction took four years. The bridge, with a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of 825 feet (251 m), {{was supported by}} four, ten-inch (25cm) wire cables, and had two levels, one for vehicles and one for rail traffic.|$|E
25|$|While the Niagara {{bridge was}} being built, Roebling {{undertook}} a railway suspension {{bridge across the}} Kentucky River, which required a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of 1,224 feet (373 m). The anchorage and stone towers were completed, and the cable wire delivered along with the material for the superstructure, when the railway company became insolvent. The bridge construction was halted. It was later completed as the first cantilever bridge in the US, with a truss for carrying the railway track.|$|E
50|$|It has Washed Out, Intake, Sluice and Roller Gates sets. Its <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> are 4.6% 1.53 meters. Its gate (opening) heights are 4.5 and 1.0 meters. The weights of {{the leaves}} are 5.4 and 1.0 tons. The {{operating}} speed is 0.3 m./ min.|$|R
50|$|Smithfield Poultry Market was {{constructed}} in 1961-1963 to replace a Victorian market building in Smithfield, London, which was destroyed by fire in 1958. Its roof is {{claimed to be the}} largest concrete shell structure ever built, and the largest <b>clear</b> <b>spanning</b> dome roof in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{dimensions}} of both semi-circular arches are practically identical: the <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> are 9 m each, the {{rise from the}} springing line to {{the apex of the}} arch 4.5 m and the clearance to ground level measures 7.5 m. The vaults are built of rubble bound with mortar, and rest on an ashlar stone base.|$|R
25|$|The {{bridge with}} the most slender arch was the Pont-Saint-Martin in the Alpine Aosta Valley. A {{favourable}} ratio of arch rib thickness to span {{is regarded as the}} single most important parameter in the design of stone arches. The arch rib of the Pont-Saint-Martin is only 1.03m thick what translates to a ratio of 1/34 respectively 1/30 depending on whether one assumes 35.64m or 31.4m to be the value for its <b>clear</b> <b>span.</b> A statistical analysis of extant Roman bridges shows that ancient bridge builders preferred a ratio for rib thickness to span of 1/10 for smaller bridges, while they reduced this to as low as 1/20 for larger spans in order to relieve the arch from its own weight.|$|E
25|$|By {{multiplying}} these modules into a grid, {{the structure}} could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground {{level of the}} Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> for {{the roof of the}} immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.|$|E
25|$|Book-ending the Mappin Wing are the Tent Room—used for {{slightly}} less formal gatherings—and the ballroom—the centre of state life at Rideau Hall. It {{is in the}} latter space that honours and awards ceremonies take place, members of the Cabinet are sworn in, ambassadors present their diplomatic credentials, and large-scale state dinners are held; as such, {{it is the second}} most photographed and televised room in Canada, preceded only by the House of Commons. A double-height space, it is lined with tall, arched windows between rectangular pilasters that are topped with gilt, acanthused capitals. Cable moulding trim surrounds most of the openings and, {{around the perimeter of the}} room, at the intersection of walls and ceiling, is a deep and ornate plaster crown moulding formed by a godroon textured frieze and a heavy dentiled bed-mould between layers of talon and gorge mouldings. Above this is the Victorian, lacunar, <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> vaulted ceiling, from the centre of which hangs a Waterford Crystal chandelier, presented by the British government on Victoria Day in 1951 as a token of gratitude for Canada's role in World War II. Also, in an alcove to the south of the ballroom's main door is a stained glass window that celebrates the excellence of Canadian performing artists and the establishment of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards.|$|E
50|$|While the Old Blenheim Bridge had and Bridgeport Covered Bridge has longer <b>clear</b> <b>spans,</b> and the Smolen-Gulf Bridge {{is longer}} overall, with a longest single span of 204 ft, the Cornish-Windsor Bridge {{is still the}} longest wooden covered bridge and has the longest single covered span to carry {{automobile}} traffic (Blenheim was and Bridgeport is pedestrian only).|$|R
50|$|The Belfast truss is a {{cross between}} the Town's lattice truss and the bowstring truss. It was {{developed}} in Ireland as a wide-span shallow rise roof truss for industrial structures. McTear & Co of Belfast, Ireland began fabricating these trusses in wood starting around 1866. By 1899, spans of 24 meters had been achieved, and in the 20th century, shipyards and airplane hangars demanded ever greater <b>clear</b> <b>spans.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{programmatic}} {{requirements of}} this complex shaped decisions about structure and materials. Designing the structural system and cable-stayed roof was a feat for Geiger Engineers. The structural engineers developed this structural envelope {{due to the}} necessity for a clear span- limiting chlorine from damaging building materials. A <b>clear</b> <b>spanned</b> space {{proved to be the}} solution that answered the need for minimal maintenance and avoidance of damage to structural elements. The engineers chose to place the pool and rink end-to–end, so that they would serve, structurally speaking as counterweights of a seesaw. At the midpoint are the “linchpins”: the two 130-foot masts from which the roof is suspended. [...] The masts are composed of 1-¼” plates that are stacked at the junction of the pool and rink. The masts are designed so that as they soar through the roof, the diameter narrows to accommodate lateral movement. [...] In order to support the 120-foot-by-230-foot <b>clear</b> <b>spans,</b> twelve cables were extended from each mast to specific connection points on the roof. The twelve 3-inch diameter A586 strand cables are critical elements in connecting the masts to the roof. To keep the roof from lifting, the roof is decked in concrete planks that counteract windloads. The concrete planks sit on longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the envelope.|$|R
500|$|Only in {{a single}} case, between arches 26 and 27, were Wurster and Ganzert able to {{determine}} the breadth of a pier: [...] Subtracting this value from the common arch span of , a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> of [...] remains. Since all arches have a rise of ca. , the Limyra Bridge has an unusually large span-to-rise ratio of [...] Such flattened arches were very rare at the time for stone bridges, and were not matched and surpassed until the reappearance of segmental arch bridges in 14thcentury Italy. For the largest arch in the Limyra Bridge, the ratio is even greater, spanning a width 6.4times its height. The two later arches, in contrast, are, with a ratio of 2.7:1, quite ordinary semi-circular arches.|$|E

500|$|The Bill Struth Main Stand, {{formerly}} known as the Main Stand, faces onto Edmiston Drive (A8 road). The red-brick facade, designed by Archibald Leitch, is a Category B listed building. Simon Inglis, writing in 1996, described it as an [...] "imposing red-brick facade, with its mock neo-classical arched, square and pedimented windows, exudes prestige and power." [...] On each end wall the club crest is depicted in a blue and gold mosaic. Stairtowers leading to the Club Deck (third tier) stand {{at each end of the}} Main Stand. These towers are also framed in red-brick, but deliberately contrast with the main body of the stand.

50|$|Internal framing is {{provided}} by substantial timber columns, bearers and joists, with ceilings lined with galvanised ripple iron {{to the ground and}} first floors. Steel box beams are also used in some areas to increase <b>clear</b> <b>spans.</b> Flooring consists of rough sawn timber boards, some areas of which have been sheeted over, and piers to the basement and sub-floor are masonry. The roof has timber framed trusses with bolted connections, forming a saw-tooth profile, with glass louvred clerestory windows. Ceilings are lined on the rake with beaded tongue and groove boarding, and the roof is sheeted with corrugated iron.|$|R

The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state. The city of Des Moines recently relit the bridges with LED lighting.|$|R
50|$|Built {{at a cost}} of £7,250,000 (£50,000,000 at 2013 prices), Greyfriars Bus Station {{was opened}} in 1976, {{replacing}} the previous facility at Derngate, and was designed by Arup Associates. The building was designed to accommodate 40,000 passengers and 1,700 buses a day and included a complex brief of a bus station, with car park over, topped by a three-storey office block (Greyfriars House). The office block was supported over the <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> below by a complex structural design based around reinforced concrete trusses. The new station was built in response to the needs in the town at the time, namely bringing visitors into the town to the Grosvenor Centre.|$|R

50|$|The {{concrete}} shell roof spans 225 xx 125 ft, with {{a double}} curvature sheet {{in the form of}} an elliptical paraboloid, mostly only 3 in thick but up to 6 in at the edges. It is claimed to be the largest concrete shell structure ever built, and the largest <b>clear</b> <b>spanning</b> dome roof in Europe. The shallow structure only rises 30 ft in the centre, and is supported by pre-stressed concrete edge beams with clerestory glazing below, so it appear to balance on its corners. It is pierced by circular rooflights. The external roof surface and gables on each side are clad in copper.|$|R
2500|$|The head house {{containing}} passenger service {{areas and}} railroad offices was an [...] "L" [...] shape {{with a short}} leg running east-west on 42nd Street and a long leg running north-south on Vanderbilt Avenue. The train shed, north and east of the head house, had three innovations in U.S. practice: the platforms were elevated to {{the height of the}} cars, the roof was a balloon shed with a <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> over all of the tracks, and only passengers with tickets were allowed on the platforms (a rule enforced by ticket examiners). The Harlem, Hudson, and New Haven trains were initially in different stations that were adjacent to each other, which created chaos in baggage transfer. The combined Grand Central Depot serviced all three railroads.|$|E

2500|$|Brunel had to {{take the}} two tracks of the South Wales Railway across the River Wye. The Admiralty had insisted on a [...] <b>clear</b> <b>span</b> over the river, with the bridge a minimum of [...] above high tide. The span would have to be self-supporting, since {{although}} the Gloucestershire side of the river consists of a limestone cliff, the Monmouthshire side is low-lying sedimentary deposit subject to regular flooding. Thus on that side, there was nowhere for an abutment capable of either resisting the outward push of an arch bridge, or the inward pull of a conventional suspension bridge. In any case, neither could be used: an arch bridge would not have met the height and width restrictions imposed by the Admiralty, and suspension bridges were notoriously unfit for carrying railway trains. The concentrated weight caused the chains to deflect, allowing the bridge-deck to ride dangerously up and down. A self-supporting truss bridge was the only option.|$|E
30|$|The three-point-bending {{test was}} {{performed}} with a <b>clear</b> shear <b>span,</b> a, of 762  mm (namely: {{distance from the}} loading point {{to the center of}} the support) and with a nominal shear span-to-depth ratio, a/d, of 3.0 for all the beams.|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} to the ramp is 42 m long and 6.55 - 6.80 m wide. The <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of its two segmental arches are 6.95 m and 7.40 m, which corresponds to a span-to-rise ratio of 4.0 and 3.3 to 1 respectively. The accurately fitting inclined contact surface of the springings clearly proves the Roman origin of these arches. With an extraordinary width of 1.20 m, the voussoirs appear oversized {{in relation to the}} span (arch slenderness of 1:5.8 and 6.2 respectively). In contrast, the two surviving bridge arches no. 1 and 3 are instable substitutions, made of carelessly laid rubble. The date of these arches is unknown, as with all other repairs; possibly they were built in the period of the Knights Templar.|$|R
5000|$|The Swiftwater Covered Bridge is a {{historic}} covered bridge which carries Valley Road over the Wild Ammonoosuc River in Bath, New Hampshire. The bridge, the fourth on the site, was built in 1849, and is a locally distinctive single-span Paddleford truss design, with laminated arches and steel beam reinforcements added in the 20th century. The bridge has an overall length of 173'8" [...] and two <b>clear</b> <b>spans</b> of 77'6" [...] and 57'6". The roadbed is 14'6" [...] wide, with a vertical clearance of 12'9".
