50|$|Cultural Schema Theory {{is often}} {{compared}} and {{contrasted with the}} Cultural Consensus Theory. Both theories present distinct perspectives {{about the nature of}} individual and cultural knowledge. However, unlike the Cultural Schema Theory, the Cultural Consensus Theory helps to describe and mathematically measure the extent to which cultural beliefs are shared. The central idea is the use of the pattern of agreement or consensus among members of the same culture. Essentially, the more knowledge people have, the more consensus is observed among them. Unfortunately, the Cultural Consensus Theory does not help others to better understand intracultural variability or how cultural knowledge is interrelated at a cognitive level. Cultural Consensus Theory anticipates intracultural variation but views variation as analogous to performance on a <b>cultural</b> <b>test,</b> with certain individuals functioning as better guides than others to the cultural information pool (Garro, 2000).|$|E

5000|$|A Cross <b>Cultural</b> <b>Test</b> of the Spiral of Silence by Huiping Huang {{analyzes}} {{the results of}} a telephone survey done in Taiwan and the United States. The hypotheses tested were the beliefs that the United States is an [...] "individualistic" [...] society, while Taiwan is a [...] "collectivist" [...] society. This suggested that the spiral of silence is less likely to be activated in the United States, because individuals are more likely to put emphasis on their personal goals. They put the [...] "I" [...] identity over the [...] "we" [...] identity, and strive for personal success. Therefore, it was hypothesized that they {{would be more likely to}} speak out, regardless of if they are in the minority. On the other hand, it was predicted that individuals in Taiwan put more emphasis on the collective goal, so they would conform to the majority influence in hopes of avoiding tension and conflict. The study also tested the effect of motives, including self-efficacy and self-assurance.|$|E
50|$|His early work, principally in the 1980s, on {{empirical}} {{evaluation of}} the <b>cultural</b> <b>test</b> bias hypothesis in clinical assessment was not only prolific but {{at the cutting edge}} of psychological science at the time and led to resolution of many of the polemic debates over the use of clinical assessment devices with native born American ethnic minorities and moved the remaining arguments from emotion to reasoned scientific dialogue (see for example his 1983, Journal of Special Education paper, “Test bias: In God we trust, all others must have data”). At the same time, he was establishing important research programs in the areas of assessment of anxiety in children and youth and tackling the measurement issues surrounding the field of learning disabilities. The extent of his contributions to psychological science in these areas is easily seen by the fact that, remarkably, two of his papers have been noted as the most cited papers published in the history of their respective journals: his 1978 paper on assessing anxiety published in the Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology, and his 1984 paper describing and resolving many of the critical measurement issues in assessment of learning disabilities appearing in the Journal of Special Education. His subsequent work in the development of interpretive methods for clinical assessment instruments and debunking of the myths of profile analysis of intelligence test performance resulted in abandonment of unsubstantiated but prevalent clinical practices and in substantial changes in how such tests are interpreted today (for example see his 2003 paper with Livingston in Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology and his opening paper of the 2007 special issue of Applied Neuropsychology, which he edited, on this topic), as well as having influenced test development practices. For additional examples see his 1997 paper on assessment of forward and backward memory span, and his two 2000 papers in School Psychology Quarterly on configural frequency analysis and modal profile analysis. His work continues to influence many other researchers, and, since 1985, there have been only 2 issues of the bimonthly Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology in which his work has not been referenced in one or more research articles.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Colonization of gram – {{negative}} {{bacteria and}} fungi in oropharynx of hospitalized patients {{in intensive care}} units, is an important process {{in the development of}} aspiration pneumonia in these patients (ICU). The purpose of current study was to define effect of selective oropharyngeal decontaminatio (SOD) on colonization of the oral-pharynx in hospitalized patients in intensive care units. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial study, 60 hospitalized patients in ICU have been randomly divided into two groups: control group and experimental group. Routine mouthwash with saline solution (QID 0. 9 %) was prescribed and after 24 hours, a <b>cultural</b> <b>test</b> has shown colonization rate. For experimental group, immediately after <b>cultural</b> <b>test,</b> SOD (paste containing polymyxin 2 %, Tobramycin 2 %, Amphotericin 2 %), were used for a week. Routine  mouthwash was continued for control group. After a week, the second culture was performed and the colonization rate in both groups was compared. Results: SOD has decreased colonization rate in experimental group (positive 10 cases in the first culture to 4 cases in the second culture) and in control group, positive 8 cases in the first culture have increased to 18 cases in second culture. Statistical tests showed that the differences between these groups statistically were significantly meaningful (P= 0. 002). Conclusions: In this study, SOD (paste containing polymyxin 2 %, Tobramycin 2 %, Amphotericin 2 %) every  6  hours during a week, in hospitalized patients in ICU, significantly have led to decreasing colonization of oral–pharynx in comparison with control group.

Specimens could be collected from the whole conjunctiva by using 1 swab for each eye and pooled for subsequent inoculation, so that the laboratory incurred no additional work. A close correlation was observed between isolation rate, together with the number of inclusions, obtained in cell culture, and intensity of inflammatory disease in hyperendemic trachoma.

40|$|Background: Asymptomatic {{bacteriuria}} is {{the significant}} presence of {{bacteria in the}} urine of an individual without symptoms. In pregnancy, the apparent reduction in immunity of pregnant women tends to encourage the growth of pathogens. Aim : This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women attending a primary health centre in Benin City, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A total of 1, 228 pregnant women were recruited for this study. All subjects were clinically identified to have no {{signs and symptoms of}} UTI. Clean catch midstream urine sample was collected from each patient into sterile universal container. The urine samples were examined microscopically and by cultural method. Identification of isolates was by standard microbiological technique. Result: A total of 556 (45. 3 %) were positive for significant bacteriuria. There was {{a significant difference in the}} prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria with respect to age (P < 0. 0001). Trimester did not show any significant difference (P = 0. 2006) in the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria. Escherichia coli was the most predominant organism followed closely by Staphylococcus aureus. Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone and Augmentin were found to be the most effective antibiotics against the urinary isolates. Conclusion : Asymptomatic bacteriuria is not uncommon among antenatal patients in the population studied.

40|$|A rapid serodiagnostic {{test for}} the {{diagnosis}} of paratrachoma (TRIC ophthalmia neonatorum, inclusion conjunctivitis, TRIC punctate keratoconjunctivitis, and trachoma of sexually transmitted origin) has been developed. The technique is based on using a modified micro-immunofluorescence test for detecting antichlamydial IgG and IgM in the blood and IgG and IgA in tears. The blood samples are collected on cellulose sponges after a finger prick, and tears are collected by introducing small sponges into the lower conjunctival fornix of the eye. The blood and tear samples collected in this way could {{be sent to the}} diagnostic laboratory by post without special arrangements for cold storage. In general the presence of antichlamydial IgG at a level of {{greater than or equal to}} 1 / 32 or IgM at a level of greater than or equal to 1 / 8 in blood and antichlamydial IgG or IgA at a level of greater than or equal to 1 / 8 in tears was closely associated with ocular paratrachoma. The combined results of the micro-IF test of blood and tears has yielded the highest rate of positivity (90 %). In patients with acute untreated paratrachoma the sensitivity of this test was similar to that of irradiated McCoy cells. In patients with a milder infection receiving antibiotics the sensitivity of the serodiagnostic test was superior to that of the <b>cultural</b> <b>test.</b> The high sensitivity and specificity of this rapid, simple and inexpensive serodiagnostic {{test for the}} diagnosis of chlamydial ocular infections, coupled with simple and practical methods of collection and transport of blood and tear specimens, offer advantages over cultural tests for routine diagnosis and study of chlamydial ocular infections...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{builds on}} Implicit Leadership Theory, {{which suggests that}} a leader’s performance {{is likely to be}} higher when there is congruence between a follower’s prototype of what a leader should be and his or her perception of the leader’s behaviour. The essence of effective leadership, according to this theory, is being seen as a leader by others. Data were collected from 196 leaders and 1, 738 followers from 23 countries within Cargill Incorporated, a US food and agricultural multinational. The research was conducted in two phases. During the first phase data were collected on followers’ desired leadership values and their perception of their leader’s behaviour on the same dimensions. These data were used to compute a congruence score based on a weighted sum of absolute differences. The congruence score data formed the heart of an individualised Leadership Fit Report written for each leader in the study showing the extent of congruence across 21 leadership characteristics (see Appendix A). The second phase of the study focused on a subset of 933 followers from five countries testing the two hypotheses. The two hypotheses in Phase Two were partially supported. The first was that congruence between desired leadership values and perceived behaviour leads to high performance of a leader and incongruence leads to lower performance. The second was that the relationship between congruence and leader performance varied by nationality. The cross-cultural test of Implicit Leadership Theory captured in Hypothesis 2 was particularly important to Cargill because it revealed unique and important 9 differences between the five countries included in the second data set. This study found that {{the nature of the relationship}} between congruence and leader performance varies significantly between all five countries. More specifically the data suggests that congruence does not always lead to high performance. This study, albeit exploratory, makes theoretical, methodological and practical contributions in the following ways. i. A cross <b>cultural</b> <b>test</b> of Implicit Leadership Theory in a multinational organisation with a significant sample size. ii. An existing desired leadership values questionnaire was used and developed further to measure leadership values and leader perception. iii. All 196 leaders received a personalised feedback report showing the level of congruence (or degree of fit) for 21 leadership characteristics. iv. A methodological contribution was made by using Polynomial Regression Equations and Response Surface Methodology to measure the nature of the relationship between desired leadership values, perceived behaviour and leaders’ performance. Implicit Leadership Theory was shown to be complex yet very relevant to management practice. The research undertaken was exploratory yet it has created the basis for on going discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{group of}} {{dysentery}} organisms {{is a large}} and. varied one. It may be divided, as is well known, into two main sub-groups, the "Shiga-Kruse" and the "mannit-fermenters," which are of equal importance and entirely distinct. If we take decided differences in agglutination, as determined by absorptions, as a criterion of specificity, the latter group includes at least four distinct species {{with a number of}} sub-varieties and transition forms. Two of the above species are found among organisms which split either dextrose, mannit, and saccharose or in addition maltose. The other two species are represented by the bacillus "Y" of Hiss and Russell and the "Flexner-Manila" bacillus. If we adopt Ford's proposal, that a new species should be made for each culture showing a constant cultural or agglutinative difference, the number would increase considerably. At the best, however, classification of bacteria is at present very artificial. Although so many types appear among the " mannit-fermenters," {{there is no reason why}} they should not all be included in the dysentery group of bacilli, provided the reaction in litmus milk be typical. This <b>cultural</b> <b>test,</b> as Duval has emphasized, is the most constant one which we have at present, but it should extend over several weeks in order to exclude lactose fermenters. In contradistinction to the heterogeneity of the "mannit-fermenters," the homogeneity of the "Shiga-Kruse" type stands in marked contrast. Every culture of the latter which. was tested (about twenty in all) reacted in all media and agglutinated with all the various sera exactly alike. One is tempted to explain this diversity of the "mannit-fermenters" by accepting the suggestion of Flexner, that they may be occasional, if not constant, inhabitants of the normal intestine. Certainly Duval has isolated the "mannit-fermenters" from the mildest cases of diarrhœa, to say nothing of the two apparently normal infants from which he also obtained them. Furthermore, the agglutinins for the mannit group in normal blood might be accounted for on this hypothesis, as well as the many differences in fermentation and agglutination. For, as has been well said by Smith and Reagh, one " should keep in mind the various adaptations in the intestine—it may be to the food remains in the large intestine, to the mucus on the surface of the epithelium, to the contents of the tubules and the larger flask-shaped glands, and further, with this progressive adaptation are associated modifications of biological characters which most likely involve agglutinative capacities as well. " The fact that dysentery bacilli have not been isolated frequently from the normal intestine might be explained by their habitat being possibly within the mucus tubules and their number few under normal condition, for it is well known that they are most frequently found in association with mucus. When abnormal conditions, however, arise and the production of mucus increases, these organisms would possibly multiply in number pari passu and find themselves in a favorable position to attack any slight injury which might occur in the wall of the intestine. The "Shiga-Kruse," or Group I, type, on the other hand, seems to present the characters of a true parasite. Only an insignificant amount of agglutinin is present for it in normal human blood and that of laboratory animals, according to most authorities; it agglutinates alike in various immune sera; it has a very marked toxicity for laboratory animals; it has never been isolated from the normal human intestine, although an organism in some respects like it has been described by Ford as being an inhabitant of the normal intestine; it produces no indol; it splits only the monosaccharids, through which it falls in line with the conclusion of Smith and Reagh, that the less a bacillus acts on sugars the more pronounced is its parasitic character. Whether or not it ever invades the blood in numbers is a question yet to be decided...|$|E
