25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush <b>current</b> <b>protection.</b> Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E

The switch may be manually operated or may be a relay or contactor connected {{to some form of}} sensor to automatically start and stop the motor. The switch may have several positions to select different connections of the motor. This may allow reduced-voltage starting of the motor, reversing control or selection of multiple speeds. Overload and over <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> may be omitted in very small motor controllers, which rely on the supplying circuit to have over <b>current</b> <b>protection.</b> Small motors may have built-in overload devices to automatically open the circuit on overload. Larger motors have a protective overload relay or temperature sensing relay included in the controller and fuses or circuit breakers for over <b>current</b> <b>protection.</b> An automatic motor controller may also include limit switches or other devices to protect the driven machinery.|$|E

Nowadays, {{to deal with}} the problem of distributed capacitive current a stimulating modern technology is being used in <b>current</b> differential <b>protection</b> with high operating threshold. Many schemes have been used into <b>current</b> differential <b>protection</b> for capacitive <b>current</b> compensation, which was based on shunt reactor, phasor compensation algorithm, Bergeron method. Those techniques were also reducing operating speed and sensitivity of <b>current</b> differential <b>protection.</b> To solve the problem of distributed capacitive current of the line, novel principle of <b>current</b> differential <b>protection</b> is described in this article. Current calculated from set point to both the ends give rise to a differential criterion. Differential protection is launched under the phenomenon of low sampling frequency to improve the expediency of the criterion. The calculation of set point distributed current is achieved at low sampling frequency by adding an interpolation point at each sampling interval. The point is set in the middle of the line and the calculation for magnitude of the current is done with half data window absolute value integrals, for improved the operating speed of the <b>current</b> differential <b>protection...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{wide area}} <b>current</b> {{differential}} <b>protection</b> is {{more susceptible to}} the line distributed capacitor than the common <b>current</b> differential <b>protection,</b> resulting in the lower sensitivity. This is {{because the number of}} lines under different operation condition is variable in the region of the wide area <b>current</b> differential <b>protection.</b> The distributed capacitance and the capacitance current may change in a wide range. In addition, it is more difficult to estimate and compensate the capacitance current in the wide area region of the differential protection. The pilot protection based on integrated impedance can overcome the influence of distributed capacitance and increase the sensitivity [38]. Introducing the concept of integrated impedance to wide area protection, the principle of FEI based on wide area integrated impedance can be established [39], which can overcome the defects of the wide area <b>current</b> differential <b>protection.</b>|$|R

50|$|There is {{no current}} zoning {{protection}} {{in place for}} the Yalecrest Neighborhood. National Register status does not prohibit demolitions or out of character remodels. According to the 2007 National Register of Historic Places designation (based on a 2005 survey), 91% of the neighborhood’s 1,487 structures have been identified as significantly contributing to the historic district. However, the neighborhood is experiencing a teardown rate of up to 6 houses per year. Starting in 2010 the neighborhood is experiencing escalated rates of teardowns primarily from developers wanting to capitalize on the location and beauty of the district. The teardowns and overscaled rebuilds and additions discourage neighbors and create animosity on the block. According to the Utah Heritage Foundation, Yalecrest has the largest number of demolitions of any area in the State of Utah since the early 2000s.< The creation of a Local Historic District would provide zoning that would curb demolitions and out of scale remodels, however there is no <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> in place. In 2013, a non-profit group called Yalecrest (Keep Educating and Encouraging Preservation) was formed to work with residents in addressing the demolitions and out of character remodels that are destroying the historic nature of Yalecrest.|$|E
50|$|Most {{threats to}} {{cultural}} property {{can be divided}} into three categories: constant dangers, peace-time incidents and incidents related to armed conflict. Constant threats are primarily theft, vandalism, air pollution, infestation by pests or fungus, deterioration due to aging, ignorance or indifference. An example for this category of danger is the fire of the Chapel Bridge in Lucerne in August 1993. It is suspected that the fire was caused by a carelessly discarded cigarette. Peacetime dangers are primarily technical such as damage like flooding and natural events such as earthquakes, storms or avalanches. We refer to the floods in the summer of 2005 as a respective example. They affected cultural property in various parts of Switzerland; for example at the Collections Centre of the Museum of Transport in Lucerne or in the Benedictine convent of St. Andreas in Sarnen. Destruction through war, acquisition by force and removal of cultural property is as old as the history of humanity. In warfare the use of weapons and explosives has particularly detrimental effect on cultural property. In recent military conflicts - for example during the Balkan wars - a greater number of campaigns were carried out to deliberately destroy cultural assets, which promoted the birth of the Second Protocol. Terrorist attacks are also increasingly and deliberately directed against cultural assets. The destruction of Buddha statues in Afghanistan by the Taliban in the spring of 2001 provides an example for this. In Switzerland, which was largely spared armed conflicts in its younger history, <b>current</b> <b>protection</b> of cultural property focuses primarily on measures against technological dangers, natural events and vandalism.|$|E
