25|$|Example 4. Ultimately {{constant}} sequences. Any Boolean {{combination of}} ultimately constant sequences is ultimately constant; hence these form a Boolean algebra. We can identify these with the integers by viewing the ultimately-zero sequences as nonnegative binary numerals (bit 0 {{of the sequence}} being the low-order bit) and the ultimately-one sequences as negative binary numerals (think two's complement arithmetic with the all-ones sequence being −1). This makes the integers a Boolean algebra, with union being bit-wise OR and complement being −x−1. There are only countably many integers, so this infinite Boolean algebra is countable. The atoms are the powers of two, namely 1,2,4,.... Another way of describing this algebra is as the set of all finite and <b>cofinite</b> sets of natural numbers, with the ultimately all-ones sequences corresponding to the <b>cofinite</b> sets, those sets omitting only finitely many natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{showed that}} for every nontrivial class C (which {{contains}} some but not all r.e. sets) the index set E = {e: the eth r.e. set We is in C} has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to E, that is, can be mapped using a many-one reduction to E (see Rice's theorem for more detail). But, many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem. These type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy. For example, the index set FIN of class of all finite sets is on the level Σ2, the index set REC {{of the class of}} all recursive sets is on the level Σ3, the index set COFIN of all <b>cofinite</b> sets is also on the level Σ3 and the index set COMP of the class of all Turing-complete sets Σ4. These hierarchy levels are defined inductively, Σn+1 contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative to Σn; Σ1 contains the recursively enumerable sets. The index sets given here are even complete for their levels, that is, all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets.|$|E
2500|$|Example 3. The set of finite and <b>cofinite</b> sets of integers, where a <b>cofinite</b> set is one omitting only finitely many integers. This {{is clearly}} closed under complement, and is closed under union because {{the union of}} a <b>cofinite</b> set with any set is <b>cofinite,</b> while the union of two finite sets is finite. [...] Intersection behaves like union with [...] "finite" [...] and [...] "cofinite" [...] interchanged.|$|E
2500|$|Any set can {{be given}} the <b>cofinite</b> {{topology}} in which the open sets are the empty set and the sets whose complement is finite. [...] This is the smallest T1 topology on any infinite set.|$|E
2500|$|For {{infinite}} Boolean algebras {{the notion}} of ultrafilter becomes considerably more delicate. The elements greater or equal than an atom always form an ultrafilter but so do many other sets; for example in the Boolean algebra of finite and <b>cofinite</b> sets of integers the <b>cofinite</b> sets form an ultrafilter even though {{none of them are}} atoms. Likewise the powerset of the integers has among its ultrafilters the set of all subsets containing a given integer; there are countably many of these [...] "standard" [...] ultrafilters, which may be identified with the integers themselves, but there are uncountably many more [...] "nonstandard" [...] ultrafilters. These form the basis for nonstandard analysis, providing representations for such classically inconsistent objects as infinitesimals and delta functions.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{characteristic}} set of a matroid is infinite, it contains zero; {{and if it}} contains zero then it contains all but finitely many primes. [...] Hence the only possible characteristic sets are finite sets not containing zero, and <b>cofinite</b> sets containing zero. [...] Indeed, all such sets do occur.|$|E
2500|$|For ultrafilters on a powerset ℘(S), a {{principal}} ultrafilter consists of all subsets of S that contain a given element s of S. Each ultrafilter on ℘(S) {{that is also}} {{a principal}} filter is of this form. Therefore, an ultrafilter U on ℘(S) is principal {{if and only if}} it contains a finite set.,...,s'n} ∈ U, then {s1} ∈ U, or ..., or {s'n} ∈ U by induction on n, using Nr.2 of the [...] characterization theorem. That is, some {s'i} is the principal element of U. If S is infinite, an ultrafilter U on ℘(S) is hence non-principal if and only if it contains the Fréchet filter of <b>cofinite</b> subsets of S. If S is finite, each ultrafilter is principal.|$|E

50|$|The double-pointed <b>cofinite</b> {{topology}} is the <b>cofinite</b> topology {{with every}} point doubled; that is, {{it is the}} topological product of the <b>cofinite</b> topology with the indiscrete topology. It is not T0 or T1, since the points of the doublet are topologically indistinguishable. It is, however, R0 since the topologically distinguishable points are separable.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>cofinite</b> {{topology}} (sometimes {{called the}} finite complement topology) is a topology {{which can be}} defined on every set X.

50|$|The Fréchet filter {{is named}} after the French {{mathematician}} Maurice Fréchet (1878-1973), who worked in topology. It is alternatively called a <b>cofinite</b> filter because its members are exactly the <b>cofinite</b> sets in a power set.|$|E
5000|$|Separation: The <b>cofinite</b> {{topology}} is the coarsest topology {{satisfying the}} T1 axiom; i.e. {{it is the}} smallest topology for which every singleton set is closed. In fact, an arbitrary topology on X satisfies the T1 axiom {{if and only if}} it contains the <b>cofinite</b> topology. If X is finite then the <b>cofinite</b> topology is simply the discrete topology. If X is not finite, then this topology is not T2, regular or normal, since no two nonempty open sets are disjoint (i.e. it is hyperconnected).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>cofinite</b> {{topology}} on {{an infinite}} set {{is a simple}} example of a topology that is T1 but is not Hausdorff (T2).

5000|$|We {{give each}} Xi the {{topology}} whose open sets are the <b>cofinite</b> subsets of Xi, plus the empty set (the <b>cofinite</b> topology) and the singleton {i}.This makes Xi compact, and by Tychonoffs theorem, X is also compact (in the product topology).

50|$|The set of all subsets of X {{that are}} either finite or <b>cofinite</b> forms a Boolean algebra, i.e., it is closed under the {{operations}} of union, intersection, and complementation. This Boolean algebra is the finite-cofinite algebra on X. A Boolean algebra A has a unique non-principal ultrafilter (i.e. a maximal filter not generated by a single element of the algebra) {{if and only if}} there is an infinite set X such that A is isomorphic to the finite-cofinite algebra on X. In this case, the non-principal ultrafilter is the set of all <b>cofinite</b> sets.|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocity}} formula {{can sometimes}} be generalized to more general topological groups; for example, the Selberg trace formula and the Arthur-Selberg trace formula are generalizations of Frobenius reciprocity to discrete <b>cofinite</b> subgroups of certain locally compact groups.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} homeomorphism classes of {{countable}} Toronto spaces, namely: the discrete topology, the indiscrete topology, the <b>cofinite</b> topology {{and the upper}} and lower topologies on the natural numbers. The only countable Hausdorff Toronto space is the discrete space.|$|E
50|$|In {{discrete}} mathematics, {{one uses}} the term almost all to mean <b>cofinite</b> (all but finitely many), cocountable (all but countably many), for sufficiently large numbers, or, sometimes, asymptotically almost surely.

50|$|Any Hausdorff (T2) {{space is}} sober (the only {{irreducible}} subsets being points), and allsober spaces are Kolmogorov (T0), and both implications are strict.Sobriety is not {{comparable to the}} T1 condition: {{an example of a}} T1 space which is not sober is an infinite set with the <b>cofinite</b> topology, the whole space being an irreducible closed subset with no generic point.Moreover T2 is stronger than T1 and sober, i.e., while every T2 space is at once T1 and sober, there exist spaces that are simultaneously T1 and sober, but not T2. One such example is the following: let X be the set of real numbers, with a new point p adjoined; the open sets being all real open sets, and all <b>cofinite</b> sets containing p.|$|E
