After protracted disputes and setbacks, the two countries' customs duties were unified in March 2001 but the <b>customs</b> <b>controls</b> were soon restored. In terms of trade, almost half of Belarusian export goes to Russia. Due to the structure of Belarusian industry, Belarus relies heavily on Russia both for export markets and for the supply of raw materials and components. After initial negotiation with the Russian Central Bank on monetary union, the Russian ruble was set to be introduced in Belarus in 2004, but this was postponed first until 2005, then until 2006, and now seems to have been suspended indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Customs administrations {{operating}} in the modern global economy {{are faced with a}} complex range of challenges. The prime responsibilities remain the collection of revenues and the protection of the society, but these demanding tasks must be performed effectively and efficiently, whilst at the same time facilitating the flow of legitimate goods. Risk management is a logical and systematic method of identifying, analyzing and managing risks. Risk management can be associated with any activity, function or process within the organization and will enable the organization to take advantage of opportunities and minimize potential losses. Minimization of the human factor in <b>customs</b> <b>control</b> through the implementation of non-intrusive inspection equipment can be very useful. The particularities of risk-management system (RMS) implementation within <b>customs</b> <b>control</b> are discussed in the article. The authors single out the elements of the risk-management system, evaluate the effectiveness of risk-management in <b>customs</b> <b>control.</b> The main reasons for non-implementation of the risk-management system in <b>customs</b> <b>control</b> are described as well. The particular attention is paid to the benefits of customs risk management. The authorsâ€™ hypothesis is that risk management in <b>customs</b> <b>control</b> must find a balance between costs and benefits to address all risks equally. Criteria are needed to decide what constitutes an acceptable or unacceptable risk. Thus, system analysis and risk management system are the effective mechanisms for acceleration of customs clearance and improve the quality of <b>customs</b> <b>control.</b> As a conclusion, the authors give recommendations for the improvement of the effectiveness of risk management system in <b>customs</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R
2500|$|OLE <b>custom</b> <b>controls</b> were {{introduced}} in 1994 {{as a replacement for}} the now deprecated Visual Basic Extension controls. Instead of upgrading these, the new architecture was based on OLE. In particular, any container that supported OLE 2.0 could already embed OLE <b>custom</b> <b>controls,</b> although these controls cannot react to events unless the container supports this. OLE <b>custom</b> <b>controls</b> are usually shipped {{in the form of a}} dynamic link library with the [...]ocx extension. In 1996 all interfaces for controls (except IUnknown) were made optional to keep the file size of controls down, so they would download faster; these were then called ActiveX Controls.|$|R
