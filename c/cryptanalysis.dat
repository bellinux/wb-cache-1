5|$|In 1950 Gleason {{returned}} {{to active duty}} for the Korean War, serving as a Lieutenant Commander in the Nebraska Avenue Complex (which much later became {{the home of the}} DHS Cyber Security Division).

5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval <b>cryptanalysis.</b> Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing helped win the war.|$|E
5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and <b>cryptanalysis</b> enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E

25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers {{as they come}} to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard <b>cryptanalysis,</b> e.g. rubber-hose <b>cryptanalysis</b> or black-bag <b>cryptanalysis</b> (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.|$|E

25|$|Just as the {{development}} of digital computers and electronics helped in <b>cryptanalysis,</b> it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption {{of any kind of}} data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and <b>cryptanalysis.</b> Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted <b>cryptanalysis,</b> which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making <b>cryptanalysis</b> so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.|$|E
25|$|The goal of <b>cryptanalysis</b> is to {{find some}} {{weakness}} or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion or evasion.|$|E

25|$|Differential <b>cryptanalysis</b> is {{a general}} form of <b>cryptanalysis</b> {{applicable}} primarily to block ciphers, but also to stream ciphers and cryptographic hash functions. In the broadest sense, it {{is the study of}} how differences in information input can affect the resultant difference at the output. In the case of a block cipher, it refers to a set of techniques for tracing differences through the network of transformation, discovering where the cipher exhibits non-random behavior, and exploiting such properties to recover the secret key (cryptography key).|$|E
25|$|In <b>cryptanalysis,</b> {{frequency}} analysis {{is the study}} of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers.|$|E

25|$|<b>Cryptanalysis</b> of symmetric-key ciphers {{typically}} involves {{looking for}} {{attacks against the}} block ciphers or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying {{approximately half of the}} possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear <b>cryptanalysis</b> attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement on brute force attacks.|$|E

25|$|Gilbert Vernam {{tried to}} repair the broken cipher (creating the Vernam-Vigenère cipher in 1918), but, {{no matter what he}} did, the cipher was still {{vulnerable}} to <b>cryptanalysis.</b> Vernam's work, however, eventually led to the one-time pad, a theoretically unbreakable cipher.|$|E
25|$|Since {{differential}} <b>cryptanalysis</b> {{became public}} knowledge, {{it has become}} a basic concern of cipher designers. New designs are expected to be accompanied by evidence that the algorithm is resistant to this attack, and many, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, have been proven secure against the attack.|$|E
25|$|Another {{contentious}} issue connected to cryptography in the United States is {{the influence of}} the National Security Agency on cipher development and policy. The NSA was involved with the design of DES during its development at IBM and its consideration by the National Bureau of Standards as a possible Federal Standard for cryptography. DES was designed to be resistant to differential <b>cryptanalysis,</b> a powerful and general cryptanalytic technique known to the NSA and IBM, that became publicly known only when it was rediscovered in the late 1980s. According to Steven Levy, IBM discovered differential <b>cryptanalysis,</b> but kept the technique secret at the NSA's request. The technique became publicly known only when Biham and Shamir re-discovered and announced it some years later. The entire affair illustrates the difficulty of determining what resources and knowledge an attacker might actually have.|$|E
25|$|Blowfish is a symmetric-key block cipher, {{designed}} in 1993 by Bruce Schneier and {{included in a}} large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective <b>cryptanalysis</b> of it has been found to date. However, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) now receives more attention.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of mathematics, al-Kindi played an {{important}} role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic and Christian world.

25|$|Other {{achievements}} of Muslim mathematicians {{during this period}} include {{the addition of the}} decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals, the discovery of all the modern trigonometric functions besides the sine, al-Kindi's introduction of <b>cryptanalysis</b> and frequency analysis, the development of analytic geometry by Ibn al-Haytham, the beginning of algebraic geometry by Omar Khayyam and the development of an algebraic notation by al-Qalasādī.|$|E
25|$|While {{involved}} with the L0pht, Mudge contributed significantly to disclosure and education on information and security vulnerabilities. In addition to pioneering buffer overflow work, the security advisories he released contained early examples of flaws in the following areas: code injection, race condition, side-channel attack, exploitation of embedded systems, and <b>cryptanalysis</b> of commercial systems. He was the original author of the password cracking software L0phtCrack.|$|E
25|$|<b>Cryptanalysis</b> {{of the new}} {{mechanical}} devices {{proved to}} be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred {{the development of more}} efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks. This culminated {{in the development of the}} Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.|$|E
25|$|The JN-25 superencrypted code, and its <b>cryptanalysis</b> by the US, {{is one of}} {{the most}} debated {{portions}} of Pearl Harbor lore. JN-25 is the U.S. Navy's last of several names for the cryptosystem of the Imperial Japanese Navy, sometimes referred to as Naval Code D. Other names used for it include five-numeral, 5Num, five-digit, five-figure, AN (JN-25 Able), and AN-1 (JN-25 Baker), and so on.|$|E
25|$|To break non-steckered Enigma {{machines}} (those {{without a}} plugboard), Knox (building on earlier research by Hugh Foss) developed a system known as 'rodding', a linguistic {{as opposed to}} mathematical way of breaking codes. This technique worked on the Enigma used by the Italian Navy and the German Abwehr. Knox worked in 'the Cottage', {{next door to the}} Bletchley Park mansion, as head of a research section, which contributed significantly to <b>cryptanalysis</b> of the Enigma.|$|E
25|$|While DES was {{designed}} with resistance to differential <b>cryptanalysis</b> in mind, other contemporary ciphers {{proved to be}} vulnerable. An early target for the attack was the FEAL block cipher. The original proposed version with four rounds (FEAL-4) can be broken using only eight chosen plaintexts, and even a 31-round version of FEAL is susceptible to the attack. In contrast, the scheme can successfully cryptanalyze DES with an effort on the order 247 chosen plaintexts.|$|E
25|$|Attempts by {{both the}} FBI's <b>Cryptanalysis</b> and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU) and the American Cryptogram Association failed to {{decipher}} their meaning, and Ricky McCormick’s encrypted notes are currently listed as one of CRRU’s top unsolved cases, with McCormick's killer yet to be identified.

25|$|Some use {{the terms}} {{cryptography}} and cryptology interchangeably in English, while others (including US military practice generally) use cryptography to refer {{specifically to the}} use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology {{to refer to the}} combined study of cryptography and <b>cryptanalysis.</b> English is more flexible than several other languages in which cryptology (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above.

25|$|Number {{theory is}} {{concerned}} with the properties of numbers in general, particularly integers. It has applications to cryptography, <b>cryptanalysis,</b> and cryptology, particularly with regard to modular arithmetic, diophantine equations, linear and quadratic congruences, prime numbers and primality testing. Other discrete aspects of number theory include geometry of numbers. In analytic number theory, techniques from continuous mathematics are also used. Topics that go beyond discrete objects include transcendental numbers, diophantine approximation, p-adic analysis and function fields.|$|E
25|$|The German {{military}} used {{a system}} of automated code for secret transfer of messages based on the Enigma machine. The constantly generated and altered code scheme was broken by Polish mathematicians led by Marian Rejewski and the discovery was shared with the French and the British before {{the outbreak of the}} war. <b>Cryptanalysis</b> of the Enigma was an immensely important Polish contribution to the war effort, as it was continued throughout the war in Britain and deprived the unsuspecting Germans of secrecy in their crucial communications.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{systems in}} general used a code to convert words and letters into numbers, to which {{additive}} keys (from one-time pads) were added, encrypting the content.

However, <b>cryptanalysis</b> by American and British code-breakers revealed {{that some of the}} one-time pad material had incorrectly been reused by the Soviets (specifically, entire pages, although not complete books), which allowed decryption (sometimes only partial) of {{a small part of the}} traffic.|$|E
