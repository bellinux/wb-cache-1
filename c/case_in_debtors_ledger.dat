50|$|Security {{requirements}} vary, but traditionally {{focus on}} the value of the <b>debtors</b> <b>ledger,</b> supported by a pledge of specific assets as collateral and a charge or mortgage over the business, along with the personal guarantees of directors. Apart from some specialised lenders, real estate security is not taken. By focusing on the value and collectability of the accounts receivable <b>ledger,</b> most <b>debtor</b> finance credit lines will automatically increase in response to increases in sales, and provide ongoing working capital to fund the growth of the business. Typically the advance rate ranges from 70% of accounts receivable ledger value up to 90%.

50|$|In recent years, it {{has become}} {{increasingly}} difficult for SMEs to obtain traditional finance from banks. Alternative options are invoice discounting or factoring, whereby the company borrows against its outstanding invoices, with the ability to obtain funds as soon as new invoices are created. It is often questioned which option is best for your business - factoring or discounting - and the answer depends on how the business wants to be perceived by customers. With factoring, the finance company charges interest on the loan until the invoice is paid, as well as fees, and the finance company takes ownership of the <b>debtor</b> <b>ledger</b> and uses its own credit control team to secure payment. With invoice discounting, the business maintains control of its own ledger and chases debts itself.|$|R

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades, {{scholars}} working from an economic perspective have criticized the bankruptcy reorganization process and sought {{to replace it with}} market mechanisms. In 2002, Professors Douglas G. Baird and Robert K. Rasmussen asserted in The End of Bankruptcy that improvements in the market for large public companies had rendered reorganization obsolete. Going concern value could be captured through sale. This Article reports the results of an empirical study comparing the recoveries in bankruptcy sales of large public companies in the period 2000 through 2004 with the recoveries in bankruptcy reorganizations during the same period. Controlling for company values measured at case commencement and operating profits, the recoveries <b>in</b> reorganization <b>cases</b> are more than double the recoveries from going concern sales. The authors attribute the low recoveries <b>in</b> sale <b>cases</b> to continuing market illiquidity, managers 2 ̆ 7 and professional advisors 2 ̆ 7 conflicts of interest, and the corruption of the bankruptcy process by competition among bankruptcy courts for large public company cases. As a result, debtors agree to sell at low prices, the auctions are rushed, and <b>in</b> most <b>cases</b> only a single bidder participates. The authors also report other sale characteristics. Bankruptcy recoveries are higher when debt capacity <b>in</b> the <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s industry is lower-the opposite of the effect predicted by Professors Andrei Shleifer 2 ̆ 6 Robert W. Vishny in their landmark article <b>in</b> 1992. <b>Cases</b> <b>in</b> which <b>debtors</b> sell their companies as going concerns often in the first few months-on average remain pending significantly longer than reorganization cases.

40|$|Both borrowers and {{creditors}} {{often have}} an implicit option to extend debt maturity as the debtor approaches financial distress. This implicit "extension option" {{is associated with}} the possibility for debtors and creditors to renegotiate the debt contract in the hope that extending debt maturity may allow the debtor to overcome temporary liquidity problems. This paper analyses and evaluates such "extension" option in a time independent setting with constant nominal capital structure and in a time dependent setting with not constant nominal capital structure. The "extension option" is shown to significantly increase the value of equity and has a non-negligible impact on debt credit spreads. The "extension option" can also increase the short-term credit spreads of outstanding debt and, in this respect, it ameliorates the shortcoming typical of structural models of credit risk, i. e. the under-prediction of short term credit spreads. The value of the extension option is very sensitive to different possible exercise policies. Four such policies are illustrated, encompassing <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> which the <b>debtor</b> extorts concessions (to extend debt maturity) from creditors and <b>cases</b> <b>in</b> which creditors make self interested concessions (to extend debt maturity). In general, when default is triggered by the "worthless equity" condition, the value of the extension option is much higher than when default is triggered by a liquidity shortage. The option to renegotiate debt maturity is of interest because extending debt maturity can decrease debt value even without cutting promised coupon payment, i. e. without giving up part of the tax shield associated with coupon payments.

40|$|Based on the {{provisions}} of article 1169 of the Civil Code, the parties are free to conclude any contract; however, {{based on the principle}} of the mandatory force of contract, the parties are held to execute the contract as signed. According to article 1549 of the new Civil Code, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> the <b>debtor</b> fails to execute its obligations accordingly, the creditor is entitled to invoke one of the following remedies: execution by equivalent; foreclosure; rescission or termination of contract or the reduction of the debtor’s performance or the use of any other legal mean available in order to achieve his right. Rescission can manifest under any of the two forms: judicial and extrajudicial. Extrajudicial rescission also has two forms: unilateral rescission and conventional rescission. Unilateral rescission operates based on the unilateral declaration of rescission. At first sight, the creditor’s possibility to terminate the contract by rescission presents some practical issues regarding the conditions when it can be invoked, the form of the declaration, its legal effects (namely the real possibility of reinstating the parties in their previous position) and the statute of limitation of the right to invoke rescission. All these aspects were subject to our analysis, thus attempting to find the practical solution for enforcing this highly anticipated solution in the new social-legal context. ...|$|R

In order to accommodate the society 2 ̆ 7 s demands, economical growth, and credit system development in Indonesian society nowadays, any forms of financial assurance are required, where people need to make a loan with any movable property as the collateral, yet it can still be used by the financing institutions. In financing the purchase by installment of any automobiles, the financing institutions require the collateral for the vehicle. In fact, the leasing companies frequently sell the collateral of the auction without going through the State Auction Office that has been stipulated in the Law on Fiduciary Collateral. This way obviously breaks the Law and if it taken seriously, it can certainly become a legal issue. This research then made three conclusions, namely: In completing the financing agreement on motor vehicle installment <b>in</b> <b>case</b> the <b>debtor</b> defaults, withdrawal was firstly made, then the company did the selling, after that auction was done. The obstacles in the execution toward fiduciary collateral which properties were not registered were made underhanded.
