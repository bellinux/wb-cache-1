ToxR, in conjunction with a second regulatory protein called ToxS, directly activates the genes encoding the cholera toxin; other ToxR regulated genes are not activated directly by ToxR. For some of these genes, ToxR manifests its control through another activator called ToxT. Expression of toxT, which encodes a member of the AraC family of bacterial transcriptional activators, is ToxR dependent and is modulated by in vitro growth conditions that modulate expression of the ToxR virulence regulon. Thus, as in other regulatory circuits, co-ordinate expression of several genes in V. cholerae results from the activity of a cascading system of regulatory factors...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{research}} in two cholera-endemic communities of Zanzibar {{has shown that}} a majority (? 94 %) {{of the adult population}} was willing to receive free oral cholera vaccines (OCVs). Since OCV uptake in the 2009 campaign reached only ? 50 % in these communities, an evaluation of social and cultural factors and of barriers was conducted to understand this difference for future <b>cholera</b> <b>control</b> planning. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A random sample of 367 adult peri-urban and rural community residents (46. 6 % immunized vs. 53. 4 % unimmunized) was studied with a semi-structured interview that inquired about social and cultural features of cholera depicted in a vignette and barriers to OCV uptake. Symptoms (rectal pain, loose skin only in rural community) and perceived causes (uncovered food, contact with contaminated water) specific for severe diarrhea were associated with uptake. Purchasing drugs from pharmacies to stop diarrhea and vomiting was negatively associated with uptake. Increasing household size, age and previous enteric illness episode were positively related to uptake, the latter only at the rural site. The most prominent barrier to uptake was competing obligations or priorities (reported by 74. 5 %, identified as most important barrier by 49. 5 %). Next most prominent barriers were lacking information about the campaign (29. 6 %, 12. 2 %), sickness (14. 3 %, 13. 3 %) and fear of possible vaccine side effects (15. 3 %, 5. 6 %). The majority of unvaccinated respondents requested repetition of the vaccination with free OCVs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Factors associated with uptake indicated a positive impact of the vaccination campaign and of sensitization activities on vaccine acceptance behavior. Unlike communities opposed to <b>cholera</b> <b>control</b> or settings where public confidence in vaccines is lacking, identified barriers to uptake indicated a good campaign implementation and trust in the health system. Despite prospects and demand for repeating the vaccination, local decision-makers should reconsider how careful logistical arrangements may improve community coverage and thus effectiveness of vaccination campaigns...|$|E

40|$|Haiti's cholera {{epidemic}} {{has been}} devastating {{partly due to}} underlying weak infrastructure and limited clean water and sanitation. A comprehensive approach to <b>cholera</b> <b>control</b> is crucial, yet {{some have argued that}} oral cholera vaccination (OCV) might result in reduced hygiene practice among recipients. We evaluated the impact of an OCV campaign on knowledge and health practice in rural Haiti. We administered baseline surveys on knowledge and practice relevant to cholera and waterborne disease to every 10 th household during a census in rural Haiti in February 2012 (N = 811). An OCV campaign occurred from May-June 2012 after which we administered identical surveys to 518 households randomly chosen from the same region in September 2012. We compared responses pre- and post-OCV campaign. Post-vaccination, there was improved knowledge with significant increase in percentage of respondents with â¥ 3 correct responses on cholera transmission mechanisms (odds ratio[OR] 1. 91; 95 % confidence interval[CI] 1. 52 - 2. 40), preventive methods (OR 1. 83; 95 % CI 1. 46 - 2. 30), and water treatment modalities (OR 2. 75; 95 % CI 2. 16 - 3. 50). Relative to pre-vaccination, participants were more likely post-OCV to report always treating water (OR 1. 62; 95 % CI 1. 28 - 2. 05). Respondents {{were also more likely to}} report hand washing with soap and water > 4 times daily post-vaccine (OR 1. 30; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 64). Knowledge of treating water as a cholera prevention measure was associated with practice of always treating water (OR 1. 47; 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 89). Post-vaccination, knowledge was associated with frequent hand washing (OR 2. 47; 95 % CI 1. 35 - 4. 51). An OCV campaign in rural Haiti was associated with significant improvement in cholera knowledge and practices related to waterborne disease. OCV can be part of comprehensive <b>cholera</b> <b>control</b> and reinforce, not detract from, other control efforts in Haiti...|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} {{formerly}} known as Bristol Waterworks Company, which was formed on 16 July 1846 by an Act of Parliament. The first general meeting {{was held in the}} White Lion Hotel on Broad Street. Members of the first committee included William Budd, a physician who helped <b>control</b> <b>cholera</b> outbreaks in Bristol, and Francis Fry of the Fry family. Women were first employed at Bristol Waterworks during the First World War. By April 1942 female staff had entirely replaced men on night telephone duty.|$|R
50|$|Oral cholera {{vaccines}} {{are increasingly}} {{used as an}} additional tool to <b>control</b> <b>cholera</b> outbreaks {{in combination with the}} traditional interventions to improve safe water supply, sanitation, handwashing and other means to improve hygiene. Since licensure of Dukoral and Shanchol, over a million doses of these vaccines have been deployed in various mass oral cholera campaigns around the world. In addition, Vietnam incorporates oral cholera vaccination in its public health programme and over 9 million doses have been administered through targeted mass vaccination or immunization of school-aged children in cholera endemic regions.|$|R
40|$|Practical {{detection}} of cholera toxin (CT) by a liposome PCR (LPCR) immunoassay {{was compared to}} that of an established V. cholerae enterotoxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin reversed passive latex agglutination (VET-RPLA) assay. LPCR detected CT in the range of 10 pg/ml to 100 ng/ml in simulated feces and environmental water. Detection by VET-RPLA required at least 4 to 19 ng/ml CT. Diarrhea transmitted by the fecal-oral route is a major pub-lic health burden in the developing world. The enterotoxin of Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin [CT]) is a major cause of the diarrhea and dehydration in epidemic diarrhea. Monitoring CT can track <b>cholera</b> outbreaks, <b>control</b> epidemics, protect consumers and patients, and possibly prevent bioterrorism. Direct monitoring of CT is important, because the presence of bacteria, even bacteria of the O 1 and O 139 serogroups isolated from cholera epidemics, and the gene encoding CT fail to define toxigenic V. cholerae (12). CT is frequently identified by enzyme-linked immunosor...|$|R
