40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} temperature-independent optical transitions from thermally diffused Gd in GaN. The emission wavelength is sub-bandgap {{with respect to}} GaN. The origin of photon generation is identified as atomic transitions in Gd hosted in the weak interaction field of GaN. The emission linewidth remains sub-nanometer (0. 1 - 0. 6 nm) from 19 to 300 K for all the optical pumping intensities. The shift in wavelength with temperature and optical pumping is negligible (similar to 0. 8 nm) for the entire temperature window. The output intensity is found to scale linearly with the pumping power. The magnetic, electrical, and physical characterizations indicate that Gd acts as an electron trap in GaN. Transient absorption spectroscopy discovers a major nonradiative parallel path for <b>carrier</b> <b>leaking.</b> The observed characteristics may find potential applications in narrow linewidth optical sources.

40|$|Abstract—In passive UHF RFID systems {{backscattering}} is {{used for}} tag to reader communication. This technique relies on a continuous wave signal being transmitted by the reader during the tag’s data transfer. In order to separate transmission and reception paths circulators, directional couplers or disjoint transmit and receive antennas can be used. Perfect isolation is not achievable with any of those approaches. So a <b>leaking</b> <b>carrier</b> is present at the receiver in any case. It is possible to reduce the interference from this signal by some kind of <b>leaking</b> <b>carrier</b> cancellation. Such a cancellation prevents receiver blocking and reduces the baseband hardware’s requirements, depending on the receiver concept. Usually, the narrowband properties of carrier cancellers are studied. This is only sufficient for conventional RFID systems, if the transmitter noise can be neglected. Broad-band RFID systems, as recently discussed in literature, also require broadband <b>leaking</b> <b>carrier</b> cancellers. In this paper the broadband suppression properties of carrier cancellers are first investigated theoretically. Further a hardware implementation is presented and characterized. Finally, measurement results are compared to the theoretical findings. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the basic physics of charge <b>carriers</b> (electrons) <b>leaking</b> {{out of the}} inversion layer of a metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor with a biased gate. In particular, we treat the gate leakage current as resulting from two combined processes: (1) the time-dependent decay of electron wave packets representing the inversion-layer charge and (2) the local generation of "new" electrons replacing those that have leaked away. As a result, the gate current simply emerges as {{the ratio of the}} total charge in the inversion layer to the tunneling lifetime. The latter is extracted from the quantum dynamics of the decaying wave packets, while the generation rate is incorporated as a phenomenological source term in the continuity equation. Not only do the gate currents calculated with this model agree very well with experiment, the model also provides an onset to solve the paradox of the current-free bound states representing the resonances of the Schroumldinger equation that governs the fully coupled metal-oxide-semiconductor system. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In {{semiconductor}} devices, leakage is {{a quantum}} phenomenon where mobile charge carriers (electrons or holes) tunnel through an insulating region. Leakage increases exponentially as {{the thickness of}} the insulating region decreases. Tunneling leakage can also occur across semiconductor junctions between heavily doped P-type and N-type semiconductors. Other than tunneling via the gate insulator or junctions, <b>carriers</b> can also <b>leak</b> between source and drain terminals of a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) transistor. This is called subthreshold conduction. The primary source of leakage occurs inside transistors, but electrons can also leak between interconnects. Leakage increases power consumption and if sufficiently large can cause complete circuit failure.|$|R
40|$|The light {{sources for}} optical {{communications}} in the 1. 3 - 1. 5 µm range are the quaternary InGaAsP/InP lasers which emit in this low loss region of optical fibers. The structure and properties of some lasers fabricated in this material {{system as well}} as their integration into optoelectronics are treated in this thesis. Lasers exhibiting low threshold, high power and stable far field are extremely desirable in communication systems. Selective epitaxial growth offers an elegant yet powerful technique of fabricating laser structures with these properties. Its application to, as well as properties of, the resulting laser structures are presented. In particular, a laser with high output power is demonstrated. To further extend the operating power of index guided laser diodes in a stable fundamental mode, gain stabilization is proposed as an effective means of discriminating against higher order transverse mode operation. The optimal design for gain stabilized fundamental mode operation is formulated theoretically and verified experimentally. Precipitous increase of threshold current with temperature has been observed in some InGaAsP/InP lasers. Electron leakage over the heterobarrier has been identified as the cause of this abnormality. The origin as well as the control of these <b>leaked</b> <b>carriers</b> is studied. Advances in optoelectronic integration consisting of diffraction coupled arrays and the demonstration of Laser-MISFET devices and the technique of microcleaved mirrors are described in detail. The microcleavage technique is applied to the fabrication of very short cavity lasers. The advantages of short cavities are presented. ...|$|R
40|$|InAs/GaSb superlattices are a {{material}} system {{well suited to}} growth via molecular beam epitaxy. The ability to tune the band gap over the entire mid and long wave infrared spectrum gives {{a large number of}} applications for devices made from InAs/GaSb superlattice material. The growth of high quality InAs/GaSb superlattice material requires a careful study of the parameters used during epitaxial growth. This work investigates the growth of tunnel junctions for InAs/GaSb based superlattice light emitting diodes, the presence of defects in GaSb homoepitaxial layers, and variations in the growth rate of InAs/GaSb superlattice samples. Tunnel junctions in cascaded structures must provide adequate barriers to prevent <b>carriers</b> from <b>leaking</b> from one emission region to the next without first recombining radiatively, {{while at the same time}} remain low in tunneling resistance for current recycling. A variety of tunnel junction designs are compared in otherwise identical four stage InAs/GaSb superlattice light emitting diodes, which past studies have found hole confinement to be problematic. GaSb was used on the p-side of the junction, while various materials were used on the n-side. Al 0. 20 In 0. 80 As 0. 73 Sb 0. 27 tunnel junctions function best due to the combination of favorable band alignment and ease of growth. Pyramidal defects have been observed in layers of GaSb grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaSb substrates. These defects are typically 3 - 8 nanometers high, 1 - 3 microns in diameter, and shaped like pyramids. Their occurrence in the growth of GaSb buffer layers can propagate into subsequent layers. Defects are nucleated during the early stages of growth after the thermal desorption of native oxide from the GaSb substrate. These defects grow into pyramids due to a repulsive Ehrlich-Schwoebel potential on atomic step edges leading to an upward adatom current. The defects reduce in density with growth of GaSb. The insertion of a thin AlAsSb layer into the early stages of the GaSb buffer increases the rate of elimination of the defects, resulting in a smooth surface within 500 nm. The acceleration of defect reduction is due to the temporary interruption of step-flow growth induced by the AlAsSb layer. This leads to a reduced isolation of the pyramids from the GaSb epitaxial layer, and allows the pyramidal defects to smooth out. Investigations into varying the superlattice growth rate have not been reported widely in the literature. Due to the frequent use of soaks, growth interrupts, and other interface structuring steps the superlattice growth rate and the interface layer sequence are linked. In order to properly study the effects of growth rate variations and interface design changes it is necessary to account for the effect on growth rate due to the interfaces. To this end it is useful to think of the effective growth rate of the superlattice, which is the total layer thickness divided by the total time, per superlattice period. Varying the effective growth rate of superlattice photoluminescence samples shows a peak in output at ˜ 0. 5 monolayers per second. Investigations into the structural properties of the superlattices show no decrease in structural uniformity for effective growth rates up to ˜ 1. 4 monolayers per second...|$|R
30|$|An RFID tag {{consists}} of an antenna that is connected to an electronic circuit, which in most cases is built on an integrated circuit. Many RFID systems use the so-called passive or semi-passive tags that do not use an internal power source {{to communicate with the}} RFID reader. They instead use backscattering, a technique which is {{based on the fact that}} the amplitude and phase of the waves scattered from an antenna depend on the antenna termination impedance. Thus, the tag sends data to the reader by modulating the impedance that the tag chip presents to the antenna terminals [2, 3]. While this backscattering technique, seen from the tag, enables remotely powered communication, it necessitates a constant carrier signal to be transmitted from the RFID reader during the tag to reader data transfer [4 – 6]. Therefore, the RFID reader has to transmit a carrier signal while it simultaneously receives a weak backscattered signal from the tag. To separate transmit an receive paths, readers either use separate transmit and receive antennas or use circulators or directional couplers. In analogy to radar systems, the first case is called bistatic, while the second one is called monostatic. Still, both system concepts struggle with low transmitter to receiver isolations [7]. This demands for receivers with very large dynamic ranges, which enhance costs, both on the analog front end as well as on the analog to digital converters. To reduce these demands, many authors [6, 8 – 17] as well as commercial monolithic RFID reader chip manufacturers [18, 19] propose or use active leakage cancellation techniques. These techniques, which originate in radar [20, 21], extract a part of the transmit signal, adjust it in amplitude and phase and inject it at the receiver. When the amplitude is adjusted to be equal and the phase to be opposite of the leakage signal, the deliberately added signal and the leakage signal cancel. While there exist many publications on hardware implementations of these <b>leaking</b> <b>carrier</b> cancellers (LCCs), few exist on adjustment algorithms to adapt them. However, adaption is critical [22, 23] because typical RFID scenarios like warehouses and conveyor belts change permanently and therefore cannot be adjusted statically.|$|R
