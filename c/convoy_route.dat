5|$|The British {{military}} {{was surprised by}} the attack on Convoy Faith, as it had been believed that the Condors no longer posed a serious threat. In response, the <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> between Britain and Africa was moved to the west. The German Condor force attempted to repeat its success against Convoy Faith by carrying out similar attacks on other convoys, but sustained heavy losses from Allied anti-aircraft guns and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Shannon and Minotaur {{were also}} present during the {{attempted}} interception of the High Seas Fleet by the Grand Fleet on 19 August although no combat occurred. For {{the rest of}} the war, the ships were assigned to the Northern Patrol. On 11 December 1917, the sisters and four destroyers were assigned to patrol the <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> between Lerwick and Norway, but the Germans successfully destroyed a convoy off the Norwegian coast on the following day and returned home without being spotted. The British ships were only able to rescue survivors and escort the sole surviving ship from the convoy, the crippled destroyer , back to Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|Lütjens {{then decided}} to move to a new area, as the {{surviving}} members of the dispersed convoy had sent distress signals. He chose the Cape Town-Gibraltar <b>convoy</b> <b>route,</b> and positioned himself to the northwest of Cape Verde. The two ships encountered another convoy, escorted by the battleship , on 8 March. Lütjens again forbade an attack, but he shadowed the convoy and directed U-boats to attack. A pair of U-boats sank a total of 28,488 tons of shipping on the night of 8–9 March. Malaya turned on the two battleships and closed to , well within the range of the Germans' guns, but Lütjens refused to be drawn into an engagement. He instead turned toward the mid-Atlantic, where Scharnhorst sank the Greek cargo ship Marathon. The two ships then refueled from the tankers Uckermark and Ermland on 12 March.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of the Atlantic, Gibraltar {{played a}} key role. The Ocean Convoy System adopted by Britain {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940 ran on two routes – an east–west route between the UK and North America, and a north–south route between the UK, Gibraltar and Freetown in British-ruled Sierra Leone. Even before the war, Gibraltar had been {{designated}} as one of the main assembly points for convoys heading inbound to Europe. From late 1942, Gibraltar was the destination of the Central Atlantic <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> between the United States and the Mediterranean in support of Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and elsewhere in the region. A huge number of Allied troops and ships travelled this route; between November 1942 and August 1945, 11,119 ships travelled in 189 convoys between Gibraltar and the United States and vice versa, and between December 1942 and March 1945, 536,134 troops were transported from the United States to Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Britain {{began on}} 10 July 1940, {{when the first}} Luftwaffe bomber fleets began attacking convoys and Royal Navy forces in English ports and the Channel. The results were {{positive}} and the Germans succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the channel <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> and to redirect shipping to ports in north-eastern Britain. With this achieved the Luftwaffe began {{the second phase of}} its air offensive, attacking RAF airfields and supporting structures on the British mainland. The codename of the offensive was Unternehmen Adlerangriff ("Operation Eagle Attack"). On 12 August, it flew its first missions in this regard. On 13 August, the Luftwaffe carried out its largest attack to date on the mainland. Christened Adlertag ("Eagle Day"), the attack was a failure. Nevertheless, the raids continued, at great cost to both sides. The impact of the German offensive on RAF airfields and Fighter Command is disputed. Some historians believe that the attacks were not having much effect and that the Germans were losing the attrition battle, while others believe the RAF was faltering.|$|E

5|$|Until the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to begin {{operations}} over the mainland, {{the first phase of}} the German air offensive targeted British shipping in the Channel. The raids rarely involved attacks against RAF airfields inland, but encouraged RAF units to engage in battle by attacking British Channel convoys. These operations lasted from 10 July to 8 August 1940. The attacks against shipping were not very successful, and only 24,500 GRT was sunk. Mine laying from aircraft had proved more profitable, sinking 38,000 tons. The impact on Fighter Command was minimal. It had lost 74 fighter pilots killed or missing and 48 wounded in July, but British strength rose to 1,429 by 3 August, leaving it only short of 124 pilots. Still, the attacks succeeded in forcing the British to abandon the Channel <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> and to redirect shipping to ports in north-eastern Britain. With this achieved the Luftwaffe began the second phase of its air offensive, attacking RAF airfields and supporting structures in Britain.|$|E

She served on the Derry-New York <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> until 4 October 1944, crossing the ocean a total of 16 times without incident. Between voyages, she underwent anti-submarine training at Derry or Casco Bay, Maine, and received voyage repairs made necessary by the rough North Atlantic weather.

Nevertheless, on 14 October the leaders of Lebanon's key factions agreed to conduct reconciliation talks in Geneva, Switzerland. Although the ceasefire officially held into mid-October, factional clashes intensified and sniper attacks on MNF contingents became commonplace.

25|$|The final major {{military}} {{operation in the}} war in the Middle East took place shortly thereafter. The Soviet Union desperately needed supplies for its war against Germany. Supplies were being sent around the North Cape <b>convoy</b> <b>route</b> to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk, but the capacity of that route was limited and subject to enemy action. Supplies were also sent from the United States to Vladivostok in Soviet-flagged ships. However, yet more capacity was needed, the obvious answer was to go through Persia (now Iran). The Shah of Persia was somewhat pro-German, and so would not allow this. Consequently, British and Soviet forces invaded and occupied Persia. The Shah was deposed (removed from power) and his son put on the throne.|$|E
500|$|On 22 April, Bayern and {{the rest}} of the German fleet {{assembled}} in the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven and departed the following morning at 06:00.

500|$|The British {{military}} conducted regular convoys {{to transfer}} personnel from the United Kingdom to the Middle East and India from mid-1940 until late 1943.

The WS convoys typically comprised several large ocean liners which had been converted to troopships protected by a strong force of warships. As the Mediterranean Sea was a war zone, the convoys normally traveled from the Clyde in Scotland to the Middle East or South Asia via the Cape of Good Hope at {{the southern tip of}} Africa. En route, the ships typically stopped at Freetown in West Africa to refuel and embark water, and again at either Cape Town or Durban in South Africa.

500|$|Admiral Scheer {{had used}} light surface forces to attack British convoys to Norway {{beginning}} in late 1917.
