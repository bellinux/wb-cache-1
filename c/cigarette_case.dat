5|$|Along {{with many}} veterans, Waddy has {{returned}} to Arnhem frequently. When visiting in 1954 he was presented with a damaged silver <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> bearing his surname.

5|$|The {{bridge was}} still under {{construction}} in January 1928, {{and at that time}} the estimated date of completion was only a month away. The bridge finally opened to traffic on 14 April. The official opening of the bridge by the NSW Governor Dudley de Chair occurred on 10 July, and was celebrated by the cutting of the ribbon and an opening of the gates {{at each end of the}} lift span. In return he was presented with a silver <b>cigarette</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E

25|$|In Taylor's pockets, {{investigators}} found a wallet holding $78 in cash, a silver <b>cigarette</b> <b>case,</b> a Waltham pocket watch, a pen knife, and a locket bearing {{a photograph of}} actress Mabel Normand. A two-carat diamond ring was on his finger. With {{the evidence of the}} money and valuables on Taylor's body, it seemed apparent that a robbery was not the motive for the killing; however, a large but undetermined sum of cash that Taylor had shown to his accountant the day before was missing and apparently never accounted for. After some investigation, the time of Taylor's death was set at 7:50p.m. on the evening of 1 February 1922.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Second World War, Doohan joined the Royal Canadian Artillery and {{was a member of the}} 14th (Midland) Field Battery, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the 14th Field Artillery Regiment of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division. He was sent to England in 1940 for training. He first saw combat landing at Juno Beach on D-Day. Shooting two snipers, Doohan led his men to higher ground through a field of anti-tank mines, where they took defensive positions for the night. Crossing between command posts at 11:30 that night, Doohan was hit by six rounds fired from a Bren Gun by a nervous Canadian sentry: four in his leg, one in the chest, and one through his right middle finger. The bullet to his chest was stopped by a silver <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> given to him by his brother. His right middle finger had to be amputated, something he would conceal on-screen during most of his career as an actor.|$|E

500|$|Three Golden Gun props were made; a solid piece, {{one that}} could be fired with a cap and {{one that could}} be {{assembled}} and disassembled, although Christopher Lee said that the process [...] "was extremely difficult." [...] The gun was [...] "one of the more memorable props in the Bond series" [...] and consisted of an interlocking fountain pen (the barrel), cigarette lighter (the bullet chamber), <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> (the handle) and cufflink (the trigger) with the bullet secured in Scaramanga's belt buckle. In the film, the gun was designed to accept a single 4.2-millimeter, 23-carat gold bullet produced by Lazar, a gunsmith in Macau who specialized in custom weapons and ammunition. The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll {{of the most popular}} film weapons, which surveyed approximately 2,000 film fans.|$|E
500|$|One {{theory as}} to how Göring {{obtained}} the poison holds that U.S. Army Lieutenant Jack G.

500|$|The play {{opens with}} Algernon Moncrieff, an idle young gentleman, {{receiving}} his best friend, Jack Worthing ('Ernest'). Ernest {{has come from}} the country to propose to Algernon's cousin, Gwendolen Fairfax. Algernon refuses to consent until Ernest explains why his <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> bears the inscription, [...] "From little Cecily, with her fondest love to her dear Uncle Jack." [...] 'Ernest' is forced to admit to living a double life. In the country, he assumes a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward, the heiress Cecily Cardew, and goes by the name of John (or Jack), while pretending that he must worry about a wastrel younger brother named Ernest in London. In the city, meanwhile, he assumes the identity of the libertine Ernest. Algernon confesses a similar deception: he pretends to have an invalid friend named Bunbury in the country, whom he can [...] "visit" [...] whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation. Jack refuses to tell Algernon the location of his country estate.|$|E

500|$|On 6 February 1957, the Soviet {{government}} {{released a}} document dated 17 July 1947, which stated [...] "I {{report that the}} prisoner Wallenberg who is well-known to you, died suddenly in his cell this night, probably {{as a result of}} a heart attack or heart failure. Pursuant to the instructions given by you that I personally have Wallenberg under my care, I request approval to make an autopsy with a view to establishing cause of death....

500|$|At Trieste {{a fellow}} MI6 agent, [...] "Captain Nash", {{introduces}} himself and Bond presumes {{he has been}} sent by M as added protection {{for the rest of}} the trip. Romanova is suspicious of Nash, but Bond reassures her that the man is from his own service. After dinner, at which Nash has drugged Romanova, they rest. Bond is woken with a weapon pointing at him and Nash reveals himself to be the killer Grant. Instead of killing Bond immediately, he describes SMERSH's plan. He is to shoot Bond through the heart and dispose of Romanova after leaving a film of their love-making in the luggage; in addition, the Spektor is booby-trapped to explode when examined. As Grant talks, Bond places his metal <b>cigarette</b> <b>case</b> between the pages of a book he holds in front of him, positioning it in front of his heart to stop the bullet. After Grant fires, Bond collapses to the floor and, when Grant steps over him, he attacks and kills the assassin. Bond and Romanova escape.|$|E
