50|$|The {{platform}} provides applications with {{a number}} of high-level abstractions, through which the applications can learn {{about the state of the}} network and through which they can control the flow of traffic through the network. The network graph abstraction provides information about the structure and topology of the network. The flow objective is a device-centric abstraction that allows applications to direct flow of traffic through a specific device without the need to be aware of the device table pipeline. Similarly, the intent is a network-centric abstraction that gives application programmers the ability to control network by specifying what they wish to accomplish rather than specifying how they want to accomplish it. This simplifies application development and at the same time provides the platform with added degrees of freedom to resolve what would normally be considered <b>conflicting</b> <b>requests.</b>|$|E
50|$|That same year, Murong Huang, {{countering}} his father's prior {{policy of}} having no contact {{at all with}} Jin's rival Later Zhao, sent messengers to Later Zhao promising to be a vassal and requesting a joint attack against the Duan. Later Zhao's emperor Shi Hu was very pleased, and they agreed on an attack in 338. In the spring, they launched the attacks. Murong Huang quickly attacked and pillaged the Duan cities north of its capital Lingzhi (令支, in modern Tangshan, Hebei), defeating Duan Lan's forces. He then withdrew, and when Later Zhao forces arrived, Duan Liao no longer dared to face them but instead abandoned Lingzhi and fled. Lingzhi surrendered to Later Zhao. Shi Hu was happy about the victory but angry that Murong Huang withdrew before the armies could meet, {{and he decided to}} turn his armies against Murong Huang instead. With Later Zhao's massive armies arriving in Former Yan territory, nearly all of the cities submitted to Later Zhao except the capital Jicheng. Murong Huang considered fleeing, but under advice of his general Muyu Gen (慕輿根), he stayed and defended the city for nearly 20 days, and Later Zhao forces were forced to withdraw; Murong Huang then sent his son Murong Ke to attack the retreating Later Zhao troops, scoring a great victory, and the only Later Zhao force remaining intact was that of Shi Min, Shi Hu's adopted grandson. After Later Zhao's withdrawal, Murong Huang recaptured the cities that had rebelled. He also took over cities formerly ruled by the Duan, extending into modern northern Hebei. In early 339, after Duan Liao sent <b>conflicting</b> <b>requests</b> to Later Zhao and Former Yan, requesting surrender, the Later Zhao and Former Yan forces engaged, and Murong Ke again won a great victory over Later Zhao. Murong Huang honored Duan Liao as a guest and merged Duan's remaining forces into his own. Later that year, however, Duan planned a rebellion and was killed by Murong Huang. (However, the Duan clan was not wiped out, and many members of the Duan clan later served as generals, officials, and imperial consorts of the Murongs.) From this point on, Former Yan forces would conduct yearly raids against Later Zhao's border region. They would also periodically attack the Yuwen and the Goguryeo.|$|E

We specify the requirements on local views, and present an algorithm satisfying the requirements. The time and message complexities of the composite algorithm for dynamic conflict resolution depend minimally on global parameters and offer a significant improvement over existing algorithms.

40|$|This paper proposes CAESAR, a novel multi-leader Generalized Consensus {{protocol}} for geographically replicated sites. The main goal of CAESAR is to overcome {{one of the}} major limitations of existing approaches, which is the significant performance degradation when application workload produces <b>conflicting</b> <b>requests.</b> CAESAR does that by changing the way a fast decision is taken: its ordering protocol does not reject a fast decision for a client request if a quorum of nodes reply with different dependency sets for that request. The effectiveness of CAESAR is demonstrated through an evaluation study performed on Amazon's EC 2 infrastructure using 5 geo-replicated sites. CAESAR outperforms other multi-leader (e. g., EPaxos) competitors by as much as 1. 7 x in the presence of 30 % <b>conflicting</b> <b>requests,</b> and single-leader (e. g., Multi-Paxos) by up to 3. 5 x.
