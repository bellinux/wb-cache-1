25|$|In 1950, when a {{brokerage}} firm {{had tried to}} compel arbitration with an investor alleging his broker left him holding the bag in a pump and dump scheme, the case had gone {{all the way to}} the Supreme Court. In 1953 it had held in Wilko v. Swan that three provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 (or, the 1933 Act), which regulates the primary market in which securities issuers sell directly to buyers, were controlling, allowing investors to take their claims to court regardless of what contracts and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) said. It found that the language in the 1933 Act voiding any waiver of any provision of the statute was broad enough to cover arbitration clauses, and deduced congressional preference for the courts in language that allowed a special cause of action where the burden of proof was on the seller of the security to show that they were unaware of the dubious nature of the security sold, and allowed buyers to sue in any state or federal <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction.</b>|$|E
25|$|For example, {{suppose that}} a {{container}} ship comes into port in Miami, Florida, United States. The ship, which is Liberian-registered, is wanted as security for various debts incurred by its Master while in Denmark. Made {{aware of the}} ship's presence, a local lawyer moves to impose a lien which involves a form of arrest by means of de novo proceedings in rem. The local Federal district sitting in Admiralty determines that the ship's Master had ostensible authority as an agent to pledge the credit of the ship's owners (who are English). It also determines that neither the ship nor its owners have violated American law in any way, and the local court {{is not in a}} good position to hear witnesses who are all resident in other states. Further, major liability in demurrage to the innocent charterers, forwarders, etc. will be incurred if the ship is detained without just cause, so it would not be unreasonable for the Federal Court to decline jurisdiction. Whether there is subsequent litigation in another state will depend on the tactics of the creditors. Without a lien over the ship or the ability to obtain some form of control over the assets of the debtor, making a claim for money owing may not be cost-effective. But if there have already been proceedings on the issue of liability before a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in another state so that the action in Miami is purely by way of enforcement, the Miami jurisdiction, whether it be state or federal would be the forum conveniens because the ship is physically within the jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{subject is}} the conditional release {{practice of the}} convicted from district prison. The analysis was performed by considering the risk factors of recidivism that prison and the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> take into account when recommending and granting parole. On {{the basis of the}} Ministry of Justice and Public Administration directive (2013), the recidivism risk assessment instrument was introduced in our penal practice, and it was based on the OASys (Offender Assessment System) instrument. In the district prisons practice, The Questionnaire on the Risk Assessment for the Convicts Sentenced to Imprisonment up to Three Years (UPROKZ 3) is used for the assessment of recidivism, which is the reduced version of the OASys instrument. The introduction of these instruments should overcome the use of general guidelines when assessing the risk of recidivism and the conditional release proposals, which led to voluntarism and arbitrariness. The research was conducted on a sample of 68 criminal records of the convicts who served their prison sentence in the District Prison in Užice. All convicts were evaluated by the UPROKZ 3 questionnaire. During the period between January 2016 and June 2016, the convicts submitted a request for the allocation of parole, and the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> made decisions to grant it. The research results indicated that the <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> granted parole more frequently than the prison recommended it.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{investigating the}} legality of the IMF and World Bank Structural Adjustment Programmes has emphasised the need for additional conditionality to be imposed on the recipient nations to enhance their Human Rights performance. This paper, however, evaluates {{the legality of}} the conditionality terms imposed in many of the Structural Adjustment Programmes developed and imposed by the IMF and the World Bank on recipient nations from a different perspective; that of the impact and results of the programmes on Human Rights achievements by the recipient nations and also the legality of conditionality clauses within the terms of the charters of the Bretton Woods organisations about which there has been much scholastic debate. This is approached from the basis {{of the nature of the}} institutions and their governing Articles of Agreement together with the approach to interpretation of these Articles by the Legal Counsel; taking the works of Ibrahim Shihata (a Senior Vice-President and General Counsel to the World bank) as evidence of the institutional approach. This is contrasted with the works of one of the chief Economists of the World Bank, Prof. Joseph Stiglitz, which develops the economic framework for analysis of the impact. Research shows that many of the Bretton Woods institution purposes have not been achieved in many of the countries involved as recipients, as will be analysed later. Indeed there are many documented cases where the results are the direct opposite of these purposes, as will be further analysed. An external view of this is developed from the SAPRIN studies undertaken in conjunction with the World Bank between 1995 and 2001 which provides a basis for comparison to relevant International Human Rights Treaties as evidence. Specifically, the following are used as benchmarks for this analysis; the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and ILO Convention No 87 treaties. It is concluded, on the basis of the impact of the Structural Adjustment programmes reviewed in the SAPRIN study, that the Structural Adjustment programmes failed both the test of economic efficiency and the test of legality in Human Rights terms. However, there are no <b>courts</b> <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> in which claims can be brought against the Bretton Woods organisations...|$|R
40|$|The ancient {{common law}} {{prohibition}} on multiple trials, {{known as the}} double jeopardy principle or its Latin equivalent nemo debet bis vexari, is a procedural defence that prohibits the prosecution of an accused for a criminal offence for which he has already been acquitted or convicted following a trial on the merits by a <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>competent</b> criminal <b>jurisdiction.</b>   A peremptory plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict may be entered meaning the defendant was formerly acquitted or convicted of the same (or substantially the same) offence.   When the pleas in bar are raised, evidence will be placed before the court, which will normally rule as a preliminary matter whether the plea is substantiated, and if it so finds, the projected trial will be estopped. Double jeopardy can only arise when {{there has been a}} previous criminal trial.   In many countries, the protection against double jeopardy is a constitutional right while in others it is afforded by statute law.     Statutory modification of the principle in England and Wales has been the model for reform in several common law jurisdictions, which allow post-acquittal retrials in limited circumstances where new and compelling evidence emerges or where there acquittal is tainted.   This article critically evaluates double jeopardy law reform in Ireland in the light of reforms in England and Wales and possible implications for the trial of offences in the Irish criminal justice process.
