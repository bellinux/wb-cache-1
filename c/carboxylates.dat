The intercalation of sodium acetate doubles the clay basal spacing and no {{degradation of the}} <b>carboxylate</b> clay is noticed in the extrusion temperature range. These <b>carboxylate</b> clays were used to synthesize polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA) /clay nanocomposites. Nanocomposites were also produced by a one-pot process using in situ prepared <b>carboxylate</b> clay. The <b>carboxylate</b> salts within the clay layers partially neutralize the maleic anhydride groups of the PP-g-MA matrix, in situ during the melt compounding. The ionic groups of the partially neutralized polymer offer favourable interactions with the clay, hence reinforcing the interfacial bond between the polymer and the clay and improving the composite properties.

40|$|Thirty-three {{microorganisms}} {{capable of}} growth with cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> {{as the sole}} source of carbon were isolated from mud, water, and soil samples from the Aberystwyth area. Preliminary screening and whole-cell oxidation studies suggested that, with one exception, all of the strains metabolized the growth substrate by beta-oxidation of the coenzyme A ester. This single distinctive strain, able to oxidize rapidly trans- 4 -hydroxycyclohexane <b>carboxylate,</b> 4 -ketocyclohexane <b>carboxylate,</b> p-hydroxybenzoate, and protocatechuate when grown with cyclohexane <b>carboxylate,</b> was classified as a strain of Alcaligenes and given the number W 1. Enzymes capable of converting cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> to p-hydroxybenzoate were induced by growth with the alicyclic acid and included the first unambiguous specimen of a cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> hydroxylase. Because {{it is a very}} fragile protein, attempts to stabilize the cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> hydroxylase so that a purification procedure could be developed have consistently failed. In limited studies with crude cell extracts, we found that hydroxylation occurred at the 4 position, probably yielding the trans isomer of 4 -hydroxycyclohexane <b>carboxylate.</b> Simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidation, coupled with an assessment of reactant stoichiometry, showed the enzyme to be a mixed-function oxygenase. Mass spectral analysis enabled the conversion of cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> to p-hydroxybenzoate by cell extracts to be established unequivocally, and all of our data were consistent with the pathway: cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> → trans- 4 -hydroxycyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> → 4 -ketocyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> → p-hydroxybenzoate. The further metabolism of p-hydroxybenzoate proceeded by meta fission and by the oxidative branch of the 2 -hydroxy- 4 -carboxymuconic semialde-hyde-cleaving pathway...|$|R

5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} cadmium chemicals like the <b>carboxylates</b> cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined {{as a result of}} environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.|$|E
5|$|Silver(II) {{complexes}} {{are more}} common. Like the valence isoelectronic copper(II) complexes, {{they are usually}} square planar and paramagnetic, which is increased by the greater field splitting for 4d electrons than for 3d electrons. Aqueous Ag2+, produced by oxidation of Ag+ by ozone, {{is a very strong}} oxidising agent, even in acidic solutions: it is stabilized in phosphoric acid due to complex formation. Peroxodisulfate oxidation is generally necessary to give the more stable complexes with heterocyclic amines, such as 2+ and 2+: these are stable provided the counterion cannot reduce the silver back to the +1 oxidation state. 2− is also known in its violet barium salt, as are some silver(II) complexes with N- or O-donor ligands such as pyridine <b>carboxylates.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of benzoate, cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate,</b> and cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> by “Syntrophus aciditrophicus” in cocultures with hydrogen-using microorganisms was studied. Cyclohexane <b>carboxylate,</b> cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate,</b> pimelate, and glutarate (or their coenzyme A [CoA] derivatives) transiently accumulated during {{growth with}} benzoate. Identification {{was based on}} comparison of retention times and mass spectra of trimethylsilyl derivatives to the retention times and mass spectra of authentic chemical standards. 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed that cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> and cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate</b> were produced from [ring- 13 C 6]benzoate. None of the metabolites mentioned above was detected in non-substrate-amended or heat-killed controls. Cyclohexane carboxylic acid accumulated to a concentration of 260 μM, accounting for about 18 % of the initial benzoate added. This compound was not detected in culture extracts of Rhodopseudomonas palustris grown phototrophically or Thauera aromatica grown under nitrate-reducing conditions. Cocultures of “S. aciditrophicus” and Methanospirillum hungatei readily metabolized cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> and cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate</b> at a rate slightly faster than the rate of benzoate metabolism. In addition to cyclohexane <b>carboxylate,</b> pimelate, and glutarate, 2 -hydroxycyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> was detected in trace amounts in cocultures grown with cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate.</b> Cyclohex- 1 -ene <b>carboxylate,</b> pimelate, and glutarate were detected in cocultures grown with cyclohexane <b>carboxylate</b> at levels {{similar to those found}} in benzoate-grown cocultures. Cell extracts of “S. aciditrophicus” grown in a coculture with Desulfovibrio sp. strain G 11 with benzoate or in a pure culture with crotonate contained the following enzyme activities: an ATP-dependent benzoyl-CoA ligase, cyclohex- 1 -ene carboxyl-CoA hydratase, and 2 -hydroxycyclohexane carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, as well as pimelyl-CoA dehydrogenase, glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and the enzymes required for conversion of crotonyl-CoA to acetate. 2 -Ketocyclohexane carboxyl-CoA hydrolase activity was detected in cell extracts of “S. aciditrophicus”-Desulfovibrio sp. strain G 11 benzoate-grown cocultures but not in crotonate-grown pure cultures of “S. aciditrophicus”. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ring reduction during syntrophic benzoate metabolism involves a four- or six-electron reduction step and that once cyclohex- 1 -ene carboxyl-CoA is made, it is metabolized {{in a manner similar to}} that in R. palustris...|$|R

25|$|In the cytoplasm, {{ferrous iron}} {{is found in}} a soluble, chelatable state which {{constitutes}} the labile iron pool (~0.001 mM). In this pool, iron {{is thought to be}} bound to low-mass compounds such as peptides, <b>carboxylates</b> and phosphates, although some might be in a free, hydrated form (aqua ions). Alternatively, iron ions might be bound to specialized proteins known as metallochaperones. Specifically, poly-r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) appear to mediate transfer of free iron to ferritin (for storage) and non-heme iron enzymes (for use in catalysis). The labile iron pool is potentially toxic due to iron's ability to generate reactive oxygen species.
