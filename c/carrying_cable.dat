5000|$|Areas {{included}} within the Goose Hollow neighborhood are King's Hill, Vista Ridge, Gander Ridge, and the adjacent flats near {{the path of}} Tanner Creek. King's Hill is separated from Vista Ridge by the Tanner Creek Canyon spanned by the Vista Bridge.

From 1890 to 1905 a steep and enormous trestle bridge passed through this canyon, <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> cars up to Portland Heights. The neighborhood boundaries range (north/south) from Burnside Street to the low slopes of the West Hills (officially known as the Tualatin Mountains) and (east/west) from I-405 to Washington Park.|$|E
5000|$|The Herzogstand Cable Car [...] (Herzogstandbahn) {{was built}} in 1994 as {{replacement}} for a 4500 ft chair lift through the Bavarian alps. Its two cabins carry passengers from Lake Walchensee (800 m above NN) to the Fahrenberg mountain (1,600 m above NN) on the upper slopes of the Herzogstand mountain. The cableway uses a 43 mm <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> and a 21 mm hauling cable. The cable car is driven by a 185 kilowatt engine. The cable way has two supports, which are 28 m and 24 m high. The journey time each way is four minutes and the cars reach {{a top speed of}} 8 m/s.|$|E
50|$|The system {{consists}} of three types of stations: Power Stations with 135 hp (101 kW) electric motors, powering one or both connecting sections. Terminal stations in Forsby and KÃ¶ping where the limestone was loaded/unloaded also functioned as power stations. Angle stations lack motors and only change {{the angle of the}} cable track by splicing together two sections powered from their respective other sides. Station buildings have an iron frame, wooden walls and roof constructed from asbestos cement. The pulling cables go in endless loops between stations, and kept taut by counterweights in towers in the power stations. The heavier <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> is divided into four runs along each section, connected by tension stations. These stations are comparatively small, simple structures regulating cable tension along the way.|$|E

50|$|The old Hausberg {{cableway}} {{built by}} PHB went into service in 1969. It was a cable car with two cabins, {{each with a}} capacity of 70 people, and operated {{until the end of}} the 2005/06 winter season.

With its 66 cabins by CWA each for 8 people it has a transport capacity of 2,400 passengers an hour. The 50 mm thick <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> runs over 15 pylons. It is driven by an electric motor in the valley station and held at a constant tension by hydraulic tensioning apparatus in the valley station. The garage for the cabins is in the mountain station.|$|E
50|$|Windermere {{railway station}} offers train and bus {{connections}} to the surrounding areas, Manchester, Manchester Airport and the West Coast Main Line, and is about 1.5 mi from the lakefront. Both Stagecoach and the local council provide frequent connecting buses from Bowness Pier; Stagecoach's open-top double-decker buses travel through the centre of town and continue to Ambleside and Grasmere, while the council's wheelchair-accessible minibuses run {{around the edge of}} town. The Windermere Ferry, a car <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> ferry, connects Bowness at Ferry Nab on {{the eastern side of the}} lake with Ferry House Far Sawrey on the western side of the lake, a trip of approximately 10 minutes. For those looking for a more leisurely way to travel there are regular lake cruises running from Bowness Bay to the north end of the lake at Ambleside and south end at Fell Foot.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last mile}} or last {{kilometer}} is a colloquial phrase {{widely used in}} the telecommunications, cable television and internet industries {{to refer to the}} final leg of the telecommunications networks that deliver telecommunication services to retail end-users (customers). More specifically, the last mile refers to the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the end-user's premises. Examples are the copper wire subscriber lines connecting landline telephones to the local telephone exchange; coaxial cable service drops <b>carrying</b> <b>cable</b> television signals from utility poles to subscribers' homes, and cell towers linking local cell phones to the cellular network. The word [...] "mile" [...] is used metaphorically; the length of the last mile link may be more or less than a mile. Because the last mile of a network to the user is conversely the first mile from the user's premises to the outside world when the user is sending data (sending an email, for example), the term first mile is also alternately used.|$|E
