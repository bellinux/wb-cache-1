The analysis was conducted {{from the perspective of}} different connection schemes of atomic packing motifs, {{based on the number of}} shared atoms between two linked coordination polyhedra. The results demonstrate that the cluster connections by face-sharing, specifically with three common atoms, are most favored when transitioning from the liquid to glassy state, and exhibit the stiffest elastic response during shear deformation. These properties of the connections and the resultant atomic correlations are generally the same for different types of packing motifs in different alloys. Splitting of the second RDF peak was observed for the inherent structure of the equilibrium liquid, originating solely from cluster connections; this trait can then be inherited in the metallic glass formed via subsequent quenching of the parent liquid through the glass transition, in the absence of any additional type of local structural order.

30|$|Another {{emergent}} {{feature of}} balanced networks {{is that they}} can support an asynchronous state characterized by large variability in single neuron spiking, and yet arbitrarily small pairwise correlations, even in the presence of substantial amounts of shared inputs [7]. Thus there is a growing consensus that the trial-to-trial irregularity in the spiking of individual neurons is often unimportant, and that information is typically encoded in firing rates. There is then another level of neural variability, namely, trial-to-trial variations in the firing rates themselves. Recent physiological data shows that the onset of a stimulus reduces firing-rate fluctuations in cortical neurons, while having little or no effect on the spiking variability [8]. Litwin-Kumar and Doiron have recently shown how these two levels of stochastic variability can emerge in a balanced network of randomly connected spiking neurons, in which a small amount of <b>clustered</b> <b>connections</b> induces firing-rate fluctuations superimposed on spontaneous spike fluctuations [9].|$|R

Eventually, we evaluated the weightedtopology of the cerebral networks by calculating some theoretical graph indexes. The results show that the main structural changes are encoded in the highest spectral contents (Beta band).

40|$|Following {{experimental}} {{measurements of}} clustered connectivity in the cortex, {{recent studies have}} found that <b>clustering</b> <b>connections</b> in simulated spiking networks causes transitions between high and low firing-rate states in subgroups of neurons. An open question is to what extent the sequence of transitions in such networks can be related to existing statistical and mechanical models of sequence generation. In this thesis we present several studies of the relationship between connection structure and network dynamics in balanced spiking networks. We investigate which qualities of the network connection matrix support the generation of state sequences, and which properties determine the specific structure of transitions between states. We find that adding densely overlapping clusters with equal levels of recurrent connectivity to a network with dense inhibition can produce sequential winner-takes-all dynamics in which high-activity states pass between correlated clusters. This activity is reflected in the power spectrum of spiking activity as a peak in the low-frequency delta range. We describe and verify sequence dynamics with a Markov chain framework, and compare them mechanically to “latching” models of sequence generation. Additionally we quantify the chaos of clustered networks and find that minimally separated states diverge in distinct stages. The results clarify the computational capabilities of clustered spiking networks and their relationship to experimental findings. We conclude that the results provide a supporting intermediate link between abstract models and biological instances of sequence generation...|$|R

On the other hand, this difference reflects not only the distinction between feature based concepts and relational concepts but also how novices and experts can access and utilize such knowledge (Lachner and Nückles 2015). Here, the key concepts with high communicability are abstract, widely applicable and independent of specific situation, for example very general field concepts. Another set of concepts is the set with high local clustering coefficients. These concepts and conceptual elements are specific derived models or specific examples, or auxiliary concepts connected with them. They are not key concepts but auxiliary and strongly context specific concepts and conceptual elements and have a role in supporting or augmenting the theoretical skeletal structure formed by the abstract theoretical concepts with high global connectivity.|$|R

It is shown that the content-based algorithm considerably improves caching performance over the content-blind algorithm at the request-grained level.

As {{a result of the}} inference process, networks estimated from experimentally obtained biological data, represent one instance of a larger number of realizations with similar intrinsic topology. A modeling approach is therefore needed to support statistical inference on the bottom-up local connectivity mechanisms influencing the formation of the estimated brain networks. We adopted a statistical model based on exponential random graphs (ERGM) to reproduce brain networks, or connectomes, estimated by spectral coherence between high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. We validated this approach in a dataset of 108 healthy subjects during eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting-state conditions. Results showed that the tendency to form triangles and stars, reflecting clustering and node centrality, better explained the global properties of the EEG connectomes as compared to other combinations of graph metrics. Synthetic networks generated by this model configuration replicated the characteristic differences found in brain networks, with EO eliciting significantly higher segregation in the alpha frequency band (8 - 13 Hz) as compared to EC.

The prevalence of Internet attacks has increased significantly, but still the challenge of detecting such attacks generally falls on the end hosts and service providers, requiring system administrators to detect and block attacks on their own. In particular, as social networks have become central hubs of information and communication, they are increasingly the target of attention and attacks. This creates a challenge of carefully distinguishing malicious connections from normal ones. Previous work has shown that {{for a variety of}} Internet attacks, there is a small subset of connection measurements that are good indicators of whether a connection is part of an attack or not. In this paper we look at the effectiveness of using two different co-clustering algorithms to both <b>cluster</b> <b>connections</b> as well as mark which connection measurements are strong indicators of what makes any given cluster anomalous relative to the total data set. We run experiments with these co-clustering algorithms on the KDD 1999 Cup data set. In our experiments we find that soft co-clustering, running on samples of data, finds consistent parameters that are strong indicators of anomalous detections and creates clusters, that are highly pure. When running hard co-clustering on the full data set (over 100 runs), we on average have one cluster with 92. 44 % attack connections and the other with 75. 84 % normal connections. These results are on par with the KDD 1999 Cup winning entry, showing that co-clustering is a strong, unsupervised method for separating normal connections from anomalous ones. Finally, we believe that the ideas presented in this work may inspire research for anomaly detection in social networks, such as identifying spammers and fraudsters. I...|$|R
