Atchison added that beyond learning how to spell words, Akeelah must learn the importance of the words. He said that Larabee [...] "looks at Akeelah as a potential leader. He wants her to understand her history. She needs to know the importance of language – and competition." [...] In spite of knowing its importance, it [...] "deconstruct the 'competition' paradigm of learning", according to Ingman.

2500|$|Of the {{approximately}} 2,350 shows the Grateful Dead played, almost 2,200 were taped, {{and most of}} these are available online. The Band began collecting and cataloging tapes early on and Dick Latvala was their keeper. [...] "Dick's Picks" [...] is named after Latvala. After his death in 1999, David Lemieux gradually took the post. Concert set lists from a subset of 1,590 Grateful Dead shows were used to perform a comparative analysis between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened online by Last.fm members. In their book Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business <b>Can</b> <b>Learn</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> Most Iconic Band in History, David Meerman Scott and Brian Halligan identify the taper section as a crucial contributor to increasing the Grateful Dead's fan base.|$|E

Being in doubt as to the true time, I am resolved to regard to- morrow, and every seventh day in succession, as the Sabbath. The very natives, I have observed with great interest, keep one day at fixed intervals sacred to the Sun-god, whom they call Apollon, perhaps the same word as Apollyon. On this day they do no manner of work, but that is hardly an exception to their usual habits. A less industrious people (slaves and all) I never met, even in the Pacific. As to being more than common idle on one day out of seven, whether they have been taught so much of what is essential by some earlier missionary, or whether they may be the corrupted descendants of the Lost Tribes (whom they do not, however, at all resemble outwardly, being, I must admit, of prepossessing appearance), I can only conjecture. This Apollon of theirs, in his graven images (of which there are many), carries a bow and arrows, fiery darts of the wicked, another point in common between him and Apollyon, in the Pilgrim's Progress. May I, like Christian, turn aside and quench his artillery! ...|$|E
