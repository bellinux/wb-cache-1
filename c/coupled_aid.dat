40|$|The {{primary sector}} {{has always had}} a {{fundamental}} role in human activities. In recent years, major industrialised and developed countries increased demand for the positive externalities generated by the agriculture, while they reduced the importance of the sector in terms of production of food. The evolution of public intervention followed the change of the role of agriculture and has tried to propose instruments able to consider and balance both private and public interests. It is especially with the Mid Term Review (MTR) that policy maker has tried to implement a system of subsidies that bound the farmer to a series of activities related either directly or indirectly with the collective welfare. Moving from <b>coupled</b> <b>aid</b> to decoupled one linked to the respect of cross-compliance means changing the concept of public intervention. In this context, a useful evaluation tool should be able to analyse and to catch the changes in farmers behaviour by considering also the territory in order to locate the effects. The territory, as a matter of fact, is not only the place where the effects passively fall, but it is capable of interfering directly in the farmers decision-making process. Therefore, the development of specific methodologies able to analyze farmers’ behaviours and specific instruments linked to the territorial analysis could represent an important tool to assess agricultural policies effects both on enterprises and territory. In this framework a methodology based on the Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) and on the implementation of a Geographic Information System (GIS) seems to answer the several questions about the policies’ assessment and land-use planning. The present research integrates this two methodologies. PMP is used in a territorial model and {{it is based on the}} optimization of an objective function representing a farm gross margin while GIS allows to analyze territorial aspects and to locate the effects of the policy. This tool has been tested in a specific case study in order to analyse the effects of the CAP Reform (in particular decoupling, cross-compliance and modulation) on the primary sector and on farm land use potential changes. The innovative aspect of the research is the attempt to study the impact of agricultural policy through an optimization model that considers among its variables also the specific localization of farms. The final result is represented by the creation of georeferred maps in which the land use changes are evaluated and interpreted under the framework of multifunctionality, in terms of quantitative analysis regarding landscape and, abandonment risk and cattle distribution.

In this paper we focus on an optimization technique with a more global perspective of the application. In particular, we present a methodology for measuring the interaction, or coupling, between kernels within an application and describe how the measurements can be used to improve the performance of scientific applications. We discuss four case studies to demonstrate the use of this methodology. The first study involves the Conjugate Gradient benchmark from the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. The <b>coupling</b> measurement <b>aided</b> {{in the development of a}} new hybrid data structure and corresponding algorithm that slightly increased the performance of the program. The second study involves the Block Tridiagonal NAS Parallel Benchmark, for which the <b>coupling</b> parameter <b>aided</b> in revising the program to reduce the level-two cache misses by 14 %. Next, we introduce improvements to an application in the SpecJVM benchmark suite resulting in 41 % reduction in level-one cache misses.

A non-perturbative treatment, the Dirac-Frenkel time-dependent variational approach is adopted using the multiple Davydov trial states. It is shown that both diagonal and off-diagonal <b>coupling</b> can <b>aid</b> efficient singlet fission if excitonic coupling is weak, and fission is only facilitated by diagonal coupling if excitonic coupling is strong.

40|$|The {{estimation}} {{accuracy of}} a low-cost {{inertial navigation system}} (INS) {{is limited by the}} accuracy of the used sensors and the imperfect mathematical modeling of the error sources. By fusing the INS data with GPS data, the errors can be bounded and the accuracy increases considerably. In this project, a low-cost in-house constructed inertial measurement unit (IMU) and an off-the-shelf GPS receiver are used for the data acquisition. The measurements are integrated with a loosely <b>coupled</b> GPS <b>aided</b> INS approach. For the assessment of the results, one data set with real data obtained from a field test is available. The tuning of the covariance matrices is a delicate adjustment and does not always provide convergence. Values for acceptable results could be found and two implementations of inertial navigation systems are compared. The use of nonholonomic constraints showed a dramatic increase in the accuracy. An analysis of the importance and influence of different IMU sensor errors provides a foundation for the modeling and inclusion of further error states in the extended Kalman filter.
