The artisanal fisheries in Martinique and the trammel-net fleet at Boulogne-sur-Mer (north of France), demonstrate the main factors underlying changes in employment and their complexity.

40|$|We study a two-sector OLG {{economy in}} which a share of old age {{consumption}} expenditures must be paid out of money balances and we appraise its dynamic features. We first show that competitive equilibrium is dynamically efficient {{if and only if}} the share of capital on total income is large enough while a steady state capital per capita above its Golden Rule level is not consistent with a binding liquidity constraint. We thus focus on the gross substitutability in consumption and on dynamic efficiency assumptions and show that, gathered together, they ensure the local determinacy of equilibrium and, as a consequence, rule out sunspot fluctuations. In addition, we prove that the unique steady state may change its stability from a saddle configuration to a source one (undergoing a flip bifurcation) for a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> good as well as for a capital intensive consumption good, when the elasticity of the interest rate is set low enough. However, when the investment good is not too capital intensive, the flip bifurcation turns out to be compatible with high elasticities of the interest rate too. Analogous results within dynamic efficiency are found in the non-monetary model, the existence of a flip bifurcation requiring now a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> good. Eventually, under dynamic inefficiency, in the non-monetary economy local indeterminacy may instead appear, either through a Hopf bifurcation or through a flip one, and its scope improves as soon as the consumption good becomes more and more capital intensive...|$|E

The total quantity of water allowed to be extracted should not exceed 112 million cubic M/year and water extraction per well restricted to 30 Lit/Sec only. It is decided that the distance and spacing between wells at project area should not be less than 1 KM X 1 KM so that water flow should not be affected. Moreover, the water policy also reduced the total center pivot cultivated area to 22 Hectares in stat of 50 Hectares in other coastal areas.

The paper reports investigations into the use of alternative means of financing. More specifically, the use of trade credit and factoring are examined. Indeed, following the trade credit management literature both institutional and macro economic restrictions on small business finance can be overcome by 'larger suppliers' extending trade credit to their smaller customers. However, the DSO-rate cannot be {{used to measure the}} supplier's willingness to invest in trade credit as it depends on both suppliers' and customers' characteristics. The decision to extend trade credit is therefore approximated by the will to control its management and operationalized by the decision to factor or not to factor. The results of our study are twofold. First, factoring is mainly used by small and medium-sized companies. Moreover, when looking at the characteristics of the factor's customers, new companies facing huge capital expenditure programmes and seasonal sales decide to factor. The prejudice about factoring being a last resort means of finance is, however, not supported: companies that decide to use factoring are indeed less profitable, but this is simply due to their high growth and/or <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> programmes.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate profitability and potential global CO 2 emission reduction of energy conversion investments in a small energy intensive industry by using an optimisation method as a decision support tool. The investments are evaluated using consistent future energy market scenarios with interdependent parameters. An optimisation model is developed with reMIND optimisation tool which is used to optimise the system cost of each scenario. The reduction in system cost and global CO 2 emissions of the new investments and results from sensitivity analysis are evaluated to determine the optimal investment solution. In the report, it is established that optimisation methods provide a structured means of studying the risk involved in <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investments.</b> The optimisation results show that investment in a small-scale steam turbine combined heat and power production is a profitable and robust investment. The net reduction of global CO 2 emission is substantial compared with the reference system.

Multiple SMRs {{on the same}} site represent an alternative investment option, that exploits the concept of Economy of Multiples to offset or partially compensate the loss of Economy of Scale. The comparative financial performance has been analysed of alternative NPP investment projects at a single site level: a stand alone, large LWR is compared against multiple SMRs, with the same total power generation capacity. Given conservative assumptions, as far as input variables are considered as deterministic values, scenario simulations show that a LR holds a competitive edge on multiple SMRs, in terms of investment profitability. Nevertheless, LR’s project profitability {{has proven to be}} more volatile against changed scenario conditions such as construction period and cost overrun, reduced electricity output, etc. SMRs’ lower project profitability is counterbalanced by higher capability to deal with perturbations of the forecasted scenario conditions, with limited loss of value, as compared to LR. If Profitability Index is assumed as an indicator of the investment performance, useful information may be derived about business risk and profitability from its distribution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how the functioning of the labor market in Morocco is affecting economic growth. The first section examines the demographic factors affecting the supply side of the labor market such as the population growth, the pace of urbanization, and the increase of female labor force participation over the last decades. These three demographic factors, although dealt with jointly, don’t have the same effects on the labor market conditions and may be connected to economic growth through different channels. The second section explores the potential distorting effects of policy choices undertaken by policy makers in Morocco over the last four decades. For a long time, the government provided much more incentives to <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> at the extent of labor intensive technologies, which distorted the allocation of resources and crowded out the abundant labor force. As a consequence, formal sector has not crated enough job opportunities while survival activities in the informal sector have expanded very rapidly. The third section investigates the educational system as the main mechanism through which human capital is accumulated. As in Lucas-Uzawa framework, human capital is accumulated endogenously as a result of individual optimal investment decisions on the basis of the expected returns on the labor market. One of the key issues is the increasing rate of graduates unemployed. Does this mean that educational system is not adequately responding to the needs of the productive system? Or that the productive system is still underdeveloped to absorb all the available skilled labor supplied on the marketplace. The fourth section of the paper examines the contribution of the public sector to employment and the nature of qualifications required by public sector jobs. The public sector wage bill in Morocco is excessive and tends to put constantly pressure on the government budget, which threatens macroeconomic stability and restrains growth prospects. The fifth section presents briefly the labor market regulation in Morocco and the extent to which they are effectively enforced. It attempts to assess the extent to which the existence of minimum wage has protected the purchasing power of workers. It also deals with the impact of existing regulations imposed to the formal sector on the expansion of a large informal sector. Labor Market, Education, Public employment, Morocco...|$|E
40|$|Deliberately small” nuclear {{reactors}} {{are making their}} way on the market, not as a mere shift backwards to the small scale of first commercial reactors, but as concepts designed to foster modularization, simplification and serial production. They are proposed by manufacturers worldwide (SMART, 4 S, SSTAR, mPower, Nuscale, etc.) and are also intended to address developed electricity markets. The idea of an economic attractiveness of Small and Medium sized Reactors (SMR) is counterintuitive, due {{to the loss of}} Economy of Scale on a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment.</b> Nevertheless a broader understanding of capital costs drivers has shaped a new concept of Economy of Multiples, that applies on multiple NPP deployment. It relies on learning accumulation to mitigate construction costs of later NPP units; design modularization to exploit the benefits of “serial” production; co-siting economies to decrease the incidence of fixed and site-related costs. We assume that smaller NPP size fosters design modularization and simplifications, with related cost savings. While the effect of modularization on construction costs has been modeled, the estimation of design-based savings may be the upmost arbitrary and controversial, but the underlying assumption is that the lower the plant size, the higher may be the “Design cost-saving factor”. The dynamic and benefits of the Economy of Multiples of SMR have already been investigated on a case study of a stand-alone Large Reactor (LR) against four SMR deployed on a single site. The two alternative investment projects have been evaluated on their economic performance and profitability. But Economy of Multiples is not a privilege of SMR. This work aims to analyze at what extent and conditions the Economy of Multiples holds against the Economy of Scale, when NPP of different sizes are deployed in multiple units, considering that the Economy of Multiples smoothes its benefits with the increase in number of units installed and that the maximum size of the sites is a limit to its application on LR. The limit case-study of “Very Small Reactors” (VSR) is investigated, representing a massive NPP deployment and a huge loss of Economy of Scale. Our analysis is performed by mean of INCAS (INtegrated model for the Competitiveness Analysis of Small-medium modular reactors) Polimi’s proprietary simulation code. Scenario simulations are run managing the Design cost-saving factor of each SMR fleet size as a parameter; its value is calculated in order to achieve the same level of economic performance of LR investment scenario. In other words we have determined the required design simplification effort needed by each NPP size, in order to attain the economic performance of the equivalent LR deployment scenario. Our results show that the Economy of Multiples holds as a competitive edge for Medium and Small Reactors even when nuclear site may host multiple LR: 8 - 9...|$|E

Here, in Mátraalja' in the vicinity of Gyöngyös, Nagyréde, Abasár, Matkaz, Visonta, Detk and Halmajugra there are wine cellars and press-houses of various design. Detk lies on the southern side of the Mátra, at a distance of 12 kilometres from Gyöngyös. The name of Detk was first mentioned in the form of Deech in a charter issue in 1348. The name of the village probably derives from a Slavic surname The first landowner was the Kompolti Family. Ludas lies in the same surrounding, ata distance of 3 kilometres from Detk. On the outskirts of the village several million years old paleontological findings weÍe found. The name of Ludas was first mentioned in the form of Lwdas in a charter issue in 24. The name of the village probably derives from {{the fact that there were}} a lot of wild geese in this area in the Middle Ages. The occupation of Hatvan by the Turks in 7544, and then the siege of Eger in 1552 came as a turn in the lives of Detk and Ludas, when the region got almost fully depopulated. After the Turks were expelled, villages were repopulated. According to the property register of 1712, there were more then twelve serfs with land in these villages. In 1723, after several other owneíS' István Tanódy acquired Detk and the neighbouring settlements. These landowning families had a significant role in the future of Detk. The most impor 1 ant sight in the village is Tanódy manor house, which was built in 1767 in late Baroque style by István Tanódy. The oldest monument of the settlement is the church in Ludas' which was built in 1788 by Bertalan Tarródy, landowner. Lack of food and work compelled a greatpart of the people of Detk to emigrate after the beginnig of the 20 th century. They underlook work primarily in the United States. Several of them stayed in this place with their families. Agriculture and grapes had an important role in the life of the village for many centuries. Various materials found and written relics of the past show that in the 4 th - 3 rd centuries B. C. grapes were grown in the territory of Hungary. After the fall of the Roman Empire the inhabitants who remained here continued the wine growing activity. The world-vide reputation of Hungarian wines was mishandled during the socialist period, which followed the World War II. After World War II in Hungary there was a social and economic mutation.

40|$|With {{regard to}} their various and technologically complex {{production}} systems, the economic success of enterprises with a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> structure decisively depends on the fact how they organize their operating business processes {{by means of a}} systematic quality controlling and in a client-orientated and efficient way, and how they permanently de-velop them by performance indicators. The systematics of quality controlling to increase the efficiency of those production systems, that was conceived within the scope of this treatise of engineering science here makes an important contribution. The focal point of the conception concerning the external relationship of the production enterprise concentrated on industrial clients and manufacturers, concerning the internal relationship it concentrated on the direct-productive fabrication processes and on the supporting processes near to production. Basing on a survey and a comparison of approaches already existing, it was possible to demonstrate in a methodical manner that these proceedings did not correspond sufficiently to the explained objective of a specific quality controlling systematics. On the one hand, the reasons for this were that the needs of enterprises with complex production systems within the subject area of strategical as well as operative quality controlling altogether were not treated in a sufficient manner. On the other hand, the existing approaches showed a too small degree of itemization to be used for a relevant practical application. During the further disquisition, apart from the imparting of basic terms there was an integration of the treatise into the subject area of quality controlling. Afterwards, for the characterization of batch pro-duction structures first an according typologization with explanation of the macroeconomic importance and of the specific restrictions for fabrication and installation were object of con-sideration. The following formulation of the objective to develop an evaluation and controlling system, basing on monetary and non-monetary performance figures, was defined on the base of the scientific requirements for action that were identified. The development of the quality controlling systematics itself could be characterized within the further disquisition by elaborating three fundamental elements. The first fundamental element to operationalize the client-orientated enterprise performance comprised – apart from the content bias of the evaluation procedure – the definition of five quality dimensions and the formulation of the respective calculation regulations. Within the scope of the second funda-mental element to operationalize the internal process performance of the enterprise, as a first step, the conception of the overall process efficiency as a non-monetary criterion of evalua-tion and its division into individual parts concerning the effects within the process was elabo-rated. Founding on that, a monetary quantification was developed by means of the methodi-cal calculation of added value and of disprofit and by the specific assignment of reference process modules. The third fundamental element exposed the total operationalization via two aggregation levels concerning process and product for the quality balance of the enterprise, whereupon an additive itemization by the matrix of non-conformity and disprofit was made to evaluate the technical-economic risk potential and to derive generic action recommendations for the enterprise with regard to the reference processes. With the presentation of this quality controlling systematics, for the first time an instrument is available that empowers the company management to improve the specific performance concerning clients and processes systematically and in a synchronous way. The possibility to evaluate the alternatives of action systematically by using the matrix of non-conformity and disprofit enables to determine different options of financial investment with regard to the process alterations and their economic consequence for the value proposition of the enter-prise. As a conclusion, it can be stated that with the presentation of this treatise a proceeding is available that allows a goal-directed evaluation and control of monetary and non-monetary results to increase the efficiency in production enterprises, and that guarantees the industrial practicability by means of a flexible adaptability to the enterprise´s conditions. The necessary selection of technical measures as well as of organizational measures by the company man-agement is substantially supported by qualitative and quantitative performance figures, what leads to a rational as well as to an economic line of action...|$|E

Zur Operationalisierung der betriebsexternen Erfolgsindikatoren wird im ersten Hauptbaustein eine neu entwickelte Kennzahlensystematik für die Bewertung der kundenspezifischen Unternehmensleistung ausgeführt. Die Aufgabe dieser Kennzahlensystematik, die durch eine exponentielle Verlaufscharakteristik gekennzeichnet ist, besteht darin, die kundenbezogenen Qualitätstreiber in Form von Beurteilungsgrößen mit Unterkriterien bzw. Beiwerten abzubilden. Der zweite Hauptbaustein führt die Operationalisierung der internen Prozessergebnisse durch eine sowohl nichtmonetäre als auch monetäre Bewertung aus. Zur Bewertung der betrieblichen Effizienz wird die Struktur der komplexen Produktionssysteme über die Konzeption von Referenzprozessmodulen in Untereinheiten zweckmäßig zergliedert und modellhaft über produkt- und prozessspezifische Kombinationen beschrieben. Ferner werden im Hinblick auf die Erzielung von Wertschöpfung bzw. das Entstehen von Wertverlusten innerhalb der Referenzprozessmodule fünf verschiedenartige Ausprägungsformen methodisch unterschieden und mit wirtschaftlichen Kriterien monetär bewertet. Nach der Operationalisierung und Beurteilung der unternehmensexternen und -internen Erfolgsindikatoren charakterisiert sich der dritte Hauptbaustein des Ansatzes durch die Aggregation der Bewertungsergebnisse innerhalb der ganzheitlichen Qualitätsbilanz. Diese befähigt den Produktionsbetrieb zur zusammenfassenden nichtmonetären und monetären Bewertung seiner Leistungsfähigkeit sowie zur zielgerichteten Ableitung von Maßnahmen zur Optimierung der Unternehmenseffizienz im Rahmen des Qualitätscontrollings. Die Verifizierung der Praxistauglichkeit und der Wirksamkeit des entwickelten Qualitätscontrollinginstrumentariums erfolgt über mehrere Anwendungsbeispiele bei Produktionsbetrieben, die eine erzielte Erhöhung der Effizienz belegen. Ferner wird nachgewiesen, dass durch den Einsatz des konzipierten Qualitätscontrollinginstrumentariums prozessspezifische Risikopotenziale hinsichtlich wirtschaftlicher und technischer Kriterien bewertet und reduziert werden können. With {{regard to}} their various and technologically complex {{production}} systems, the economic success of enterprises with a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investment</b> structure decisively depends on the fact how they organize their operating business processes {{by means of a}} systematic quality controlling and in a client-orientated and efficient way, and how they permanently de-velop them by performance indicators. The systematics of quality controlling to increase the efficiency of those production systems, that was conceived within the scope of this treatise of engineering science here makes an important contribution. The focal point of the conception concerning the external relationship of the production enterprise concentrated on industrial clients and manufacturers, concerning the internal relationship it concentrated on the direct-productive fabrication processes and on the supporting processes near to production. Basing on a survey and a comparison of approaches already existing, it was possible to demonstrate in a methodical manner that these proceedings did not correspond sufficiently to the explained objective of a specific quality controlling systematics. On the one hand, the reasons for this were that the needs of enterprises with complex production systems within the subject area of strategical as well as operative quality controlling altogether were not treated in a sufficient manner. On the other hand, the existing approaches showed a too small degree of itemization to be used for a relevant practical application. During the further disquisition, apart from the imparting of basic terms there was an integration of the treatise into the subject area of quality controlling. Afterwards, for the characterization of batch pro-duction structures first an according typologization with explanation of the macroeconomic importance and of the specific restrictions for fabrication and installation were object of con-sideration. The following formulation of the objective to develop an evaluation and controlling system, basing on monetary and non-monetary performance figures, was defined on the base of the scientific requirements for action that were identified. The development of the quality controlling systematics itself could be characterized within the further disquisition by elaborating three fundamental elements. The first fundamental element to operationalize the client-orientated enterprise performance comprised – apart from the content bias of the evaluation procedure – the definition of five quality dimensions and the formulation of the respective calculation regulations. Within the scope of the second funda-mental element to operationalize the internal process performance of the enterprise, as a first step, the conception of the overall process efficiency as a non-monetary criterion of evalua-tion and its division into individual parts concerning the effects within the process was elabo-rated. Founding on that, a monetary quantification was developed by means of the methodi-cal calculation of added value and of disprofit and by the specific assignment of reference process modules. The third fundamental element exposed the total operationalization via two aggregation levels concerning process and product for the quality balance of the enterprise, whereupon an additive itemization by the matrix of non-conformity and disprofit was made to evaluate the technical-economic risk potential and to derive generic action recommendations for the enterprise with regard to the reference processes. With the presentation of this quality controlling systematics, for the first time an instrument is available that empowers the company management to improve the specific performance concerning clients and processes systematically and in a synchronous way. The possibility to evaluate the alternatives of action systematically by using the matrix of non-conformity and disprofit enables to determine different options of financial investment with regard to the process alterations and their economic consequence for the value proposition of the enter-prise. As a conclusion, it can be stated that with the presentation of this treatise a proceeding is available that allows a goal-directed evaluation and control of monetary and non-monetary results to increase the efficiency in production enterprises, and that guarantees the industrial practicability by means of a flexible adaptability to the enterprise´s conditions. The necessary selection of technical measures as well as of organizational measures by the company man-agement is substantially supported by qualitative and quantitative performance figures, what leads to a rational as well as to an economic line of action...|$|E
40|$|Solar Thermal Power Plants have {{generated}} in the last 10 years a dynamic market for renewable energy industry and a pro-active networking within R&D community worldwide. By end 2015, there are about 5 GW installed in the world, most of them still concentrated in only two countries, Spain and the US, though a rapid process of globalization {{is taking place in}} the last few years and now ambitious market deployment is starting in countries like South Africa, Chile, Saudi Arabia, India, United Arab Emirates or Morocco. Prices for electricity produced by today's plants fill the range from 12 to 16  c€/kWh and they are <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> with <b>investments</b> above 4000  €/kW, depending on the number of hours of thermal storage. The urgent need to speed up the learning curve, by moving forward to LCOE below 10  c€/kWh and the promotion of sun-to-fuel applications, is driving the R&D programmes. Both, industry and R&D community are accelerating the transformation by approaching high-flux/high-temperature technologies and promoting the integration with high-efficiency conversion systems...|$|R
40|$|Industrial robots {{are widely}} used as flexible, re-programmable {{positioning}} devices in manufacturing plants, and allow to save costs, increase productivity and raise quality. However, they still present <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> <b>investments.</b> Therefore, increasing their autonomy and efficiency are topics of ongoing research. With the increasing availability of cheap computation power and low-cost sensors, considerable gains in efficiency and autonomy can be realized {{through the use of}} additional sensors and sophisticated data processing and control algorithms. This thesis focuses on two major research topics. The first topic of this thesis deals with contact modeling and identification and aims to advance the autonomy and intelligence of robots that interact with their environment. To this end, robots are equipped with force sensors, in addition to their built-in position sensors, to gather information about their environment. To interpret measurements from these sensors, this thesis formulates and validates contact models, which describe the behavior of robots in contact with their environment. To characterize the interaction of robots with unstructured or uncertain environments, this thesis also develops contact parameter identification algorithms to identify the parameters of contact models. Based on the identified contact parameters, the accuracy and robustness of the low-level control, as well as the task execution can be improved on-line, while knowledge of the contact parameters can be used off-line to design and validate constrained robotic tasks by means of computer simulations. The second topic of this thesis deals with optimal robot motion planning and aims to advance the efficiency of robot motions. By optimizing robot motions, while taking into account their dynamic behavior, robots can fully exploit their capabilities and make full use of their actuators. This thesis develops computer-aided algorithms for planning of robot motions along prescribed geometric paths, called path tracking problems, with time as the main optimality criterion. These path tracking algorithms allow to relieve operators from the burden of manual optimization and tuning, and reduce the downtime of robots, while increasing their productivity. nrpages: 312 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the different investment volumes and patterns {{for the three}} home countries and the ASEAN hosts, and compares the respective structures with each other. The hypothesis that different trade performances of two countries are coupled with comparatively different investment structures is tested employing some measures of structural similarity. In the second part, the FDI in developing areas are contrasted with the holdings in industrialized countries. The third part deals with the industry structure of FDI in ASEAN manufacturing industries only, thus abstracting from the distorting effect of <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> resource oriented <b>investment.</b> The intra-ASEAN structure of foreign direct investment is analyzed in the following paragraph by linking sectoral and regional structures to each other.

40|$|The airport {{business}} is very <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> and substantial <b>investment</b> {{is needed to}} accommodate traffic growth. Since there is only very limited research on the resulting dilemma of capital funding requirements and delivering shareholder value, and basically none {{on the impact of}} economic regulation on the latter, the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore this issue in depth. In order to address the question if privatised airports earn their cost of capital, 2003 - 2009 data is used for a long-term trend analysis, comparing the financial performance of ten publicly quoted European airports. The majority of sample airports generate a negative economic value added for most of the seven years and correlational research reveals that traffic-induced investment spending is the single most influential factor. Moreover, it indicates a significant relationship between EVA and the respective regulatory regimes of sample airports...|$|R
40|$|The European {{non-ferrous}} metals manufacturing {{industry is a}} strategic sector directly employing 500, 000 people and supplying products for numerous crucial downstream industrial sectors. As a <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> industry, its <b>investment</b> horizon spans over decades and is thus particularly in need of adopting a long-term strategic perspective. This foresight study applied a highly participatory, qualitative methodology that gathered representatives of the {{non-ferrous metals}} industry, research institutions, policymakers, trade unions and stakeholders from upstream and downstream sectors. This methodology allowed: (1) to define a long-term (2050) vision for the non-ferrous metals manufacturing industry and (2) to propose concrete actions for the industry itself, policymakers, and other stakeholders, to address the challenges faced by the sector (trade and competition, innovation, resources, business integrity and skills) on its path towards the vision.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the prospects for}} financing a wave of new nuclear power plants (NPP) using project financing, which is used widely in large <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> infrastructure <b>investments,</b> including the power and gas sectors, but has not previously been used for nuclear power. It argues that the first few NPPs {{will have to be}} financed on balance sheet by large corporations because these plants need to build a positive record on construction risk. If that record can be built there is no reason in principle why large scale project financing should be denied to NPPs. The projects will probably need to have a long term power offtake project, requiring a creditworthy electricity supplier, but this is feasible even in liberalised but relatively oligopolistic power markets like the UK. Interviews with practitioners in the project finance sector confirm that banks are interested, in principle, in lending for nuclear power stations. Project finance would also readily allow multiple shareholdings in individual plants. This in turn would provide the means for power companies to diversify their plant risk and for third party financial shareholders to invest in diversified portfolios. This last feature could open up a new route for significant equity investment in NPPs. The analysis concentrates on the UK but is potentially of wider application. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show the {{importance}} of using project finance in infrastructure investments in developing countries. The paper will be focused only on one infrastructure sector, which is energy. Structurally, power project finance has involved largely buildown-transfer (BOT) project structures and long-term contracts. The projects largely reflect a rational allocation of risks among public and private participants. Private sponsors and lenders generally assume risks for completion and performance. Governments assume substantial risks in nearly all projects, mostly in areas in which they have control, such as utility performance, currency convertibility, fuel costs, inflation, and political event. The aim of this research is to empirically examine a financing and governance structure called Project Finance that typically funds large scale, <b>capital</b> <b>intensive,</b> infrastructure <b>investments</b> in risky countries. The methodology used in this paper is literature review of the main theories for project finance. I will empirically test the propensity of the firms to use project finance, using data of some projects in South –East countries. For this purpose the study compares project financed and corporate financed transactions in the energy sector. I find that the propensity of firms to use project finance is high and statistically significant when large sunk investments have state owned primary buyer firms in risky countries...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{comments}} on the signalling inventory model (Hughes & Schwartz, 1988) was {{the absence of a}} comparison between FIFO and other possible signalling devices. In this paper the model of Hughes & Schwartz (1988) is extended by adding a second accounting signal: the depreciation accounting method. If the manager-owner can choose between FIFO and linear depreciation to solve asymmetries in information about the success of the project, he will always choose the signal, which results in the smallest increase in taxes paid. Therefore, the characteristics of the investment and the purchasing policy are very important. In <b>capital</b> <b>intensive</b> industries, where <b>investments</b> in fixed assets are large, FIFO {{is expected to be the}} cheapest signal. As the volatility of prices and the inventory level go up, FIFO becomes more expensive as a signalling device. Differences in the cost from using a certain signalling strategy can explain why differences in reporting strategies between industries occur. Efficiency; Accounting;...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} century, open pit mines have {{steadily}} increased their production rate by using larger equipments which require <b>intensive</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investment.</b> Low commodity prices have forced companies to decrease their unit cost by improving productivity. One {{way to improve}} productivity is to utilize equipment as effectively as possible. Therefore, the accurate estimation of equipment effectiveness is very important {{so that it can}} be increased. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a well-known measurement method, which combines availability, performance and quality, for the evaluation of equipment effectiveness in manufacturing industry. However, there isn’t any study in literature about how to use this metric for mining equipments such as shovel, truck, drilling machine etc. This paper will discuss the application of OEE to measure effectiveness of mining equipment. It identifies causes of time losses for shovel and truck operations and introduces procedure to record time losses. The procedure to estimate OEE of shovels and trucks has also been presented via numerical example...|$|R

Growing environmental and energy security concerns represent a major driver for the renovation and improvement of existing energy infrastructure. Wind and solar electricity retain the greatest potential to contribute and increase the shares of renewable electricity production; however, current electricity transmission and distribution systems (power highways) do not generally appear adequate to reliably cope with large-scale penetration of such variable renewablesbased generating plants (whether centralised or distributed). Most energy investments are long life and <b>capital</b> <b>intensive,</b> therefore <b>investment</b> decisions taken now will have an impact for many years. When planning the electricity system of the future, it is necessary to adopt an integrated approach to assess the interrelated physical, environmental, cyber, social, economic and policy challenges. Ensuring a higher level of energy security and sustainability is high on the agenda of all countries. The challenges ahead are to identify and implement the solutions that best respond to these needs. The workshop will focus on how these developments can provide examples and opportunities for E&I countries to build smart grids and power highways through sound regional and international investments. Objective of the workshop is also to share experiences on renewable power integration into the electricity grids of Enlargement and Integration Countries. The emphasis will be on practical guidance and exchange of information, a lessons learned approach that will provide instructive examples of assessments of smart power grids, {{both inside and outside the}} EU, with particular focus on the Mediterranean basin...|$|R
