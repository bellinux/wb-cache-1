The {{aim of the}} present experiment was to study the effect of dietary supplementation with inulin on the <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora,</b> fibrolytic activity, and production of volatile fatty acids. Pannon White rabbits (n= 180) were divided into three groups at weaning (28 th day of age) and fed ad libitum. Experimental diets were already fed one week before weaning. The control group (C) was fed a standard basal diet with no supplementation; group M received the same but medicated (1 mg/kg diclazuril, 500 mg/kg oxytetracycline and 50 mg/kg tiamulin) diet, while 4 % inulin (Frutafit, HD, Brenntag, Budapest) {{at the expense of}} barley was added into the diet of the Inulin (I) group. The diets were similar in the level of crude protein, fat and fibre fractions, while diet I differed in starch and sugar content.

This study was conducted to examine the effect of salinomycin on Campylobacter jejuni infection and on the composition of the <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> in broiler chickens. Methods An experimental infection study was carried out in isolators and the intestinal microflora was analyzed using quantitative cultivation, denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), cloning and sequencing. Results We found no effect of salinomycin on C. jejuni but salinomycin significantly affected the composition of the microflora. In addition, salinomycin significantly reduced the prevalence of Clostridium perfringens and we observed a significant increase (62 %) in the mean body weight of salinomycin treated chickens compared to un-treated controls. Conclusion Termination of the use of ionophore coccidiostats will not affect food safety related to campylobacter, but will increase the risk of necrotic enteritis in the broilers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Gluconic acid (GA) {{derives from}} the {{incomplete}} oxidation of glucose by some Gluconobacter strains. When fed to monogastric animals, GA is poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can reach the lower gut where it is fermented to butyric acid. This study investigated the effect of GA on in vitro growth response and proteolytic state of swine <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora.</b> A diet for pigs (CP 15. 8 %, DE 15. 0 MJ/kg) was predigested in vitro to simulate ileal digestion and later used as the substrate in the in vitro fermentation. Caecal content was collected from 6 pigs, diluted with buffer and used as inoculum. The inoculum was flushed with CO_{ 2 }_ and dispensed into five glass syringes and five vessels per treatment, containing predigested diet. Syringes and vessels were incubated at 39 °C for 24 h. There were 6 treatments: control diet, or control diet with GA added at 2, 000, 4, 000, 6, 000, 8, 000, and 10, 000 ppm. Gas production was measured recording the cumulative volume of gas produced every 30 min. Samples of fermentation fluid were collected from each vessel at time 0, 4, 8 and 24 h for ammonia and at time 24 h for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) determination. During the 24 h in vitro caecal fermentation, total gas production and maximum rate of gas production were increased by all GA concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0. 001). Ammonia in fermentation liquor was reduced by GA at 2, 000 (– 26 %; P < 0. 01) and 4, 000 ppm (– 17 %; P < 0. 05) after 4 h and at all concentrations (P < 0. 001) after 8 h and 24 h, with the only exception of GA at 2, 000 ppm. After 24 h of fermentation, total SCFA, acetic acid, butyric acid, acetic to propionic acid ratio, and acetic + butyric to propionic acid ratio were linearly increased in all GA treatments (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Gut {{immunology}} {{encompasses the}} need for local cellular immunity and prevention of systemic immune reactions to dietary antigens. The relation between these factors and nutritional state or the presence of luminal nutrients in the enterally fed and parenterally fed is poorly defined. Most studies suggest that acquisition of lymphoid characteristics is independent of luminal nutrition and its responsiveness is related more to bacterial challenge. Protein malnutrition may impair immune responsiveness by moderating the generalised inflammatory response, rather than through reduced T cell function and IgA synthesis. Predisposition {{to the development of}} gut hypersensitivity can be induced in animals by longterm feeding with elemental diets. The efficient absorption of these diets reduces the <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> burden and together with changed gastric acid secretion and small bowel motility, may affect the composition of the gut flora. Changed luminal nutrition, enhanced tissue damage and inappropriately increased mucosal T cell function may thus be related. The clinical effectiveness, however, of elemental diets in treatment of unresponsive coeliac disease is reassuring. To investigate intestinal immunity in humans, an approach based on whole gut lavage has been developed. Data from this non-invasive human technique will prove to be a useful means of assessing the effects of nutritional rehabilitation on mucosal immunity...|$|E

40|$|Necrotic {{enteritis}} is {{a disease}} of considerable economic importance to the global poultry industry. Clostridium perfringens has long been recognised as the etiological agent of the disease. However, disease initiation and progression is complex {{and appears to be}} precipitated by a range of predisposing factors. The present study investigated microbial interactions in the caecum of birds challenged with C. perfringens that developed necrotic enteritis. Bacterial populations of healthy and diseased birds, across two independent animal trials, were characterised by pyrosequencing of the V 1 -V 3 region of 16 S rRNA genes. Significant changes in the microbiota of infected birds were detected. Most of the affected bacterial species, including a number of butyrate producers, were reduced in abundance in infected birds compared to uninfected controls and a number of phylotypes, classified as Weissella species, were also more abundant in healthy birds. Conversely, some bacterial groups were more abundant in the C. perfringens-infected birds, for example, members of an unclassified order of Mollicutes showed a 3. 7 -fold increase in abundance in infected birds. Representative sequences from this novel order shared 99 % identity with sequences previously detected in intestinal microbiota of chickens and humans, and have previously been shown to be represented in a number of samples originating from irritable bowel syndrome disease patients. We speculate that these newly identified perturbations in the composition of <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> {{may play a role in}} the development and manifestation of necrotic enteritis...|$|E
40|$|Colonization of the caeca {{of newly}} hatched chicks by Salmonella typhimurium was {{prevented}} by oral administration of {{a mixture of}} cultures comprising 48 different bacterial strains originating from an adult bird known {{to be free from}} salmonellas. The treatment conferred protection to the same degree as that obtained previously with a suspension of adult caecal contents or an undefined anaerobic culture from the same source and was demonstrated in four separate laboratory trials. Examination of the <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> of chicks one day after being given the protective treatment showed that the presence of high levels of lactobacilli and Bacteroides spp. which are not found usually at two days of age in chicks produced under commercial conditions was indicative of the successful establishment of an adult-type microflora. Although the usual method of administering the protective organisms was to dose the chicks directly into the crop, it was also found possible to incorporate the organisms in the drinking water given to the birds at dilutions up to one in five, the maximum tested. When chicks were given the bacterial mixture via the crop and fed on a diet containing 10 mg kg- 1 nitrovin and 100 mg kg- 1 monensin, the bacteroides failed to establish in the caeca and the birds were not protected against salmonella colonization. However, when the bacterial cultures were incorporated in the drinking water and the chicks given the same feed, normal protection was obtained; possible reasons for these observations are discussed...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to estimate and compare the caecal microbial activity in hares and rabbits via an analysis of the following end-products of in vitro caecal fermentation: methane, total gas production, short chain fatty acids and ammonia concentration. Hare caecal methanogen-esis occurred at a much lower level (0. 25 mmol/kg for samples incubated without substrate and 0. 22 mmol/kg for samples incubated with substrate) than that of the rabbit (15. 49 and 11. 73 mmol/kg, respectively) (P< 0. 001). The impact of the substrate’s presence on caecal methanogenesis was not significant, though its presence increased the total gas production during fermentation (P< 0. 001). Hare <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> produced a lower short chain fatty acids concentration than did rabbit microorganisms (P< 0. 05). In unincubated hare samples, the short chain fatty acids concentration was 28. 4 mmol/kg, whereas in unincubated rabbit samples, the short chain fatty acids concentration was 51. 8 mmol/kg.

Mortality rate, live weight, feed intake and feed conversion ratio were recorded up to 62 days of age. At 60 days nutrient digestibility was measured by acid insoluble ash method. The caecal content of 10 rabbits per group was collected at 62 days and analysed for volatile fatty acids production, ammonia content and microbial count. Rabbits from the control group had a significantly (p < 0. 01) lower body weight at 62 days (1638. 9 g vs. 1779. 4 g and 1862. 5 g, respectively for the control, MOS and antibiotic groups) while the antibiotic group showed a higher (p < 0. 05) feed intake than the control group (127. 9 g/day vs. 109. 3 g/day). Rabbits from the MOS group had a higher apparent digestibility of cellulose (34. 27 % vs. 29. 61 % and 27. 49 %, respectively for the MOS, control and antibiotic groups) and, as a consequence a higher level of acetate in the caecal content (39. 93 mmol/l vs. 34. 21 mmol/l and 23. 09 mmol/l, respectively for the MOS, control and antibiotic groups). <b>Caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> of the MOS group rabbits also had a higher fermentative activity in respect of protein source, as demonstrated by the higher productions of branched chain fatty acids.

40|$|Xylose is {{an unusual}} nectar sugar found in the nectar of Protea and Faurea (Proteaceae). Since nectar {{composition}} is an important floral characteristic in plant strategies for ensuring reproductive success, the unexplained presence of xylose in Protea nectar prompted this study {{of the interaction between}} pollinators and Protea species. Among pollinators that visit Proteaflowers in the south-western Cape Floral Kingdom, South Africa, insects and birds show an aversion to, and are poor assimilators of, xylose, whereas rodents such as Namaqua rock mice Aethomys namaquensis are the only pollinators so far shown to consume xylose willingly, and are able to obtain metabolic energy from this sugar. Mammalian tissues are not capable of catabolizing xylose efficiently, but certain gastrointestinal microflora are, through a process of fermentation which produces short-chain fatty acids used by host animals in oxidative metabolism. I explored mechanisms enabling Aethomys namaquensis to utilize xylose, in particular, the role of resident intestinal microflora in this process. Chapter One discusses pollination syndromes and the definitions thereof, mammal pollination, with particular reference to Australia and South Africa, and explains the rationale behind the questions addressed in this thesis. To assess xylose utilization in wild-caught mice with and without their natural gastrointestinal microflora, an antibiotic treatment was developed (Chapter Two). The veterinary antimicrobial agent, Baytril 10 % oral solution, was found to be effective in significantly reducing gut microflora in animals on a four-day treatment protocol. The protocol developed here reduced the gut microflora sufficiently for subsequent experiments comparing xylose utilization in mice with and without intact microflora. Xylose utilization was assessed using 14 C-labelled xylose (Chapter Three). Rock mice were caught during Protea humifloraflowering and non-flowering seasons, and fed 14 C-labelled xylose. Exhaled CO 2 and excreted urine and faeces were collected, and label recovery determined. These experiments showed that xylose-utilizing bacteria in the rock mouse gut are very important for xylose utilization. More efficient xylose utilization during the flowering season suggests that this component of the gut microflora is inducible. Culturable gut microflora were then isolated from rock mouse faecal and caecal samples, assessed for xylose utilization to identify positive xylose-fermenters and classified by 16 S rRNA based taxonomy (Chapter Four). Faecal isolates were Lactobacillus murinus and Enterococcus faecium, and caecal isolates were three Bacillus species, Shigella boydii, one Arthrobacter species and two fungal isolates from Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. The types and concentrations of short-chain fatty acids arising from xylose fermentation by <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> were measured using gas chromatography. The fatty acid profile produced by rock mouse gut microflora is similar to that for other animals that rely on gut microbial fermentation to produce fatty acids then used in oxidative metabolism.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess whether}} {{juvenile}} chronic ferric iron ingestion limit colitis and dysbiosis at adulthood in rats and mice. METHODS: Two sets of experiments were designed. In the first set, recently weaned mice were either orally administered ferrous (Fe 2 +) iron salt or ferric (Fe 3 +) microencapsulated iron for 6 wk. The {{last week of}} experiments trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis was induced. In the second set, juvenile rats received the microencapsulated ferric iron for 6 wk and were also submitted to TNBS colitis {{during the last week}} of experiments. In both sets of experiments, animals were sacrificed 7 d after TNBS instillation. Severity of the inflammation was assessed by scoring macroscopic lesions and quantifying colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. Alteration of the microflora profile was estimated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) by measuring the evolution of total <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora,</b> Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and enterobacteria. RESULTS: Neither ferrous nor ferric iron daily exposures at the juvenile period result in any effect in control animals at adulthood although ferrous iron repeated administration in infancy limited weight gain. Ferrous iron was unable to limit the experimental colitis (1. 71 1; 0. 27 MPO U/mg protein vs 2. 47 1; 0. 22 MPO U/mg protein in colitic mice). In contrast, ferric iron significantly prevented the increase of MPO activity (1. 64 1; 0. 14 MPO U/mg protein) in TNBS-induced colitis. Moreover, this positive effect was observed at both the doses of ferric iron used (75 and 150 mg/kg per day po - 6 wk). In the study we also compared, in both rats and mice, the consequences of chronic repeated low level exposure to ferric iron (75 mg/kg per day po - 6 wk) on TNBS-induced colitis and its related dysbiosis. We confirmed that ferric iron limited the TNBS-induced increase of MPO activity in both the rodent species. Furthermore, we assessed the ferric iron incidence on TNBS-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. At first, we needed to optimize the isolation and quantify DNA copy numbers using standard curves to perform by qPCR this interspecies comparison. Using this approach, we determined that total microflora was similar in control rats and mice and was mainly composed of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at a ratio of 10 / 1. Ferric juvenile administration did not modify the microflora profile in control animals. Total microflora numbers remained unchanged whichever experimental conditions studied. Following TNBS-induced colitis, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was altered resulting in a decrease of the Firmicutes numbers and an increase of the Bacteroidetes numbers typical of a gut inflammatory reaction. In parallel, the subdominant population, the enterobacteria was also increased. However, ferric iron supplementation for the juvenile period prevented the increase of Bacteroidetes and of enterobacteria numbers consecutive to the colitis in both the studied species at adulthood.

40|$|Abstract The {{microbial}} {{populations in}} the gastrointestinal tracts of poultry {{play an important role}} in normal digestive processes and in maintaining animal health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics on the growth parameters, gut ecosystem, histology and immune function. In this study, four experiments one in vitro and three in vivo were conducted using specific pathogen free (SPF) and Hubbard broiler chickens. The first experiment was designed to determine the influence of inulin as an effective prebiotic on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains, and to screen LAB for selection as a source of chicken probiotic. Eight strains of LAB were isolated from chicken caeca and three strains from the Plymouth University culture collection were screened for potential probiotic properties for growth in inulin from Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus) and commercial inulin (Frutafit® HD, Netherlands). Lactobacillus animalis JCM 8692 strain isolated from chicken caeca showed the highest auto-aggregation and co-aggregation ability, resistance to acidity and bile salts, strong suppression of pathogens and ability to adhere to epithelial cells compared with other isolated strains. The second experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of commercial inulin and Jerusalem artichoke tubers as prebiotic supplementation on the diversity of the <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora,</b> jejunum histology and immune organ of SPF chickens. This investigation has found that inulin which was extracted from JA had a similar result when compared with commercial inulin and could be a suitable candidate for an inulin source in broiler diets. The third experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of Bactocell® (PRO 1) and Lb. animalis (PRO 2) as probiotic supplements on broiler chickens. EPEF was significantly increased in probiotic 1 and probiotic 2 compared with control (311. 03, 309. 87 and 260. 06) respectively. Both types of probiotics supported the growth of chicks healthy and could be a suitable candidate as a source of probiotic in broiler diet. The fourth experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of dietary supplementation of a probiotic (Lb. animalis), a prebiotic JA tuber and a combination of both (Synbiotic) in broiler chickens. Growth performance was improved in all additive supplementation compared with the control group. EPEF was increased in probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic compared with control (290. 8 ± 11. 8, 300. 9 ± 3. 86, 322. 1 ± 7. 09 and 262. 3 ± 5. 94) respectively. Beneficial bacteria in the guts of chicks fed probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotic was increased compared with chicks fed control diet. The diversity of microbial population in the gastrointestinal tract of chickens improved due to additives. The intestinal villus lengths and microvilli density was improved in all additives supplementation in comparison with control. Overall, it was concluded that probiotic, prebiotic and synbiotics can positively affect production performance and can improve the gut health.

40|$|In {{the early}} seventies, {{it had been}} {{discovered}} that the addition of an undefined mature microflora to 1 -day-old broiler chickens inhibited Salmonella in the caeca of these broilers. This phenomenon is known as competitive exclusion. Thereafter, scientists have focused on developing defined competitive exclusion mixtures of caecal bacteria. One problem in developing defined mixtures is that the mechanism behind competitive exclusion is unknown. The aim of this thesis is to study the suggested role of volatile fatty acids in competitive exclusion of Salmonella enteritidis in the caeca of broiler chickens. In addition, this thesis aims to develop a defined competitive exclusion culture with a low number of bacterial species. Results from a first study showed that volatile fatty acids {{are responsible for the}} reduction of members of the family of Enterobacteriaceae in the caeca of broiler chickens during growth. Since S. enteritidis is a member of this family, these results might indicate that volatile fatty acids could be responsible for the inhibition of S. enteritidis as well. This was further studied in a sequencing fed-batch reactor which mimicked caecal ecophysiology. It was shown that S. enteritidis could be washed out from the reactor when concentrations of volatile fatty acids (representative for a maturated microflora), were applied to a transient state culture of S. enteritidis. In contrast, inhibition of S. enteritidis was less pronounced when concentrations of volatile fatty acids (representative for a <b>caecal</b> <b>microflora</b> of young broilers), were applied. In addition, it was observed that a rapid increase of volatile fatty acids in the reactor, as measured in the caeca of broiler chickens treated with competitive exclusion mixtures, caused washout of S. enteritidis as well. On basis of these results it was decided to develop a defined mixture of two caecal bacterial species, Lactobacillus crispatus and Clostridium lactatifermentans, which are capable of producing volatile fatty acids from lactose. The effect of both bacteria on S. enteritidis was studied in the same sequencing fed-batch reactor. Results showed that both bacteria were capable of inhibiting S. enteritidis, especially when both bacteria were established in the reactor before S. enteritidis. Furthermore, it was shown that inhibition occurred at caecal pH (5. 8) but not at pH 7. 0. This indicates that the undissociated concentrations of acetate and propionate, produced by a coculture of L. crispatus and C. lactatifermentans, are responsible for the reduction of S. enteritidis. Finally, it was studied whether L. crispatus, C. lactatifermentans and dietary lactose can increase concentrations of volatile fatty acids in the caeca of broiler chickens. It was shown that caecal concentrations of lactate were increased in treated broiler chickens but concentrations of acetate, propionate and butyrate were not. Since L. crispatus produces lactate and C. lactatifermentans acetate and propionate, it is concluded that C. lactatifermentans had not become established in the caeca of treated broilers under these experimental conditions. It is concluded from this thesis that volatile fatty acids play a pivotal role in the reduction of S. enteritidis from the caeca of broiler chickens. Furthermore, the developed competitive exclusion culture of L. crispatus and C. lactatifermentans is capable of inhibiting growth of S. enteritidis. In order to obtain reduction in broiler chickens, colonisation of the caeca by L. crispatus and C. lactatifermentans is an absolute prerequisite...|$|E
