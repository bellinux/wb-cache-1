25|$|Region-wide {{accreditation}} {{has also}} been planned for vocational skills. Currently local training agencies award National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) or national Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) certification, which are not valid across Member States. However, in 2003, the Caribbean Association of National Agencies (CANTA) was formed as an umbrella organization of the various local training agencies including Trinidad and Tobago's National Training Agency, the Barbados TVET Council and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States TVET agency and the HEART Trust/NTA of Jamaica. Since 2005, the member organizations of CANTA have been working together to ensure a uniformed level of certified skilled labour under the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME) and CANTA itself has established a regional certification scheme that awards the Caribbean Vocational Qualification (CVQ), which is to replace NVQs and national TVET certifications. The CVQ will be school-based and although based on the certification scheme of CANTA, will be awarded by the Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) which will be collaborating with CANTA on the CVQ programme. At the February 9–10, 2007 meeting of the Regional <b>Coordinating</b> <b>Mechanism</b> for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, officials discussed arrangements for the award of the CVQ which {{was approved by the}} Council for Human and Social Development (COHSOD) in October 2006. It was expected that the CVQ programme may be in place by mid-2007, if all the requirements are met and that provisions were being made for the holders of current NVQs to have them converted into the regionally accepted type (although no clear mandate is yet in place). This deadline was met and in October 2007, the CVQ programme was officially launched. The CVQ now facilitates the movement of artisans and other skilled persons in the CSME. This qualification will be accessible to persons already in the workforce as well as students in secondary schools across the Caribbean region. Those already in the work force will be required to attend designated centres for assessment.|$|E
500|$|Adult sponges lack neurons or {{any other}} kind of nervous tissue. However most species have the ability to perform {{movements}} that are coordinated all over their bodies, mainly contractions of the pinacocytes, squeezing the water channels and thus expelling excess sediment and other substances that may cause blockages. Some species can contract the osculum independently {{of the rest of the}} body. Sponges may also contract in order to reduce the area that is vulnerable to attack by predators. In cases where two sponges are fused, for example if there is a large but still unseparated bud, these contraction waves slowly become coordinated in both of the [...] "Siamese twins". The <b>coordinating</b> <b>mechanism</b> is unknown, but may involve chemicals similar to neurotransmitters. However glass sponges rapidly transmit electrical impulses through all parts of the syncytium, and use this to halt the motion of their flagella if the incoming water contains toxins or excessive sediment.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify the processes and devices used by special education administrators to coordinate the work of principals in implementing programs for handicapped students. Based on literature of organizational structures and of school district administration, interview protocols were developed to elicit information about the use of <b>coordinating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in schools. Data was gathered through field interviews with a stratified sample of ten special education directors and twenty-one principals in ten school districts in Arizona. The data were subjected to two iterations of analysis: computer assisted analysis yielding frequency distributions, percentages, and cross tabulations, and descriptive analysis. Four <b>coordinating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were found to be used by directors in working with principals: commitment to common goals, direct supervision, standardization of processes, and mutual adjustment. The use of <b>coordinating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> varied in relation to school level, structural complexity, and environmental stability and complexity. The major mode of coordination was mutual adjustment, with both directors and principals relying on direct contact more than any other device for information sharing, decision making, and conflict resolution. The study revealed a surprising level of conflict surrounding the implementation of handicapped programs. This conflict was discussed in relation to various aspects of school practice, management, and governance.
