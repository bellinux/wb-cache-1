40|$|The main {{problems}} facing forest resource Assessment in the Sudan are {{the inadequacy of}} the methods of biomass estimation and the inability to produce reliable forecasts of production {{in addition to the}} lack of accurate statistics on forest products. The need for sound techniques and methodologies for volume estimates is vital to forest inventory at local or national levels. The available systems for volume estimation; standard volume tables and tariff system need to be tested under various situations related to area extent, species limitations, ages and size classes. Standard volume tables are based on an assumption of an average form factor along the entire limits of volume table; this constitutes a source of inherited error in volume table approach. The tariff system is assumed to overcome the inherited error and other limitations of the volume table as a result of incorporation of form factor variable in tariff equations derivation. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare between the volume tables and tariff systems application for volume estimation using statistical procedure and the actual volumes as reference volume. The latter was calculated by the form factor method. Other objectives are to check upon the universality of tariff system, in relation to the limitations of standard volume tables (areas, species and ages), size classes, in addition to creation of relationships between the tariff values and other measurable tree parameters, to facilitate tariff values prediction. The study was carried out on three tree species, Acacia nilotica in plantation along the Blue Nile and Rahad riverine forests, Acacia seyal in natural stands at Okalma forest reserve in rain fed sector of Sennar state and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in plantation at Abugeli of the Blue Nile riverine forest. Statistical analysis was performed with JMP statistical software by SAS. For comparison between results of different volume estimating systems, effects of geographical areas, species type, and age on Volume Comparison Index (VCI) for both systems. Scatter plots, regression techniques were used to determine the effects of different systems on the Volume Comparison Index xi and relationship between different parameters, values and treatments as related to different systems. The results indicate that there is no significant variation between volume values estimated by tariff system, and the actual volume values (form factor method) for each of the three species while there are significant variations in volume values estimated by standard volume equation system as compared to the other two systems. The results indicated that, the general tariff system is consistently more accurate than the standard volume table, although the latter is species specific. The present study indicated that, form factor is a function of diameter at breast height (dbh) and height. Therefore, errors associated with the standard volume equations are due to the incorrect assumption of a constant form factor over the range of size-classes parameters of the standard volume equations. The application of the volume tables is constrained by inherited limitations to the site or locality, species type ages and size classes. Further to that, volume tables are characterized by inherited source of error even though applied for the species for which it is constructed. The application of the tariff system, overcome the error and limitations associated with the standard volume table as it incorporates form factor as a variable in tariff equations, indicating the universality of the system as it is simple and more accurate than the standard volume table under different conditions and species. The study provided evidence that the tariff system is a stand development measure as it is based on <b>tariff</b> <b>numbers</b> or form height classes which are characterized by increasing trend with age. Due to the strong relationship between top height and the <b>tariff</b> <b>number,</b> top height is the most convenient and suitable tree/stand parameter to be used for the determination of <b>tariff</b> <b>numbers</b> and in <b>tariff</b> system application.

This study was conducted in response to the base's request for design assistance to the Federal Energy Management Program. Given the current tariff structure there are two main decisions facing NBVC: whether to install distributed energy resources (DER), or whether to continue the direct access energy supply contract. At the current effective rate, given assumptions about the performance and structure of building energy loads and available generating technology characteristics, {{the results of this study}} indicate that if the building installed a 600 kW DER system with absorption cooling and heat capabilities chosen by cost minimization, the energy cost savings would be about 14 percent, or $ 55, 000 per year.

40|$|Border inspection, and the {{challenge}} of deciding which of the tens of millions of consignments that arrive should be inspected, is a perennial problem for regulatory authorities. The objective of these inspections is to minimise the risk of contraband entering the country. As an example, for regulatory authorities in charge of biosecurity material, consignments of goods are classified before arrival according to their economic <b>tariff</b> <b>number</b> (Department of Immigration and Border Protection, 2016). This classification, perhaps along with other information, is used as a screening step to determine whether further biosecurity intervention, such as inspection, is necessary. Other information associated with consignments includes details such as the country of origin, supplier, and importer, for example. The choice of which consignments to inspect has typically been informed by historical records of intercepted material. Fortunately for regulators, interception is a rare event, however this sparsity undermines the utility of historical records for deciding which containers to inspect. In this paper we report on an analysis that uses more detailed information to inform inspection. Using quarantine biosecurity as a case study, we create statistical profiles using generalised linear mixed models and compare different model specifications with historical information alone, demonstrating the utility of a statistical modelling approach.

The study had three primary objectives: (1) evaluate factors influencing household water demand; (2) develop water use patterns; and (3) identify improvements to water-supply services. Determinants of interest at household level were education level of household head, age of household head, members/size of household, occupation of household head, gender of household head, frequency of flushing, frequency of bathing, frequency of doing laundry, and frequency of gardening. The study was conducted in Thohoyandou Block F, Unit C, Unit D, and Golgotha. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data in the study area. The questionnaire consisted of the following sections: household general information, water-supply information, water demand information, and water quality information. A total of one hundred (100) households were interviewed. Statistic package for social science (SPSS) software was used to perform the analyses. SPSS performed the correlation matrix, principal component analysis and regression analysis to generate a model. Correlation analysis results showed that <b>tariff,</b> <b>number</b> of people living together, bathing, and flushing were primary factors influencing water demand in the study area. Principal component analysis (PCA) results extracted four (4) components out of thirteen (13). PCA supported results from the correlation matrix. The multiple regression analysis results-generated model showed that three (3) variables in Block F, four (4) variables in Golgotha and Unit C, and two (2) variables in Unit D were strong predictors of water use. On the basis of the results it can be concluded that the most consistent variable for predicting water demand was education level of the household head. The conclusion can also be drawn from the results that bathing was the highest consumer of household water. The study recommends that tariff structure must be revised, water infrastructure, service delivery and water quality must be improved for the residents in the study area...|$|R

40|$|For {{a single}} tariff, {{the height of}} the tariff is an {{unambiguous}} measure of the policy's restrictiveness. With more than one tariff, theory has not provided an extension that captures the idea of the tariff's height, so analysts have used index numbers such as the mean and the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of tariffs. By contrast, the theoretical literature on the piecemeal reform of tariffs shows that efficiency gains from tariff reform depend on complex conditions that have little relation to the mean or variance of tariffs. But {{in the absence of a}} connection between theory and empirical measures, it is difficult to know whether to discard the measures. Moreover, the piecemeal reform question of measuring the welfare gain from a tariff is not directly related to the problem of evaluating the height of restrictiveness. The problem of finding a single number analogous to the height of tariffs is the <b>tariff</b> index <b>number</b> problem. The authors have developed a solution: the Trade Restrictiveness Index, which they define as the uniform tariff factor that is equivalent in trade restrictiveness (equivalent in the balance of trade) to the actual differentiated tariff structure. Here, the author develops the Trade Restrictiveness Index in terms of mean and variance-covariance indexes of the tariff schedule. There are two payoffs. First, the Trade Restrictiveness Index can be decomposed into expressions that rescue the commonsense idea that lower mean and lower variance of tariffs are both efficient. Second, a special case is offered in which the proper weights in the mean and variance of tariffs are the observed trade weights. Thus, the Trade Restrictiveness Index is superior to traditional summary measures such as the average tariff rate and the coefficient variation for the tariff schedule. It requires only limited additional information on the structure of the economy to yield a measure that is preferable on both theoretical and practical grounds.

50|$|On December 4, 1991, {{under the}} George H. W. Bush administration, the United States enacted the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), {{eliminating}} <b>tariffs</b> on a <b>number</b> of products from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Its objective was {{the strengthening of}} legal industries in these countries as alternatives to drug production and trafficking. The program was renewed on October 31, 2002 by the George W. Bush administration as the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA). Under the renewed act, Andean products exempted from tariffs increased from around 5,600 to some 6,300. ATPDEA was set to expire on December 31, 2006, but was renewed by Congress for six months, up to June 30, 2007. An extension was granted on June 28, 2007, this time for eight months, until February 29, 2008. The U.S. Congress passed a third renewal for ten months on February 28, 2008, up to December 31, 2008. In November 2008, U.S. President George W. Bush asked Congress to remove Bolivia from the agreement due to failure to cooperate in counternarcotics efforts. On December 14, 2009, the United States House of Representatives approved the extension of such plan {{for a period of}} one year. The final version of the agreement, covering Ecuadorian products only, lapsed on July 31, 2013 after Ecuador became ineligible.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assumes that}} Mercosur {{has been under}} a crisis {{for the last four}} years, the main {{symptoms}} of which are: decreasing priority in the context of Brazilian Foreign Policy (BFP); growing number of exceptions within its Common External <b>Tariff</b> (CET); decreasing <b>number</b> of Mercosur decisions embodied in each country's domestic legal framework; Mercosur's incapacity to effectively negotiate free trade agreements (FTAs). Changes in BFP's paradigms and positions are used as main parameters for the crisis' examination. Five interpretations for Mercosur's crisis are studied, within the scope of both that theoretical (paradigms) and empirical (positions) framework: i) adoption of an intergovernmental model, instead of a supranational one; ii) paradigm change in BFP's, from an Americanist/pragmatic institutionalist (under President Cardoso) to an autonomist (under Presidents Lula and Dilma); iii) Unasur's creation, as a source of Mercosur's weakening and IIRSA's politicization; iv) Mercosur's incapacity to embody a hub and spoke pattern of integration; and v) Brazil's and Argentina's foreign policy polarization under Menen and Cardoso as well as both countries' interventionist economic policies under the Kirchners and Lula/Dilma. The paper's conclusions identify interpretations i), ii), iii) and iv) as adequate explanations for the crisis. Effective measures to overcome Mercosur's crisis are also presented...|$|R
