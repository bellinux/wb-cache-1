Diffusion <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> ions {{in mixed}} cation glasses of the {{composition}} xA 2 O·(3 -x) MO· 4 SiO 2 (x = 0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 4 and 1. 0; A = Na, K; M = Ca, Ba) was investigated {{by means of the}} radiotracer diffusion technique below the respective glass transition temperatures.

40|$|A {{short time}} after the first {{successful}} experiments on magneto-optical trapping of neutral atoms, it was recognized that the number, density and storage time are ultimately limited by collision processes between the cold atoms in the trap light fields. During the last decade, these collision mechanisms were extensively studied in magneto-optical traps of alkali-metal elements. The theoretical analysis for small laser detuning, that is, excitation at large interatomic distance, is difficult because of the hyperfine structure. In addition to this, {{there is still some}} controversy about the collision mechanisms involved at low trapping laser intensities. On the other hand, interest on laser cooling and trapping <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> elements has grown over the past few years. The simplicity in the level structure <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earths</b> provides a possibility for effective calculations and comparison with experiments. Nevertheless, there are still little experimental data related to cold collisions in these elements. One {{reason for this is that}} cold collisions represent only a small fraction of the total trap losses, in contrast to the case of alkali-metals. To address this limitation we present here a new method for detecting cold collisions even when they contribute nearly negligibly to the trap loss rate.

40|$|Periodic Anderson model (PAM), {{where local}} {{electron}} orbitals interplay with itinerant electronic carriers, plays {{an essential role}} in our understanding on heavy fermion materials. Motivated by recent proposal of simulating Kondo lattice model (KLM) in terms <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal atoms, we make a further step toward simulation of PAM, which includes crucial charge/valence fluctuation of local f-electron beyond purely low-energy spin fluctuation in KLM. To realize PAM, transition induced by suitable laser between electronic excited and ground state <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> metal atoms (^ 1 S_ 0 ^ 3 P_ 0) is introduced, and it leads to effective hybridization between local electron and conduction electron in PAM. Generally, the SU(N) version of PAM can be realized by our proposal, which gives a unique opportunity to detect large-N physics without complexity in realistic materials. In the present work, high temperature physical feature of standard (SU(2)) PAM with harmonic trapping potential is detailed analyzed by quantum Monte Carlo and dynamic mean-field theory. Indications for near-future experiments are provided.

40|$|Zeolite {{molecular}} sieves have found extensive applications in ion-exchange, separation and catalytic processes, {{particularly in the}} chemical and petroleum industries. Currently, the state-of-the-art in synthesis of high-silica zeolites {{involves the use of}} complex organic molecules to direct the formation of zeolitic materials with novel pore structures. While efforts towards preparation of new zeolites using organic molecules as structure-directing agents continues, synthesis of calcium and other alkaline-earth zeolites has not received much attention since the inception of the systematic investigation of zeolite synthesis some 35 years ago. Of the approximate 50 natural zeolites discovered to date, over 20 % have eluded synthesis and another 10 % have proven exceedingly difficult to synthesize at typical hydrothermal conditions. The overwhelming majority of these zeolites are calcium-dominant. The difficulty encountered in the synthesis <b>of</b> these <b>alkaline-earth</b> zeolites is in direct contrast to their natural occurrence as alteration products of volcanic glasses. Thus, the objective of this work is developing practical methodolgies for the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> zeolites. Hydrothermal transformation of perlite (a natural rhyolitic glass) to calcium zeolites is investigated as a first step towards developing synthesis procedures for the preparation of calcium and other alkaline-earth zeolites from pure starting reagents. In particular, synthetic analogues of the calcium zeolites gismondine, heulandite and epistilbite are obtained as alteration products of perlite glass reacting with calcium-containing solutions. The influence of the solution phase species and their concentrations, the pH and the temperature on the distribution of the zeolite products obtained are discussed. It is observed that the crystallization of heulandite from perlite is preceded by the transient formation of a gismondine-type zeolite most similar to the synthetic zeolite P 1. This information is exploited to devise methodology for the preparation of zeolite P 1 from pure starting reagents and its subsequent conversion to calcium and other alkaline-earth zeolites upon treatment with solutions containing alkaline-earth cations. Thus, a novel approach for the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> zeolites based on the hydrothermal conversion of zeolite P 1 is developed. Details of the synthesis procedures are enumerated for the preparation <b>of</b> <b>alkaline-earth</b> zeolites CIT- 3 (HEU), CIT- 4 (BRE), epistilbite (EPI), harmotome (PHI), and yugawaralite (YUG). Transformation of zeolite P 1 to alkaline-earth zeolites is governed by factors such as the Si/Al ratio of the starting P 1 material, the composition of the solution phase and {{the presence or absence of}} seed crystals. The effects of these factors on the products obtained, i. e., phase selectivity, are discussed...|$|R
