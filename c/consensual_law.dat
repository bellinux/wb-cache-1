5000|$|At {{the same}} time he was working on {{marriage}} rights for LGBT persons, Eskridge was working with Georgetown law professor Nan Hunter on teaching materials for a field they dubbed “Sexuality, Gender, and the Law.” Eskridge and Hunter rejected the idea that the field should be defined as “Sexual Orientation and the Law,” because they considered norms of gender and sexuality inextricably intertwined. Published by Foundation Press, “Sexuality, Gender, and the Law” is now in its third edition, with a fourth being prepared in 2017. Emerging from his work with Hunter, Eskridge published a series of articles on sodomy laws and other discriminatory laws harming gender and sexual minorities. An amicus brief he wrote for the Cato Institute and a law review article titled [...] "Hardwick and Historiography" [...] were cited by the majority opinion in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), where the Supreme Court invalidated <b>consensual</b> sodomy <b>laws.</b> Several paragraphs from the Court’s opinion are virtual verbatim quotes from the Cato amicus and the law review article. Justice Scalia’s dissenting opinion in Lawrence explicitly noted Eskridge’s book, “Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet” (Harvard Press 1999). Many fans of Justice Scalia were surprised to find approving references to a book he repeatedly cited as “Gaylaw.” Eskridge wrote an authoritative history of the decline and fall of sodomy laws in “Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861-2003” (Viking 2008).|$|R
50|$|In some countries, sexual {{intercourse}} between a minor and an adult {{is not considered}} <b>consensual</b> under the <b>law</b> because a minor is believed to lack the maturity and competence to make an informed decision to engage in fully consensual sex with an adult. In those countries, sex with a minor is therefore considered statutory rape. In most European countries, by contrast, once an adolescent has {{reached the age of}} consent, he or she can legally have sexual relations with adults because it is held that in general (although certain limitations may still apply), reaching the age of consent enables a juvenile to consent to sex with any partner who has also reached that age. Therefore, the definition of statutory rape is limited to sex with a person under the minimum age of consent. What constitutes statutory rape ultimately differs by jurisdiction (see age of consent).|$|R

However, the law {{is more concerned with}} protecting the rights of people who are potentially subjected to such abuse. This is why familial sexual relationships are criminalized, even if all parties are <b>consensual.</b> There are <b>laws</b> prohibiting all kinds of sexual activity between relatives, not necessarily penetrative sex. These laws refer to grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts and uncles.

Other laws, such as bans against same-sex marriage and sodomy laws applying only to same-sex behavior, discriminate on the basis of sex, not sexual orientation; but their overwhelming effect is against gay people, and homophobia is what keeps these laws on the books. Finally, some laws without sex or sexual orientation classifications have discriminatory effects on gay people: general sodomy <b>laws</b> which criminalize <b>consensual</b> intimacy and <b>laws</b> prohibiting race, sex, and other forms of discrimination, but not sexual orientation discrimination.

Admission to the event is free, and all are welcome to attend. Should equal rights for gay people give way to liberties for religious people? According to Eskridge, a similar question was posed a generation ago – Should equal rights for people of color give way to the liberties of religious people? His lecture will explore this controversial parallel and its implications. Since joining the Yale faculty in 1998, Eskridge has taught Constitutional Law, Legislation, Theories of Statutory Interpretation, and Sexuality, Gender and the Law. With more than 20 years in the legal academy, he has also taught at Georgetown University, New York University and Harvard University. Before beginning his teaching career, Eskridge clerked for Judge Edward Weinfeld of the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and practiced law at Shea 2 ̆ 6 Gardner. He has published a field-establishing casebook, three monographs and dozens of law review articles articulating a legal and political framework for proper state treatment of sexual and gender minorities. The historical materials in his book Gaylaw: Challenging the Apartheid of the Closet formed the basis for an amicus brief he drafted for the Cato Institute and for much of the U. S. Supreme Court’s analysis in Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which invalidated <b>consensual</b> sodomy <b>laws.</b> Eskridge earned his B. A. summa cum laude from Davidson College and his masters degree from Harvard University. He then earned his J. D. from Yale, where he was the note and topics editor of The Yale Law Journal. The Sibley Lecture Series, established in 1964 by the Charles Loridans Foundation of Atlanta in tribute to the late John A. Sibley, is designed to attract outstanding legal scholars of national prominence to Georgia Law. Sibley was a 1911 graduate of the law school. #...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1960 s, the U. S. divorce laws {{underwent}} {{major changes}} and the divorce rate more than doubled in all of the states. The new laws introduced unilateral divorce in most of the states and changes in divorce settlements in every state, such as property division, alimony transfers, and child custody assignments. The empirical literature so far has focused on the switch from consensual to unilateral divorce and found that this change cannot fully account for the increase in the divorce rate. Also, the divorce rate increased even in states where the decision remained consensual. In this paper, I consider the effects of other aspects of the legal change. I show that changes in divorce settlements provide economic incentives for both spouses to agree to divorce. Moreover, I describe a mechanism that can explain the different change in divorce rate by age of couples. I solve and calibrate a model where agents differ by gender, and make decisions on their marital status, investment and labor supply. Under the new financial settlements, divorced men gain from a favorable division of property, while women gain from an increase in alimony and child support transfers. Since both of them are better off in the new divorce setting, the existing requirement of consent for divorce (consensual or unilateral) is no longer relevant. Results show that changes in divorce settlements account for a substantial amount of the increase in the aggregate divorce rate. I also find that the increase in divorce rate of young couples with children contributes the most to the overall increase, which is consistent with the data.

40|$|In {{her recent}} Columbia Law Review article, "Infant Safe Haven Laws: Legislating in the Culture of Life," Professor Carol Sanger shows that American safe haven laws, viewed {{within a larger}} {{political}} culture, promote {{the goal of the}} culture of life: the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Their effectiveness in that pursuit, she correctly notes, depends on whether judges and others recognize the strong differences between varying culture of life settings. Like Professor Sanger, I see differences between safe haven abandonment and abortion. Unfortunately, Professor Sanger fails to note that American safe haven laws, within a larger political culture, also significantly promote the culture of motherhood, that is, the unconditional respect for relatively exclusive maternal decisionmaking about newborns, regardless of children's best interests, of any legal paternity interests, and of the strong social policy favoring two parents for each child born alive as a result of consensual sex. As with culture of life settings, there are strong differences in culture of motherhood settings. I see significant differences between protecting potential human life from maternal acts and protecting actual human life from maternal acts. I see differences between pursuing actual deadbeat dads and simply projecting certain dads as deadbeat. I see differences between children conceived as a result of artificial insemination via an anonymous donor and children conceived as a result of consensual sex. I see differences between terminating potential or actual legal paternity before and after birth. The culture of motherhood, as the culture of life, in American family law merits our serious attention. There are strong differences of opinion on some forms of exclusive maternal decisionmaking. In particular, beyond revisiting safe haven laws, state legislators (and Congress, through the Social Security Act) need to reform many of the adoption and birth certificate laws governing children born as a result of <b>consensual</b> sex. American <b>laws</b> should better assure that the men named as legal fathers at birth merit that designation and that more children have legal fathers named at the time of birth...|$|R
40|$|As {{far as the}} {{transference}} of {{the risk}} {{in the sale of}} heritable property is concerned, there are oddities emerging from the comparison between Scots law and the 'Continental' counterparts, particularly, the Italian jurisdiction, utilised within the context of this contribution as a sort of yardstick and parameter of analysis. More specifically, in a jurisdiction such as the Scottish one, usually defined as the stereotype of a mixed legal system and, therefore, by definition a sort of paradigm of virtuosity, the conclusion of the missives (or preliminary contract, to use a correspondent 'civil law' nomenclature), {{for the purposes of the}} transference of heritable property, marks the passing of the risk from the seller to the buyer, consistently with the Roman tradition (consensual approach). However, quite bizarrely, despite a court decision of more than two decades ago, where this arcane should have been dispelled eventually, with clear adoption of the Roman rule, Scots Scholars seem to have preferred not to somatise this principle in their legal corpus, particularly in terms of practice, by preferring a more conventional (and probably English!) system based on the agreement between the parties and where usually the passing of the risk is postponed to the settlement. On the same subject, the Italian jurisprudence, by definition hinged upon its own Roman pillars, did manage to implement its own principles and precepts, through a coherent application of the maxim res perit domino but without the <b>consensual</b> Roman <b>law</b> approach, this different position being the outcome of the theorisation of the consensual contracts with 'real effects' and those with 'personal effects', extraneous to the Scottish tradition, where a mere demarcation line between consensual contract and 're contracts' is traced. Additionally, the contribution, also as a result of an analysis, of both philological and semantic nature, attempts to demonstrate that, probably, in Scotland, where currently, at common law, the rule adopted in terms of passing of the risk is the Roman Law one (contractual approach), there might have been a misunderstanding, in the way the maxim res perit domino has been usually interpreted (erroneously, to sign the phenomenon of the passing of the risk at the time of the conclusion of the contract), and, ultimately, a conceptual intellectual confusion with the brocard 'periculum rei venditae nondum traditae est emptoris'. On these premises, the paper attempts to clarify if and how the passing of the risk of the sale of heritable property is disciplined in the two jurisdictions, Italy and Scotland, against the background of the 'common ancestor', and how differently two Latin maxims have survived and/or reverberated in each of them. More pretentiously, it is also suggested how the matter could be governed, more coherently; particularly, it is investigated whether the proposal of amendments of the Scottish Law Commission of two decades ago, whose aim was fundamentally to postpone the passing of the risk to the entry date or, if earlier, with the taking of the possession by the buyer, could be, on the one hand, reconsidered in Scotland, on the other hand, even exported to the Continent as a parameter for every sale of heritable property...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{builds on}} {{a growing body}} of {{scholarship}} discussing the role of reasonableness in consent-search doctrine. Although the language of “voluntary consent” implies a subjective inquiry into the state of mind of the person granting consent, the U. S. Supreme Court has repeatedly injected an objective standard of reasonableness into its analysis of a citizen’s consent. Several scholars have characterized the Court’s consent jurisprudence as focusing not on true voluntariness but on the reasonableness of police conduct, which they argue is appropriate because the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is “reasonableness. ” While the renewed scholarly focus on the role of reasonableness in the Court’s consent jurisprudence is helpful in explaining the puzzling disconnect between language and doctrine, much of this current emphasis has been distorted by the dichotomy between coercion and voluntariness: Did police use (unreasonable) coercive tactics that would override a (reasonable) person’s free will? However, the Fourth Amendment’s default concept of reasonableness is based not on coercion or volition but on its requirement of a warrant based on probable cause. Typically when the Court recognizes an exception to the default rule, it grounds that exception in a concept of reasonableness that requires a weighing of the governmental interests served by the warrantless conduct against the level of the intrusion on affected Fourth Amendment interests: liberty and privacy. Because the Court has relied on the myth of voluntary consent as a proxy for the warrant and probable cause requirements that normally define “reasonableness” in the Fourth Amendment context, the Court has bypassed the usual substitute proxy for Fourth Amendment reasonableness: an express weighing of the governmental and citizen interests at stake. This Article engages in the reasonableness inquiry that the Supreme Court has avoided. Drawing on the Court’s approach to reasonableness in other Fourth Amendment contexts, this Article first looks to the concept tof “macro reasonableness” to argue that the Court has overestimated the value of <b>consensual</b> searches to <b>law</b> enforcement and underestimated their effect on privacy. While the Court has emphasized the value of consensual searches yielding incriminatory evidence that might go undetected absent the consent-search doctrine, many consent searches serve no government interests at all. Meanwhile the pervasiveness of the practice imposes tremendous costs to privacy. This Article then seeks to reshape the consent-search exception, using a requirement of “micro reasonableness,” to make the doctrine of consent more reflective of Fourth Amendment reasonableness. Under this requirement, courts would examine not only the voluntariness of the consent underlying the search, but also the government’s reasons for requesting the consent and the scope of the consent requested...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{international}} criminal law (ICL) developed {{in the aftermath of}} World War II {{as an alternative to the}} proposal, espoused by Winston Churchill among others, that major Axis war criminals be summarily executed on sight. Because of this pedigree and the unconscionable nature of the crimes, ICL jurisprudence and scholarship have largely neglected the paramount question fundamental to any criminal justice system: the justifications for and legitimate goals of punishment. Insofar as a coherent jurisprudence of ICL sentencing can be said to exist at all, it remains correspondingly impoverished and unprincipled — comparable in some respects to that of the indeterminate federal sentencing system criticized by Judge Marvin E. Frankel in his famous polemic, Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order (1973). This Article analyzes the extent to which the conventional goals of punishment in national law can or should be transposed to the distinct legal, moral, and institutional context of ICL. It argues that the expressive capacity of punishment best captures both the nature of international sentencing and its realistic institutional capacity to make a difference in view of the legal, political, and resource constraints that will continue, for the foreseeable future, to afflict ICL. The transposition to ICL of the standard justifications for punishment in national law proves deeply problematic in large part because ICL attempts to combine the paradigms of two very different legal fields: (i) classical international law — a profoundly <b>consensual</b> body of <b>law</b> based on broadly shareable norms among states; and (ii) national criminal law — a profoundly coercive body of law often understood to embody the most fundamental, particularistic norms and values of a local polity. ICL therefore differs from national criminal law in several respects relevant to the social institution of punishment, including the nature of (i) the community that authorizes ICL, (ii) the crimes addressed by it, and (iii) the perpetrators judged by it. These differences tend to compromise the coherence or efficacy (or both) of conventional crime-control and retributive justifications for punishment. Insofar as these justifications or penal goals remain plausible, it is largely because of the expressive dimensions of punishment. ICL’s ability to contribute to the lofty objectives ascribed to it depends far more on enhancing its value as authoritative expression than on ill-fated efforts to identify “appropriate” punishments for crimes that strain our moral intuitions. For this reason, I urge, among other potential developments in the law and practice of sentencing by {{international criminal}} tribunals: (i) the institution of sentencing hearings as an essential component of ICL; (ii) greater attention to social, psychological, and political context and the role of the defendant vis-à-vis collective entities (states, armies, and so forth) as aggravating or mitigating factors; and (iii) a focus on enhancing jurisprudential exchange between national and international criminal justice institutions...|$|R
