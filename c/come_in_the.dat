5|$|By his standards, Roger Federer had a weak season: {{he failed}} to win a Grand Slam tournament title {{for the first time}} since 2002, losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final, and the sixth time overall in Major finals. He dropped to world No. 4 in November, the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002. Federer's drop was caused by Murray's {{remarkable}} run of form in Asia in October, winning three successive titles. However, Federer rallied, winning his three final tournaments (a sign of things to <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent season), including the World Tour Finals, which was enough to secure an end-of-season ranking of No. 3. Murray, meanwhile, was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments, with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final against Djokovic. He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year, and five titles in total.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. It is common for a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E

The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome, who is strong in the discipline. Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had <b>come</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tirreno–Adriatico, but he had performed strongly in the Alps in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.|$|E

5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent.
