40|$|The <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> in a {{concrete}} column confined with fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) are uniform across the section and isotropic only when the column is under concentric loading and circular in shape.

To overcome this difficulty, a new finite-element (FE) method was developed based on the most up-to-date lateral strain–axial strain and axial stress–strain constitutive models of concrete. This paper reports on using the method to analyse circular concrete columns confined by FRP under eccentric loading. It was found that, under eccentric loading, the <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> are generally smaller at larger eccentricity. Overall, good agreement between the theoretical results and published experimental data was achieved.

The closure of fractures is dependent upon the strength of the rock mass, the physical nature of the fracture, and the fluid pressure present in the fracture. Fracture closure is highly time dependent, and a number of nonlinear pressure flow relationships have been identified. These deviations are thought to represent two fundamentally different processes, the most important of which are turbulence in the flow and fracture expansion...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Presentation date: 1992 - 12 - 08 The {{use of the}} {{triaxial}} test to characterize the strength of soils for civil engineering applications is widespread. These tests are typically conducted with <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> in excess of 5 psi. To characterize {{the strength of a}} soil located in the upper layers of the subgrade of an aggregate surfaced road it is necessary to conduct {{triaxial test}}s with low <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> (5 psi or less). The development of a method for conducting multistage, consolidated undrained (CU) tests at low <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> (0. 5 to 5. 0 psi), with back pressure saturation, is presented. Aspects of the test procedure that require special attention are described and recommendations are made including: 1. Compaction of the sample in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide reduces the time and pressure required to complete back pressure saturation. 2. Seepage force related pore pressures develop during sample flooding. Zeroing of the effective stress transducer should be completed prior to sample flooding so that it is certain that zero effective stress conditions are present. 3. Back pressure saturation is simplified by the use of a slave regulator (air loaded pressure regulator) that maintains a nearly constant pressure differential between the cell pressure and the back pressure. 4. The stress path method of interpretation {{is an essential part of}} multistage triaxial testing.

5000|$|MICP {{treatment}} {{may be limited}} to deep soil due to limitations of bacterial growth and movement in subsoil. MICP may {{be limited to the}} soils containing limited amounts of fines due to the reduction in pore spaces in fine soils. Based on the size of microorganism, the applicability of biocementation is limited to GW, GP, SW, SP, ML, and organic soils. Bacteria are not expected to enter through pore throats smaller than approximately 0.4 µm. In general, the microbial abundance was found to increase with the increase in particle size. On the other hand, the fine particles may provide more favorable nucleation sites for calcium carbonate precipitation because the mineralogy of the grains could directly influence the thermodynamics of the precipitation reaction in the system. [...] The habitable pores and traversable pore throats were found in coarse sediments and some clayey sediments at shallow depth. In clayey soil, bacteria are capable of reorienting and moving clay particles under low <b>confining</b> <b>stress</b> (at shallow depths). However, inability to make these rearrangements under high confining stresses limits bacterial activity at larger depths. Furthermore, sediment-cell interaction may cause puncture or tensile failure of the cell membrane. Similarly, at larger depths, silt and sand particles may crush and cause a reduction in pore spaces, reducing the biological activity. Bacterial activity is also impacted by challenges such as predation, competition, pH, temperature, and nutrient availability. These factors can contribute to the population decline of bacteria. Many of these limitations can be overcome through the use of MICP through bio-stimulation - a process through which indigenous ureolytic soil bacteria are enriched in situ. This method is not always possible as not all indigenous soils have enough ureolytic bacteria to achieve successful MICP.|$|E

30|$|A {{parameter}} {{often used}} in soil mechanics to quantify the ductility or brittleness of clays is the over-consolidation ratio (OCR).

These materials are called over-consolidated (OC) materials. If the current effective vertical stress in the material is as high or higher {{than at any time in}} its history, then the material is normally consolidated (NC). Over-consolidation in mudrocks and shales is caused by a combination of mechanical compaction and other non-mechanical factors leading to an apparent pre-consolidation. Shales which reach effective <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> above the apparent pre-consolidation stress are normally consolidated (NC), while those at effective <b>confining</b> <b>stresses</b> below apparent pre-consolidation are over-consolidated (OC).

To experimentally investigate the fluid flow regimes through deformable rock fractures, water flow tests through both mated and non-mated sandstone fractures were conducted in triaxial cell under changing <b>confining</b> <b>stress</b> from 1. 0.

The results show that linear Darcy 2 ̆ 7 s law holds for water flow through mated fracture samples due to high flow resistance caused by the small aperture and high tortuosity of the flow pathway, while nonlinear flow occurs for non-mated fracture due to enlarged aperture. Regression analyses of experimental data show that both Forchheimer equation and Izbash 2 ̆ 7 s law provide an excellent description for this nonlinear fracture flow process.

This model is developed primarily to support process modeling of coalbed methane (CBM) or CO 2 -enhanced CBM (ECBM) recovery from coal seam. It applied an innovative approach by which stresses acting on and strains occurring in coal are successively combined in rectangular coordinates, leading to the aggregated mechanical constants. These mechanical properties represent important information for improving CBM/ECBM simulations and incorporating within these considerations of directional permeability.
