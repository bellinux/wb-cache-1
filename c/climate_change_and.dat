The contributions of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> human activities to runoff were analyzed using rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, slope variation, and water balance method during 1961 – 2010 at the Jinsha River basin, China. Results indicate that runoff at upstream and runoff at midstream are both dominated by <b>climate</b> <b>changes,</b> <b>and</b> the contributions of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> to runoff are 63 %~ 72 % and 53 %~ 68 %, respectively. At downstream, <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> account for only 13 %~ 18 %, and runoff is mainly controlled by human activities, contributing 82 %~ 87 %. The availability and stability of results were compared and analyzed in the four methods. Results in slope variation, double mass curve, and water balance method except rainfall-runoff relationship method are of good agreement. And the rainfall-runoff relationship, double mass curve, and slope variation method are all of great stability. The four methods and availability evaluation of them could provide a reference to quantification in the contributions of <b>climate</b> <b>changes</b> <b>and</b> human activities to runoff at similar basins in the future...|$|R
