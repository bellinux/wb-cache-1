5|$|The breed has a {{reputation}} for being healthy with a long lifespan. Breeders have protected the gene pool, and direct in-line breeding has been prevented. Jack Russells can live from 13 to 16 years given proper care. However, certain lines have been noted for having specific health concerns and, therefore, could occur in any line or generation because of recessive genes. These issues can include hereditary cataracts, ectopia lentis, <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness,</b> patellar luxation, ataxia, myasthenia gravis, Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, and von Willebrand disease.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness</b> related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|Alice {{spent her}} {{childhood}} between Darmstadt, London, Jugenheim, and Malta (where her naval officer father was occasionally stationed). Her mother {{noticed that she}} was slow in learning to talk, and became concerned by her indistinct pronunciation. Eventually, {{she was diagnosed with}} <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness</b> after her grandmother identified the problem and took her to see an ear specialist. With encouragement from her mother, Alice learned to both lip-read and speak in English and German. Educated privately, she studied French, and later, after her engagement, she learned Greek. Her early years were spent in the company of her royal relatives, and she was a bridesmaid at the marriage of George, Duke of York (later King George V) and Mary of Teck in 1893. A few weeks before her sixteenth birthday she attended the funeral of Queen Victoria in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and shortly afterward she was confirmed in the Anglican faith.|$|E
40|$|<b>Congenital</b> {{unilateral}} <b>deafness</b> {{is a rare}} disorder. The {{prevalence rates}} are unknown. The prevalence of children with severe to profound hearing losses that are congenital (or acquired before the development of speech and language) is 0. 5 to 3 per 1, 000 live births. Evidently, <b>congenital</b> unilateral <b>deafness</b> must have a lower prevalence. The purpose {{of this research was}} to present a new disorder, hereditary <b>congenital</b> unilateral <b>deafness.</b> A pedigree is presented in which both male and female members display symptoms of <b>congenital</b> unilateral <b>deafness.</b> Two affected persons and a normal-hearing member of the family have vestibular abnormalities without dysequilibrium. The inheritance pattern of this new syndrome is not clear. We hypothesize that the disorder might be new. A family like this has never before been presented in the medical literature...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Congenital</b> sensorineural <b>deafness</b> is an {{inherited}} condition {{found in many}} dog breeds, including Australian Stumpy-tail Cattle Dogs (ASCD). This deafness is evident in young pups and may affect one ear (unilateral) or both ears (bilateral). The genetic locus/loci involved is unknown for all dog breeds. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine incidence, inheritance mechanism, and possible association of <b>congenital</b> sensorineural <b>deafness</b> with coat colour in ASCD and to identify the genetic locus underpinning this disease...|$|R

25|$|Deafness* in dogs can {{be either}} {{acquired}} or congenital. Predisposing factors for acquired deafness include chronic infection, use of certain drugs, and most commonly, age-related changes in the cochlea. <b>Congenital</b> <b>deafness</b> can be genetic, seen sometimes in dogs with merle or white coats, or caused by in utero damage from infections or toxins.|$|E

25|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} are implicated in {{cellular}} activity {{to a variety}} of inflammatory responses including cardiovascular disease. They may also be involved in hearing impairment via cochlear damage induced by elevated sound levels, in ototoxicity of drugs such as cisplatin, and in <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness</b> in both animals and humans. ROS are also implicated in mediation of apoptosis or programmed cell death and ischaemic injury. Specific examples include stroke and heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be {{predisposed}} {{to a form}} of <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness,</b> which is present at birth, {{due to a lack of}} formation or early degeneration of receptors in the inner ear, although this is relatively rare. [...] In addition, more recent studies have found Cavaliers that develop a progressive hearing loss, which usually begins during puppyhood and progresses until the dog is completely deaf, usually between the ages of three and five years. [...] The progressive nature of this form of deafness in Cavaliers is believed to be caused by degeneration of the hearing nerve rather than the lack of formation or early degeneration of the inner ear receptors.|$|E
2500|$|Some horses {{with the}} splashed white pattern {{have been shown}} to have <b>congenital</b> <b>{{deafness}},</b> though many or most have normal hearing. This type of deafness is probably similar to instances of deafness in white or piebald, blue-eyed examples in other species. In white-coated cats and dogs with deafness, an absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to death of the hair cells, which are necessary for perceiving sound. The presence of pigment around the outside of the ears - which most splash horses have - does not prove the presence of that necessary pigment in the inner ear. [...] There must be pigment inside the inner ear to prevent this problem.|$|E

40|$|Rubella {{antibody}} {{was detected}} in 85 (61 %) of 139 children aged from 6 months to 7 years with <b>congenital</b> perceptive <b>deafness.</b> Of the 112 {{children who were}} aged under 4 years 61 (54 %) had rubella antibody (seropositive) compared with 7 · 1 % in randomly selected children of the same age.

Intrauterine rubella was thought to be the cause of the deafness in 82 (59 %) of the 139 children, in 60 of whom deafness was the only rubella defect detected.

2500|$|The {{herpes simplex}} virus can cause microcephaly, microphthalmus (abnormally small eyeballs), retinal {{dysplasia}}, hepatosplenomegaly, and mental retardation. [...] Both microphthalmus and retinal dysplasia can cause blindness.

[...] Other birth abnormalities have been reported as well, such as chorioretinitis, microphthalmus, and ocular defects.

2500|$|Splashed {{white or}} splash is a horse coat color {{pattern in the}} [...] "overo" [...] family of {{spotting}} patterns that produces pink-skinned, white markings. Many splashed whites have very modest markings, while others have the distinctive [...] "dipped in white paint" [...] pattern. Blue eyes are {{a hallmark of the}} pattern, and splash may account for otherwise [...] "solid" [...] blue-eyed horses. Splashed white occurs in a variety of geographically divergent breeds, from Morgans in North America to Kathiawari horses in India. The splashed white pattern is also associated with <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness,</b> though most splashed whites have normal hearing. There now exists a DNA test for three forms of splashed white, and there is speculation that the SW-2 and SW-3 alleles may be an embryonic lethal when homozygous.|$|E

The dumbness might be the result of a defective structure of the mouth, or of the tongue, or a mere defective innervation of these parts; or it might result from <b>congenital</b> <b>deafness,</b> caused by some minute defect of the internal ear, which only a careful anatomist could discover.|$|E
