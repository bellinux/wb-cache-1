5|$|Business school rankings are {{important}} to the various business schools because they are an important marketing tool used to recruit top students, and lure recruiters from the top companies. Business schools attempt to achieve higher rankings in order that they may obtain the top students who will over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> careers most likely benefit the school by achieving high ranking positions, attaining great influence, and accumulating great wealth. Such students often are able to help other students attain better (higher paying, more respected and more influential) jobs. Students use the rankings to choose their school, and creators of the rankings produce them to aid in this decision.|$|E

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes over the <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity {{is often associated with}} rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E
