25|$|Founded in 1885 as the {{original}} American Telephone and Telegraph Company, it was at times the world's largest telephone company, the world's largest cable television operator, and a regulated monopoly. At its peak in the 1950s and 1960s, it employed one million people and the <b>company</b> <b>revenue</b> was roughly $3 billion annually.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the factory tried to enter new markets with the {{production}} of bromine, but closed production after a fire destroyed the production facility only two weeks after completion in 1985. Due to increasing competition {{in the market for}} fertilizers and the lack of new products, <b>company</b> <b>revenue</b> fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its locational disadvantage as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of anti-dumping on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries. <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> fell to 225 million DM and losses increased to 9.6 million DM. On December 23, 1993 all remaining production was shut down and all remaining 700 workers were laid off. Since then Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH is the name of a wholesale distributor of chemicals and subsidiary of K+S AG (named Kali und Salz AG until 1999). <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> in 2007 was 7.86 million Euro, down from 10.07 million Euro in 2004.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{innovation}} of quartz technology had originated in Japan, Universal {{began to focus}} most of its attention on the Asian watch market, since {{a significant portion of}} <b>company</b> <b>revenue</b> was already centered in Hong Kong. Although Forbes still ranked Universal (in price) to Corum, IWC and Rolex, and as being more expensive than Omega, Longines and Baume et Mercier, the international marketing strategies and venture to quartz proved economically devastating for the brand, causing loss of capital among its holding companies, and in effect, the popularity of the brand itself.|$|E
25|$|Her tenure is {{credited}} with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that The New York Times did not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal. During this time, Katharine Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the Post newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan {{accounted for more than}} 60% of the entire <b>company</b> <b>revenue</b> stream.|$|E
25|$|However, these {{expectations}} were not realised in practice, {{and in many}} regions of Bengal, the peasants bore {{the brunt of the}} increased demand, there being little protection for their traditional rights in the new legislation. Forced labour of the peasants by the zamindars became more prevalent as cash crops were cultivated to meet the <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> demands. Although commercialised cultivation was not new to the region, it had now penetrated deeper into village society and made it more vulnerable to market forces. The zamindars themselves were often unable to meet the increased demands that the Company had placed on them; consequently, many defaulted, and by one estimate, up to one-third of their lands were auctioned during the first three decades following the permanent settlement. The new owners were often Brahmin and Kayastha employees of the Company who had a good grasp of the new system, and, in many cases, some had prospered under it.|$|E

25|$|The Company {{inherited}} a revenue collection {{system from the}} Mughals in which the heaviest proportion of the tax burden fell on the cultivators, with one-third of the production reserved for imperial entitlement; this pre-colonial system became the <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> policy's baseline. However, there was vast variation across India in the methods by which the revenues were collected; with this complication in mind, a Committee of Circuit toured the districts of expanded Bengal Presidency {{in order to make}} a five-year settlement, consisting of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farming. In their overall approach to revenue policy, Company officials were guided by two goals: first, preserving as much as possible the balance of rights and obligations that were traditionally claimed by the farmers who cultivated the land and the various intermediaries who collected tax on the state's behalf and who reserved a cut for themselves; and second, identifying those sectors of the rural economy that would maximise both revenue and security. Although their first revenue settlement turned out to be essentially the same as the more informal pre-existing Mughal one, the Company had created a foundation for the growth of both information and bureaucracy.|$|E
500|$|The company {{primarily}} provides {{meat for}} other marketing brands, producing 90% of its product for customers while selling only 10% under the West Liberty Foods brand name. In addition to slaughtering turkeys, the company produces prepared beef, chicken, pork, and turkey products. [...] <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> has grown rapidly with US$65 {{million in sales}} during 1997, $120 million in 2000, and $200 million in 2003. [...] Most recently, West Liberty Foods posted $442 million in revenue for 2006, making the company the 56th-largest meat-packing company by sales in the United States. [...] Much of the company's sales come from large nationwide foodservice customers, and as of 2006, was Subway's largest supplier of sliced sandwich meat, providing the franchise with more than 1 million pounds per week. As a result of servicing national customers, the company is inspected more than other food manufacturers. West Liberty Foods' three plants have been ISO 14001 certified for meeting environmental management standards, and the West Liberty plant was the first turkey-processing plant in the United States to receive this certification.|$|E

By 1983, BGW's skill in {{sheet metal work}} (acquired in fabricating their substantial amplifier housings) had grown {{to the point of}} it becoming its own source of <b>company</b> <b>revenue.</b> BGW began supplying finished metal products to a number of industries, and established a BGW-branded [...] "Rack and Roll" [...] line of 19-inch rack hardware in 1991.|$|E

2500|$|In 1986, Bombardier {{acquired}} Canadair {{after the}} Canadian government-owned aircraft manufacturing company recorded the largest corporate loss in Canadian history. Shortly thereafter, de Havilland Canada, Short Brothers and Learjet operations were {{absorbed by the}} aerospace arm, which now accounts for over half of <b>company</b> <b>revenue.</b> [...] Bombardier's most popular aircraft currently include its Q400, CRJ100/200/440, and CRJ700/900/1000 lines of regional airliners. In late September, the Company announced that Indian airline SpiceJet had ordered 25 of the Q400 planes with an option for an additional 25 units. The total sale for 50 would be valued at US$1.7 billion, minus discounts.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, the Responsible Government Association (RGA) was formed. This party sought {{self-government}} for Southern Rhodesia {{within the}} Empire, just as Britain had previously granted [...] "responsible government" [...] to its colonies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa as {{a precursor to}} full dominion status. Sir Charles Coghlan, a lawyer based in Bulawayo, led the RGA from 1919. The RGA opposed the proposed integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910 by the South Africa Act 1909, Section 150 of which explicitly provisioned for the accession of territories governed by the British South Africa Company. The Company originally stood against Southern Rhodesia's addition, fearing the territory might become dominated by Afrikaners, but abruptly changed its stance when, in 1918, the Privy Council in London ruled that unalienated land in the Rhodesias belonged to the British Crown {{rather than to the}} Company. This removed the longstanding stream of <b>Company</b> <b>revenue</b> created by the sale of land.|$|E
