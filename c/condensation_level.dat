Chemical modifications of histone proteins often occur on particular amino acids. This specific addition of single or multiple modifications on histone cores can be interpreted by transcription factors and complexes which leads to functional implications. This process is facilitated by enzymes such as HATs and HDACs that add or remove modifications on histones, and transcription factors that process and [...] "read" [...] the modification codes. The outcome can be activation of transcription or repression of a gene.

The October-mean cloud-top height structure of the southeast Pacific was then spatially and diurnally characterized. Coastal shoaling is apparent, but so is a significant along-coast cloud-top height gradient, with a pronounced elevation of the cloud-top heights above the Arica Bight at ~ 20 °S. Diurnal cloud-top height variations (inferred from irregular 4 -times-daily sampling) can locally reach 250 m in amplitude, and they can help to visualize offshore propagation of free-tropospheric vertical motions. A shallow boundary layer associated with the Chilean coastal jet expands to its north and west in the afternoon. Cloud-top heights above the Arica Bight region are depressed in the afternoon, which may mean that increased subsidence from sensible heating of the Andes dominates an afternoon increase in convergence/upward motion at the exit of the Chilean coastal jet. In the southeast Atlantic during October, the stratocumulus cloud-top heights are typically lower {{than those in the}} southeast Pacific. A coastal jet region can also be identified through its low cloud-top heights.

In the IMC, mountains of major islands reach significant heights (3000  m or higher) but {{are close to}} the coastlines, so that the mountain−valley breezes are not separated from the sea−land breezes (e.g., Yang and Slingo 2001). However, inland regions of the true continents may have diurnal cycles of the mountain−valley type completely separated from the coastlines. Thus, if we take such steep slope effects into account and replace the coastline length by the length of the contour line of an appropriate altitude (probably given by a midpoint between the lifting <b>condensation</b> <b>levels</b> in the morning and evening), we may obtain a corrected result in which the data plots for Central Africa (Fig.  8 a, d) and Amazonia (Fig.  8 c, f) also approach the linear relationship.

50|$|For non-convective cloud, the {{altitude}} at which condensation begins {{to happen is}} called the lifted <b>condensation</b> <b>level</b> (LCL), which roughly determines {{the height of the}} cloud base.

Water vapor in saturated air is normally attracted to condensation nuclei such as salt particles that are small enough to be held aloft by normal circulation of the air. If the condensation process occurs below the freezing level in the troposphere, the nuclei help transform the vapor into very small water droplets. Clouds that form just above the freezing level are composed mostly of supercooled liquid droplets, while those that condense out at higher altitudes where the air is much colder generally take the form of ice crystals.

Length-dependent stimulation of condensation took place during anaphase and depended on aurora/Ipl 1 activity, its localization to the spindle midzone, and phosphorylation of histone H 3 on Ser 10, a known Ipl 1 substrate. The anaphase spindle therefore may function as a ruler to adapt the condensation of chromosomes to spindle length.

The data show enhanced growth of large droplets and spectral broadening in cloud parcels with low liquid water mixing ratio. Three mixing models, including inhomogeneous mixing, entity type entrainment mixing, and circulation mixing proposed in this study, are examined with regard to their influences on cloud microphysics. The observed cloud microphysical behavior is most consistent with the circulation mixing, which describes the mixing between cloud parcels with different lifting <b>condensation</b> <b>levels</b> during their circulations driven by evaporative and radiative cooling.

40|$|Wisconsin {{recorded}} {{its fifth}} largest tornado outbreak {{during the late}} afternoon and early evening hours of 23 June 2004. Seventeen tornadoes and numerous reports of damaging straight-line winds and large hail accompanied the complex storm structures, which consisted of bow echoes and high-precipitation (HP) supercells. One particular long-track HP supercell produced six tornadoes. One death and 23 injuries resulted from the outbreak of severe weather. Property damage totaled approximately $ 28. 8 million, while crop damage approached $ 3. 1 million. Although severe weather was anticipated, the number of tornadoes was somewhat unexpected. This case was characterized by fast upper flow and strong evolution of a compact surface low, resulting in rapid changes in wind shear and instability. The quick progression and evolution of the synoptic and mesoscale features, as well as relatively low dewpoints for late June, led to difficulty in identifying {{the magnitude of the}} severe threat prior to the tornado outbreak.

50|$|The lifted <b>condensation</b> <b>level</b> or lifting <b>condensation</b> <b>level</b> (LCL) is {{formally}} {{defined as}} the height at which the relative humidity (RH) of an air parcel will reach 100% when it is cooled by dry adiabatic lifting. The RH of air increases when it is cooled, since {{the amount of water}} vapor in the air (i.e., its specific humidity) remains constant, while the saturation vapor pressure decreases almost exponentially with decreasing temperature. If the air parcel is lifting further beyond the LCL, water vapor in the air parcel will begin condensing, forming cloud droplets. (In the real atmosphere, it is usually necessary for air to be slightly supersaturated, normally by around 0.5%, before condensation occurs; this translates into about 10 meters or so of additional lifting above the LCL.) The LCL is a good approximation of the height of the cloud base which will be observed on days when air is lifted mechanically from the surface to the cloud base (e.g., due to convergence of airmasses).|$|E

Here we present a high resolution survey of genome interactions in Schizosaccharomyces pombe using synchronized cells to investigate cell cycle dependent changes in genome organization and transcription. Cell cycle dependent interactions were captured between and within S. pombe chromosomes. Known features of genome organization (e. g. the clustering of telomeres and retrotransposon long terminal repeats (LTRs)) were observed throughout the cell cycle. There were clear correlations between transcript levels and chromosomal interactions between genes, consistent with a role for interactions in transcriptional regulation at specific stages of the cell cycle. In silico reconstructions of the chromosome organization within the S. pombe nuclei were made by polymer modeling. These models suggest that groups of genes with high and low, or differentially regulated transcript levels have preferred positions within the S. pombe nucleus. We conclude that the S. pombe nucleus is spatially divided into functional sub-nuclear domains that correlate with gene activity.

Hydrogen cyanide (HCN), cyanoacetylene (HC 3 N), and ethane (C 2 H 6) vapors are treated as chemically inert gas species that flow from an upper boundary at 500 km to a condensation sink near Titan's tropopause (- 45 km). Gas vertical profiles are determined from eddy mixing and a downward flux at the upper boundary. The condensation sink is based upon diffusive growth of the cloud particles and is proportional to the degree of supersaturation in the cloud formation regIOn. Observations of the vapor phase abundances above the <b>condensation</b> <b>levels</b> and the locations and properties of the ice clouds provide constraints on the free parameters in the model. Vapor phase abundances are determined from CIRS mid-IR observations, whereas cloud particle sizes, altitudes, and latitudinal distributions are derived from analyses of CIRS far-IR observations of Titan. Specific cloud constraints include: I) mean particle radii of 2 - 3 J. lm inferred from the V 6 506 cm- band of HC 3 N, 2) latitudinal abundance distributions of condensed nitriles, inferred from a composite emission feature that peaks at 160 /cm, and 3) a possible hydrocarbon cloud layer at high latitudes, located near an altitude of 60 km, which peaks between 60 and 80 cm l. Nitrile abundances appear to diminish substantially at high northern latitudes over the time period 2005 to 2010 (northern mid winter to early spring).
