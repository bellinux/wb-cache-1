25|$|Machine-knitted jumpers {{tend to use}} finer wool, cotton, or {{synthetic}} yarn and have less complex patterns, {{since many of the}} traditional stitches cannot be reproduced this way. They are generally flatter, lighter and less substantial, without the pronounced texture of a hand knitted or hand loomed jumper. Machine knitted jumpers will loosen with wear, and so it is advisable to buy one size smaller than the size of the sweater usually worn. They are the least expensive option. Hand-looming allows more complicated stitches to be used, will have fewer stitches to the inch and be thicker. The best quality hand-loomed jumpers are almost indistinguishable from hand knit. Hand-knit jumpers tend to be more tightly knit, to have more <b>complex</b> <b>stitch</b> patterns and to be longer-lasting and they attract a significant price premium. By holding them up to light, the difference between the machine knit and hand knit is evident.|$|E
5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A flat knitting machine is very flexible, allowing <b>complex</b> <b>stitch</b> designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a circular machine. Knitting speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in flat knitting which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial flat knitting machines are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand flat knitting machine is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|E
40|$|A thin stream or rope of {{viscous fluid}} falling from a {{sufficient}} height onto a surface forms a steadily rotating helical coil. Tabletop laboratory experiments {{in combination with}} a numerical model for slender liquid ropes reveal that finite-amplitude coiling can occur in four distinct regimes (viscous, gravitational, inertio-gravitational, and inertial) corresponding to different balances among the three principal forces acting on the rope. The model further shows that the onset of coiling has distinct viscous, gravitational, and inertial modes that connect smoothly with the corresponding finite-amplitude regimes. In addition to steady coiling, slender liquid ropes falling onto surfaces can exhibit a remarkable variety of nonstationary behaviors, including propagating spiral waves of air bubbles, supercoiling, the leaping-shampoo (Kaye) effect for non-Newtonian fluids, and the fluid-mechanical sewing machine in which the rope leaves <b>complex</b> <b>stitch</b> patterns on a moving surface...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{describe}} the critical {{steps of the}} laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) technique and discuss how they impact upon the pertinent issues regarding prostate cancer surgery: blood loss, potency and continence. RESULTS: A major advantage of LRP is the reduced operative blood loss. The precise placement of the dorsal vein <b>complex</b> <b>stitch</b> associated with the tamponading effect of the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum significantly decrease venous bleeding, which is {{the main source of}} blood loss during radical prostatectomy. At the Cleveland Clinic, the average blood loss of our first 100 patients was 322. 5 ml, resulting in low transfusion rates. The continuous venous bleeding narrowed pelvic surgical field and poor visibility can adversely impact on nerve preservation during open radical prostatectomy. Laparoscopy, with its enhanced and magnified vision in a relatively bloodless field allows for excellent identification and handling of the neurovascular bundles. During open retropubic radical prostatectomy, the pubic bone may impair visibility and access to the urethral stump, and the surgeon must tie the knots relying on tactile sensation alone. Consequently, open prostatectomy is associated with a prolonged catheterization period of 2 - 3 weeks. Comparatively, during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy all sutures are meticulously placed and each is tied under complete visual control, resulting in a precise mucosa-to-mucosa approximation. CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic approach may represent a reliable less invasive alternative to the conventional open approach. Despite the encouraging preliminary anatomical and functional outcomes, prospective randomized comparative trials are required to critically evaluate the role of laparoscopy for this sophisticated and delicate operation...|$|E

40|$|Research {{data on the}} {{aerodynamic}} {{behavior of}} baseballs and cricket and golf balls are summarized. Cricket balls and baseballs are roughly {{the same size and}} mass but have different stitch patterns. Both are thrown to follow paths that avoid a batter's swing, paths that can curve if aerodynamic forces on the balls' surfaces are asymmetric. Smoke tracer wind tunnel tests and pressure taps have revealed that the unbalanced side forces are induced by tripping the boundary layer on the seam side and producing turbulence. More particularly, the greater pressures are perpendicular to the seam plane and only appear when the balls travel at velocities high enough so that the roughness length matches the seam heigh. The side forces, once tripped, will increase with spin velocity up to a cut-off point. The enhanced lift coefficient is produced by the Magnus effect. The more <b>complex</b> <b>stitching</b> on a baseball permits greater variations in the flight path curve and, {{in the case of a}} knuckleball, the unsteady flow effects. For golf balls, the dimples trip the boundary layer and the high spin rate produces a lift coefficient maximum of 0. 5, compared to a baseball's maximum of 0. 3. Thus, a golf ball travels far enough for gravitational forces to become important...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the upper}} and lower spars provide a frame for the sail, the camber of the sail is simply a {{function}} of how tightly the spars stretch the sail.

Curved edges, when mated with the straight spars, provide all or nearly all of the sail curvature needed.|$|R

50|$|TinyOS {{is fully}} non-blocking: {{it has one}} call stack. Thus, all input/output (I/O) {{operations}} that last longer than a few hundred microseconds are asynchronous and have a callback. To enable the native compiler to better optimize across call boundaries, TinyOS uses nesC's features to link these callbacks, called events, statically. While being non-blocking enables TinyOS to maintain high concurrency with one stack, it forces programmers to write <b>complex</b> logic by <b>stitching</b> together many small event handlers. To support larger computations, TinyOS provides tasks, which are similar to a Deferred Procedure Call and interrupt handler bottom halves. A TinyOS component can post a task, which the OS will schedule to run later. Tasks are non-preemptive and run in first in, first out order. This simple concurrency model is typically sufficient for I/O centric applications, but its difficulty with CPU-heavy applications has led to developing a thread library for the OS, named TOSThreads.|$|R
40|$|The Knitting Map was a large-scale, durational textile {{installation}} by the Irish-based performance {{production company}} half/angel {{that took place}} during Cork’s year as European Capital of Culture (2005). Bringing a decade of experience with emergent technologies and art practice, half/angel developed technologies to connect the physical busy-ness of Cork City (captured via a series of CCTV cameras) with correspondingly <b>complex</b> knitting <b>stitches</b> (<b>stitches</b> became more <b>complex</b> when the city was busy), and Cork weather (captured by a weather station) to yarn color. The resulting textile was an abstract documentation of {{a year in the}} life of an Irish city, in which a community of the disenfranchised (largely middle aged and older working class women form Cork), were given cartographic authority. To realize The Knitting Map, which required a year-long process of hand-knitting by over 2000 participants, half/angel embraced translation in myriad forms from data procurement and conversion, to language and culture. Here, digital vocabulary, initially unfamiliar and intimidating to many participants, empowered a group of women to speak through a traditional art form in an innovative voice, in which knitting became a radical act. In this paper, we explore the role of translation in engendering gestures of mapping, both intended and unintended. We examine The Knitting Map’s cartographic gestures as they played-out within an Irish context and how the work’s foregrounding of femininity and traditional craft troubled history. Such disruptions, we argue, are contingently consequent when traditional craft claims monumental cultural space...|$|R

40|$|Deformation from {{polygonal}} shapes into smooth surfaces is {{an attractive}} design tool since it relieves the user from the burden of having to first specify a large set of control points and then <b>stitching</b> <b>complex</b> patches together. This thesis presents such a modeling paradigm. Once a polygonal shape with underlying rectangular topology is specified by the user, it is deformed into a default smooth surface that interpolates all the polygonal vertices. The user can then modify the default smooth surface by increasing or decreasing the amount of deformation, either globally or locally. This is accomplished by interactively controlling the shape parameters associated with the polygonal vertices. The mathematical formulation {{is based on the}} interpolation method proposed by Loe and Tai [1]. The interpolation technique blends a cubic uniform B-spline curve or surface with a sequence of singularly reparametrized line segments or bilinear patches using a blending function that simulates the tension effect. Uniform B-spline, however, does not produce satisfactory result when the distances between the input points vary substantially; thus, we extend the idea to use the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and thus introduce an extra shape parameter, called weight. In addition, a roundness parameter is also introduced to adjust the shape of the NURBS curve or surface. This modeling paradigm is conceptually simple, and it allows C 2 continuous surfaces to be easily designed, even by novice users...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the time zero contact pressure over a defined rotator cuff footprint using different repair and stitch techniques in an established sheep model. Forty fresh-frozen sheep shoulders were randomly assigned to five repair groups: single-row repair using simple stitches (SRA-s), single-row repair using horizontal mattress stitches (SRA-m), and single-row repair using arthroscopic Mason-Allen stitches (SRA-ama). Double-row repair was either performed with a combination of simple and horizontal mattress stitches (DRA-sm) or with arthroscopic Mason-Allen/horizontal mattress stitches (DRA-amam). Investigations were performed using a pressure-sensitive film system. The average contact pressure and pressure pattern were measured for each group. Contact pressure was lowest in SRA-m followed by SRA-s. SRA-ama showed highest contact pressure of all single-row treatment groups (P <  0. 05). DRA-amam presented the highest overall contact pressure (P <  0. 05), whereas DRA-sm exerted contact pressure equal to that of SRA-ama. Both double-row techniques showed the most expanded pressure pattern. Average contact pressures for the more complex single- and double-row techniques utilizing arthroscopic Mason-Allen stitches were greater than were those of the repair techniques utilizing simple and horizontal mattress stitches. However, the contact pattern between the anchors could be increased by using the double-row technique, resulting in more footprint coverage compared to patterns utilizing the single-row techniques. These results support the use of the more <b>complex</b> arthroscopic Mason-Allen <b>stitches</b> and may improve the environment for healing of the repaired rotator cuff tendon...|$|R
40|$|The Annieopsquotch accretionary tract in Newfoundland is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} west-dipping structural panels, each containing remnants of ophiolitic and arc-backarc complexes of Laurentian affinity formed during the Ordovician closure of Iapetus. Panels were transferred from an upper-plate to a lower-plate setting during their Middle to Late Ordovician accretion to the Laurentian margin and become progressively younger eastward. Geochronological data indicate a complex and rapid history of generation and accretion of peri-Laurentian suprasubduction zone rocks. The rapid changes in tectonic environments and the complexity of the relationships are analogous to the complex arc-backarc relationships observed in the western Pacific today. The recognition of the peri-Laurentian provenance of these units based on stratigraphy, geochronology, isotopes, and geochemistry defines the position of the Red Indian Line, the fundamental suture zone in the northern Appalachians, but more importantly enables the development of a realistic tectonic model for the Annieopsquotch accretionary tract involving both thrust and sinistral transcurrent displacements. The oldest and most inboard unit in the Annieopsquotch accretionary tract is the Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt (ca. 480 Ma), which marks the initiation of subduction outboard of the Laurentian margin. The Lloyds River ophiolite complex (ca. 473 Ma) preserves a fragment of younger, more mid-ocean-ridge–like backarc-oceanic crust than the adjacent, structurally overlying Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt. The Lloyds River ophiolite complex originated as a backarc to the Buchans Group (ca. 473 Ma) ensialic bimodal calc-alkaline arc. The panels containing the Annieopsquotch ophiolite belt and Lloyds River ophiolite <b>complex</b> were <b>stitched</b> and overlain by ensialic arc rocks of the Otter Pond Complex (ca. 468 Ma) immediately after their accretion to composite Laurentia together with the structurally underlying Buchans Group. The youngest, structurally lowest two panels comprise the elements of the Red Indian Lake group (465 – 460 Ma), which record the opening of a backarc basin and the subsequent establishment of a bimodal ensialic calc-alkaline arc sequence. The observed relationships indicate that the Annieopsquotch accretionary tract was generated above a single west-dipping subduction zone outboard of the Laurentian margin over ∼ 20 m. y. Accretion mainly took place in two stages at ca. 468 and 450 Ma, which correspond with the collision between Laurentia and the Dashwoods ribbon continent and the collision with the peri-Gondwanan Victoria Arc along the Red Indian Line, respectively. Both collisions form part of the Taconic orogeny. The latter, Late Ordovician collision terminated the relatively rapid closure of the main Iapetan tract. The proposed model is similar to the correlative tracts in the British and Irish Caledonides, and may encourage a new look at the New England Appalachians...|$|R
40|$|Data centers {{today are}} growing {{in size and}} {{becoming}} harder to manage. It {{is more important than}} ever to concentrate on management of such large networks, and arrive at simple yet efficient designs that involve minimum manual intervention. Reducing network management costs can lead to better service availability, response times and increase return on investment. In this dissertation, we focus on three aspects of data center network management, the network fabric, policy enforcement and fault localization. There are inherent challenges due to scale in each of these areas. Firstly, simple, plug-and-play networks are known not to scale, leading network operators to often <b>stitch</b> <b>complex</b> interior and exterior gateway protocols to connect large data centers. Second, network isolation policies can become too huge for network hardware to handle as the number of applications multiplexed on a single data center increase. Thirdly diagnosis can become extremely hard because of the sheer number of components interacting for a service to be successful. Localizing the fault is often left to knowledgeable operators who work together in war rooms to track down and fight problems. Such an approach can be time consuming, tedious and reduce availability. To address these challenges, we propose to compose the data center management system with these three contributions : (i) PortLand : A scalable layer 2 network fabric that completely eliminates loops and broadcast storms and combines the best elements of traditional layer 2 and layer 3 network fabrics: plug-and-play, support for scale, mobility and path diversity. (ii) FasTrak : A policy enforcement system that moves network isolation rules between server software and network hardware so that performance sensitive traffic is not subject to unnecessary overheads and latency. FasTrak enables performance sensitive applications to move into multi- tenant clouds and supports their requirements. (iii) Gestalt : A fault localization algorithm, developed from first principles, that can operate in large scale networks and beats existing localization algorithms on localization accuracy or time or both. We have prototyped and evaluated each of these systems and believe that these can be easily implemented with minor modifications to data center switches and end host...|$|R
