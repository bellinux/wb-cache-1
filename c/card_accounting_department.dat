50|$|Most of {{the growth}} of the company during the 1980s and early 1990s were the results from the {{acquisition}} of credit <b>cards</b> <b>accounts</b> from banks needed to sell some assets for quick cash to stave off insolvency or from banks that had decided to cease issuing and servicing their own credit <b>cards</b> <b>accounts</b> because they either could not compete with the much larger credit card issuers such as First USA. As more bank credit <b>card</b> <b>accounts</b> became concentrated in a few large issuers during the 1990s, fewer banks had credit <b>card</b> <b>accounts</b> to sell, so large issuers were forced to switched to direct marketing as the means to obtain more cardholders. In the process, those issuers started to offer no annual fee cards with introductory interest rates that quickly increase after a set time which led to fierce competition among the remaining credit card issuers, especially in the fight in attracting the most lucrative customer, the ones who routinely maintain large monthly revolving balances, and are the same customers who could cause problems for the bank if the local economy turn sour.|$|R
