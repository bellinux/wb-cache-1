40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{emerging}} geographic features of current concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance,</b> and to improve, modify, and extend the framework proposed by Mizzaro (1998). The objective is to define a new framework able to account, more completely and precisely, for the notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> involved in mobile information seeking scenarios. Design/methodology/approach – The authors formalise two new dimensions <b>of</b> <b>relevance.</b> The first dimension emphasises the spatio-temporal nature of the information seeking process. The second dimension allows us to describe how different concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> rely on different abstractions of reality. Findings – The new framework allows: to conceptualise the point in space and time at which a given notion <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> refers to; to conceptualise the level of abstraction taken into account by a given notion of relevance; and to include widely adopted facets (e. g. users mobility, preferences, and social context) in the classification <b>of</b> notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance.</b> Originality/value – The conceptual discussion presented in this paper contributes to the future development <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> in the scope of mobile information seeking scenarios. The authors provide a more comprehensive framework for conceptualization, development, and classification <b>of</b> notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> in the field of information retrieval and location-based services.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a growing concern amongst {{organisation}} and management scholars about the practical <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> their research. Yet, although many researchers talk about ‘relevance’ they hardly ever define what they mean by that. The term itself has different meanings, which often even contradict each other. This ambiguity is problematic as it implies different and even conflicting relationships between science and practice. Consequently, the various contributions to the debate on ‘relevance’ cannot meaningfully be related to each other before the underlying notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> are clarified. This is particularly critical when it comes to questions about research policy: different notions <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> lead to different policy recommendations. In this paper we try to elucidate the concept <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> by developing a taxonomy of different forms <b>of</b> <b>relevance.</b> In addition to that, we assess {{the extent to which the}} different forms <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> fit with the logic of science, and consequently what forms <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> can justifiably be expected from organisation and management studies...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> as viewed and {{applied in the}} context of IR evaluation, by presenting an overview of the multidimensional and dy-namic nature of the concept. The literature on relevance reveals how the relevance concept, especially in regard to the multidimensionality <b>of</b> <b>relevance,</b> is many faceted, and does not just refer to the various relevance criteria users may apply in the process <b>of</b> judging <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> retrieved information objects.

Thus, the objective {{of this article is to}} present an overview of the many different views and ways by which the concept <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> is used—lead-ing to a consistent and compatible understanding of the concept. In addition, special attention is paid to the type <b>of</b> situational <b>relevance.</b> Many researchers perceive sit-uational relevance as the most realistic type <b>of</b> user <b>relevance,</b> and therefore situational relevance is dis-cussed with reference to its potential dynamic nature, and as a requirement for interactive information retrieval (IIR) evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Relevance is the {{critical}} criterion for valuing information. The usual requirements of valuable information resources are their accuracy, brevity, timeliness and rarity. This thesis points out that relevance has to be explicitly recognised as an important quality of information. Therefore, the theory of signs is adopted to enable a systematic study of the problem <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> according to the branches of semiotics in order to clarify the concept <b>of</b> information. <b>Relevance</b> has several meanings according to the various disciplinary approaches including phenomenology, law, logic, information science, communication and cognition. These different concepts are discussed and criticised in two chapters. A new approach is proposed in which a universal concept <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> is considered as an affordance. Therefore, all the approaches to relevance can be applied within the broader approach of the analysis of affordances. This approach not only encompasses all the underlying characteristics <b>of</b> <b>relevance,</b> it is also compatible with the assumptions of the logic of norms and affordances (NORMA). NORMA semantic analysis {{is used as a}} basis on which concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> are applied semiotically. Two case- studies are selected for testing these concepts which results in a guideline for practical application in a semiotic framework. The results from these case-studies confirm the practical importance of these concepts <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> which can be systematically used in the analysis and design of information systems.

It then shows, at the hand <b>of</b> examples, why <b>relevance</b> is important from a user perspective in the extra-lexicographical pre- and post-consultation phases and in the intra-lexicographical consultation phase. It defines an additional type <b>of</b> subjective <b>relevance</b> that is very important for lexicography as well as for information science, viz. functional relevance. Since all lexicographic work is ultimately aimed at satisfying users’ information needs, the article then discusses why the lexicographer should take note of all these types <b>of</b> <b>relevance</b> when planning a new dictionary project, identifying new tasks and responsibilities of the modern lexicographer.
