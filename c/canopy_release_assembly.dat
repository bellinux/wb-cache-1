40|$|Key messageThe {{position}} {{of trees in}} the canopy impacts xylem structure and its inter-annual variation. After <b>canopy</b> <b>release,</b> {{the increase in the}} hydraulic conductivity of growth rings was driven by an increase in radial growth in large trees, and by both an increase in radial growth and changes in xylem structure in saplings. ContextForest canopies are frequently subjected to disturbances that allow understory trees to access the upper canopy. The effect of <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> on xylem anatomy has been assessed in juvenile trees and saplings, while the potential acclimation of larger trees remains poorly documented. AimsWe estimated the potential hydraulic conductivity of growth rings in large understory trees compared to overstory trees, and evaluated the responses to <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> in large trees and in saplings. MethodsWe recorded radial growth, wood density, and vessel structure in beech trees according to their position within the canopy and their size. Xylem traits were followed during 6 years after <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> for large trees, and during 2 years for saplings. Vessel diameter and frequency as well as ring area were used to compute the potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity. ResultsLarge understory trees displayed lower radial growth increments and lower potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity than overstory trees. After <b>canopy</b> <b>release,</b> potential annual ring hydraulic conductivity increased in large trees, due exclusively to increased radial growth without any change in specific hydraulic conductivity. It increased in saplings due to both increased radial growth and increased specific conductivity. ConclusionTree size impacted xylem structure and resulted in plasticity of the potential hydraulic conductivity of the annual tree ring following <b>canopy</b> <b>release...</b>|$|R

5|$|Banksia menziesii regenerates after bushfire by resprouting {{from its}} woody lignotuber, or from epicormic buds on the trunk. It is {{generally}} only weakly serotinous {{in the southern}} part of its range, that is, it lacks a canopy seed bank as follicles on old flower spikes in the <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> their seed after two years, but populations retain more seed as populations move north. Lower canopies and drier climates predispose to hotter fires that are more likely to kill plants and effect seed release, and thus facilitate seedling recruitment.|$|R
25|$|Bader's fuselage, {{tail and}} fin were gone from behind him, {{and he lost}} height rapidly at what he {{estimated}} to be 400mph (640km/hr) in a slow spin. He jettisoned the cockpit <b>canopy,</b> <b>released</b> his harness pin, and the air rushing past the open cockpit started to suck him out, but his prosthetic leg was trapped. Part {{way out of the}} cockpit and still attached to his aircraft, Bader fell for some time before he released his parachute, at which point the leg's retaining strap snapped under the strain and he was pulled free. A Bf 109 flew by some 50 yards away as he neared the ground at around 4,000feet (1,200metres).|$|R
5000|$|The Board of Investigations {{concluded}} that improvements to their parachutists and equipment {{were to be}} provided. Chief Warrant Officer Lewis [...] "Lew" [...] T. Vinson suggested that the Capewell <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> be installed on all the Marines' parachutes, static-line or free-fall, to permit the jumper {{to get out of}} the harness if caught in a drag. Later, the Army Parachute Board came to the same conclusion at Fort Benning and Fort Bragg. Six army parachutists had been recently killed at Fort Bragg in the same manner as the unfortunate marines at Case Springs. Because of these deaths, it led to the recommendation and requirement of adopting the Capewell Release by all the services.|$|R

Steingard's first principal side project, Fox Run, {{released on}} October 25, 2006, utilizes {{a large number}} of instruments for a unique sound. His second album Under The <b>Canopy,</b> <b>released</b> on November 25, 2008, is rather an emotional alternative one rather than the pop-punk genre of Hawk Nelson, while three singles from Under The Canopy was featured in the Atlantis EP released on November 11, 2008, and available for free download. Steingard served as a judge for The 13th and 14th Annual Independent Music Awards in 2014 and 2015, and his contributions helped to assist the careers of upcoming independent artists.|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{process in}} the lower region of a maize canopy is analyzed for two nights. It appears that during calm nights a free convection state develops in the lower region of the canopy. Convective heat is released at the soil's surface and transported directly to the higher portion of the <b>canopy.</b> The <b>released</b> sensible heat at the soil's surface can be easily calculated by applying the Nusselt number for free convection. At night thermal energy is also released through cooling of the <b>canopy.</b> The <b>released</b> heat from the stored canopy heat is of the same order of magnitude as all other energy terms. Conversely during daytime for most agricultural crops this energy term is of minor importance {{in comparison to the}} other energy terms. The formation of dew at night is an important process. A maximal possible estimate of dew accumulation for a particular night can easily be made by using the potential dew. The potential dew can be deduced more accurately by taking into account the released heat stored in the plant canopy...|$|R

25|$|Parachute pack systems – The {{parachute}} {{is one of}} the trademarks of Force Recon, {{throughout its}} existence the operators have extensively used a wide variety of parachutes. In the mid-1950s, they used the T-10, then later adopting the Capewell <b>canopy</b> <b>release</b> which provided a cut-away to reduce the deadly effect of drag. The T-10 became the most frequented parachute; which had two variants, one for low-level static line (LLSL) and the other for military free fall (MFF) descends. They had numerous parachutes listed under the Table of Equipment (T/E) that had been contained in the Paraloft. Even in its formative days in the Marine Corps Test Unit#1, the operators and testers of the Naval Parachute Unit (NPU) at El Centro had tested and sported numerous parachutes, adding modifications and suggestions that soon were adopted by other parachutists. By the 1990s, the MC-4 and MC-5 Ram Air Parachutes became the feasible choice, as it allows more detailed and accurate landing in smaller areas, easy to control—especially during oscillation of the canopy. Plus, it was formed to modulate between the LLSL and MFF without having to consort to a different pack.|$|R

40|$|A {{computerized}} system for dispensing insect sex pheromones at various release rates is presented. The installation {{consists of an}} electronic device which, through a suitable timed dripping system, distributes the pheromone formulate on a plaited filament that moves within the orchard. The pheromone- impregnated thin rope runs over a system of pole-mounted pulleys above the tree <b>canopy,</b> <b>releasing</b> the semiochemical into the orchard. The versatility of such a mating-disruption system makes it possible: i) to distribute different pheromones {{at the same time}} and on the same support as required; ii) to avoid possible chemical treatments due to dispenser depletion in the last part of the season; iii) to change the operational parameters, in particular the timing and the dosage of pheromone dispensing, according to: a) time of the day during which adults are active for mating; b) trap catches in the reference field; c) possible trap catches within the disrupted orchard. Field tests were carried out in the period 2000 - 2001 on apple and pear orchards to control Codling moth (Cydia pomonella), Oriental fruit moth (C. molesta) and the Leafrollers complex. The amount of pheromone released during the season varied from 160 to 220 g, according to the species to be controlled and their respective populations. Good results have been achieved in most tests, showing an efficacy comparable with the standard IPM practise...|$|R
