5|$|In <b>cotton</b> production, the {{replacement}} of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt <b>cotton</b> can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of <b>cotton</b> pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt <b>cotton</b> can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt <b>cotton</b> are often similar.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Cottons</b> Breccia {{is part of}} {{the upper}} Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran: 586 – 572 Ma) Grassy Group, exposed on King Island, Tasmania. This {{formation}} has been widely interpreted as an unambiguous tillite, in support of tectono-climatic models that invoke catastrophic latest Neoproterozoic global glaciation. However, dissenting opinions interpret the <b>Cottons</b> Breccia as a tectonic breccia. In this paper,we reviewthe tectonostratigraphy of the <b>Cottons</b> Breccia, and the enclosing Grassy Group. We find no unambiguous evidence for a direct glacial origin, as postulated by some early workers. An interpretation of the <b>Cottons</b> Breccia as a deposit within half-graben in the shoulder regions of an actively developing latest Neoproterozoic volcanic rifted margin is consistent with all the available sedimentological, structural, geochronological, and tectonic evidence...|$|R

5|$|As silk was {{a luxury}} good, {{the market was}} small and easily {{saturated}} by machine produced goods. The next innovation in machine produced textiles came in the <b>cotton</b> industry which had a much wider market and produced more affordable goods. Spinning <b>cotton</b> was a more complex process than silk production. The water frame for spinning <b>cotton</b> was developed by Richard Arkwright and patented in 1769. The machines could spin yarn continuously and replaced skilled workers with unskilled supervisors {{to make sure the}} machines didn't break. Water frames varied in size from 4 to 96spindles. For these reasons, the water frame became popular and widespread. In 1771, Richard Arkwright took a lease on land in Cromford. By 1774, his first mill was operational, and in 1776 he began construction of a second mill at Cromford. During this time, he developed machines for pre-spinning and in 1775 took out his second patent. With spinning mechanised, the other processes involved in producing <b>cotton</b> could not keep up and also required mechanisation. He produced a machine for carding, the process which laid out the <b>cotton</b> fibres parallel, however not all his inventions were successful and cleaning the <b>cotton</b> was performed by hand until the 1790s when an effective machine was invented.|$|E

40|$|In the {{processing}} of raw <b>cottons,</b> the presence of entomological sugars from insect contamination on surfaces of lint can affect quality. Sticky sugars and other carbohydrates collect on processing machinery, inhibiting speed and efficiency.

A rapid, reliable, and nondestructive test capable of detecting such sugars on <b>cottons</b> would be a welcome tool.

Raw <b>cotton,</b> animal hides, oil seeds, grains, pulses, coffee, tea and <b>cotton</b> manufactures were the main items of sea trade. Most of the sea trade was carried through the presidency's principal port of Madras. Other important ports were Gopalpur, Kalingapatnam, Bimlipatnam, Visakhapatnam, Masulipatnam, Cocanada, Madras, Cuddalore, Negapatam, Pamban and Tuticorin {{on the east coast}} along with Mangalore, Cannanore, Calicut, Tellicherry, Cochin, Alleppey, Quilon(Coulão) and Colachel on the western seaboard. The port of Cochin was taken over by the Government of India on 1 August 1936, and that of Madras on 1 April 1937. There were Chambers of Commerce in Madras, Cochin and Cocanada. These chambers each nominated a member to the Madras Legislative Council.|$|E

Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire <b>Cotton</b> Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw <b>cotton</b> from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the <b>cotton</b> famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local <b>cotton</b> workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of <b>cotton</b> spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last <b>cotton</b> spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Royton's damp climate {{provided}} the ideal conditions for <b>cotton</b> spinning {{to be carried}} out without the <b>cotton</b> drying and breaking, and newly developed 19th century mechanisation optimised <b>cotton</b> spinning for mass production for the global market. By 1832, there were 12 steam powered mills in Royton, of which its former hamlets had begun to agglomerate as a town around the <b>cotton</b> factories, a number of small coalpits and new turnpike road from Oldham to Rochdale, which passed through the town centre. The Manchester, Oldham and Royton Railway and a goods yard was constructed in the 1860s, allowing improved transportation of textile goods and raw materials to and from the township. Neighbouring Oldham (which by the 1870s had emerged {{of the largest and most}} productive mill town in the world) had begun to encroach upon Royton's southern boundary, forming a continuous urban cotton-spinning district. The demand for cheap <b>cotton</b> goods from this area prompted the flotation of <b>cotton</b> spinning companies; the investment was followed by the construction of 22 new <b>cotton</b> mills in Royton. Together with Oldham, at its peak the area was responsible for 13% of the world's <b>cotton</b> production.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{quantities}} of <b>cotton</b> {{began to be}} used after about 1600, firstly in linen/cotton fustians, but by around 1750 pure <b>cotton</b> fabrics were being produced and <b>cotton</b> had overtaken wool in importance. The Irwell and Mersey were made navigable by 1736, opening a route from Manchester to the sea docks on the Mersey. The Bridgewater Canal, Britain's first wholly artificial waterway, was opened in 1761, bringing coal from mines at Worsley to central Manchester. The canal was extended to the Mersey at Runcorn by 1776. The combination of competition and improved efficiency halved the cost of coal and halved the transport cost of raw <b>cotton.</b> Manchester became the dominant marketplace for textiles produced in the surrounding towns. A commodities exchange, opened in 1729, and numerous large warehouses, aided commerce. In 1780, Richard Arkwright began construction of Manchester's first <b>cotton</b> mill. In the early 1800s, John Dalton formulated his atomic theory in Manchester.|$|E
