By contrast, I criticize a <b>cisgendered</b> viewpoint and demonstrate the logical errors that result in transphobic behavior through Jacques Lacan’s version of the prisoner’s dilemma. I conclude to theorize trans activism’s engagement with the state through Lacanian analytic technique. This technique does not result in traditional “treatment,” but instead fuels activism {{with knowledge of the}} structures that must be reconfigured to attain liberation. To this end, trans activism’s engagement with legal institutions is interpreted through Lacan’s Seminar XVII: The Other Side of Psychoanalysis, and Althusser’s On the Reproduction of Capitalism. I argue trans activists seize the opportunity of the encounter to transform an exploitative and repressive state...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} re-explore and {{critique}} {{the current trend}} of androgyny in fashion and popular culture and the potential it may hold for gender-deviant dress and politics. In order to do this, it will discuss {{the way in which}} a popular version of male drag has monopolized a vision of gender subversion that has marginalized ‘straight’ <b>cisgendered</b> women’s transgressive challenge to gender norms. Although not misogynistic in itself, RuPaul’s Drag Race (Logo 2009 – 2017) brings to the surface the misogyny inherent in femininity – the performance underscores deeper asymmetrical power imbalances which are embedded in women’s daily lives. Recent unisex fashion collections with their subsequent campaigns have sought to address this imbalance; however, this is not a problem with an easy fix. This article looks at the way in which particular performers such as Grace Jones and Harnaam Kaur have ad(dressed) their gender resistance without camouflaging and thus losing sight of a feminist history of gender inequality which still strongly resonates...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, hetero-masculine drag is a {{generally}} accepted cultural practice associated with laddish behaviour. This mode of drag consists of hetero-masculine, <b>cisgendered</b> men performing deliberately erroneous feminine imitation {{with the intention}} of being funny. For example, a crowd of mates out on a stag night might wear dresses and wigs to enliven a pub-crawl. It is a mode of drag enacted for the purposes of fun and comedy, and neither demonstrates an exploration of gender nor celebrates the feminine. Instead, it articulates stark distinctions between the ‘wholly masculine’ performer and their ‘badly’ performed femininity. I argue here that in its parody of femininity, hetero-masculine drag as it manifests in Australian social traditions and mainstream media functions to verify a specific form of hegemonic Australian masculinity and devalue femininity. This article establishes that in Australia this ostensibly amusing practice is aligned with Australian football culture. Footballers are often criticised in the media for offensive/sexist behaviour, yet this particular custom of derisively parodying femininity receives little if any negative attention. I contend that certain cultural structures render the gendered discriminations of this activity all but invisible. This article investigates the socio-cultural functions of this mode of drag and the reasons it is sheltered from public condemnation...|$|R

40|$|In R v McNally, gender {{deception}} {{is found}} capable of {{leading to the}} vitiation of consent to sexual intercourse and, in so doing, places restriction on the freedom of transgendered individuals in favour of <b>cisgendered</b> freedom. This paper seeks to challenge the standing of this decision by adopting a combined methodological approach between Deleuzian post-structuralism and Gewirthian legal idealism. In so doing, we attempt {{to show that the}} combination offers a novel and productive approach to contentious decisions, such as that in McNally. Our approach brings together post-structuralist corporeality which conceives of the body as material and productive, and Gewirth’s ‘agent’ to conceptualise the legal body as an entity which can, and should, shape judicial reasoning. It does this by employing the criterion of categorically necessary freedom on institutionalised practical reasoning. These ‘bodies of agents’ can be conceived as the underpinning and justificatory basis for the authority of the law subject to the morally rational Principle of Generic Consistency. This egalitarian condition precedent requires individualisation and the ability to accept self-differentiation in order to return to a status, which can be validly described as “law”. Ultimately, we argue that this theoretical combination responds to a call to problematise the connection made between gender discourse and judicial reasoning, whilst offering the opportunity to further our conceptions of law and broaden the theoretical armoury with which to challenge judicial reasoning in McNally. That is, a ‘good faith’ attempt to further and guarantee transgender freedoms...|$|R

25|$|Transgender men {{who have}} been oophorectomized must {{continue}} androgen therapy to avoid premature osteoporosis. Estrogen supplementation is theoretically not usually necessary, as some of the injected testosterone will be aromatized into estrogen sufficient to maintain bone (as it does in <b>cisgender</b> men). However, a single small study of trans men after oophorectomy demonstrated that androgens alone may be insufficient to retard bone loss. (van Kesteren P, et al. “Long-term follow-up of bone mineral density and bone metabolism in transsexuals treated with cross-sex hormones.” Clin Endocrin. 48(3):347-54. 1998.) It is likely the case that pre-oophorectomy, residual estrogen production is protective. However, after oophorectomy, some trans men may have insufficient estrogen to retard bone loss.|$|E

40|$|Both {{popular media}} {{and social science}} {{research}} suggest that gender/sexual identities and roles that have dominated western society are being challenged (Budgeon, 2014). Heteronormative assumptions and the gender binary are rapidly evolving to capture experiences that reflect greater diversity (Diamond, 2005; Nagoshi et al., 2012), including those that extend beyond labels.

With regard to sexual orientation, 409 identified as heterosexual, 59 as bisexual, 76 as gay/lesbian, and 60 as “other” (asexual, pansexual). In general, ‘unlabeled’-gender participants reported lower overall life satisfaction compared to <b>cisgendered,</b> but were similar to other GSRMs on reported levels of minority stress. Explaining their ‘unlabeled’ status, participants described their primary identification as human, expressed discomfort with gender-based assumptions and rejected constrictions of the gender binary. All but one of the participants who reported an ‘unlabeled’ sexual orientation indicated that their birth sex was female and none identified as male. ‘Unlabeled’ participants reported lower overall and family life satisfaction than did straight participants.

40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} one of the most {{frequently}} encountered gynaecological malignancies that is highly preventable through screening. Therefore, screening for cervical cancer is a public health priority. No recommendations exist for screening lesbian or bisexual women or for female to male transgender individuals. Evidence suggests that trans men attend cervical screening far less than <b>cisgendered</b> women and also are more likely to receive an inadequate cervical smear test. We aimed to explore barriers to cervical screening uptake in trans men. Methods: Qualitative interviews were carried out with trans men who had an intact cervix and were eligible for cervical screening. Recruited through trans organisations, seven participants based in London and Manchester were interviewed or took part in a focus group. Because of the sensitive nature of the research, there were few expressions of interest for the study, so every request was highly valued. Interview and group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed by thematic analysis. Ethics approval was granted from London Metropolitan University. Findings: Four themes emerged. The trans men reported the importance of social and peer support in providing motivation to seek health care. The need for their gender identity, post-transition, to be accepted by health-care professionals was crucial in influencing the decision for screening uptake. Despite the participants' understanding of the importance of cervical screening on their health, previous negative experiences deterred attendance. There was a recognition that education about the importance of screening within the trans community was needed. Interpretation: Trans men need sensitive and respectful cervical screening experiences. Promotion of cervical screening through provision of education for trans men and health-care professionals is essential to increase awareness and understanding of the importance of screening in this group and to develop sensitive environments for screening to take place. Although we interviewed a small sample, our findings are novel and valuable. Future research is needed to develop interventions to increase understanding and awareness, promote screening attendance, and create a trans friendly environment. Guidelines for delivering appropriate services are warranted...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} new context for reading early modern devotional writing’s rich {{engagement with the}} language of the body in its focus on the relationship between gendered representations of devotional desire and spiritual ability in the religious poetry of seventeenth-century England. By tracing how somatic speech and bodily conditions are portrayed in the devotional poetry of John Milton, Richard Crashaw, Thomas Traherne, and An Collins, this project examines how these writers fashion spiritual states through the language of a sometime sorrowful and sometime ecstatic, but always desiring body. My project reveals how early modern authors manipulate or respond to gendered and bodily hierarchies to craft liturgically rich devotional scenes that exceed and overwhelm sensations of spiritual lack written on and within the bodies of the devotional figures presented therein. Through my focus on the body of the text and also the ways in which bodies are represented within devotional texts, I posit a new way of looking at early modern devotional writing: as prosthetics. The term prosthesis is most often associated with a medical appendage supplementing a bodily lack, but my project takes seriously the animating capacity of language as I demonstrate the ways in which early modern devotional writing exhibits a “prosthetic impulse” that blurs mind-body divides via the amplified register of highly affective somatic speech. Far from mere metaphor, this dissertation shows how the prosthetized devotional text materializes and makes known the spiritual abilities of authors who actively frame divine desire around bodies in opposition to the normative <b>cisgendered</b> and ableist body so widely celebrated in religious discourses of the period. Reading devotional texts as prosthetics that supplement the spiritual lack experienced by early modern believers struggling to articulate their relationship with the divine reveals the problematic interplay between self and society in its blurring of the boundaries between immaterial soul, the material body, and the literal pages before us. My project thus demonstrates how the prosthetized text actively reframes dualist constructions of the body and soul, men and women, and also spiritual health and ability...|$|R

In increasing these frequency values, it was possible for these transfeminine individuals to more closely approximate the vocal frequency of <b>cisgender</b> women.

25|$|Firstly, {{if one is}} to {{decrease}} testosterone in male-to-female gender transition, {{it is likely that}} sexual desire and arousal would be inhibited; alternatively, if high doses of estrogen negatively impact sexual desire, which has been found in some research with <b>cisgender</b> women, it is hypothesized that combining androgens with high levels of estrogen would intensify this outcome. Unfortunately, to date there haven’t been any randomized clinical trials looking at the relationship between type and dose of hormone replacement therapy, so the relationship between them remains unclear. Typically, the estrogens given for male-to-female gender transition are 2-3 times higher than the recommended dose for HRT in postmenopausal women. Pharmokinetic studies indicate taking these increased doses may lead to a higher boost in plasma estradiol levels; however, the long-term side effects haven’t been studied and the safety of this route is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Progestogens, in {{conjunction}} with the hormone prolactin, are involved in the maturation of the lobules, acini, and areola during pregnancy: mammary structures that estrogen has little to no direct effect on. However, there is no clinical evidence that progestogens enhance breast size, shape, or appearance in either transgender women or <b>cisgender</b> women, and one study found no benefit to breast hemicircumference over estrogen alone in a small sample of transgender women given both an estrogen and an oral progestogen (usually 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate). However, the authors of the paper stated that the sample size was too small to make any definitive conclusions, and that further studies should be carried out to confirm whether progestogens significantly affect breast size and/or shape in transgender women. As of 2014, no additional study had looked at the issue. Anecdotal evidence from transgender women suggests that those who take progesterone supplements may experience more full breast development, including stage IV on the Tanner scale (many transgender women do not develop Tanner stage V breasts). However, there have been no formal studies with sufficiently large sample sizes to confirm this.|$|E
40|$|Literary {{descriptions}} of shifting from and transgressing assigned sex were common in 19 th Century Sweden. This thesis forms {{a contribution to}} the larger project of writing a history of Swedish trans literature, and develops new interpretations of certain works of fiction by applying a transgender studies perspective. Through trans readings the thesis also examines what potential and possible implications literature might have for trans people beyond the literary realm. Trans readings are able to supplement earlier research by providing a nuanced understanding of the production of trans- and <b>cisgenders.</b> The theoretical perspectives used in the thesis are drawn for the most part from queer and transgender studies. The thesis adopts a conceptual understanding of trans as a movement, and aims to widen the scope of what may be considered relevant to a history of trans literature. The primary objects of analysis are the 1833 autobiography of widely known thief and cross-dresser Lasse-Maja (Lars Molin), C. J. L. Almqvist’s Drottningens juvelsmycke (1834), and Aurora Ljungstedt’s Moderna typer (1874). In closing, two texts from the fin-de-siècle are also closely read; Amanda Kerfstedt’s Reflexer (1901) and Frida Stéenhoff’s “Ett sällsamt öde” (1911). A wide range of other fiction is additionally studied in order to establish a contextual pattern of trans literary traditions. The thesis demonstrates that trans permeates all kinds of fiction, and that the characters analysed construct both trans and cis gender categories. It concludes that trans is done in a variety of ways, and with a variety of meanings in 19 th and early 20 th century literature. Trans is often depicted as a positive, fruitful and desirable act, through trans characters who are both themselves subjects of erotic desire and who become symbols of liberty and emancipation. Other trans figures however are often counter images of what are considered to be correct sexes, and are depicted as threatening and/or ridiculous. Both these negative and positive representations of trans affirm the gender binary. At the same time, they also break and destabilize that same binary, and the trans characters in the study both can and cannot be interpreted as transgressing cis- and heteronormativity respectively...|$|R
25|$|Synthetic anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), like {{nandrolone}} (as an ester like nandrolone decanoate or nandrolone phenylpropionate), are agonists of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR) similarly to testosterone {{but are not}} usually used in HRT for transgender men or for androgen replacement therapy (ART) in <b>cisgender</b> men. However, {{they can be used}} in place of testosterone with similar effects, and can have certain advantages like less or no local potentiation in so-called androgenic tissues that express 5α-reductase like the skin and hair follicles (which results in a reduced rate of skin and hair-related side effects like acne, oily skin, seborrhea, excessive body hair growth, and, in particular, male-pattern baldness), although this can also be disadvantageous in a few aspects of masculinization (specifically facial hair growth, body hair growth, and clitoral enlargement). Although many AAS are not potentiated in androgenic tissues, they have similar effects to testosterone in other tissues like bone, muscle, fat, and the voice box. Also, many AAS, like nandrolone esters, are aromatized into estrogens to a greatly reduced extent relative to testosterone or not at all, and for this reason, are associated with reduced or no estrogenic effects (e.g., gynecomastia). AAS that are 17α-alkylated like methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, and stanozolol are orally active but carry a high risk of liver damage, whereas AAS that are not 17α-alkylated, like nandrolone esters, must be administered by intramuscular injection (via which they act as long-lasting depots similarly to testosterone esters) but have no more risk of liver damage than does testosterone.|$|E
