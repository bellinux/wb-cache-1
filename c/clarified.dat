40|$|The {{mechanism}} of reducing light scattering in isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), through {{the addition of}} so-called <b>clarifying</b> agents, is studied with small-angle light scattering (SALS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The <b>clarifying</b> agents {{used in this study}} depict monotectic phase behavior with i-PP, crystallizing in a relatively narrow concentration range in a nanofibrillar network, providing an ultrahigh nucleation density in the i-PP melt. It is found that the <b>clarifying</b> effect, a dramatically increased transparency and reduced haze, that occurs within the aforementioned additive concentration range, coincides with a change in morphology from strongly scattering spherulites to shish-kebab-like crystalline structures, as evidenced by in situ SALS measurements and confirmed by SEM images. A simple scaling law, relating the diameter of the shish-kebab structures to the fibril diameter and volume fraction of the <b>clarifying</b> agent is proposed, suggesting that the performance of a (fibril-forming) <b>clarifying</b> agent will improve by reducing the fibril diameter and/or increasing the volume concentration of the <b>clarifying</b> agent...|$|R

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate counselor intention in counseling and experimental interview. In Study 1, six samples of counseling transcripts were collected from published cases by well known counselors and analysed in terms of response mode and intention by three judges. Of nine categories of response mode, reflection (54 %) and open and closed questions (18. 8 %) were used most frequently. The judges speculated counselors' intention of <b>clarifying</b> either facts or feeling through examining trascripts of the most frequent response categories. It was found {{that about half of}} responses by reflections and questions was supposed as intended <b>clarifying</b> facts and the other half as intended <b>clarifying</b> feeling. In Study 2, a 2 (intention) × 2 (theme) factorial design was used in an experimental interview. Thirty pairs of volunteer students participated in the interview. Prior to the interview the participant interviewer was asked to <b>clarify</b> either facts or feeling during a 5 minute interview. The theme of the interview was either career planning or peer relationship. It was found that for students it was much more difficult to realize <b>clarifying</b> interviewee's feelings than <b>clarifying</b> factual events. The realization of <b>clarifying</b> feeling was easier for peer relationship than for career planning. In Study 3, practical counselors were directly compared with lay students in terms of responses to transcribed artificial interviews. Twenty-three practical counselors working at various institutions such as hot line center, child guidance center, and college and 110 undergraduates in a university participated in this study. It was found that practical counselors were likely to intend to <b>clarify</b> interviewees's feeling using reflection, whereas lay students were likely to <b>clarify</b> factual events using questions.
