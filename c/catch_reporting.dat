40|$|Over {{recent decades}} {{recreational}} fisheries have grown substantially throughout the world. Despite this increase, catches from recreational fisheries {{have often been}} ignored in fisheries management, although this is now being remedied. Monitoring recreational fisheries can be expensive, and the primary means used for monitoring is angler (creel) surveys, typically funded from sales of fishing licences. The studies presented in this thesis examine different approaches to monitoring recreational trolling fisheries’ catch and effort, where fishing licenses are not required {{and there are no}} reporting requirements. I present results from a complemented roving/mail-in survey undertaken during 2013 - 2014 to estimate recreational effort and catch of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta) in the largest lake in the European Union, Lake Vänern, Sweden. I also evaluate different angler <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> methods (mail-in, tournament reports and face-to-face interviews) and compare catch rates within and among spring and fall fishing periods. In addition, mail-in survey data are examined for recall bias.   I estimate that 28. 7 tonnes of salmon and trout combined were harvested by the recreational trolling fishery in 2014, more than the commercial and subsistence fisheries combined. Seasonal differences in both recreational effort and catch were observed. Effort, in boat hours, was significantly higher in spring than in fall. Catch rates of trout were higher in fall than in spring, but there were no seasonal differences in catches of salmon. Harvest per boat day did not differ significantly among <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> methods, indicating that all three methods could be useful for managers interested in harvest rates. In contrast, total and released catch per boat day differed among reporting methods, with tournament anglers catching more fish in total. Finally, there was little evidence for recall bias in mail-in surveys, indicating that mail-in surveys are useful for collecting unbiased catch data. My study is the most comprehensive angler survey to date for Lake Vänern, and my results should be of immediate use to local fisheries managers and should also be of interest to researchers and managers interested in estimating catch and effort for fisheries at large spatial scales. Over the past several decades recreational fisheries have grown substantially throughout the world. Until recently, however, recreational catch has been ignored in the management of many important fisheries. The studies presented in this thesis examine different approaches to monitoring recreational trolling fisheries’ catch and effort in Lake Vänern, Sweden, the largest lake in the European Union. Paper I presents results from a complemented roving/mail-in survey, designed to estimate recreational effort and catch of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (S. trutta). The results show that the recreational trolling fishery today harvests more salmon and trout annually than the commercial and subsistence fisheries combined, and that there are seasonal patterns in effort and catch. Paper II evaluates different angler <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> methods (mail-in, tournament reports, and face-to-face interviews), compares catch rates within and among spring and fall fishing periods and examines mail-in data for recall bias. Harvest per boat day did not differ significantly among <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> methods, indicating that all three could be useful for estimating harvest rates. However, tournament anglers had higher rates for released catch. Finally, there was little evidence for recall bias in mail-in surveys. In summary, this thesis has developed the framework for a recreational angler survey program for Lake Vänern, and should be of interest to researchers and managers interested in estimating catch and effort for fisheries at large spatial scales...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) assign {{property rights}} in fisheries by granting individual fishers a tradable {{share of the}} total allowable catch (TAC). ITQs were originally proposed to enhance profitability and safety, but may also provide incentives for more conservation-minded fishing practices. Indeed, recent empirical evidence shows {{a reduction in the}} likelihood of stock collapse and a threefold increase in catches two decades after ITQ implementation. Yet these spectacular catch increases follow modest 20 % reductions in reported catches. We used standard fisheries models to analyze whether these catch trends are consistent with the theory underlying conservation benefits from property rights. We find that it appears unlikely that catch increases are attributable to ITQs alone. Improved <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> systems are often enacted concurrent with ITQs and may plausibly explain sustained catch increases. The existence of this alternative explanation warrants caution about claims that property rights are the cause of sustainable catch gains...|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian fishery for Cancer pagurus {{peaked in}} the 1940 - 50 ’s with catches of 7000 to 9000 tonnes annually. After 1955 the fishery declined, the profit {{remained}} low {{and by the}} early 90 ’s the industry was heavily subsidized. A plan for the industry took action when subsidizes were cut and the landings dropped. This, together with an increasing demand, has brought profitability into the trade again.

The meeting was attended by scientists {{from many of the}} IATTC’s member countries and other interested parties (Appendix I). On the first day, the IATTC staff gave several presentations describing the stock assessment model, available data, and modeling and data assumptions (Appendix II). The remainder of the meeting focused on identifying useful data sources which could potentially be available from collaborators. The available catch data for silky sharks are incomplete, and assumptions have to be made to reconstruct the total catch. The available data differs among nations and fleets within nations, and so different assumptions have to be made.

40|$|The stalked {{barnacle}} Pollicipes pollicipes (Gmelin, 1790) is {{an important}} shellfish resource in Portugal. Due to the social-economic importance of barnacle harvesting, a management plan aimed at achieving a controlled and sustainable activity (including temporal and spatial closures, rotational harvesting, {{a limited number of}} harvesting licenses, bag and size limits for catches and <b>catch</b> <b>reporting)</b> was implemented in 2000 at the Berlengas Nature Reserve (RNB) in central Portugal. We evaluated the bag and size limits imposed by the management plan, performing observations on harvesting activity and asking licensed harvesters and RNB staff about these measures. Both inquiries and observations suggest that licensed harvesters are not following the bag and size limits imposed. Mean amounts captured in RNB varied from 14 to 24 kg per harvester/day, but 25 % of the observations corresponded to higher catches per individual than the total amount allowed (20 kg). Only half of the sampled amounts (taken in autumn 2005 and 2006) were in agreement with the size limit regulation and 50 % of the total biomass comprised individuals of maximal rostro-carinal length (RC) ␣ 25 mm. For most harvesters, size limit is the most difficult management rule to fulfil. Both harvesters and RNB staff agree that surveillance is scarce and is a major problem of this fishing activity. In order to achieve a more sustainable use of this resource, we propose the implementation of a more effective surveillance and monitoring plan, the definition of a unique landing site, the maintenance of the bag limit (20 kg) and a reduction of the size limit (50 % of total biomass comprising individuals ␣ 22 mm RC) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} and current {{dynamics of the}} three Atlantic walrus (Odobenus rosmarus rosmarus) populations that occur in Greenland are estimated using age- and sex-structured population models with exponential growth, density-regulated growth and selection-delayed dynamics. These models are integrated with data in a Bayesian framework, where {{the likelihood of the}} simulated population trajectories are evaluated from recent abundance estimates and age-structure information from a selective hunt. The overall decline in the Baffin Bay population caused by historical catches is unclear due to incomplete <b>catch</b> <b>reporting</b> prior to 1950 s. However, it is estimated that the population declined by 40 % from the 1960 s to 2005; decreased catches (≈ 140 to ≈ 70) have subsequently allowed this population to increase. The 2012 abundance estimate is 1, 400 (95 % CI: 1, 000 - 2, 000) individuals, and the annual natural growth rate in this population is now 7. 7 % (95 % CI: 6. 7 - 8. 9 %). Averaging across models, it is estimated that West Greenland/Baffin Island walruses declined by 80 % from 7, 000 (95 % CI: 5, 400 - 10, 000) in 1900 to 1, 350 (CI: 950 - 1, 950) in 1960. Hereafter they increased to 3, 100 (95 % CI: 2, 500 - 4, 400) in 1993, and owing to increased catches they have experienced a minor decline between 1994 and the early 2000 s. Annual catches where then cut from 190 to the current quota of 61, and the population is again increasing with a 2012 estimate of 3, 900 (95 % CI: 2, 500 - 5, 300) individuals. A 2012 estimate of 1, 400 (95 % CI: 700 - 3, 100) walruses in East Greenland is recovered relative to 1888; the year prior to our first historical catches by European sealers. The historical trajectory, however, is uncertain: Density regulation estimates a relatively flat trajectory, with a maximal depletion in 1890 to 80 % of the initial abundance, and a slow continuous increase to almost no current growth. A recovered population is also estimated by selection-delayed dynamics. However, this model estimates a continued increase, and a historical depletion to 2 % in 1957. These results are only partially comparable with an earlier assessment for East Greenland. Updated abundance estimates for West Greenland, and modelling with age-structured data from Baffin Bay, have greatly improved our status estimates for Baffin Bay and West Greenland/Baffin Island. </p...|$|E
