By measuring the rates of mupltiple channels, various combination of the couplings can be determined. In this talk Higgs different <b>cupling</b> measurements and their uncertainties are shown for an amount of data of 300 fb- 1, using different theoretical assumptions.

40|$|The variational Feynman {{formalism}} for the polaron, {{extended to}} an all-coupling treatment of bipolarons, is applied for two impurity atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate. This shows {{that if the}} polaronic coupling strength is large enough the impurities will form a bound state (the bipolaron). As {{a function of the}} mutual repulsion between the impurities two types of bipolaron are distinguished: a tightly bound bipolaron at weak repulsion and a dumbbell bipolaron at strong repulsion. Apart from the binding energy, also the evolution of the bipolaron radius and its effective mass are examined {{as a function of the}} strength of the repulsive interaction between the impurities and of the polaronic <b>cupling</b> strength. We then apply the strong-coupling formalism to multiple impuritiy atoms in a condensate which leads to the prediction of multi-polaron formation in the strong coupling regime. The results of the two formalisms are compared for two impurities in a condensate which results in a general qualitative agreement and a quantitative agreement at strong coupling. Typically the system of impurity atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate is expected to exhibit the polaronic weak coupling regime. However, the polaronic coupling strength is in principle tunable with a Feshbach resonance...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a new way}} to model and identify single-link flexible arms when Coulomb friction is present in the joit. In order to isolate the effects of this nonlinearity, the arm model is divided into two submodels: motor and beam. The two are <b>cupled</b> through the torque at the base of fiae beam. A systematic method is developed to obtain the dynamics of a lumped-mass flexible beam, and some properties are obtained from this model. The influence of the payload on the model is given special attention. This way of modelling is later extended to the general case of distributed-mass flexible arms. Identification in the presence of Coulomb friction is carried out. A new method is proposed to estimate this friction and to reconstruct the toolot frequency response from experimental results, which are highly distorted by this nonlinear friction.

5000|$|Another {{defining}} collaboration {{involved the}} Russian-born composer Mischa Spoliansky who {{at this time}} as living in Berlin, and whom Schiffer first met in 1925. Together {{the two of them}} devised a new form of sharply humorous musical theatre that combined elements of cabaret and of revue. Their first major production, [...] "Es liegt in der Luft" [...] ("It's in the air") was an instant hit with German audiences. It can be seen as Germany's first musical, although the term was not used in Germany at this time, and the work was generally perceived as a revue. It was a stage breakthrough in other ways, too. Margo Lion starred alongside her younger friend, not yet famous, Marlene Dietrich. One of the highlights was the duet which the two sang together [...] "Wenn die beste Freundin mit der besten Freundin".
