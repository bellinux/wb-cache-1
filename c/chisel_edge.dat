40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. "May 2006. "Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 85 - 89) Drilling {{is probably}} the most important conventional mechanical process and it is the most widely used machining operations. Prediction of cutting forces for any set of cutting parameters is essential in optimal design and manufacturing of products. It has been predicted that most of the problems associated with hole making operation, such as drilling, {{can be attributed to the}} force generated during cutting operation. In addition, prediction of force helps in design and evaluation of cutting tools and fixtures. The drilling of unidirectional carbon epoxy composite using conventional simple flute twist drill with/without the effect of <b>chisel</b> <b>edge</b> is analyzed. In this study, a series of drilling experiments are conducted on carbon fiber-reinforced composite laminates to determine quantitatively the effect of the <b>chisel</b> <b>edge</b> on the thrust force. In addition, tests are conducted to determine the effect of pre-drilling the laminate with a pilot hole. The results show a large reduction in the thrust force when a pilot hole is present which, in effect, removes the <b>chisel</b> <b>edge</b> contribution. An explicit finite element technique employing an Arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian (ALE) is used in developing a finite element simulation of a 3 Ddrilling process, one of the most complex material removal processes. In these simulations the work piece material and the air surrounding it are modeled using ALE elements. The generation of forces can be tracked using this tool. This objective of this thesis is finite element modeling of cutting forces and measuring the cutting forces generated during 3 D-drilling process and comparing the forces with the experimental results. The results on the forces are found to be comparable between the FEA and experimental values.

40|$|Workpiece damage {{generated}} during conventional drilling (CD) {{of carbon}} fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) (such as delamination, matrix cracking, fibre pull out etc.) results in reduced fatigue strength, poor assembly tolerance and compromised structural {{integrity of the}} component. Avoidance of such damage during drilling of CFRP is a challenge for the aircraft and aerospace industries. At present, it {{requires a lot of}} resources and huge cost in order to generate damage free holes in CFRP in the industries. Therefore, the industries (such as BAE Systems) are looking for alternative hole producing processes for damage free drilling. It has been reported that thrust force during drilling should be reduced in order to reduce exit delamination. Ultrasonic assisted drilling (UAD) has been found to reduce the cutting and thrust forces during drilling of metals when compared to CD. Although limited attempts employing UAD indicate a reduction in thrust and cutting forces and damage when machining CFRP, this process has not been examined in detail with respect to optimising machining parameters in relation to machining theory. In addition, there has been limited research regarding the effect of the UAD process on overall workpiece damage as a result of drilling of CFRP. The focus of this research was the identification of the mechanism responsible for thrust force reduction in UAD in comparison to CD during drilling of CFRP which would help in selecting the machining parameters resulting in minimum workpiece damage. Consequently, the cutting speeds resulting in reduced forces and damage were investigated. As a fundamental concept in machining theory, higher rake angles result in lower cutting forces and improved surface roughness. Calculations of effective normal rake angle {{at the cutting edge of}} a twist drill in UAD revealed a maximum of 62 ° and 49 ° effective rake angle at 10 and 100 m/min (40160 Hz, 7. 3 μm peak-to-peak amplitude) respectively for a new tool. Employing knowledge of the effective rake angle, experiments were performed at specific cutting speeds in order to examine the effects of UAD on forces and damage during drilling of CFRP and compared to CD. Further work employed a pilot hole to remove the contribution of <b>chisel</b> <b>edges</b> so that influence of effective rake angles at the cutting edges could be examined. Through-hole drilling tests, comparing UAD and CD, employing a constant feed rate of 0. 05 mm/rev and two cutting speeds (10 and 100 m/min) were carried out.

Optical imaging distortions were individually corrected for by imaging the apparent distortion of a glass slide surface by the removed lens. Results. Apparent epithelial thickness varied with edge position (P < 0. 001). When distortion was corrected for, epithelial indentation decreased with time after insertion (P = 0. 010), changed after a blink (P < 0. 001), and varied with position on the lens edge (P < 0. 001), with the latter being affected by midperipheral lens shape profile and edge design. Horizontal and vertical lens movement did not change with time postinsertion. Vertical motion was affected by midperipheral lens shape profile (P < 0. 001) and edge design (P < 0. 001).
