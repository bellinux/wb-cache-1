50|$|Other common {{usage of}} the black light {{pigments}} is in security features of money notes, various certificates printed on paper, meal <b>coupons,</b> <b>tickets</b> and similar things that represent a value (monetary or otherwise).

This defeats simple and inexpensive attempts to counterfeit them by scanning the original using a high resolution scanner and printing them using an inexpensive high resolution printer (most if not all inexpensive printers do not allow using black light inks for printing) and no special equipment is needed to verify the presence and correctness of this feature (an inexpensive black light source being all that is required).

The existing digital right schemes only help the issuer to issue digital rights without quantity limitation. However, issuer needs to limit the quantity of his digital rights due to marketing strategy. In this paper, we propose a flexible digital right scheme, such that the issuer can easily control circulation of each broker. Furthermore, we propose one variant based on our first scheme to make a digital right that can be flexibly divided according to owner’s demand. The variant scheme conquers the weakness of paper-based gift coupon, and makes the digital rights more flexible in redemption. Both schemes not only satisfy the confidentiality, anonymity, secure transference, preventing double spending and so on, but also expand the applications of digital rights.

40|$|This paper proposes FlexToken, a new copy {{prevention}} {{scheme for}} digital rights such as <b>tickets</b> or <b>coupons,</b> which are circulated as {{pieces of paper}} in the real world. The important feature of this scheme is that digital rights are represented using two separate types of information: the contents and the token of the rights. The token represents the "genuineness" of the contents and distinguishes the genuine digital rights from copies. A token is stored and circulated using tamper-proof devices such as smartcards while the contents can be held in any storage medium. This approach decreases the amount of memory required of the tamper-proof devices. Furthermore, circulating {{the identity of the}} right issuer and accredited information, which specifies the tamperproof devices trusted by the issuer, along with a token makes it possible to protect any type of digital right, regardless of the issuer.

50|$|This game {{is played}} {{over the course of}} five rounds. In each round, players must decide whether to travel to the land of Abundance (where 6 pieces of bread are {{produced}} each round) or the land of Famine (where 3 pieces are produced each round). At the end of each round, the bread is evenly split among all those who traveled to that particular place, and any remaining bread is discarded. For example, if 6 people travel to Abundance, they each get 1 bread; if 7 people travel there, nobody gets any bread because there is not enough to go around. Players make their decision to travel to either land by purchasing a train ticket in secret, and are given five <b>ticket</b> <b>coupons</b> {{at the start of the}} game for these transactions. Contestants are told how many people went to each town at the end of the round, but not who specifically went there. At the end of the game, everyone earns 1 garnet for every 3 pieces of bread they earned. The contestant with the most bread wins two Tokens of Life; the contestant with the least becomes a Death Match candidate. In the event of a tie for last place, the winner decides the Death Match candidate.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Passengers on the same commercial airline flight may pay very different fares. This situation has led to dissatisfaction among some passengers who believe that airline ticketing practices are unfair. To reduce their cost of flying, some passengers have tried to use "hidden-city" and "back-to-back" ticketing. Hidden-city ticketing occurs when a passenger books a flight to one city but purposely deplanes at an intermediate city. Though never intending to make {{the last leg of}} the flight, the passenger buys the ticket because it is cheaper than a ticket to the intermediate city. Back-to-back ticketing occurs when a passenger buys two round-trip tickets that include a Saturday night stay but either uses only half the <b>ticket</b> <b>coupons</b> or uses all the coupons out of sequence. This practice results in a lower price than would be possible by purchasing round-trip tickets that did not include a Saturday night stay. Most airlines expressly forbid the use of hidden-city and back-to-back ticketing. This report reviews (1) the factors that airlines consider when setting fares; (2) the factors that create hidden-city ticketing and the pricing practices that foster back-to-back ticketing practices; (3) the potential effects on airfares and service, especially to consumers in small communities, of a legislative requirement to permit hidden-city ticketing, and; (4) the potential effect on airfares and service of legislation that would allow back-to-back ticketing. GAO found that when setting fares for each market, airlines consider the amount of competition from other airlines offering similar "products. " Hidden-city opportunities may arise when a greater amount of competition exists for travel between spoke communities (i. e. destinations located "beyond" a hub airport) than on routes to and from hub communities, and where airfares in those markets reflect such competition. Back-to-back ticketing opportunities occur because airlines maximize their profits by setting higher fares for purchase by passengers who normally travel during peak times, generally during the week (business passengers), and lower fares for purchase by passengers who travel at off-peak times and stay at their destination over the weekend (leisure passengers). Passengers who would otherwise not qualify for discounted fares might be able to circumvent the airlines' Saturday night stay requirements to obtain lower fares. If legislation required airlines to permit hidden-city ticketing, airfares in some markets could increase immediately [...] especially in markets including smaller communities. If back-to-back ticketing were permitted, airlines would likely decrease the attractiveness of such fares to business travelers by increasing fares for tickets designed for leisure passengers, adding more restrictions to their use, and potentially reducing service in some markets. ...|$|R
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} iPod Touch features iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. The {{user interface}} of iOS {{is based on}} the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions {{within the context of the}} iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode). Initially shipped with iOS 6, which was released on September 19, 2012, it can play music, movies, television shows, eBooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. This feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. However, the earpods that comes with the iPod does not include a remote and mic. The Voice Control feature can also be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist. Like the iPhone 4S and later models, the fifth generation iPod Touch was the first in the iPod Touch line-up to include Siri, that allows the user to operate the device by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics. Typing can be aided by the voice assistant, which converts speech to text, and also supports iMessage, a specialised instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple devices running iOS 5 or later. Some newer applications and features that came with iOS 6 included Apple Maps, Passbook and screen mirroring. Apple Maps which replaced the former map application (powered by Google Maps) lacks many features present in competing maps apps and is also known to give wrong directions to users which still not fixed after the iOS 7 updates. The new Apple Maps app uses Apple's new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic. The new Passbook app is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission <b>tickets,</b> <b>coupons</b> and loyalty cards. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. AirPlay was made available, which allows screen mirroring through an Apple TV or other supported external device allows the screen of the iPod Touch to be mirrored, and was the first generation of the iPod Touch to support it.|$|R
