25|$|To {{determine}} whether one must debit or credit a specific account we use either the accounting equation approach {{which consists of}} five accounting rules or the traditional approach based on three rules (for Real accounts, Personal accounts, and Nominal accounts) to {{determine whether}} to debit or to <b>credit</b> <b>an</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The scammer {{contacts}} {{the victim}} to interest {{them in a}} [...] "work-at-home" [...] opportunity, or asks them to cash a check or money order that for some reason cannot be redeemed locally. In one cover story, the perpetrator of the scam wishes the victim {{to work as a}} [...] "mystery shopper", evaluating the service provided by MoneyGram or Western Union locations within major retailers such as Wal-Mart. The scammer sends the victim a forged or stolen check or money order as described above, the victim deposits it—banks will often <b>credit</b> <b>an</b> <b>account</b> with the value of a check not obviously false— and sends the money to the scammer via wire transfer. Later the check is not honoured and the bank debits the victim's account. Schemes based solely on check cashing usually offer {{only a small part of}} the check's total amount, with the assurance that many more checks will follow; if the victim buys into the scam and cashes all the checks, the scammer can steal a lot in a very short time.|$|E
25|$|Bank {{statements}} are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting {{standards of the}} world. Under GAAP {{there are two kinds}} of accounts: debit and credit.

Law regarding three part relationships: By using Göranson’s theory {{you can say that}} the <b>credit</b> balance on <b>an</b> <b>account</b> may be object of possession. The holder of the account has independent and direct possession. By using the principle condictio indebiti, the holder of the <b>account</b> (<b>A)</b> can become owner of means despite that the person who did the deposit (B) did not intend to make the deposit to that specific <b>account</b> (<b>A’s</b> <b>account).</b> Criminal law: The authors of the doctrine consider that the concept of the Swedish word ”besittning” is intended for physical objects and therefore the <b>credit</b> balance of <b>an</b> <b>account</b> may not be object of possession. According to the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal may the surveillance over <b>an</b> <b>account</b> be place on level with possession. When the <b>credit</b> balance of <b>an</b> <b>account</b> may be deemed as object of possession, then the means of the account can be object of embezzlement and unlawful disposal...|$|R
50|$|A balance {{transfer}} is {{the transfer of}} (part of) the balance (either money or <b>credit)</b> in <b>an</b> <b>account</b> to another account, often held at another institution. It is most commonly used when describing <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> card {{balance transfer}}.|$|R

50|$|A CICS {{transaction}} {{is a set}} {{of operations}} that perform a task together. Usually, the majority of transactions are relatively simple tasks such as requesting an inventory list or entering <b>a</b> debit or <b>credit</b> to <b>an</b> <b>account.</b> <b>A</b> primary characteristic of a transaction is that it should be atomic.

They {{are not part}} of the double-entry system, but may be expanded by the computer as a debit to one <b>account</b> and <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> to another <b>account.</b> For example, <b>a</b> cash receipts transaction may cause a debit (increase) to <b>a</b> cash <b>account</b> and <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> (decrease) to <b>an</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable account.|$|R
50|$|A bank counts <b>a</b> nostro <b>account</b> with <b>a</b> {{debit balance}} as a cash asset in its balance sheet. Conversely, <b>a</b> vostro <b>account</b> with <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> balance (i.e. <b>a</b> deposit) is a liability, and a vostro with a debit balance (a loan) is an asset.

The actual bank account number, including the bank's routing transit number, are masked by the UPIC. Only <b>credit</b> transactions to <b>an</b> <b>account</b> can be initiated with a UPIC. All direct debits are blocked, which should mitigate unauthorized transactions to <b>an</b> <b>account.</b>|$|R

40|$|Drawing on the {{endogenous}} {{character of}} money and <b>credit</b> supply, <b>an</b> <b>accounting</b> model of three fundamental drivers of fragility (sudden stops) in a non-depository financial sector is here presented. Essentially, financial firms adopt a scheme of idiosyncratic liquidity risk management (ILRM) : depository institutions (traditional banks) opt for an originate-to-hold approach; non-depository entities (shadow banks) for an originate-to- distribute approach. Building on <b>a</b> sequential <b>accounting</b> model of asset- backed securities (ABSs) distribution, three fragility drivers are singled out: excess issuance of collateralized debt; poor liquidity transformation; collateralized-debt rollover frequency excessive relative to issued ABSs liquidity. Policy implications are eventually sketched out...|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] in {{the debit}} column denotes the {{increasing}} {{effect of a}} transaction on the asset account balance (total debits less total <b>credits),</b> because <b>a</b> debit to <b>an</b> asset <b>account</b> is <b>an</b> increase. The asset account above {{has been added to}} by a debit value X, i.e. the balance has increased by £X or $X. Likewise, in the liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total debits), because <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> to <b>a</b> liability <b>account</b> is <b>an</b> increase.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} between the total debits and total <b>credits</b> in <b>a</b> single <b>account</b> is the account's balance. If debits exceed <b>credits,</b> the <b>account</b> has <b>a</b> debit balance; if credits exceed debits, the <b>account</b> has <b>a</b> <b>credit</b> balance.

50|$|There {{are a few}} {{distinct}} {{advantages of}} having a bank as a DP. Having <b>a</b> Demat <b>account</b> with <b>a</b> bank DP, usually provides quick processing, accessibility, convenience, and online transaction capability to the investor. Generally, banks credit the Demat account with shares in case of purchase, or <b>credit</b> <b>a</b> savings <b>account</b> with the proceeds of a sale, on the third day. Banks are also advantageous {{because of the number}} of branches they have. Some banks give the option of opening <b>a</b> demat <b>account</b> in any branch, while others restrict themselves to a select set of branches. Some private banks also provide online access to the demat account. Hence, the investors can conveniently check online details of their holdings, transactions and status of requests through their bank's net-banking facility. A broker who acts as a DP may not be able to provide these services.|$|R
