5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about when {{money has been}} left for a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose).</b> In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

500|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{applies to}} {{two types of}} situations: subsequent failures and initial failures. Subsequent failures are where money has already been applied to a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose,</b> and that purpose has failed. It does not allow the next of kin of the original donor to recover any money, as said in Re Wright: [...] "Once money has been effectually dedicated to charity, whether in pursuance of a general or a particular charitable intent, the testator's next of kin or residuary legatees are forever excluded". The courts instead simply {{determine whether or not}} the reason for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.|$|E

500|$|As such, simply {{giving the}} {{trustees}} this power {{was not enough}} to defeat uncertainties. If, however, the testator [...] "had sufficiently defined" [...] the way in which trustees should exercise their judgement, it would be valid. The final device is to give the trustees the power to give trust property to [...] "anyone in the world" [...] or to [...] "anyone whom the trustees consider appropriate". This has two problems; firstly, the class could be too broad to be administratively workable, and second, the courts are unable to judge if the power has been exercised appropriately. However, in Re Hay's Settlement Trust, Megarry V-C held that, exercised properly, this sort of agreement could be administratively workable, and would not be immediately void. But if the gift were given to a wide class of people for a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose,</b> it will be valid.|$|E
500|$|In July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his {{opponent}} Hillary Clinton released a campaign video {{of one of}} the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with the Trump Organization, where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to pay the bill, Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The Clinton campaign used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses. Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, The Washington Post reported that a [...] painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose,</b> or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase.|$|E
500|$|The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") took {{public action}} in 2005. [...] In mid year, it {{released}} two private letter rulings, {{each of which}} described an organization that was conducting operations {{in a manner similar}} to the Nehemiah Program. [...] Each ruling found that (i) the organization's operations did not exclusively serve a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> but, instead, served to promote [...] "the private interests of home sellers and other private parties" [...] and, consequently, (ii) the payments made by home sellers to the organization would not qualify as [...] "charitable contributions" [...] for which the seller could claim a tax deduction. [...] And in November 2005, the Department of Justice filed suit in Chicago on behalf of the IRS, seeking an injunction against an Illinois-based seller-funded down-payment program. [...] The injunction sought to bar that program from [...] "falsely advising" [...] home sellers that they could claim their payments to the program as charitable-contribution tax deductions. [...] The IRS made its findings applicable to all seller-funded down-payment assistance programs when it issued a revenue ruling in May 2006. [...] That ruling, Revenue Ruling 2006–27, contrasted the tax treatment of seller-funded programs with the treatment accorded to other types of down-payment assistance. [...] Seller-funded programs, the ruling stated, were [...] "not operated exclusively for charitable purposes". [...] Furthermore, payments made by the seller to the organizations were to be treated not as charitable contributions, but either as rebates to the home buyer or as reductions in the sales price of the home. [...] Shortly after the revenue ruling was issued, Nehemiah published an open letter from its president, in which it noted its opposition to the ruling but added that the ruling did not prevent the Nehemiah Program from continuing its operations. The letter did note, however, that Nehemiah might have to pay [...] "appropriate business taxes on the revenue generated by its downpayment assistance program".|$|E

2500|$|Objects. The {{beneficiaries}} of the trust must be clearly identified, or at least be ascertainable (Re Hain's Settlement).

The Act states that if a petition signed by a minimum number of students (the threshold cannot exceed 5%) is lodged then a referendum must be held on whether or not to end one of the union's affiliations. [...] Money donated to a students' union is subject to ultra vires law and can only be spent to further this <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose.</b> A major source of funding for most unions are 'block grant' donations given by their colleges or universities.

2500|$|In {{its essence}} the word [...] "trust" [...] applies to any {{situation}} where one person holds property {{on behalf of}} another, and the law recognises obligations to use the property for the other's benefit. The primary situation in which a trust is formed is through the express intentions {{of a person who}} [...] "settles" [...] property. The [...] "settlor" [...] will give property to someone he trusts (a [...] "trustee") to use it for someone he cares about (a [...] "beneficiary"). The law's basic requirement is that a trust was truly [...] "intended", and that a gift, bailment or agency relationship was not. In addition to requiring certainty about the settlor's intention, the courts suggest the terms of the trust should be sufficiently certain particularly regarding the property and who is to benefit. The courts also have a rule that a trust must ultimately be for people, and not for a purpose, so that if all beneficiaries are in agreement and of full age they may decide how to use the property themselves. The historical trend of construction of trusts is {{to find a way to}} enforce them. If, however, the trust is construed as being for a <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose,</b> then public policy is to ensure it is always enforced. Charitable trusts are one of a number of specific trust types, which are regulated by the Charities Act 2006. Very detailed rules also exist for pension trusts, for instance under the Pensions Act 1995, particularly to set out the legal duties of pension trustees, and to require a minimum level of funding.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), under {{contract}} with the US Department of Commerce, assigned the Internet Users Society-Niue (IUS-N), a private nonprofit, as manager of the [...]nu top-level domain on the Internet. IUS-N's <b>charitable</b> <b>purpose</b> was – {{and continues to be}} – to use revenue from the registration of [...]nu domain names to fund low-cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue. In a letter to ICANN in 2007, IUS-N's independent auditors reported IUS-N had invested US$3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from [...]nu domain name registration revenue during that period. In 1999, IUS-N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognised that IUS-N managed the [...]nu ccTLD under IANA's authority and IUS-N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue's private citizens. A newly elected government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name, including a requirement for IUS-N to make direct payments of compensation to the Government. In 2005, a Government-appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report, which found no merit in the government's claims; the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007. Starting in 2003, IUS-N began installing WiFi connections throughout the capital village of Alofi and in several nearby villages and schools, and has been expanding WiFi coverage into the outer villages since then, making Niue the first WiFi Nation. To assure security for Government departments, IUS-N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS-N's satellite Internet link, at no cost.|$|E
