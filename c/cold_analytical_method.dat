The {{world is}} again experiencing a new period of change today. The cold war has {{ended and the}} strategic environment is changing to reflect those developments. The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the changes in naval mission types after the end of the <b>cold</b> war. An <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> has been used in the study; the developments in the naval strategic environnment will be described in a detailed way. Then the study will try to analyse those developments and try to explain how the naval power missions will be redefined according the new factors. The naval strategic environment is becoming littoral and also more prone to conflictual situations as more states try to seek their national interests, once they are free from the binding conditions of the old bi-polar strategic environment. Some naval missions that were the needs of the global scale confrontation of the cold war will not be of the same importance in this new period. Instead the mission types that can be described as regional and coastal will be more used by the navies of the world reflecting the rise of littorality in the new period. Altınyay, ÖzgürM. S...|$|R
40|$|Anthocyanins are {{secondary}} plant metabolites {{ubiquitous in}} the plant kingdom. They have different biological activities, so monitoring their content in plant tissue or in feed/food derived from plants {{may be an important}} task in different projects from various fields of molecular biology and biotechnology. Profiling of secondary metabolites with high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) systems is time-consuming, especially when many samples have to be checked within a defined time frame with a reasonable number of repetitions according to the metabolomic standards. Even application of the advanced ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) /MS or equivalent systems would require a long time for analysis of numerous samples. We demonstrate the applicability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for the assessment of level (concentration) of anthocyanins in leaf tissues of four Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes grown at normal (20 degrees C/ 16 degrees C day/night) and decreased (4 degrees C) temperature. The quantitative results were obtained for anthocyanins with MALDI-TOF MS using ferulic acid as a matrix. The amounts of anthocyanins in leaves of A. thaliana varied from 0. 3 - 2. 5 mu g per gram of leaves for ecotypes Col- 0 and C 24, respectively, and contents of these markedly increased in plants grown in the <b>cold.</b> The applied <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> exhibited better repeatability of measurements than obtained with an HPLC/ion trap MS system...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the ICH Q 8 document concerning the development of pharmaceutical processes following a Quality by Design (QbD) approach, there have been many discussions on the opportunity for <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> developments to follow a similar approach. A key component of the QbD paradigm is the definition of the Design Space of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> where assurance of quality is provided. Several Design Spaces for <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> have been published, stressing the importance of this concept. This paper aims at explaining what is an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> Design Space, why it is useful for the robust development and optimization of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> and how to build such a Design Space. A strong emphasis is made by distinguishing the usual mean response surface approach, overlapping mean response surfaces and the desirability function one to other probabilistic approaches as only these last ones correctly define a Design Space. In addition, recent publications assessing the Design Space of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> are reviewed and discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|<b>Analytical</b> <b>method</b> {{validation}} is {{a mandatory}} step {{to evaluate the}} ability of developed methods to provide accurate results for their routine application in order to trust the critical decisions that will be made with them. Even if several guidelines exist to help perform <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validations (ICH Q 2 R 1 [1], USP [2], …) {{there is still the}} need to clarify the meaning and interpretation of <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation criteria and methodology. Indeed, actually method validation is mostly realised as the traditional check list implementation of e. g. the ICH Q 2 R 1 or USP method validation requirements. However, within the trend of Quality by Design [3], there is the need to switch from this traditional vision to an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation really adding value and providing a high level of assurance of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> results reliability. Yet, different interpretations can be made of the validation guidelines {{as well as for the}} definitions of the validation criteria. This will lead to diverse experimental designs implemented to try fulfilling these criteria. Finally, different decision methodologies can also be interpreted from these guidelines. Therefore, the risk that a validated <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> may be unfit for its future purpose will depend on a personal interpretation of these guidelines. The objective of this presentation is thus to show that <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation should be planned and performed by first starting with the end in mind: what is the objective of the <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> under study? In such a way <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> validation is coherent with the actual Quality by Design regulatory expectations. The risk of having validated an <b>analytical</b> <b>method</b> unfit for its purpose is strongly reduced as well as the risk of generating Out of Specification (OOS) results due to an unfit method.

40|$|Analytical results {{harmonisation}} is {{investigated in}} this study to provide {{an alternative to the}} restrictive approach of <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> harmonisation which is recommended nowadays for making possible the exchange of information and then for supporting the fight against illicit drugs trafficking. Indeed, the main goal {{of this study is to}} demonstrate that a common database can be fed by a range of different <b>analytical</b> <b>methods,</b> whatever the differences in levels of analytical parameters between these latter ones. For this purpose, a methodology making possible the estimation and even the optimisation of results similarity coming from different <b>analytical</b> <b>methods</b> was then developed.
