40|$|AbstractBackground: The <b>Cut</b> 1 and <b>Cut</b> 2 {{proteins}} of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe form {{a complex}} and are required for the separation of sister chromatids during anaphase. Polyubiquitinated <b>Cut</b> 2 degrades {{at the onset of}} anaphase and this degradation, like that of mitotic cyclin, is dependent on the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. Expression of <b>Cut</b> 2 that cannot be degraded blocks sister chromatid separation and anaphase spindle elongation. Here, we have investigated the role of the <b>Cut</b> 1 –Cut 2 interaction in sister chromatid separation. Results: The carboxyl terminus of <b>Cut</b> 2 interacts with the amino terminus of <b>Cut</b> 1, and temperature-sensitive <b>cut</b> 2 mutants expressed <b>Cut</b> 2 proteins that contain substitutions in the carboxyl terminus and fail to interact with <b>Cut</b> 1, resulting in aberrant anaphase. Localization of <b>Cut</b> 1 alters dramatically during the cell cycle. <b>Cut</b> 1 is retained in the cytoplasm during interphase and moves to the mitotic spindle pole bodies and the spindle upon entry into prophase, when spindles are formed. The association between <b>Cut</b> 2 and <b>Cut</b> 1 is needed for the localization of <b>Cut</b> 1 to the spindles, as <b>Cut</b> 1 remains unbound to the spindle if complex formation is impaired. <b>Cut</b> 2 degrades during anaphase, but <b>Cut</b> 1 remains bound to the anaphase spindle. This association with the anaphase spindle requires the conserved carboxyl terminus of <b>Cut</b> 1. Conclusions: Complex formation between <b>Cut</b> 1 and <b>Cut</b> 2 is needed for the onset of normal anaphase. <b>Cut</b> 2 is required for loading <b>Cut</b> 1 onto the spindle at prophase and <b>Cut</b> 2 proteolysis is needed for the active participation of <b>Cut</b> 1 in sister chromatid separation...|$|R

While pursuing David Home, Laird of Wedderburn and George Home, he was forced to retreat to Dunbar, but his horse got stuck in a marsh (which was for many years after called 'Batty's Bog'). George Home lopped off the White Knight's head and, it was said, threaded the diplomat's hair to his saddle cloth, then rode to Duns and set this trophy on a pole in the centre of the village. The chronicler Lindsay of Pitscottie writing in the 1570s tells the story;"fearing ane conspiracie, he spurred his hors, and fled towardis the castle of Dunbar; thinking to have wone away, because he was weill horsed.

It seems interesting to optimize for a function that considers all edges in the <b>cut.</b> In this lecture, we will look at a method that computes <b>cuts</b> where the sum of the edge weights is minimal. Minimal graph <b>cuts</b> Consider a graph G = (V,E), where we have selected two vertices s, t ∈ V. A <b>cut</b> on G is an s − t <b>cut</b> if it separates s from t. We want to find an s − t <b>cut</b> C that minimizes∑ e∈C w(e).
