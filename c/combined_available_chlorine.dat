5000|$|The {{presence}} of chlorine in traditional swimming pools {{can be described}} as a combination of free available chlorine (FAC) and <b>combined</b> <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> (CAC). While FAC is composed of the free chlorine that is available for sanitizing the water, the CAC includes chloramines, which are formed by the reaction of FAC with amines (introduced into the pool by human perspiration, saliva, mucus, urine, and other biologics). [...] Chloramines are responsible for the [...] "chlorine smell" [...] of pools, as well as skin and eye irritation. These problems are the result of insufficient levels of free available chlorine, and indicate a pool that must be [...] "shocked" [...] by the addition of 5-10 times the normal amount of chlorine. [...] In saltwater pools, the generator uses electrolysis to continuously produce free chlorine. It also burns off chloramines {{in the same manner as}} traditional shock (oxidizer). As with traditionally chlorinated pools, saltwater pools must be monitored in order to maintain proper water chemistry. Low chlorine levels can be caused by insufficient salt, incorrect (low) chlorine-generation setting on the SWG unit, higher-than-normal chlorine demand, low stabilizer, sun exposure, or mechanical issues with the chlorine generator. Salt count can be lowered due to splash-out, backwashing, and dilution via rainwater.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Sodium {{hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) is {{an important}} tool in root canal disinfection although {{it is well known}} that the shelf-life of NaOCl is limited. In this study, NaOCl solutions that were collected from dental practices and were intended for endodontic irrigation were investigated to see whether they contained the expected concentration of free <b>available</b> <b>chlorine.</b> Method and Materials: NaOCl solutions were collected from dental practices. The concentration of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> per sample was determined with iodometric titration and the pH was measured. Each participating dentist completed a questionnaire that requested data on a range of issues relating to the assumed concentration of NaOCl and handling of the sample. Results: Eighty-four samples with questionnaires were received. NaOCl was purchased from supermarkets and drugstores (36 %), dental suppliers (48 %), or pharmacies (16 %). The median expected concentration was 2 % (n = 36). On average, 27 % less <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> was measured than the dentist assumed was in the sample (P <. 001). Fifteen percent of samples contained less than 1 % <b>available</b> <b>chlorine,</b> which is needed for tissue dissolution and disinfection. The average pH was 11. 5. Conclusion: The greatest differences in concentrations were found in NaOCl sourced from supermarkets or drugstores. Future studies should elucidate the cause of this discrepancy.

The organisms selected for study were Escherichia coli (LacZ 545), Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 23355), and the amphipod Hyalella azteca. E. coli was shown to bind tightly (1. 6 X 10 (4) CFU per amphipod) to this macroinvertebrate and to resist repeated attempts to wash it off. E. cloacae was shown to bind much less tightly (1. 4 X 10 (3) CFU per amphipod) to H. azteca and was less resistant to removal by washing. The extent of association {{is a function of}} macroinvertebrate size (surface area), but the procedure produces repeatable results usable for controlled experimentation.

40|$|Background; Chlorinated lime {{solution}} (Eusol) {{and water}} treating agent (WaterGuard®) {{are widely used}} in hospitals and in homes as antiseptics and water disinfectants respectively. These preparations contain calcium hypochlorite (Eusol) and sodium hypochlorite (Water Guard®) respectively, as the base of biocide activities against various types of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and some spp of protozoa. The lethal action on the microorganisms is due to chlorination of cell proteins or enzymes by unionized hypochlorous acid. The main problem with these products is their instability in their solution form where they tend to decompose slowly (especially in acidic medium) liberating chlorine when stored {{for a long period}} of time. The decomposition and release of chlorine in these preparations is pH dependent whereby it is favored by acidic medium and unfavored in alkaline medium. Eusol and WaterGuard® as antiseptics and disinfectants respectively, are largely prepared locally in hospital pharmacies and pharmaceutical industries. A survey of products from industries shows that they have long shelf-life indicated on their packages. Due to instability of these compounds the content of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> is doubtful. The aim of this study was to carry out chemical analysis and antimicrobial efficacy of these chlorine-based disinfectants Study designs; The study was a prospective study. Materials and methodology; Fourteen (14) samples of Eusol and five (5) samples of WaterGuard® were collected randomly from different pharmacies. The chemical analysis of these products was carried out by titrimetric method (iodometric titration) to obtain the content of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the sample according to British Pharmacopoeia (BP) 2004. The results of the <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> in WaterGuard® were compared with that indicated on the label in order to assess whether there was a decrease or the exact amount of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the sample. For Eusol, the percentage <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the sample was compared with the B. P specification. The antimicrobial activity was tested by ditch-plate technique using standard microorganisms namely; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli whereby the zones of inhibition were determined and compared with the zone of inhibition of the control sample. Results: All fourteen samples of chlorinated lime solution upon chemical assay; did not comply with specifications (BP 2004). However all five samples of sodium hypochlorite solution (WaterGuard®) complied with specifications (content within 90 - 110 % label claim). When tested for antimicrobial efficacy; all fourteen samples of chlorinated lime solution (Eusol) had low antimicrobial activity. All samples of WaterGuard® showed no antimicrobial activity upon dilution as recommended by manufacturer. Conclusion. This study has shown that; chlorinated lime solution (Eusol) and sodium hypochlorite solution (WaterGuard) are not stable, as they decompose when kept for a long time and consequently lead to reduction of the content of <b>available</b> <b>chlorine</b> which is important for antimicrobial activity.
