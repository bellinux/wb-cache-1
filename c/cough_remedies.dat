A systematic review {{to assess the}} effectiveness and tolerability of ivy for acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs). Methods. We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled clinical trials and observational studies evaluating the efficacy of ivy preparations for acute URTIs. Study quality was assessed by the Jadad score or the EPHPP tool. Results. 10 eligible studies were identified reporting on 17463 subjects. Studies were heterogeneous in design and conduct; 2 were RCTs. Three studies evaluated a combination of ivy and thyme, 7 studies investigated monopreparations of ivy. Only one RCT (= 360) investigating an ivy/thyme combination used a placebo control and showed statistically significant superiority in reducing the frequency and duration of cough. All other studies lack a placebo control and show serious methodological flaws. They all conclude that ivy extracts are effective for reducing symptoms of URTI. Conclusion. Although all studies report that ivy extracts are effective to reduce symptoms of URTI, there is no convincing evidence due to serious methodological flaws and lack of placebo controls.

40|$|Herbal {{formulations}} being {{widely accepted}} therapeutic agents as antidiabetics, antiarthritics, hepatoprotectives, <b>cough</b> <b>remedies,</b> memory enhancers, and adaptogens. The commonest myth regarding herbal medicines {{is that these}} medicines are completely safe, and can therefore be safely consumed by the patient on his/her own, without a physician's prescription. This belief has led to large-scale self-medication by {{people all over the}} world, often leading to disappointing end-results, side-effects, or unwanted after-effects. There is an increasing awareness at several levels of the need to develop pharmacovigilance practices for herbal medicines. The current model of pharmacovigilance and its associated tools have been developed in relation to synthetic drugs, and applying these methods to monitoring the safety of herbal medicines presents unique challenges in addition to those described for conventional medicines. Several problems relate {{to the ways in which}} herbal medicines are named, perceived, sourced, and utilized. This may be because of differences in the use of nonorthodox drugs (e. g., herbal remedies) which may pose special toxicological problems, when used alone or in combination with other drugs. The purpose of pharmacovigilance is to detect, assess, and understand, and to prevent the adverse effects or any other possible drug-related problems, related to herbal, traditional, and complementary medicines...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{electronic}} {{medical record}} (EMR) contains {{a rich source of}} information that could be harnessed for epidemic surveillance. We asked if structured EMR data could be coupled with computerized processing of free-text clinical entries to enhance detection of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Methodology: A manual review of EMR records related to 15, 377 outpatient visits uncovered 280 reference cases of ARI. We used logistic regression with backward elimination to determine which among candidate structured EMR parameters (diagnostic codes, vital signs and orders for tests, imaging and medications) contributed to the detection of those reference cases. We also developed a computerized free-text search to identify clinical notes documenting at least two non-negated ARI symptoms. We then used heuristics to build case-detection algorithms that best combined the retained structured EMR parameters with the results of the text analysis. Principal Findings: An adjusted grouping of diagnostic codes identified reference ARI patients with a sensitivity of 79 %, a specificity of 96 % and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 32 %. Of the 21 additional structured clinical parameters considered, two contributed significantly to ARI detection: new prescriptions for <b>cough</b> <b>remedies</b> and elevations in body temperature to at least 38 uC. Together with the diagnostic codes, these parameters increased detection sensitivity to 87 %, but specificity and PPV declined to 95 % and 25 %, respectively.

40|$|Background: Irrational {{prescribing}} {{of drugs}} is of common occurrence in clinical practice. Rational drug prescribing {{is defined as}} "the use of the least number of drugs to obtain the best possible effects in the shortest period and at a reasonable cost". The present {{study was designed to}} evaluate the practice of rational prescription in patients (cases) admitted in various wards of G. S. V. M. Medical College and associated hospitals at Kanpur. Methods: This study was carried out on patients admitted in different wards. For the study of drug prescribing patterns, each prescribed drug was counted only once for a patient, irrespective of change in dose and route of administration. WHO guidelines were taken into consideration. Both distribution of type of drug as well as drug category were evaluated in different departments thereafter. The characteristics chosen on each prescription provided the incidence of poly pharmacy and frequencies of prescribing of individual drug were analyzed. The data obtained were subsequently categorized systematically and analyzed by taking WHO guidelines into consideration. Results: The most commonly prescribed drugs were vitamins and tonics (57. 5 %) followed by anti-microbial agents (12. 7 %), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (10. 5 %), anti-hypertensive (5. 2 %), anti <b>cough</b> <b>remedies</b> and acid peptic disease drugs.
