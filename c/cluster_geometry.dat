With respect to Figure 11, the equatorial Fe(1) atom is on the left, Fe(2) {{is in the middle}} and Fe(3) is on the right. Crystallographic data showed that the average M-L bond lengths for Fe(2) and Fe(3) ions to their respective cyanide ligands at 30 K were 1.94 Å and 1.95 Å and 1.96 Å and 1.96 Å at 110 K, respectively,.

The Fe(1) was significantly higher at 2.11 Å suggesting significant HS FeII character even though typical values reported for HS FeII sites are slightly higher. Typically, bond lengths determined by X-ray crystallography show a small decrease at increasing temperatures due to an increase in the amplitude of atom vibrations, which is the case seen here above 110 K for the average Co-N bond lengths (1.90 Å at 200 K and 1.89 Å at 298 K for the top axial CoIII ion and 1.88 Å at 200 K and 1.84 Å at 298 K for the bottom axial CoIII ion, Figure 11). This however, is not the case for the Fe-N bonds which show a systematic increase. At room temperature, 298 K, the average bond lengths for Fe(1) at 2.17 Å [...] and Fe(3) at 2.15 Å, are typical for HS FeII.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} mobile ad-hoc indoor networks {{consisting of}} simple inexpensive robots, LANdroids, with limited wireless communication range {{and without any}} range or location sensors. We focus {{on the problem of}} using the mobile LANdroids to take responsibility for maintaining connectivity between a static Gateway and mobile Targets that move beyond the communication range of an established network. We refer to such a tracking task as Target Tethering. This type of network commonly uses IEEE 802. 11 wireless protocols for communication, with Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a measure of radio signal strength. RSSI data is noisy and poorly relates to distance in indoor environments, leading to a challenging Target Tethering task. Some algorithms use the trace of single-source RSSI data to infer distance between two nodes and use it to compute a Target Tethering policy. However, such distance estimates are poor. We instead aim at inferring physical network layout from RSSI data among multiple nodes. We introduce a novel approach based on <b>Cluster</b> <b>Geometries,</b> classes of network nodes corresponding to rotationinvariant physical layouts of LANdroids and a mobile Target, with the conjecture that multi-robot RSSI data can distinguish the <b>Cluster</b> <b>Geometries</b> and therefore the physical layouts. We proceed with extensive experiments and support our conjecture by showing successful classification of the designed <b>Cluster</b> <b>Geometries</b> given the multi-robot RSSI-based data. We then combine the estimated Geometries with motion patterns of the moving Targets to show that suitable multi-robot Target Tethering policies for unknown indoor environments can be learned using multi-agent reinforcement-learning. Specifically, we use an interesting variation of Q-learning where we first learn offline base policies in general open environments and later specialize the policies seamlessly during online execution to account for obstacles in the indoor environment.

The authors have studied silica clusters before, using global optimisation and a simple potential that had been reparameterised to get closer agreement with Density Functional Theory calculations [1, 2]. This presentation focuses on a study of a special class of cluster geometries: fully-coordinated silica <b>clusters,</b> i. e. <b>geometries</b> where each silicon atom is chemically bonded to four oxygen atoms and each oxygen atom is bonded to two silicon atoms.
