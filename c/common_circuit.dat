40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} effects of {{conducted}} and radiated EMI due to improperly designed circuits or printed circuit board (PCB) layouts. <b>Common</b> <b>circuits</b> used {{in a wide range}} of electronic devices are evaluated using both good and poor design techniques. Additional evaluations are performed to measure {{the effects of}} EMI on cabling used for digital communication or RF purposes. Finally, a consumer product is evaluated which must pass regulatory agency requirements in order to be sold in the consumer market. Potential solutions to common EMI problems are then implemented and discussed. This work will look at individual circuits and evaluate design flaws that contribute the largest amount of radiated emissions. Avoiding poor circuit designs and PCB layout mistakes reduces the amount of radiated emissions from any product. This work discusses the theory of electromagnetics and how it pertains to EMI events, then addresses the practical problems associated with EMI using <b>common</b> <b>circuits</b> to illustrate EMI effects. It is important to understand why EMI related effects are becoming more critical, and to show why EMI problems should be corrected within the design phase. ...|$|R

50|$|Because {{of their}} high {{frequency}} capability, Gunn diodes are mainly used at microwave frequencies and above. They can produce {{some of the highest}} output power of any semiconductor devices at these frequencies. Their most common use is in oscillators, but they are also used in microwave amplifiers to amplify signals. Because the diode is a one-port (two terminal) device, an amplifier circuit must separate the outgoing amplified signal from the incoming input signal to prevent coupling. One <b>common</b> <b>circuit</b> is a reflection amplifier which uses a circulator to separate the signals. A bias tee is needed to isolate the bias current from the high frequency oscillations.|$|E
