5|$|In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream {{was a major}} {{commercial}} success. The {{strong influence}} of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between alternative rock {{and the type of}} rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 1961, {{the second}} prototype, XP836, {{performed}} its first take off conventionally. Continuing {{tests of the}} two prototypes proceeded to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between vertical take off and flight, a feat which was achieved on 8 September 1961. During September, the feat was repeated multiple times by both prototypes, transitioning from vertical to horizontal flight and vice versa, including instances in which the auto-stabiliser was intentionally disabled.|$|E
5|$|The result meant Montoya {{moved up}} into fifth {{place in the}} Drivers' Championship, 83 points behind leader Michael Schumacher who {{clinched}} the title two races beforehand. Barrichello's third position finish allowed him to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to David Coulthard. Williams' strong finish meant the gap between themselves and McLaren was reduced to eight points with two races remaining in the season.|$|E

40|$|This {{report shows}} that {{although}} there has been some improvement in education and health outcomes for Indigenous Australians, most <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets are not on track to be met. Abstract This is <b>the</b> seventh <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> Report produced since targets were set by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in 2008. The report shows that {{although there has}} been some improvement in education and health outcomes for Indigenous Australians, most <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets are not on track to be met. The Government is continuing to focus on reform of Indigenous affairs and the positive impact that this will have on <b>the</b> <b>Closing</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gap</b> targets. There is a strong emphasis on practical actions to get kids to school, adults into work, make communities safer and advancing constitutional recognition...|$|R

5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts {{remain to be}} {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b> There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Because the big {{gap between}} the ROK Capital and ROK 8th Divisions made it {{impossible}} for ROK I Corps at Kyongju to direct the action of the 8th Division, the ROK Army transferred that division to the control of the ROK II Corps on September 7, and attached to it the ROK 5th Regiment of the ROK 7th Division. This shift of command came just as the NK 15th Division penetrated the ROK 8th Division lines to enter Yongch'on in the Taegu-P'ohang-dong corridor. From west of An'gang-ni the ROK 3rd Regiment drove toward Yongch'on, attempting to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coulthard {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher who began from pole position. Barrichello began from {{third on the}} grid and overtook Coulthard going into the first corner. Michael Schumacher maintained his start line advantage and kept the lead {{after the first round}} of pit stops. During the course of the second stint of the race, Michael Schumacher began to struggle with tyre wear, allowing Coulthard to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> and passed him on lap 40. Coulthard maintained his lead through the second round of pit stops and won the race. Michael Schumacher retired on lap 59 with an engine failure promoting Häkkinen into second position.

Michael Schumacher attempted to defend his lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first corner, with Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to pass him to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E

5|$|The 2001 Gator Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 1, 2001 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Early on, Virginia Tech took {{advantage}} of Clemson mistakes to build a first-quarter lead. On the game's first possession, the Tech defense forced a Clemson punt. Clemson mishandled the kick, and Tech was able to recover the ball at the Clemson 23-yard line. One play later, Tech was on the board with a touchdown pass from quarterback Michael Vick. By {{the end of the}} first quarter, Tech had taken a 14–0 lead. Clemson was able to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to 14–10 in the second quarter, but Tech added another touchdown before halftime to take a 21–10 lead into the second half.|$|E
5|$|The game {{began at}} 12:00PM EST. Connecticut, led by running back Donald Brown's 208yards rushing, {{dominated}} {{the first half}} statistically, but found themselves down 20–10 midway through the second quarter because they committed six fumbles, five of which were recovered by Buffalo. UConn would <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to 20–17 by halftime, and take the lead for good late {{in the third quarter}} off a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tyler Lorenzen to tight end Steve Brouse. The Connecticut victory was sealed when, late in the fourth quarter, Buffalo quarterback Drew Willy threw a pass that was intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston and returned 100yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|With five draws and one defeat, West Germany {{failed to}} qualify for the inaugural 1984 European Championship, {{finishing}} third in the qualifying group. In the beginning, Bisanz's primary objective was to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to the Scandinavian countries and Italy– then the strongest teams in Europe. He emphasized training in basic skills and the need for an effective youth programme. Starting in 1985, Bisanz increasingly called-up younger players, but at first had little success with this concept, as West Germany again failed {{to qualify for}} the 1987 European Championship finals.|$|E

5|$|By August the {{division}} was {{still waiting to}} be deployed, but now plans envisioned using {{them as part of}} a larger force. Operation Transfigure involved {{the division}}, the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, the US 101st Airborne Division, and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade landing at Rambouillet St Arnoult, to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between Orléans and Paris. Operation Axehead, using the same force, was to seize the bridges over the River Seine in support of 21st Army Group. Operation Boxer, with the same force, was to seize Boulogne and assault V1 flying bomb sites. Near the end of the month, Operation Linnet, with the same units as before, was formulated to seize crossings over the Escaut. Operation Infatuate, drawn up in early September, involved the entire I Airborne Corps landing in Belgium to trap the retreating German armies in the Scheldt estuary, as well as aiming to threaten Antwerp.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1996, Liverpool faced Newcastle United in a Premier League fixture at Anfield, {{during the}} 1995–96 season. Liverpool won the match, scoring four goals to Newcastle's three. The winning goal was scored by striker Stan Collymore {{in the second}} minute of {{stoppage}} time. Before the match, both clubs had lost their previous fixtures but still had a chance of winning the league and wanted to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between themselves and leaders Manchester United. Newcastle United, who were 12 points ahead in January, had suffered from poor performance throughout March, winning one match out of four that month. Liverpool had won six of their last nine league games during February and March, scored the most goals and conceded the fewest until this match.|$|E
5|$|On lap 47, Massa made a {{pit stop}} for new tyres from fifth place, {{retaining}} his position ahead of Fernando Alonso. All the while, Räikkönen {{was able to}} <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Hamilton ahead of him to eight seconds on lap 49. On the next lap, Button passed Sainz for tenth and Ricciardo moved ahead of Palmer for 12th another lap later. Rosberg crossed the line to take his seventh consecutive victory, a feat to that point only achieved by Alberto Ascari, Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel. Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen rounded up the podium ahead of the two Williams drivers, Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa. Rosberg recorded the first Grand Slam of his career, meaning he won the race, recorded the fastest lap, achieved pole position and led every lap. He was the 24th driver in history to achieve the feat.|$|E

5|$|Ralf Schumacher {{took his}} first pit stop on lap 28, {{emerging}} in seventh position. Barrichello pitted one lap later. Race leader Häkkinen took his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind teammate Coulthard. Häkkinen regained the lead after Coulthard made his pit stop on lap 32, who came out in third position. Fisichella retired with further brake problems on lap 32. Häkkinen set the fastest lap of the race, a 1:20.028 on lap 33, {{as he continued to}} stretch his lead over Michael Schumacher. Coulthard, who was on fresh tyres, gradually began to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> to Michael Schumacher by lap 39. Michael Schumacher increased the gap when Coulthard lost two seconds; the result of being held up by Genè who was later issued a 10-second stop-go penalty.

5|$|The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry {{held the}} regiment's left flank west of Komam-ni, while the 2nd Battalion held the {{right along the}} Nam River. 3rd Battalion, redesignated from the 1st Battalion, 29th Infantry, was in reserve on the road south of Chirwon from where it could move quickly to {{any part of the}} line. To the south was the US 24th Infantry Regiment and west of Chindong-ni, the 5th Regimental Combat Team was on the {{division}}'s left flank. On division orders, the 5th Regimental Combat Team first held the ground above the Chindong-ni coastal road only as far as Yaban-san. Kean soon decided, however, that the 5th RCT should <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> northward between it and the 24th Infantry. When the 5th sent a South Korean unit of 100 men under American officers to the higher slope of Sobuk-san, North Korean troops already there drove them back.

5|$|The British fleet {{approached}} the French line in an oblique manner, leading to individual engagements as the British ships attempted {{to break through}} at several points. Around 9:30, the British flagship HMS Queen Charlotte cut the French line aft of Montagne, firing a devastating raking broadside that killed Montagnes commander, Captain Bazire. The ship astern of Montagne, Jacobin, attempted to prevent Queen Charlotte breaking through by accelerating to <b>close</b> <b>the</b> <b>gap</b> between herself and her flagship; this left a gap behind her, between Jacobin and Achille, that HMS Brunswick, under Captain John Harvey, attempted to exploit to cut the line and assist Queen Charlotte. Achille accelerated and closed the gap, and Brunswick turned her fire against Vengeur, while Achille engaged HMS Ramillies and Valiant.|$|E
