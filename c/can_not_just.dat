In February 1782, Irvine sent Washington a detailed plan for an offensive. Irvine estimated that with 2,000 men, five cannons, and a supply caravan, he could capture Detroit. Washington replied that the bankrupt U.S. Congress would be unable to finance the campaign, writing that [...] "offensive operations, except upon a small scale, <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> now be brought into contemplation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we <b>can,</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E

50|$|However, {{there are}} also risks for attendees, and these relate to an unfortunate {{perception}} that a business relationship can also be speed-tracked, {{as well as a}} misconception that quantity is of prime importance. Members still need to take time to develop relationships with individual fellow members outside the networking event and the importance of this cannot be overestimated. Other principles of good networking, such as an attitude of giving, not pushing, business cards or marketing material at people, for example, still stand.

50|$|Professors {{of history}} Martha Howell and Walter Prevenier thus state that an {{argument}} from silence {{can act as}} presumptive evidence only if the person failing to mention the information {{was in a position}} to have the information, and was purporting to be giving a complete account of the story in question. Howell and Prevenier state that arguments from silence face the difficulty that a historian <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> assume that an author would have recorded the fact in question; for if the fact did not seem important enough to an author it would have been excluded.|$|E
5000|$|Counterconditioning is {{very similar}} to {{extinction}} seen in classical conditioning. It is the process of getting rid of an unwanted response. But in counterconditioning, the unwanted response does not just disappear, it is replaced by a new, wanted response. [...] "The conditioned stimulus is presented with the unconditioned stimulus". This also {{can be thought of as}} stimulus substitution. The weaker stimulus will be replaced by the stronger stimulus. When counterconditioning is successful, the process <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> be explained by simply substitution of a stimulus. It usually is explained by things such as conditioned inhibition, habituation, or extinction.|$|E

The Royal Arts Academy which she started with Uduak Oguamanam, Anietie Isong, and actress Monalisa Chinda, is based in Surulere, Lagos State, Nigeria. The academy has tasked itself with a mandate concerned with the empowerment of its students by giving them the necessary tools required to take part in all aspects of film creation and production. The academy is dedicated to producing students who <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> compete and excel in the Nigerian film industry, but also in the international film industry. Apart from teaching students what they need to begin a career in the movie industry, the academy also gives students the opportunity to win funding to help them begin their career by actually producing movies the general public can see.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} social evolutionists of the present (see, e.g., Sanderson, S. K. 2007. Evolutionism and its Critics: Deconstructing and Reconstructing an Evolutionary Interpretation of Human Society. Boulder, CO: Paradigm. P.161-171), he is especially known for his theory of the state formation ("Carneiro's Circumscription Theory") that explains how the constraints of the environment interact with population pressures and warfare to form states (Carneiro, R. L. 1970. A Theory of the Origin of the State. Science 169: 733-738). He has also made important contributions to the general theory of cultural evolution. He claims that in primitive war if the losers get away far enough then everything is quite fine. As seen with Ancient Egypt, when an area conquered along the Nile, the people <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> run off into the desert, therefore they are bound to their area, as seen with China, Iraq, etc.|$|E
50|$|Things get {{complicated}} {{when she}} is forced to reveal her past, especially since Loki is currently hunting a Mazianni ship. Long overdue for a major overhaul, Loki limps into Thule, hooks up to the sole starship fuel pump and takes on all the available fuel. While there, the ship they were searching for (Keu's India) shows up. The Mazianni ship had been harried and hunted by Alliance and Union forces {{to the point that}} it was blocked from its regular supply bases and is desperately low on fuel. Keu needs to take the precious pump and fuel intact, so he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> blow Loki up. Instead, he sends boarding parties of armored marines, but Bet and NG between them manage to hold them off. Then the Alliance warship Norway arrives to close the trap and administer the coup de grâce. Bet's actions during the battle prove to her crewmates that she can be trusted; she has found a (relatively) safe haven.|$|E

[...] In addition, Jones wrote that [...] "Bebo Norman has long been known for his meaningful lyrics and Lights of Distant Cities shows that as he ages, he just gets better with his writing. Centered around the theme of finding light in the darkness and being that light in a world of darkness, he also delves into the effects that we all feel from the darkness that comes from sin." [...] Jones gave credence that [...] "Lights of Distant Cities could easily be called Bebos best project yet -- no small feat after the eight powerhouse albums he has recorded since 1996". The bottom line according to Jones is that [...] "Norman delivers a project that we <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> enjoy, but listen to and grow with. He brings light to the day that lasts long after the sun has gone down." [...] Jones called the [...] "standout tracks" [...] "Daylight Breaking", [...] "Just a Glimpse" [...] and [...] "Sing of Your Glory".|$|E

50|$|Lili stops {{eating and}} begins losing {{strength}} {{and ends up}} in the hospital where she has decided to stop living at all. She receives a letter from Loïc where he apologizes for leaving without a word or getting back to her and makes it very clear that he will not be coming back. He also says that he has been traveling around living on petty jobs and blames their father for his lot in life. Lili recovers and begins looking for her twin by following the trail of the letters she has received along with Thomas, the boyfriend of her friend from school, Lea. Lili and Thomas gradually fall in love. When Lili goes to Saint Aubin with Thomas, she sees her father mailing letters, concluding that her father was imitating Loïc's handwriting and sending letters to Lili, in an attempt to protect her and keep her alive. Coincidentally, Thomas, when visiting his grandmother's grave, sees Loïc's gravestone. When Thomas arrives at Lili's house for a family lunch, he speaks with her parents, mentioning that he knows of Loïc's death. They reveal that Loïc had died in an accident during mountain climbing, and they plead for Thomas not to tell Lili anything. Thomas believes that they are crazy, but decides to keep the truth to himself. Lili, who arrives home shortly after to meet Thomas and her parents for the lunch, finds her brother's guitar hidden in her father's car. Knowing he would never have left behind his beloved guitar, she learns that he <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>just</b> have gone away.|$|E
