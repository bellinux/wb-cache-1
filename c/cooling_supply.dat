5000|$|The real key to Watsco’s growth, and the {{foundation}} {{that would be}} built upon thereafter, came in 1989 when Watsco invested in an air conditioning distribution business. In 1989, Watsco bought 80% of the largest distributor of central air conditioning equipment under the Rheem brand name, Gemaire Distributors, Inc., for US$17.1 million. [...] The other 20% of the company was held by Rheem. Then in 1990, Watsco bought a 50.5% interest in Heating & <b>Cooling</b> <b>Supply,</b> Inc., the largest independent distributor of HVAC equipment and supplies in California. Watsco had planned to buy 80% of Heating & <b>Cooling</b> <b>Supply,</b> raising money through a public stock offering. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait {{and the possibility of}} war in the Persian Gulf flattened the stock market, making Watsco’s stock offering virtually impossible, and the company withdrew it. Instead Watsco settled for a smaller piece of Heating & <b>Cooling</b> <b>Supply,</b> paying approximately US$16 million for a 50.5% interest. [...] Rheem bought the remaining 49.5%. The acquisition allowed Watsco to double its share of the distribution market in southern California and Arizona, and company revenues shot up. By 1991 Watsco’s revenues had reached US$169 million.|$|E

5000|$|But {{it was the}} {{distribution}} business that continued {{to lead the way}} through the 1990s. The industry was still highly fragmented, made up of many small, well-established players, and Watsco had many opportunities to expand by acquisition. “There’s no one out there consolidating in the industry except us,” CEO Nahmad told the Wall Street Journal (June 20, 1994). [...] In that interview Nahmad also announced that Watsco's profit for 1994 was expected to go up by about 20%. The company moved to the more prestigious New York Stock Exchange that year. In 1995, Watsco acquired Central Air Conditioning Distributors, Inc., a North Carolina Rheem distributor. In 1996, Watsco bought out Rheem’s minority interest in the three Rheem-brand distributors: 1) Gemaire, 2) Heating & <b>Cooling</b> <b>Supply</b> and 3) Comfort Supply, a 1993 acquisition that they had split 80/20. These all became wholly owned subsidiaries of Watsco. The company also bought Three States Supply Company, Inc. that year. Then in early 1997, Watsco acquired Coastline Distribution, Inc. and purchased four additional operations from Inter-City Products Corporation for US$21.7 million. Inter-City was one of the nation's largest manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment, with several major brands, including Comfortmaker and Arcoaire. It had 25 locations of its Coastline Distribution business, spread throughout Florida, Georgia, Alabama, the Carolinas, Maryland and parts of southern California. Within a couple months, Watsco announced that it was buying two distribution operations from the air conditioner maker Carrier. This was the company's 15th acquisition in the HVAC/R distribution business since 1989.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of drill microgeometry and <b>cooling</b> <b>supply</b> in the surface integrity of machined holes. The changes in the holes surface and subsurface due to differences on tools features were presented. Design/methodology/approach: Two types of carbide drills with differences in microgeometry and internal/external cooling were used in the machining of SAE 1045 steel. The surface integrity of the holes was evaluated in terms of surface and subsurface quality. The holes surface was examined using optical microscopy (texture) and roughness measurement. The subsurface analysis included plastic deformations, and micro and nanohardness. Findings: The differences in the <b>cooling</b> <b>supply</b> and drills microgeometry showed influence on surface integrity results. The drill type with internal cooling and improved microgeometry produced holes with a smoother surface and subsurface changes of lower magnitude. The most influent feature of microgeometry was the margin thickness. The drill with a thicker margin presented better results, mainly due to friction reduction. Practical implications: The performed investigations could be useful in the industrial practice and give the information for tool selection in drilling of SAE 1045 steel, which is very used in mechanical components industry. Originality/value: The paper shows the importance of analysing the effect of differences of tools features in surface integrity, which is often neglected, but has great influence on the components performance, mainly under severe mechanical and thermal loads. This work also presents the benefits in surface integrity due to drills microgeometry improvement...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The HVAC {{systems in}} subway {{stations}} are energy consuming giants, {{each of which}} may consume over 10, 000 Kilowatts per day for cooling and ventilation. To save energy for the HVAC systems, it is critically important to firstly know the “load signatures ” of the HVAC system, i. e., the quantity of heat imported from the outdoor environments and by the passengers respectively in different periods of a day, which will significantly benefit the design of control policies. In this paper, we present a novel sensing and learning approach to identify the load signature of the HVAC system in the subway stations. In particular, sensors and smart meters were deployed to monitor the indoor, outdoor temperatures, and the energy consumptions of the HVAC system in real-time. The number of passengers was counted by the ticket checking system. At the same time, the <b>cooling</b> <b>supply</b> provided by the HVAC system was inferred via the energy consumption logs of the HVAC system. Since the indoor temperature variations are driven by the difference of the loads and the <b>cooling</b> <b>supply,</b> linear regression model was proposed for the load signature, whose coefficients are derived via a proposed algorithm. We collected real sensing data and energy log data from HaiDianHuangZhuang Subway station, which is in line 4 of Beijing from the duration of July 2012 to Sept. 2012. The data {{was used to evaluate}} the coefficients of the regression model. The experiment results show typical variation signatures of the loads from the passengers and from the outdoor environments respectively, which provide important contexts for smart control policies.
