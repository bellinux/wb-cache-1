On 20 April 2007 the morning tidal flow was discontinued, after reports by TfL and the Metropolitan Police (MPS) of an increase in dangerous motoring behaviour; these blamed poor driving, such as overtaking, for the decrease in safety during <b>counterflow</b> operations. The decision to end the <b>counterflow</b> was controversial, particularly as TfL and the MPS had been considering it since 2005, without properly informing affected borough councils, and an independent committee was set up to evaluate the decision. The ending of the <b>counterflow</b> system has brought protests from users of the tunnel and those experiencing increased congestion due to the change.|$|E

Given that most previous studies on the <b>counterflowing</b> LPM jet have all been on blunt bodies and at high supersonic or hypersonic flow conditions, exploring the feasibility to obtain a LPM jet issuing from a slender body against low supersonic freestream conditions is {{the main focus of}} this study. Computational fluid dynamics computations of axisymmetric models (cone-cylinder and quartic geometry), of relevance to NASA's High Speed project, are carried out using the space-time conservation element solution element viscous flow solver with unstructured meshes. A systematic parametric study is conducted to determine the optimum combination of <b>counterflowing</b> jet size, mass flow rate, and nozzle geometry for obtaining LPM jets. Details from these computations will be used to assess the potential of the LPM <b>counterflowing</b> supersonic jet as a means of active flow control for enabling supersonic flight over land and to establish the knowledge base for possible future implementation of such technologies...|$|R

500|$|Tuna {{and other}} fast-swimming ocean-going fish {{maintain}} their muscles at higher temperatures than their environment for efficient locomotion.

Depending on the supersonic free-stream conditions and the ejected mass flow rate of the <b>counterflowing</b> jets, the bow shock of the vehicle is moved upstream, further away from the vehicle. This results in an increasing shock standoff distance of the bow shock with a progressively weaker shock. At a critical jet mass flow rate, the bow shock becomes so weak that it is transformed into a series of compression waves spread out in a much wider region, thus significantly modifying the flow that wets the outer surfaces, with an attendant reduction in wave and skin friction drag and aerothermal loads...|$|R

A theoretical analysis was performed to describe the flow field in the mixing region between the two <b>counterflowing</b> streams. The results obtained by applying a locally similar solution compare favorably with the experimentally measured values. Large values of jet penetration were obtained with a high subsonic or low supersonic jet; large interaction forces are characteristics of higher supersonic injections.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the use of <b>counterflowing</b> jets can greatly reduce the drag and heat loads on blunt-body geometries, especially when the long penetration mode jet condition can be established. Previously, the authors had done some preliminary numerical studies to determine the ability to establish long penetration mode jets on a typical Mach 1. 6 slender configuration, and study its impact on the boom signature. The results indicated that a jet with a longer penetration length was required to achieve any impact on the boom signature of a typical Mach 1. 6 slender configuration. This paper focuses on an in-depth parametric study, done using the space-time conservation element solution element Navier-Stokes flow solver, for investigating the effect of various <b>counterflowing</b> jet conditions/configurations on two supersonic slender-body models (cone-cylinder and quartic body of revolution). The study is aimed at gaining {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between the shock penetration length and reduction of drag and boom signature for these two supersonic slender-body configurations. Different jet flow rates, Mach numbers, nozzle jet exit diameters and jet-to-base diameter ratios were examined. The results show the characteristics of a short-to-long-to-short penetration-mode pattern with the increase of jet mass flow rates, observed across various <b>counterflowing</b> jet nozzle configurations. Though the optimal shock penetration length for potential boom-signature mitigation is tied to the long penetration mode, it often results in a very unsteady flow and leads to large oscillations of surface pressure and drag. Furthermore, depending on the geometry of the slender body, longer jet penetration did not always result in maximum drag reduction. For the quartic geometry, the maximum drag reduction corresponds well to the longest shock penetration length, while this was not the case for the cone-cylinder-as the geometry was already optimized for drag. Numerical results and assessments obtained from this parametric study along with the recommendation for future implementation of <b>counterflowing</b> jets as a means for drag and noise reduction are detailed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|An active {{flow control}} concept using <b>counterflowing</b> jets to {{significantly}} modify the external flowfields and strongly weaken or disperse the shock-waves of supersonic and hypersonic vehicles {{to reduce the}} aerothermal loads and wave drag was investigated. Experiments were conducted in a trisonic blow-down wind-tunnel, complemented by pre-test computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of a 2. 6 % scale model of Apollo capsule, with and without <b>counterflowing</b> jets, in Mach 3. 48 and 4. 0 freestreams, to assess the potential aerothermal and aerodynamic benefits of this concept. The model was instrumented with heat flux gauges, thermocouples and pressure taps, and employed five <b>counterflowing</b> jet nozzles (three sonic and other two supersonic with design Mach numbers of 2. 44 and 2. 94) and nozzle exit diameters ranging from 0. 25 to 0. 5 inch. Schlieren data show that at low jet flow rates of 0. 05 and 0. 1 lb(sub m) /sec, the interactions result in a long penetration mode (LPM) jet, while the short penetration mode (SPM) jet is observed at flow rates greater than 0. 1 lb(sub m) /sec., consistent with the pre-test CFD predictions. For the LPM, the jet appears to be nearly fully-expanded, resulting in a very unsteady and oscillatory flow structure in which the bow shock becomes highly dispersed such {{that it is no}} longer discernable. Higher speed camera Schlieren data reveal the shock to be dispersed into striations of compression waves, which suddenly coalesce to a weaker bow shock with a larger standoff distance as the flow rate reached a critical value. The pronounced shock dispersion could significantly impact the aerodynamic performance (L/D) and heat flux reduction of spacecraft in atmospheric entry and re-entry, and could also attenuate the entropy layer in hypersonic blunt body flows. For heat transfer, the results show significant reduction in heat flux, even giving negative heat flux for some of the SPM interactions, indicating that the flow wetting the model is cooling, instead of heating the model, which could significantly impact the requirements and design of thermal protection system. These findings strongly suggest that the application of <b>counterflowing</b> jets as active flow control could have strong impact on supersonic and hypersonic vehicle design and performance...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} brief {{overview}} of the classic tonal screech noise problem created by underexpanded supersonic jets, briefly describing the fluid dynamic-acoustics feedback mechanism that has been long established as the basis for this well-known aeroacoustics problem. This is followed by a description of the Long Penetration Mode (LPM) supersonic underexpanded <b>counterflowing</b> jet phenomenon which has been demonstrated in several wind tunnel tests and modeled in several computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The authors provide evidence from test and CFD analysis of LPM that indicates that acoustics feedback and fluid interaction seen in LPM are analogous to the aeroacoustics interactions seen in screech jets. Finally, the authors propose applying certain methodologies to LPM which have been developed and successfully demonstrated in the study of screech jets and mechanically induced excitation in fluid oscillators for decades. The authors conclude that the large body of work done on jet screech, other aeroacoustic phenomena, and fluid oscillators can have direct application to the study and applications of LPM <b>counterflowing</b> supersonic cold flow jets...|$|R
