25|$|In 1948, {{following}} {{the completion of}} the demobilisation process, Australia's part-time military forces were re-organised under the guise of the Citizens Military Force. Upon re-formation, the 4th Brigade was assigned to the 3rd Division and consisted of three infantry battalions: the 5th, 6th and 8th/7th. Throughout the Cold War period which followed, the composition of the brigade changed a number of times as the role of part-time military forces evolved. Initially, post war service was voluntary, however, in 1951 national service was instituted and this increased the size of the CMF units. During this time, due to increased manpower and resources, the brigade was able to achieve full manning and equipment scales and, as a result, in 1959, formed the basis of a 3,500-man <b>combined</b> <b>arms</b> <b>exercise</b> undertaken at Puckapunyal.|$|E
25|$|In September 1974, having {{returned}} to Enoggera from Singapore the previous year, 6 RAR briefly raised an airborne capability {{but this was}} only short-lived. That same year, the battalion also provided assistance to the civil community in response to Cyclone Tracy, undertaking clean up tasks in Darwin. 'D' Company was reorganised as a parachute company group in early 1980 and continued in this role until November 1983. As a result of shortcomings in the capability of the Australian Defence Force were highlighted {{in the wake of}} the 1987 Fijian coups d'Ã©tat, the battalion was trained in the amphibious role. In April 1989, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel David Mead, the battalion took part in the <b>combined</b> <b>arms</b> <b>Exercise</b> Caltrop Force in California, during which it undertook amphibious operations in US Marine AAVP7s. Later, in February 1992, 6 RAR began conversion to a motorised organisation and added a Ready Reserve company later the same year. It reverted to an integrated-regular/reserve battalion in February 1997 and trialed the experimental Army 21 organisation.|$|E

Between 1988 and 1992 the division participated in the suppression of interethnic conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Baltic region, Transdnistria, North Ossetia, and South Ossetia. In 1991, the 104th and 234th Guards Airborne Regiments were awarded the Ministry of Defense Pennant [...] "For Courage and Valor". Earlier, the division and its artillery regiment had been awarded the pennant. The division {{took part in the}} August Coup of 1991, when it was sent to Estonia by the Coup's leaders to take over the Tallinn TV Tower.|$|E
2500|$|The 29 Palms EAF {{is under}} {{operational}} {{control of the}} Commanding General, Third Marine Aircraft Wing. Day-to-day operations are {{the responsibility of the}} Marines of MWSS-374. The EAF was built in 1976 to test the Naval services aluminum expeditionary runway concept. The austere EAF is an example of what Naval aviation would use in a tactical situation where no prior airfield exists. It is a cornerstone of the Marine Corps' <b>Combined</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Exercise</b> (CAX) Program. Today's EAF has changed very little since the original construction. Over three million square feet of aluminum AM-2 matting make up the primary runway, taxiways, and parking areas. The EAF operates as a [...] "host nation" [...] airfield to which deployed units bring their own organic support. Support functions provided at the EAF include the following: Airfield Operations, Air Traffic Control, Airfield Construction, Maintenance and Repair, Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting, Common Aviation Support Equipment, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, Weather Services, Communications, Aircraft Refueling, Fuel Storage, Engineer Support, and Motor Transport.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{independence}} of Singapore {{and the establishment of}} Kuomintang rule over the island of Taiwan, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) adopted military training bases in Taiwan from 1975 that included <b>combined</b> <b>arms</b> <b>exercises</b> involving infantry, artillery, and armored units. The then Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew also appointed Taiwanese military personnel in training Republic of Singapore Air Force. These exercises, engaging as many as 10,000 troops at one time, provided officers a chance to simulate wartime conditions more closely and gain experience in the command and control of operations involving several battalions.|$|R
50|$|In January 2005, it was {{announced}} that 6 Sikorsky S-70B (derivative of SH-60 Seahawk) naval helicopters will be purchased, complete with anti-surface and anti-submarine weapons and sensors. These will be operated by RSAF pilots, with System Specialists of the Republic of Singapore Navy operating the sensors and weaponry. They will operate from the Navy's new Formidable class frigates, and when operating from land will be based at Sembawang Air Base. All 20 AH-64D Longbow attack helicopters have been delivered, achieving pilot IOC. 12 of these Longbow Apaches were deployed back to Singapore and took part in <b>combined</b> <b>arms</b> <b>exercises</b> with the Army.|$|R
50|$|In October 2006, the 84th USARRTC {{underwent}} {{another major}} transformation as 12 brigades from the Army Reserve's Institutional Training Divisions realigned under the command.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the battalion's LVT-7s {{underwent}} a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), which converted the LVT-7 vehicles to the improved Amphibious Assault Vehicle-7A1 (AAV-7A1) by adding an improved engine, transmission, and weapons system {{and improving the}} overall maintainability of the vehicle. Upon realizing the need to mechanize units participating in the <b>Combined</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>Exercises</b> (CAX), two platoons of AAVs were transferred to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms (MCAGCC) in July 1979. The two platoons were formed from Camp Pendleton one went to Company A, 3d Tank Battalion, and the other platoon went to Company B, 3d Tank Battalion.|$|R
