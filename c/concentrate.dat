40|$|Background: Platelet {{transfusion}} {{is accompanied}} by febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. The generation of cytokines (like IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-alpha) in platelet <b>concentrates</b> by white cells is suggested {{to be responsible for}} febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions. The number of white cells in the platelet <b>concentrates</b> is crucial to cytokine generation. Methods: This study was performed to determine whether WBC reduction in platelet <b>concentrates</b> by prestorage leukodepletion filters or inactivation by gamma radiation reduced the levels of these cytokines during storage for 3 days. Each of the platelet <b>concentrates</b> (n = 54) was prepared from a single random donor by platelet-rich plasma.

40|$|As in many {{countries}} (Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, Sweden), <b>concentrated</b> ownership is a ubiquitous feature of the Indian private sector {{over the past seven}} decades. Yet, unlike in most countries, the identity of the primary families responsible for the <b>concentrated</b> ownership changes dramatically over time, perhaps even more than it does in the U. S. during the same time period. It does not appear that <b>concentrated</b> ownership in India is entirely associated with the ills that the literature has recently ascribed to <b>concentrated</b> ownership in emerging markets. If the <b>concentrated</b> owners are not exclusively, or even primarily, engaged in rent-seeking and entry-deterring behavior, <b>concentrated</b> ownership may not be inimical to competition. Indeed, as a response to competition, we argue that at least some Indian families the <b>concentrated</b> owners in question have consistently tried to use their business group structures to launch new ventures. In the process they have either failed hence the turnover in identity or reinvented themselves. Thus <b>concentrated</b> ownership is a result, rather than a cause, of inefficiencies in capital markets. Even in the low capital-intensity, relatively unregulated setting of the Indian software industry, we find that <b>concentrated</b> ownership persists in a privately successful and socially useful way. Since this setting is the least hospitable to the existence of <b>concentrated</b> ownership, we interpret our findings as a lower bound on the persistence of <b>concentrated</b> ownership in the economy at large. ...|$|R
