5|$|Although the BBC has {{invested}} in the reconstruction of episodes using animation, it has never attempted to do anything {{in the way of}} complete re-staging of missing episodes; the closest that it has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was the recreation of parts of various serials, including the completely missing Marco Polo, in the docudrama An Adventure in Space and Time produced for the 50th anniversary in 2013. However, in 2012 a reimagined version of The Power of the Daleks, written by, directed by, and starring Nick Scovell, was released on YouTube in three parts before it was shown complete at the Power:Reimagined convention in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA published in 2012, the Newfoundland pony and Canadian horse {{were found to be}} the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied, which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony. When an estimation was made using microsatellite loci, the Newfoundland was found to have high autosomal diversity and a high number of haplotypes, some of which overlapped with the mountain and moorland pony breeds (historically documented as the ancestors of the Newfoundland), Nordic breeds and a feral population at Saint-Pierre et Miquelon. Overlapping haplotypes also suggested a relationship with the Standardbred and Clydesdale, suggesting possible crossbreeding at some point, although previous studies using microsatellite markers had not <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion. Although the microsatellite loci showed a relationship between the Newfoundland and the Sable Island horse, the study did not find overlapping haplotypes that would support this, possibly due to the population bottleneck in the 1980s that may have resulted in such haplotypes being lost. In order to be registered with the Newfoundland Pony Society, ponies must undergo DNA testing to verify Newfoundland parentage.|$|E

While Vorster was unwilling to make concessions to his own country's blacks, he concluded that white minority rule was not sustainable in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1.

25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It is hard for many cello players {{to be able to}} find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.|$|E
25|$|First {{appearing}} in the 1987 film, Predator, the eponymous character lands in Val Verde via starship. He has <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> location due to the wars between rebel and government forces, already having made several kills among the locals before beginning to hunt down a United States Army Special Forces group sent there to rescue presidential cabinet ministers kidnapped by guerrilla forces. The Predator dispatches the soldiers one by one with its array of weaponry until Major Dutch Schaeffer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the last one alive. Dutch eventually confronts the creature, covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's thermal imaging, and setting up numerous booby traps. Though he manages to disable the Predator's cloaking ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of Honour, discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel. Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually sets off one of his traps, which crushes and mortally wounds the creature. After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator simply mimics his question and sets off his self-destruct device before laughing maniacally, though Dutch manages to escape the explosion.|$|E
25|$|Landing on Dock Island, Franky repairs the Thousand Sunny, {{which has}} been damaged by Zephyr. They meet , whose granddaughter reveals that pirates who <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> island {{say that they have}} been {{attacked}} by Zephyr. Mobston, angered by Zephyr destroying their pirates' dreams, decides to give the Straw Hats his strongest equipment. While there, the Straw Hats gather information on Zephyr's location from the navy and meet up with Kuzan, who reveals that has left the navy after being defeated by Akainu on Punk Hazard. Using the Sea Train, the Straw Hats enter Secon Island just as the volcano erupts. They confront Zephyr, Ain and Binz, only to be easily defeated once again. Meanwhile, Garp reveals to Coby and Helmeppo that Zephyr once believed in the navy's justice and became an Admiral after serving as a soldier in the navy. When Zephyr's wife and son were killed by a pirate who resented him, Zephyr became an instructor. One day, most of Zephyr's recruits were killed and Zephyr lost his arm after being attacked by a pirate with Devil Fruit powers. Zephyr acquired a weapon developed by the navy's scientist to defeat Devil Fruit users and organized a strike unit. However, when the pirate who attacked him was chosen to serve as a Warlord, Zephyr left the Navy, organizing the Neo Marines as a result.|$|E

500|$|By 1975, Dylan showed scant {{interest}} in the discographical minutiae of the recordings. Interviewed on the radio by Mary Travers, he recalled, [...] "We were all up there sorta drying out ... making music and watching time go by. So, in the meantime, we made this record. Actually, it wasn't a record, it was just songs which we'd <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> basement and recorded. Out in the woods..."

500|$|The {{ultimate}} substantive {{legacy of}} Principia Mathematica is mixed. [...] It is generally accepted that Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem of 1931 definitively demonstrated that for any set of axioms and inference rules proposed to encapsulate mathematics, there {{would in fact}} be some truths of mathematics {{which could not be}} deduced from them, and hence that Principia Mathematica could never achieve its aims. [...] However, Gödel could not have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion without Whitehead and Russell's book. [...] In this way, Principia Mathematicas legacy might be described as its key role in disproving the possibility of achieving its own stated goals. [...] But beyond this somewhat ironic legacy, the book popularized modern mathematical logic and drew important connections between logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.|$|E
500|$|Empire Kim Newman {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. He said Saw is styled like early David Fincher films and [...] "boasts an {{intricate}} structure - complex flashbacks-within-flashbacks explain how the characters have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> crisis - and a satisfying mystery to go with its ghastly claustrophobia." [...] He ended his review saying, [...] "As good an all-out, non-camp horror movie as we've had lately." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B minus, calling it [...] "derivative and messy and too nonsensical for its own good." [...] He described Jigsaw's intent as [...] "to show you the serial killer lurking inside yourself." [...] Gleiberman criticized Elwes' performance by saying, [...] " [...] ought to be featured in a seminar on the perils of overacting." [...] Daniel M. Kimmel of the Telegram & Gazette called it [...] "one of the most loathsome films this critic has seen in more than 20 years on the job." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013 Senholt {{noted that}} because the group has no {{official}} membership, it is [...] "difficult, if not impossible, to estimate the number of ONA members". Senholt suggested that a [...] "rough estimate" [...] of the [...] "total number" [...] of individuals involved with the ONA in some capacity from 1980 to 2009 was [...] "a few thousand"; he had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> conclusion from {{an examination of the}} number of magazines and journals about the subject circulated and the number of members of online discussion groups devoted to the ONA. At the same time he thought that the number of [...] "longtime adherents is much smaller." [...] Also in 2013, Monette estimated that there were over two thousand ONA associates, broadly defined. He believed that the gender balance was roughly equal, although with regional variation and differences among particular nexions. Introvigne noted that if Monette's estimate was correct, it would mean that the ONA is [...] "easily... the largest Satanist organization in the world".|$|E
500|$|Humber was {{promoted}} to the Mets, again as a September call-up, on September 2. Though the Mets considered inserting him into the starting rotation immediately, they chose to start Pelfrey. Humber made two relief appearances for the Mets, on September 5 and 11. The Mets, having lost eight of their previous 12 games and seen their lead over the Philadelphia Phillies in the National League East division race decrease from seven games to two, removed Pelfrey from the final rotation to give an extra day of rest to pitchers Pérez, Maine, and Pedro Martínez, and gave Humber his first Major League start on September 26, 2007, against the Washington Nationals, choosing him over Dave Williams. Although the Mets raced out to a 6–2 lead, Humber allowed five runs in four-plus innings, receiving a no decision in a game the Mets eventually lost, 9–6. The decision to start Humber was seen as emblematic of the Mets' desperation. As George Vecsey wrote in The New York Times, [...] "How did it <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this?</b> How did the entire Mets' season come to depend so much on a young pitcher, Philip Humber, who had never started {{in the major leagues}} until last night?" [...] He concluded his three Mets appearances in the 2007 season with a 7.71 ERA.|$|E
500|$|Michael Sragow of Orange County Register {{gave the}} film grade C, {{saying that the}} film is [...] "a coarse, rickety comedy." [...] Richard Corliss wrote for Time {{magazine}} that [...] "All three women are less watchable and amusing than Nicki Minaj as Carly's legal assistant Lydia." [...] Film critic Stephen Holden of The New York Times said that the film is [...] "so dumb, lazy, clumsily assembled and unoriginal, it could crush any actor forced to execute its leaden slapstick gags and mouth its crude, humorless dialogue." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews wondered, [...] "Has it <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> for director Nick Cassavetes?", comparing his career negatively to that of his father, John Cassavetes. Berardinelli elaborated, [...] "what a comedown to find him in charge of such an unfocused, unfunny, scatologically-obsessed 'comedy.'" [...] Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.Com gave the film two out of four stars and said, [...] "While [...] "The Other Woman" [...] raises some thoughtful questions about independence, identity {{and the importance of}} sisterhood, ultimately it would rather poop on them and then throw them through a window in hopes of the getting the big laugh." [...] Wesley Morris of Grantland said, [...] "No one knows which takes are funny and which aren't.
