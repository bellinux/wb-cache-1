The story was written with Kingsepp's active cooperation and originally published on 23 December 2004. It was available via Eesti Päevaleht's web archive until December 2008 when she requested its withdrawal on grounds of it containing her personal data, particularly marital status, number of children, and location of birth, education, and residence. [...] Subsequently, Estonian Data Protection Inspection backed the request; Eesti Päevaleht complied but appealed to Tallinn Administrative Court. In June 2009, the court upheld the request on grounds that public interest towards Kingsepp's person has ceased since she withdrew from active politics, and that her former party is a [...] "completely marginal" [...] organisation. Accordingly, the story was no longer available on Eesti Päevaleht's website. It could still be read in libraries that maintain archives of newspapers. From 19 August 2010 it is again available due to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Estonia.|$|E

40|$|The unrevised and {{handwritten}} Cape diaries of Lady Anne Barnard for {{the years}} 1799 and 1800 have recently been transcribed and {{are now in the}} process of being edited. Since they are very long, and would be expensive to publish in their entirely, the question has arisen for their editors what principles of selection and emphasis should be followed in the editorial process. The diaries are private documents, intended to be read by no one but the author herself, and they are frequently non-standard in punctuation, spelling and even at times in syntax. The editors therefore face other issues, concerning their right to correct or standardise the text, which as it stands, is an illustration of the practice of a highly intelligent and experienced woman with almost no formal education - a woman who in many respects is representative of her time and class. The different kinds of interest present within the text - Cape and European history, the history of women, of slaves and of colonialism, as well as of the indigenous peoples of the Cape hinterland, may well represent alternative focuses between which the editors, in an abbreviated text, must choose, since the final decision <b>concerning</b> <b>publication</b> is likely to be an economic one.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test Lotka’s law of {{scientific}} publication productivity using the methodology outlined by Pao (1985), in the field of Library and Information Studies (LIS). Lotka’s law has been sporadically tested in the field over the past 30 + years, but the results of these studies are inconclusive due to the varying methods employed by the researchers. ^ A data set of 1, 856 citations that were found using the ISI Web of Knowledge databases were studied. The values of n and c were calculated to be 2. 1 and 0. 6418 (64. 18 %) respectively. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) one sample goodness-of-fit test was conducted at the 0. 10 level of significance. The Dmax value is 0. 022758 and the calculated critical value is 0. 026562. It was determined that the null hypothesis stating that there is no difference in the observed distribution of publications and the distribution obtained using Lotka’s and Pao’s procedure could not be rejected. ^ This study finds that literature in the field of Library and Information Studies does conform to Lotka’s law with reliable results. As result, Lotka’s law can be used in LIS as a standardized means of measuring author publication productivity which will lead to findings that are comparable on many levels (e. g., department, institution, national). Lotka’s law can be employed as an empirically proven analytical tool to establish publication productivity benchmarks for faculty and faculty librarians. Recommendations for further study include (a) exploring the characteristics of the high and low producers; (b) finding a way to successfully account for collaborative contributions in the formula; and, (c) a detailed study of institutional policies <b>concerning</b> <b>publication</b> productivity and its impact on the appointment, tenure and promotion process of academic librarians. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Terminology and Lexicography {{have been}} {{especially}} addressed to the Allied Health Sciences regarding discussion of case reports or <b>concerning</b> <b>publication</b> of scientific articles. The knowledge of Human Anatomy enables the understanding of medical terms and the refinement of Medical Terminology makes possible a better anatomicomedical communication in a highly technical level. Most of the scientific publications in both Anatomy and Medicine are found only in English and most of dictionaries or search resources available do not have specificity enough to explain anatomicomedical, terminological, or lexicographical occurrences. OBJECTIVE: To design and produce a multilingual terminological dictionary (Latim-English-Portuguese-Spanish) containing a list of English anatomicomedical terms in common usage in cardiology subspecialties addressed to medical students and professionals, to other allied health sciences professionals, and to translators working in this specific field. METHODS: Terms, semantical and grammatical components were selected to compose an anatomicocardiological corpus. The adequacy to the thematic terminological research requests and the translation reliability level will be settled from the terminology specificity {{in contrast to the}} semantics, as well as from a peer survey of the main terms used by national and international experts in specialized journals, Internet sites, and from text-books on Anatomy and Cardiology. The inclusion criteria will be the terms included in the English, Portuguese, and Spanish Terminologia Anatomica - the official terminology of the anatomical sciences; nonofficial technical commonly used terms which lead to terminology or translation misunderstanding often being a source of confusion. RESULTS: A table with a sample of the 508 most used anatomical cardiologic terms in English language peer-reviewed journals of cardiology and (pediatric and adult) thoracic surgery is shown. CONCLUSIONS: The working up of a multilingual terminological dictionary reduces the risk of ambiguities, inconsistencies, inutilities, and repetitions concerning the Nomenclature addressed to the Allied Health Sciences by prioritizing the inclusion of official technical terms and a judicious selection of commonly used terms. Efforts to standardize lists of structures in Humana Anatomy lead to both opportunities of scientific update and conceptual enlightenmen...|$|E

40|$|Background: Selective {{serotonin}} reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{are widely}} used medications to treat several psychiatric diseases and, above all, depression. They seem to {{be as effective as}} older antidepressants but have a different adverse effect profile. Despite their favorable safety profile, little is known about their influence on traffic safety. Objective: To conduct a literature review to summarize the current evidence on the role of SSRIs in traffic safety, particularly concerning undesirable effects that could potentially impair fitness to drive, experimental and pharmacoepidemiologic studies on driving impairment, 2 existing categorization systems for driving-impairing medications, and the European legislative procedures for assessing fitness to drive before issuing a driver's license and driving under the influence of medicines. Methods: The article search was performed in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect, and SafetyLit. The English-language scientific literature was searched using key words such as SSRIs and psychomotor performance, car crash or traffic accident, and adverse effects. For inclusion in this review, papers had to be full-text articles, refer to possible driving-related adverse effects, and be experimental or pharmacoepidemiologic studies on SSRIs and traffic accident risks. No restrictions <b>concerning</b> <b>publication</b> year were applied. Results: Ten articles were selected as background information on driving-related adverse effects, and 15 articles were selected regarding experimental and pharmacoepidemiologic work. Regarding SSRI adverse effects, the most reported undesirable effects referring to driving impairment were anxiety, agitation, sleep disturbances, headache, increased risk of suicidal behavior, and deliberate self-harm. Regarding the remaining issues addressed in this article, inconsistencies were found between the outcomes of the selected experimental and epidemiologic studies and between the 2 existing categorization systems under evaluation. Some pitfalls of the current legislative scenario were identified as well. Conclusions: Based on the current evidence, it was concluded that more experimental and epidemiologic research is needed to elucidate the relationship between SSRI use and traffic safety. Furthermore, a revision of the existing categorization systems and harmonized European legislation in the field of medication use and driving were highly recommended.

40|$|Publications in an {{international}} comparison In the past 10 years, Germany has showed a continuously increasing trend and always been ranked in the fourth or third place worldwide {{in terms of the}} number of publications and cita-tions respectively. German authors contribute 7. 2 % of total scientific publications but receive 9. 8 % of total citations in 2009. Similar to other large industrialized countries, Germany's share of publications has reduced slowly but constantly during the last decade due to the dramatic growth trends in threshold countries, first of all China. However, the German share in publica-tions has been rather stable since 2008. Germany displays an increasingly upward trend in its citation rate, which is distinctly above the world average. Germany's citation rates without non-English papers have always been beyond the Great Britain's level, and reached a similar high level like the USA in the last two years. Considering the indices Scientific Regard (SR) and International Alignment (IA), Germany's IA index has promoted up to 26, a value at a similar level as Great Britain, implying German scientists have increasingly released their achievements to the international community in journals with higher visibility; although it had always been similar to those for other leading industrialized countries like the United States in previous years, German SR value experiences a large margin decline in 2009, which is caused by both its comparative rise of expected citations and its comparative fall of observed citations. Smaller European countries like Switzerland present high SR as well as IA values. As to the disciplinary profile, Germany shows high specialization values in "nuclear technology", "medical engineer-ing", "geo-science" and "biotechnology", displaying a portfolio that differs from those of China and Great Britain. <b>Concerning</b> <b>publication</b> activities of BRICS, China has become the second largest paper pro-ducer, while its citation rate remains below the world average as do those of other threshold countries. Russia is an exception compared with other BRICS countries showing obviously and continually decreasing shares of publications and citations partly because of its relative inde-pendent native language scientific community. China and South Africa show very positive SR values in combination with still very negative IA values due to publications in journals with limited international visibility. International co-publications Germany's absolute number as well as the share of internationally co-authored publications in-creased in the last years. However, a similar statement also holds for most other countries. Non-etheless, the increase in collaboration is especially observable after 2008. German co-authorships with EU and BRICS countries were especially intensified in the recent period. International collaborations most frequently happen in fields of German non-specialization, i. e. Food and Nutrition, Chemistry, Pharmacy, Computers, "Ecology and Climate", Agriculture and Forestry. One explanation could be that the number of potential collaboration partners is re-stricted within Germany, but high outside Germany. Vice versa, the shares of co-authored pub-lications are lower in those scientific fields, in which Germany is specialized and which play an outstanding role in the German profile. Finding national co-authors might be easier here...|$|E
40|$|Teesid: Oktoobrirevolutsiooni järgne vene emigratsioon, mida teaduskirjanduses traditsiooniliselt nimeta takse esimeseks laineks, valgus mööda ilma laiali ning oli seninägematult arvukas, haarates kaasa miljoneid endise Tsaari-Venemaa elanikke. Sellele nähtusele on pühendatud tuhandeid humanitaartea duslikke, sotsioloogilisi, politoloogilisi jm uurimusi, mis kajastavad vene eksiilkultuuri eri tahke. Vene emigratsioon puudutas ka Eestit ning enamik käsitletud ilmingutest olid otseselt seotud siinse vene kogukonnaga, ent kohati väga erineva tähendusega. Käesoleva artikli eesmärk on lühidalt kirjeldada vene emigratsiooni sotsiaalset ja demograafilist struktuuri, selle keskusi, emigrantide rolli oma ja võõra kultuuri säilitamisel, põlvkondadevahelist aspekti, eelkõige kirjanduselus, ning haridusküsimusi. Lähemalt on käsitletud vene emigrantide rolli Eesti kultuuris muu maailma taustal.     SU M M A R Y   After the October Revolution {{a mass of}} emigrants, all {{citizens}} of the former Tsarist Russia dispersed in the world. In the scholarly literature this dispersal of upwards {{of a million people}} has come to be referred to as the first wave of Russian emigration. Thousands of scholarly articles from the humanities, sociology, political science and other disciplines have been devoted to various aspects of Russian exile culture: descriptions of exile cultural centres (including Paris, Berlin, Constantinople, Brazil, and the USA); various cultural phenomena (literature, film, theatre, fashion, journalism, art, etc.). As was true of the large part of Europe, the Russian emigration impacted Estonia, as it did across the rest of Europe; however, the fate of the Russian community in Estonia had strikingly original features. Some of these derived principally from Estonia’s position as a border state, {{as well as from the}} fact that even in the days of the Russian Empire, over 40000 Russians resided in Estonia. Theoretically, this should have made it easier for Russian emigrants to assimilate to Estonian conditions (for example, Russian schools existed from an earlier period, along with the requisite complement of teachers; Russian-language journalism existed, etc.). However, in reality, most of the promoters of local Russian culture emerged from among the emigrants, new settlers in Estonia. The purpose of this article is briefly to describe the social and demographic structure of the Russian emigration (military personnel will be treated separately) and the question of their legalization, which was solved in 1921 by the renowned Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen. At his initiative, the Intergovernmental Conference of the representatives of 34 nations that met in Geneva adopted the designation refugee, which for the time being only referred to stateless people of Russian origin. The legitimation of these people as refugees was contingent on the acceptance of a statute confirming the use of a heretofore nonexistent International identity document, the so-called Nansen Certificate. This certificate enabled Russian emigrants to claim refugee status in several nations, which included the attribution of rights and freedoms equal to those of citizens of these nations. Approximately 450 000 Nansen Certificates were issued over a period of several years. The article contains brief descriptions of centres of exile, the circumstances and chronology of their foundation, the perceived role of emigrants in the preservation of their own culture and a culture foreign to them. The intergenerational conflict that occurred in cultural, in particular literary life is discussed. Among other topics considered are issues <b>concerning</b> <b>publication,</b> journalistic activity, and educational activities; a brief consideration is given to the positions of different nations on the support and preservation of Russian-language education. A very important influence on Russian emigration was Vladimir Lenin’s so-called „gift“— the expulsion of over 200 scholars from Soviet Russia in the year 1921. A special place is accorded in this article to the role of Russian emigrants in Estonian culture, including the role played by Russian cultural figures (scholars, military personnel, artists, etc.) in building up the young Estonian Republic. The most active participation of Russians was occasioned by the creation of Estonia’s own legal system. In addition, Russians participated in organizing the Estonian postal system and local transportation. The role of Russian emigrants in the development of the educational system of the Estonian Republic is also significant. The article describes the leadership provided by the local Russian community, particularly in the establishment in 1924 of the tradition of Russian cultural festivals, which was then disseminated globally in Russian exile culture. Brief consideration is given to local Russian culture and its importance in the development of Estonian culture. The most important facet of this was the Estonian ballet, born of Russian traditions and experience. Reportedly the first professional ballet troupe was assembled in Tallinn in 1918 by Sessy Smironina-Sevun, but the first actual ballet was performed in 1922, premiering with Coppelia, choreographed by the Moscow Bolshoi Ballet prima ballerina Viktorina Krieger, who played the lead role, and was later to be the artistic director of the Estonia ballet. In 1919, Jevgenia Litvinova, a former ballerina from the Maria Theatre, founded the first ballet studio in Tallinn. Another topic addressed in the article is local publishing and literary activity in the Russian language. Besides Russian publishing houses (Bibliofiil, Koltso, Alfa, Russkaja Kniga), Estonian-language publishing houses printed Russian-language books, textbooks, magazines and newspapers. Up to the year 1940, 91 publishing houses in Estonia printed Russian-language material, many of them only a few Russian books. In addition to publication activities, literary circles were active at different times. Among them was the Revel Literary Circle, founded in 1898, the oldest and most unusual gathering place for educated people. Poets’ workshops in Tallinn and Tartu were among the more interesting societies in Estonia, aimed more specifically at poets of the younger generation. Members of the Tallinn workshop created their own almanac, „Nov“, and published a magazine, Polevõje Tsvetõ. All of these phenomena and problems must be situated in the context of the larger world. The Russian emigration is far from being merely a unique phenomenon of life and work outside of the homeland; indeed, it exerted a strong influence on the culture, scholarship, and literature of the countries of settlement. Among the greatest achievements of 20 th century humanity are the works of Nobel laureate and writer Ivan Bunin, prose writer Vladimir Nabokov, artists Marc Chagall, Konstantin Korovin, Aleksander Benois, and Vassily Kandinsky; the theories of Noble laureate, physicist and chemist Ilya Prigogine; the works of composers Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Igor Stravinsky; actor and theatre director Mikhail Chekhov; constructor Igor Sikorsky; chemist Vladimir Ipatjev. No less important in Estonian culture were poet Igor Severjanin, architect Aleksander Vladovski, representatives of Russian classical ballet (Tamara Beck, Jevgenia Litvinova); artists Anatoli Kaigorodov, Nikolai Kalmakov, and Andrei Jegorov...|$|E
