We show that the parallel and anti-parallel memory states of the spin-valve can be mapped onto a junction equilibrium phase of either zero or π by appropriate choice of the ferromagnet thicknesses, and that the magnetic Josephson junction can be written to either a zero-junction or π-junction state by application of write-fields of approximately 5 mT.

40|$|We {{investigate}} fast-pulse switching of in-plane-magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) within 3 -terminal {{devices in}} which spin-transfer torque {{is applied to}} the MTJ by the giant spin Hall effect. We measure reliable switching, with write error rates down to $ 10 ^{- 5 }$, using current pulses as short as just 2 ns in duration. This represents the fastest reliable switching reported to date for any spin-torque-driven magnetic memory geometry, and corresponds to a characteristic time scale that is significantly shorter than predicted possible within a macrospin model for in-plane MTJs subject to thermal fluctuations at room temperature. Using micromagnetic simulations, we show that in the 3 -terminal spin-Hall devices the Oersted magnetic field generated by the pulse current strongly modifies the magnetic dynamics excited by the spin-Hall torque, enabling this unanticipated performance improvement. Our results suggest that in-plane MTJs controlled by Oersted-field-assisted spin-Hall torque are a promising candidate for both cache memory applications requiring high speed and for <b>cryogenic</b> <b>memories</b> requiring low write energies.

40|$|Superconducting devices, which rely on {{modulating}} {{a complex}} superconducting order parameter in a Josephson junction, {{have been developed}} for low power logic operations, high-frequency oscillators, and exquisite magnetic field sensors. Magnetic devices, which rely on the modulation of a local vector order parameter- the local magnetic moment, have been used as memory elements, high-frequency spin-transfer oscillators, and magnetic field sensors. In a hybrid superconducting-magnetic device, these two order parameters compete, with one type of order suppressing the other. Recent interest in ultra-low-power, high-density <b>cryogenic</b> <b>memories</b> has spurred new interest in merging superconducting and magnetic behavior so as to exploit these two competing order parameters to produce novel switching elements. Here, we describe a reconfigurable two-layer magnetic spin valve integrated within a Josephson junction. Our measurements separate the suppression in the superconducting coupling due to the exchange field in the magnetic layers, which causes depairing of the supercurrent, from the suppression due to the magnetic field generated by the magnetic layers. The exchange field suppression of the superconducting order parameter is a tunable and switchable behavior that is also scalable to nanometer device dimensions. These devices are the first to demonstrate nonvolatile, size-independent switching of the Josephson coupling, in both magnitude and phase, and they may allow for the first nanoscale superconducting memory devices...|$|R
40|$|Josephson {{junctions}} with ferromagnetic layers {{are vital}} {{elements in a}} new class of <b>cryogenic</b> <b>memory</b> devices. One style of memory device contains a spin valve with one "hard" magnetic layer and one "soft" layer.

A candidate class of materials that fulfills these criteria is the Pd_ 1 -xFe_x alloy system with low Fe concentrations. We present studies of micron-scale elliptically-shaped Josephson junctions containing Pd_ 97 Fe_ 3 layers of varying thickness. By applying an external magnetic field, the critical current of the junctions are found to follow characteristic Fraunhofer patterns.

40|$|The {{combination}} of superconducting and magnetic materials to create novel superconducting devices has been {{motivated by the}} discovery of Josephson critical current (Ics) oscillations {{as a function of}} magnetic layer thickness and the demonstration of devices with switchable critical currents. However, none of the hybrid devices have shown any spintronic effects, such as spin-transfer torque, which are currently used in room-temperature magnetic devices, including spin-transfer torque random-access memory and spin-torque nano-oscillators. We have developed nanopillar Josephson junctions with a minimum feature size of 50 nm and magnetic barriers exhibiting magnetic pseudo-spin-valve behavior at 4 K. These devices allow current-induced magnetization switching that results in 20 -fold changes in Ics. The current-induced magnetic switching is consistent with spin-transfer torque models for room-temperature magnetic devices.

By applying an external magnetic field, the critical current of the junctions are found to follow characteristic Fraunhofer patterns, and display sharp switching behavior suggestive of single-domain magnets. The high quality of the Fraunhofer patterns enables us to extract the maximum value of the critical current even when the peak is shifted significantly outside the range of the data due to the magnetic moment of the ferromagnetic layer. The maximum value of the critical current oscillates {{as a function of the}} ferromagnetic barrier thickness, indicating transitions in the phase difference across the junction between values of zero and π.

40|$|Superconductivity and {{ferromagnetism}} are antagonistic {{forms of}} order, and rarely coexist. Many interesting new phenomena occur, however, in hybrid superconducting/ferromagnetic systems.

Such "pi-junctions" were first realized experimentally in 2001, {{and have been}} proposed as circuit elements for both high-speed classical superconducting computing and for quantum computing. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the phase state of a Josephson junction containing two ferromagnetic layers can be toggled between 0 and pi by changing the relative orientation of the two magnetizations.

The superconductor-insulator-superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIS'FS) MJJs are analyzed both experimentally and theoretically.

We fabricate Nb-Al/AlOx-Nb-PdFe-Nb SIS'FS MJJs using a co-processing approach {{with a combination of}} HYPRES and ISSP fabrication processes. The resultant SIS'FS structure with thin superconducting S'-layer is substantially affected by the ferromagnetic layer as a whole. We fabricate these type of junctions to reach the device compatibility with conventional SIS junctions used for superconducting SFQ electronics to ensure a seamless integration of MJJ-based circuits and SIS JJ-based ultra-fast digital SFQ circuits. We report experimental results for MJJs, demonstrating their applicability for superconducting memory and digital circuits. These MJJs exhibit IcRn product only ~ 30 % lower than that of conventional SIS junctions co-produced in the same fabrication. Analytical calculations for these SIS'FS structures are in a good agreement with the experiment. We discuss application of MJJ devices for memory and programmable logic circuits.

40|$|Josephson {{junctions}} containing two ferromagnetic layers {{are being}} considered for use in <b>cryogenic</b> <b>memory.</b> Our group recently demonstrated that the ground-state phase difference across such a junction with carefully chosen layer thicknesses could be controllably toggled between zero and π by switching the relative magnetization directions of the two layers between the antiparallel and parallel configurations. However, several technological issues must be addressed before those junctions {{can be used in}} a large-scale memory. Many of these issues can be more easily studied in single junctions, rather than in the Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) used for the phase-sensitive measurements. In this work, we report a comprehensive study of spin-valve junctions containing a Ni layer with a fixed thickness of 2. 0 nm, and a NiFe layer of thickness varying between 1. 1 and 1. 8 nm in steps of 0. 1 nm. We extract the field shift of the Fraunhofer patterns and the critical currents of the junctions in the parallel and antiparallel magnetic states, as well as the switching fields of both magnetic layers. We also report a partial study of similar junctions containing a slightly thinner Ni layer of 1. 6 nm and the same range of NiFe thicknesses.

40|$|Spin {{transfer}} torque (STT) based {{magnetic memory}} {{has been suggested}} as a potential <b>cryogenic</b> <b>memory</b> that can work {{in conjunction with a}} Josephson junction based logic device. Conventional spin transfer (CST) device, which employs a spin polarizer with its magnetization collinear with that of the free layer, {{has been shown to be}} too slow to be integrated with a Josephson junction device. On the other hand, orthogonal spin transfer (OST) device, which employs out-of-plane polarizer, as well as an in-plane polarizer, can be switched in the sub-nanosecond, t p [LESS-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 100 ps regime. The orthogonal spin polarization of the spin-polarized current injected by the out-of-plane polarizer ensures that the STT is maximized during the switching process. A persistent problem with the OST device, however, has been the low switching reliability. In my experimental works on low temperature OST device, I have demonstrated that the switching reliability issue can be resolved by enhancing the effective spin polarization of the in-plane polarizer. Using macrospin analysis, I have shown that the spin accumulation between the free layer and in-plane polarizer can account for the apparent enhancement of the spin polarization. Furthermore, I have outlined methods to improve the free layer, namely decrease the effective demagnetization field, so that reliable switching can occur in an OST device even in the absence of spin accumulation. My macrospin analysis of the spin-orbit torque (SOT) driven switching of the perpendicularly magnetized free layer has shown that it is possible to achieve fast sub-nanosecond switching, demonstrated in the OST devices, in this SOTdriven device as well. The damping-like torque component of the spin-orbit torque can excite the free layer efficiently to achieve fast switching. The SOTdriven device however shares similar switching reliability issues found in an OST device. I have proposed that either an increased damping of the free layer or significant field-like torque can solve the issue. I studied the SOT in a Tb-CoFe/heavy metal bilayer structure to determine if the material can be used to realize fast switching in a SOT-driven device. TbCoFe alloys have been shown to exhibit extremely large magnetic damping, as well as reduced saturation magnetization due to their ferri-magnetic ordering, making it an ideal choice as a free layer in a SOT-driven device. Measurements of effective fields in the bi-layer structure has revealed that, in addition to the aforementioned benefits, the strength of the SOT in the bilayer increases linearly as the anisotropy strength of the TbCoFe layer. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
