25|$|In the {{interest}} of achieving a controlled arrival at the desired position (SP) in a timely and accurate way, the <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> needs to be critically damped. A well-tuned position control system will also apply the necessary currents to the controlled motor so that the arm pushes and pulls as necessary to resist external forces trying to move {{it away from the}} required position. The setpoint itself may be generated by an external system, such as a PLC or other computer system, so that it continuously varies depending on the work that the robotic arm is expected to do. A well-tuned PID control system will enable the arm to meet these changing requirements to the best of its capabilities.|$|E

The owners recruited young New England farm girls from the surrounding area to work the machines at Waltham. The mill girls lived in company boarding houses and were subject to strict codes of conduct and supervised by older women. They worked about 80 hours per week. Six days per week, they woke to the factory bell at 4:40am and reported to work at 5am and had a half-hour breakfast break at 7am They worked until a lunch break of 30 to 45 minutes around noon. The workers returned to their company houses at 7pm when the factory closed. This system {{became known as the}} Waltham System.|$|E
40|$|In the paper, the Electrorheological fluid(ERF) is {{embedded}} in the pneumatic vibration isolator and three kinds of <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are designed, which experimental results are also compared. The first kind of the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is the semi-active <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which is designed for ERF controllable damper. The second kind of the <b>control</b> <b>system</b> is the active <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which is designed for the air servo position control of the platform of the pneumatic vibration isolator. The third kind of vibration isolator <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> is the combination of the active air servo <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and the ERF controllable damper. The experimental results are shown and compared to those of the passive pneumatic vibration isolators, the transmissibility of a vibration source to the isolation platform can be reduced by the first <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Using the second kind of the <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the transmissibility of the system is less than that of the first kind of the <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Using the third <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> the transmissibility becomes the least of these <b>control</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Breaking with the tradition of the closed and almost wholly British <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> of the English East India Company, The Madras Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1836 by Fredrick Adam, Governor of the Madras Presidency (the second oldest Chamber of Commerce in the country). Thereafter in a nod to the declining fortunes of the British textile owners and skilled workers who were still extant in the city, the Madras Trades Association was established in 1856, by which the old colonial families still involved in the skilled and textile trades were granted entry into the British and Indian financial trade system. In turn, the Madras Stock Exchange was established in 1920.|$|E

2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{negative}} feedback, the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car, for example, that matches a target speed such as the speed limit. The <b>controlled</b> <b>system</b> is the car; its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road (the disturbance). The car's speed (status) is measured by a speedometer. [...] The error signal is {{the departure of the}} speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed (set point). This measured error is interpreted by the controller to adjust the accelerator, commanding the fuel flow to the engine (the effector). The resulting change in engine torque, the feedback, combines with the torque exerted by the changing road grade to reduce the error in speed, minimizing the road disturbance.|$|E
