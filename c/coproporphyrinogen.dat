Series III uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin are obtained by incubating b-aminolevulinic acid (Ai) and chicken erythrocyte preparations (1 - 4). If the cell-free supernatant fluid from hemolyzed avian erythrocytes is used, the yield of uroporphyrin III and coproporphyrin III increases and there is correspondingly less protoporphyrin (3).

A 4 -propionate-substituted porphyrinogen, harderoporphyrinogen, {{which is also}} a substrate for <b>coproporphyrinogen</b> oxidase, is formed during the reaction. Synthetic [14 C]coproporphyrinogens III, specifically labelled in the carboxyl carbon atoms of either the 2 - or 4 -propionate substituents, were used to measure the rate of decarboxylation of each substituent by rat liver <b>coproporphyrinogen</b> oxidase. The experimental results, together with the recognition that in all known substrates of <b>coproporphyrinogen</b> oxidase only those propionate groups flanked by a specific arrangement of substituents are decarboxylated, indicate that the 4 -propionate group of <b>coproporphyrinogen</b> III cannot be attacked until the 2 -propionate group has been decarboxylated. Production of 14 CO 2 from the substrate labelled in the 2 -propionate group therefore measures the formation of harderoporphyrinogen, whereas 14 CO 2 from the 4 -propionate-labelled substrate measures protoporphyrinogen IX formation. The rate of harderoporphyrinogen formation is about twice that of protoporphyrinogen, and this ratio is unchanged by varying the concentration of <b>coproporphyrinogen</b> III or by competitive inhibition of the enzyme.
