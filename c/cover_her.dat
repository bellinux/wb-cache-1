5|$|Susanna's third husband—Wasiullah Khan (also {{known as}} Musafir) (Irrfan Khan)—is a soft-spoken, {{thoughtful}} poet {{by day and}} a sado-masochist by night. Susanna tries to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> bruises with makeup; her servants cannot bear to see her mistreated, and advise her {{to get rid of}} him. Khan is ultimately interred in a snowy Kashmiri grave.|$|E
5|$|Courtship {{is often}} aerial and often {{involves}} pheromones. Butterflies then {{land on the}} ground or on a perch to mate. Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital opening to prevent her from mating again.|$|E
5|$|She was {{selected}} {{to play in a}} four-game test series in Canberra against Japan's wheelchair basketball team held in March 2002, the first Australian hosted international for the team since the 2000 Summer Paralympics, and at the 2002 World Cup event in Japan, but did not do so. She quit the sport after being told that neither insurance nor the Australian Paralympic Committee would <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> against injury during a tour in the United States, as her tendonitis was considered a there, and she would have to pay the costs for injury treatment herself. She quit wheelchair basketball. She had a child, which caused a recurrence of her original illness.|$|E

5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy enough to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck {{turned around to}} face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away.|$|E

5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E

5|$|Hilde {{appears as}} a slender woman with long, red hair. Her primary {{appearance}} encases her fully in form-fitting body armor, with red and black fabric underneath. A wolf's head, the character's family symbol, extends from the right pauldron and covers her helmet's visor, while the left pauldron is covered by red fabric, fastened {{to the center of}} her breastplate's collar underneath a large brooch. Beneath the armor, a red coat covers her torso, the tail of which extends past her waist. Her alternate character design consists of a long, blue dress, extending to her feet and neck, exposing her shoulders and angled towards her right leg. White gloves, shoes, and stockings <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> arms and legs, while a darker colored sash surrounds her waist and midsection, also angled to the right.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The {{disappearance}} of Figueroa sparked controversy about media coverage because cable news channels, such as CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel, neglected to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> story {{in favor of}} Natalee Holloway, a Caucasian teen missing {{on the island of}} Aruba. Some observers protested that Figueroa's case was similar to the Laci Peterson case (which also covered the same timespan) and thus deserved greater attention, implying that race was a factor in the lack of coverage.|$|E
25|$|Ogilby, aged 31 or 32 at {{the time}} of her death, was buried in Umgall Cemetery, Templepatrick, County Antrim. Her {{children}} Sharlene and Derek were put into care. The Ogilby family received only £149 compensation from the State to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> funeral expenses. It was later revealed that Ogilby had planned to relocate to Edinburgh, Scotland as soon as her infant son, Derek, was released from hospital (on account of his premature birth).|$|E

25|$|Often, Webb and Hitchcock use {{no music}} {{at all to}} undergird a romantic scene. The two-and-a-half minute kiss begins with distant music when it commences out on the balcony, but goes silent when the couple move inside. Other times, they flout {{conventional}} wisdom: when Alicia asks the band to stop playing stuffy waltzes and liven things up with Brazilian music to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> trip to the wine cellar with Devlin, Latin dance tunes replace the expected suspense cue.|$|E
25|$|On December 25, 1840, Hannah Hanson Kinney {{was acquitted}} of the murder charge and {{released}} from prison. The jury took {{a total of three}} minutes to deliberate on a verdict. She sold off her millinery shop to <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> late husband's gambling debts, which totaled $2,000. Once the debt was settled, Hanson was left with $89 in total. Hanson's brother-in-law, Albert Leach, who had visited her while in prison, mortgaged his horse and carriage to get Hanson and her three children back on their feet financially.|$|E
25|$|Hanafi: The Hanafi {{school does}} not {{consider}} a woman's face to be awrah; however it is still obligatory (wajib) {{for a woman to}} <b>cover</b> <b>her</b> face. While the Hanafi school has not completely forbidden a male's gaze towards a female's face when there exists absolutely no fear of attraction, the woman has no way of knowing whether the gazes directed towards her are free of desire or not, especially when she is out in public. The Hanafi school has thus obliged women to cover their faces in front of strangers.|$|E
