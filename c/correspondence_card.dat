A logotype symbol is created {{on the basis of}} an element from the Celtic art, and a graphic material thatharmonies with this ideal of style is built around the symbol. A unique visiting <b>card,</b> <b>correspondence</b> cardand letterhead is produced to strengthen the identity of DUCIS outwards. The work proceeds with an international education folder which is an important element in the marketingwork for the MA-education which starts in the autumn of 2003. Two posters, one for the opening ofDUCIS in may 2003 and one for a conference in 2004, are produced. Finally, a redesign of the book coverfor NIS, Nordic Irish Studies, is carried out.

The conclusion is that the work has been quite successful and that this, to a largeextent, depended on an engaged and supporting commissioner. The commissioner also is very satisfi edwith the results. The in-depth studies of the project is about the art and design of the Celtic culture throughout history. The text gives an account for the history and expressions of Celtic art from its birth, 2800 years ago, untilits death in 13 th century Ireland and Scotland.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} an isomorphism between the card game SetR © and the four-dimensional vector space {{over the three}} element field, F 3, to draw various results about the game. By creating a one-to-one and onto <b>correspondence</b> between the <b>cards</b> and points in F 4 3, we find that a collectable set {{is in fact a}} line in the vector space. Using this, we are able to determine the total number of collectable sets that exist in the game, as well as find the maximum number of cards that can be played without having a collectable set. Furthermore, we can simulate the game using the Monte Carlo method to find the probability of having a collectable set in a random selection of cards from the deck. 1. The Game SetR© The game SetR © was invented in 1974 by geneticist Marsha Jean Falco in an attempt to determine if epilepsy was an inherited disease in German Shepherds. She found through recording information about each dog that certain characteristics were grouped together. Instead of rewriting data, she decided to draw symbols on file cards to represent different gene combinations found in each dog. Her work of observing the different symbol combinations inspired her to create the game SetR © [1]. Today, the game SetR © is composed of 81 cards, each with a unique image. To play, one must lay down a 3 x 4 grid cards, face up. The purpose of the game is to collect three cards that meet a specific criteria, thus forming what we call a collectable set. Each card in the game has one quality from each of the four Figure 1. A collectable set containing all the same shape, and all different colors, number of symbols, and fill...|$|R
