50|$|With {{the use of}} {{prenatal}} ultrasonographic imaging, {{early detection}} of abnormal brain development in the fetus with MDS can be seen. At birth, facial dysmorphism can {{be present in the}} infant. Young children, when affected, can suffer from feeding difficulties, severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, and seizures. An early way to detect this syndrome in children can be by brain MRI which can show the image of smooth brain, also called lissencephaly. Children with this syndrome may remain underdiagnosed because of how rare it is, and how common it is to have facial features that appear to be dysmorphic. They are highly variable and not easily recognizable because this syndrome shares distinct external features (phenotype) similar to more common syndromes. Lack of relevant family history can also prevent suspicion in many cases.FDNA provides a service that in turn increases the chances of detecting these distinct characteristics, which, when shown to a geneticist, can assist in reaching the right medical diagnosis.If a couple has had one child with MDS, they can be offered prenatal diagnosis in future pregnancies. This option is particularly important for the 20% of MDS families where one parent carries a balanced <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangement.</b> The risk for these couples to have another affected child depends on the exact type of <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangement</b> present and may be as high as 25-33%. For families in which both parents' chromosomes are normal, the risk of having another child with MDS is low (1% or less). Either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis can be used early in a pregnancy to obtain a small sample of cells from the developing embryo for chromosome studies. Early prenatal diagnosis by ultrasound is not reliable because the brain is normally smooth until later in pregnancy. Couples who are considering prenatal diagnosis should discuss the risks and benefits of this type of testing with a geneticist or genetic counselor.|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} 15 years {{molecular}} cytogenetic techniques have been extensively {{used to study}} primate evolution. Molecular probes were helpful to distinguish mammalian chromosomes and chromosome segments {{on the basis of}} their DNA content rather than solely on morphological features such as banding patterns. Various landmark rearrangements have been identified for most of the nodes in primate phylogeny while chromosome banding still provides helpful reference maps. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques were used with probes of different complexity including chromosome painting probes, probes derived from chromosome sub-regions and in the size of a single gene. Since more recently, in silico techniques have been applied to trace down evolutionarily derived <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements</b> by searching the human and mouse genome sequence databases. More detailed breakpoint analyses of <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements</b> that occurred during higher primate evolution also gave some insights into the molecular changes in <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements</b> that occurred in evolution.

The progress in various molecular and molecular-cytogenetic approaches including the recently launched chimpanzee genome project suggests that these new tools will have a significant impact on the further understanding of human genome evolution.

40|$|The ends of {{chromosomes}} in mammals, called telomeres, {{are composed}} of a 6 base pair repeat sequence, TTAGGG, which is added on by the enzyme telomerase. In combination with a protein complex called shelterin, these telomeric repeat sequences form a cap that protects the ends of chromosomes. Due to insufficient telomerase expression, telomeres shorten gradually with each cell division in human somatic cells, which limits {{the number of times}} they can divide. The extensive cell division involved in cancer cell progression therefore requires that cancer cells must acquire the ability to maintain telomeres, either through expression of telomerase, or through an alternative mechanism involving recombination. It is commonly thought that the source of many <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements</b> in cancer cells {{is a result of the}} extensive telomere shortening that occurs prior to the expression of telomerase. However, despite the expression of telomerase, tumor cells can continue to show chromosome instability due to telomere loss. Dysfunctional telomeres in cancer cells can result from oncogene-induced replication stress, which results in double-strand breaks (DSBs) at fragile sites, including telomeres. DSBs near telomeres are especially prone to <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements,</b> because telomeric regions are deficient in DSB repair. The deficiency in DSB repair near telomeres is also an important mechanism for ionizing radiation-induced replicative senescence in normal human cells. In addition, DSBs near telomeres can result in chromosome instability in mouse embryonic stem cells, suggesting that telomere loss can contribute to heritable <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements.</b> Consistent with this possibility, telomeric regions in humans are highly heterogeneous, and <b>chromosome</b> <b>rearrangements</b> near telomeres are commonly involved in human genetic disease.
