25|$|Arkansas {{scored on}} its first drive when running back Knile Davis took the ball in from six yards out. The Hogs also scored on their next possession, a Broderick Green run over right guard for a touchdown. On the ensuing possession, EMU quarterback Kyle McMahon was intercepted by Freddie Burton, who {{returned}} the ball 50 yards for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Ryan Mallett would find Joe Adams on a ten-yard <b>crossing</b> <b>pattern</b> for a score. Following a missed Alex Tejada field goal, Patrick Treppa would punt for EMU, leaving the Razorbacks with the ball on their own one-yard line. However, on the next play, Broderick Green broke through the line and rumbled 99 yards for a touchdown. The score was the longest play in Arkansas Razorbacks history, longer than the previous record of 90 yards set by Billy Moore against Tulsa back in 1962. Following another EMU punt, Mallet would find Adams for a 78-yard touchdown pass, giving the Hogs a 42-0 lead as the teams went to halftime. The Razorback defense did not allow EMU a single first down in the first half.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] The {{surfaces}} of 63 extracted premolar teeth were processed with intense ultrashort laser pulses (λ[*]=[*] 795 nm; pulse duration, 120 fs; repetition rate, 1 kHz) to produce <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with different pitches (s) in the micrometer range {{in order to}} evaluate the influence of such microstructures on the shear bond strengths of orthodontic brackets to enamel. The samples were classified in nine groups corresponding to the control group (raw samples) and eight different laser-processed groups (<b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with s increasing from 15 to 180 μm). Brackets were luted with TransbondTM XT adhesive resin to all the samples; after 72 h, they all were submitted to strength test in a universal testing machine. Additionally, {{a third of the}} samples underwent morphological analysis of the debonded surface by means of scanning electron microscope microscopy and an analysis of the failure mode based on the adhesive remnant index. The results showed that enamel microstructuring with ultrashort laser pulses remarkably increase the bond strength of brackets. Dense <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> (s[*] [*] 90 μm) give rise to smaller improvements of the bond strength. A strong correlation of this behavior with the predominant failure mode in both scenarios was found. So far, the best compromise between suitable adhesive efficiency, processing time minimization, and enamel surface preservation suggests the performance of <b>cross</b> <b>patterns</b> with pitches in the order of 90 μm.

50|$|The {{original}} {{design for the}} M1 helmet {{was approved by the}} United States military on June 9th, 1941. The helmet shell, known as the Hadfield manganese steel helmet, was first manufactured by the McCord Radiator Company, whereas the fiber liner interior was designed and produced by Hawley Products Company. The purpose of the Hawley liner was to serve as a cushion between the wearer and the steel shell. The fiber material interior consisted of a finished green cardboard, with an interior suspension. The interior suspension was shaped as a webbed <b>crossing</b> <b>pattern.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{scissor lift}} {{is a type}} of {{platform}} that can usually only move vertically. The mechanism to achieve this is the use of linked, folding supports in a criss-cross [...] "X" [...] pattern, known as a pantograph (or scissor mechanism). The upward motion is achieved by the application of pressure to the outside of the lowest set of supports, elongating the <b>crossing</b> <b>pattern,</b> and propelling the work platform vertically. The platform may also have an extending [...] "bridge" [...] to allow closer access to the work area, because of the inherent limits of vertical-only movement.|$|E

50|$|A HP/UHP {{metamorphism}} {{caused by}} subduction at the Silurian/Devonian boundary was {{followed in the}} Devonian/Mississippian by polyphase dynamometamorphism due to crustal shortening. The latter developed a <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> in the resulting structures - the well known Variscan x. The intensive nappe-stacking during continental collision transported high-grade terranes in a southerly direction over less deformed units creating the impression of an inverted metamorphism - a feature so ubiquitous in the Massif Central. The last two deformational phases in the Pennsylvanian formed under extensional stresses and again produced a <b>cross</b> <b>pattern</b> in the resulting structures. The strong orogenic extension and final collapse triggered decompressional melting which led to pronounced granitisation and associated mineralisation mainly of the Au - Sb - W - type.|$|R

While the Colts managed to score a late touchdown, the Jets' 16-7 triumph is considered to be one of the greatest upsets in the history of professional sports in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} measurement, development, {{and consequences of}} subtyping in stereotype change. All three studies presented subjects with a pattern of stereotype-disconfirming information that was either concentrated within a few or dispersed across several group members. Experiment 1 <b>crossed</b> this <b>pattern</b> factor with order of rating and memory tasks and identified a new memory-based measure of subtyping (clustering of items in free recall by sub-category). Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were lower and clustering scores higher in the concentrated condition, irrespective of order of tasks. Experiment 2 <b>crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> with whether stimulus information was blocked-by-person or unblocked. Ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits were higher when information was both dispersed and blocked; subtyping was strong only when information was both concentrated and blocked. Experiment 3 <b>crossed</b> <b>pattern</b> with number of subtypes (one vs two), and found lower ratings on stereotype-inconsistent traits and higher subtyping in both the concentrated vs dispersed, and the two-vs one-subtype conditions. Results are {{discussed in terms of}} the nature of subtyping and some limitations of the paradigm used. (C) 1994 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R
