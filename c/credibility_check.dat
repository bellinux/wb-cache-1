The model has the potential of facilitating the devising and implementation of accident prevention measures by pre-construction project participants to mitigate the H&S impact of CPFs. The model also has the potential of facilitating accident investigation on projects, particularly root cause analysis, thus enabling the contribution of CPFs and hence the contribution of pre-construction project participants in accident occurrence to be ascertained. Further research in this area is also encouraged to augment the utility of the model in supporting pre-construction H&S risk mitigation...|$|E

However, many people get news from social media platforms and trust the information they read (Turcotte, York, Irving, Scholl, & Pingree, 2015). Crisis theories suggest strong relationships are less affected by crisis situations, and relationships are heavily based on trust (Broom, Casey, & Ritchey, 1997; Coombs, 2000; Coombs & Holladay, 2006; Ledingham, 2003).

In both steps 1 and 2 of the study, themes identified by one (group of) informant(s) were introduced into subsequent interviews to enable theoretical sampling. To enhance credibility, we furthermore used initially identified descriptive codes in step 1 (i.e., expert interviews) as points for discussion in the focus group interviews with stakeholders in step 2. This not only allowed for a <b>credibility</b> <b>check</b> of the initial analysis but also allowed for continuous evaluation of achievement of adequate information power (i.e., saturation) [27].

Ultimately, I put forth the ‘‘Client’s Helical Path’’ as a theoretical model grounded in clients' unsuccessful therapy experiences. The theory subsumes four subcategories: three cyclically-related subcategory processes (Embarking, Evaluating, and Ending), and a fourth category (Familiarity) that provides a temporal/experiential dimension. Clients embark upon a course of therapy with certain expectations; they later evaluate their experience {{on the basis of}} these expectations, and then end therapy when they adjudicate it as not sufficiently successful. Clients' familiarity with the enterprise of therapy is enhanced with each successive therapy experience, and this familiarity implicates clients' subsequent expectations, evaluations, and endings. The theory contextualizes clients’ experiences of unsuccessful therapy at the level of the individual, rather at the level of the course of therapy, thereby providing an understanding for how past therapy experiences influence future ones. This feature of the theory represents a significant departure from and contribution to the existing psychotherapy research literature. I discuss the unique nature and utility of the theory, its overlap with existing empirical findings, as well as its limitations. I suggest directions for future research, and I provide multiple <b>credibility</b> <b>checks...</b>|$|R

Method: Critical Incident Technique was employed in this study. Interviews were conducted with women who were actively battling anorexia, or had struggled {{with it in the}} past, and who have either fully completed, or were in the process, of completing a service transition from adolescent mental health services to adult mental health services. Results: There were seven participants in this study. From the seven interviews 285 critical incidents to transition services were identified and extracted. Eighty-one incidents were found to be helpful, 121 were found to hinder, and 83 were wish list items that participants {{would have liked to have}} seen happen during their transition to adult mental health services for eating disorders.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the Clinical Psychologists' religious beliefs and their clinical work with Older Adult clients. Literature Review: The literature review draws attention to the importance of the religiosity of Clinical Psychologists who work with Older Adult clients. This is in contrast to previous research, which has tended to focus on the religious beliefs of clients. Likewise, previous research has focussed on adults, neglecting Older Adults as a clinical group. The need for research addressing the influence of the clinician's religiosity is identified. Method: The approach is Grounded Theory methodology (social constructionist revision). A method in-between the 'abbreviated* and 'full' versions is used, with negative case sampling built into the design through the recruitment of four respondents who described themselves as religious and four as non-religious. The approach is justified using epistemological and empirical arguments. Analysis: Textual descriptions and embedded quotations are used to present four super-ordinate, and eight sub-ordinate, categories describing {{the relationship between}} respondents' religious beliefs and their clinical practice with Older Adults. Findings are summarised by the titles of super-ordinate categories, as follows: "The issue of the compatibility or incompatibility of religion and Clinical Psychology"", "Disclosure to colleagues: anticipated embarrassment", "The relationship between the Older Adult client's religious views and the Clinical Psychologist's religious views" and "The relationship between the Clinical Psychologist's own religious views and their clinical practice with Older Adults". Diagrams are constructed to demonstrate the relationships between categories, as identified by respondents. A resultant main diagram is derived and shown. Discussion: A simplified version of the main diagram is presented, distilling categories generated by analysis into 'distal' and 'proximal' factors. Implications for clinical practice and for future research are discussed {{in the context of this}} tentative model. <b>Credibility</b> <b>checks</b> and limitations are reviewed and conclusions drawn...|$|R

Much {{has been accomplished}} with LDA in compressible flows despite the difficulties posed by the high speeds and additionally by the rapid spatial changes in speed or flow direction. The successful {{application of}} the technique is difficult because the signal to noise ratios (SNRs) are fairly low even {{under the best of}} conditions and highly variable because of variations in particle size and particle location with the sensing volume. The available signal processing is not very effective in discarding signals that are too noisy to provide an accurate velocity measurement. The temptation is to work with particles which are too large to adequately follow the flow but which provide cleaner signals due to increased scattering intensities. For the data to have <b>credibility,</b> some <b>check</b> on the particle response must be made for a given facility and LDA system. The capability, if developed, of being able to determine the size of each particle upon which a measurement is based and the SNR of the corresponding signal burst would be extremely valuable in reducing much of the uncertainty now present in LDA compressible flow measurements...|$|R
40|$|Success {{or failure}} in {{teaching}} and learning is often associated with the level of expertise in individual faculty or motivation and abilities in students. Rarely do departments or the university as a whole share responsibility (Biggs, 2001). A potential gateway to change is learning teams, an abridged title for learning-oriented course design teams (McAlpine, 2002 a). Learning teams are intentionally organized around course design projects that evolve over time to foster learning from experience. They provide an opportunity to deliberate on course decisions with a strategic group of people [...] -faculty, pedagogical experts, instructional technologists, librarians, and students [...] -for the purpose of initiating change. Learning teams represent a systematic process for linking people to new communities of practice, crossing boundaries we may not even know exist. The research context is McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Internal funding was provided to increase access to a core faculty development workshop on Course Design and Teaching (CDT). The CDT workshop is a five-day intensive experience that provides a framework for helping professors think intentionally about their instructional decisions (Saroyan & Amundsen, 2004). A major challenge in the workshop over the years has been how to model and make explicit issues around the role of technology in instruction, and more recently information resources, while preserving the theoretical integrity of the workshop. The redesign of the CDT workshop with these goals in mind presented an opportunity to experiment formally with the learning team strategy. A learning team met for one year, generating and reflecting on the results of three design iterations. Grounded theory analysis of interviews with participants proceeded through an initial searching phase looking for variation in perspectives and dominant themes followed by focused coding and the seeking of patterns. Findings were validated through triangulation of different data sources (interviews, observations, documents, products) and two <b>credibility</b> <b>checks</b> (one with a colloquium of the learning team and another with an external consultant). Only findings validated with participants are cited. A conceptual model of learning teams emerged with a core concept captured in the phrase "a systematic way of talking to each other" and seven related concepts: context sensitivity, mutual goals, diversity, design framework, dialogue, collective self-reflection, and momentum. The model integrates literature from the fields of faculty development, university course design, and educational technology. What fundamentally happened in the learning team? A WebCT environment now houses a dynamic record of the CDT workshop. People in the Libraries are cued to how they can best inform the course design process. Team members have a deepened awareness and shared commitment to multidisciplinary collaboration. However, in concentrating on achieving explicit goals the team failed to reflect collectively on their own learning that occurred. Focusing attention on team processes provides a way forward on this research agenda. The real problem will lie in scaling out the learning team strategy. A new reality is needed in the professoriate to move people from individual responsibility to collective responsibility in university course design, not as groups of experts but as multidisciplinary teams...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} {{research}} conducted with Technical and Further Education (TAFE) teachers from Queensland and Western Australia. The research {{is located at}} the intersection where teachers’ identities met the discourse of new vocationalism. Scholars have highlighted the tensions that this discourse has produced in the relationships between TAFE and its teachers, and noted that TAFE teachers are pressured to change their subjectivities to reflect themselves more effectively as workers in an educational market focused on economic imperatives. This is often in contrast to these teachers’ personal notions of themselves as liberal educators, with a focus on lifelong learning, personal transformation, collaborative relationships and social responsibility. This research was driven by the possibility that the concept of ‘critical spirit’ might provide a means for TAFE teachers to stand their ground in relation to the continued reshaping of the TAFE teacher terrain produced by the adoption of the new vocational discourse. This interpretative research was conceptualised by synthesising sociocultural perspectives of discourse as a reality building tool (Gee, 2005) with notions of critical thinker dispositions referred to as critical spirit (Siegel, 1988; Oxman-Michelli, 1992). The elements of critical spirit: openmindedness, independence of mind, wholeheartedness, intellectual responsibility and respect for others (Oxman-Michelli, 1992) were used as central components {{to the development of a}} coding framework for the explication of critical spirit from TAFE teacher artefacts and in positioning critical spirit as a discourse. An examination of 12 TAFE teacher case narrative artefacts revealed that elements of critical spirit were evident. Subsequent participant <b>credibility</b> <b>checks</b> and semi-structured interviews provided diverse data related to teacher embodiment of a critical spirit in relation to the building of certain teacher identities. In some cases participants expressed that their identities were bolstered by engaging in a critical spirit discourse, others cautioned its public embodiment, suggesting that deploying critical spirit made them more visible to surveillance and control. The major finding of this research was that an explicit engagement with a critical spirit discourse was of value to these TAFE teachers. Furthermore, this critical spirit discourse was seen to perform the work of a borderland discourse (Gee, 2005; Alsup, 2006). It afforded a means to traverse the terrain “between disparate personal and professional subjectivities” (Alsup, 2006, p. 5). The research also uncovered other discourses pertinent to participant artefacts. These were identified as a test of fortitude discourse and a community of support discourse. It was postulated that these would extend the critical spirit discourse by adding to Oxman-Michelli’s (1992) five elements of critical spirit. The findings suggested little evidence to support this position. The significance of this research was in: (a) the production of a methodological construct for explicating particular notions of critical spirit; (b) its contribution to furthering understandings of the professional lives of TAFE teachers and their work world; and (c) the value that a critical spirit discourse had in strengthening these TAFE teachers’ notions of themselves and their effectiveness. Its contribution to substantial knowledge was in its expansion of our understanding of teacher identities within the Vocational Education and Training sector in Australia. ...|$|R

Member checks completed after a study are completed by sharing all of the findings with the participants involved. This allows participants to critically analyze the findings and comment on them. The participants either affirm that the summaries reflect their views, feelings, and experiences, or that they do not reflect these experiences. If the participants affirm the accuracy and completeness, then the study is said to have <b>credibility.</b> These member <b>checks</b> are not without fault, but serve to decrease the incidence of incorrect data and the incorrect interpretation of data.

40|$|The aim of all {{clinical}} research must surely be to assess an intervention or process or relationship between variables, ultimately {{in order to}} be able to improve clinical practice and healthcare for patients/consumers. As such, evidence gathered must have external validity (generalisability) and it must be relevant to clinical practice. It can be seen therefore that research into acupuncture for pain relief is an inherently difficult task, which requires much sensitivity and careful planning in order to minimise error when drawing conclusions. The researcher needs to adequately address problems such as sample size, blinding, randomisation and appropriate use of control and treatment. It is also most important to be able to clarify that the placebo (if used) is credible to the patient. The field of acupuncture has been overwhelmed with hundreds of sub-standard trials and much doubt still surrounds the issue of efficacy. Few good quality rigorous trials exist to support the use of acupuncture for pain relief in general. It has also been noted that the question of long-term efficacy has not been assessed by the many trials and this needs to be addressed prior to its acceptance. Further well conducted rigorous trials are therefore needed, utilising the lessons learnt through the substantial number of previous trials, in order to adequately assess the efficacy of acupuncture for painful conditions. Such trials must therefore: Utilise a placebo control. Be randomised and stratified. Ensure patient blinding. Use self completed outcome measures and blinded assessors. Have sufficient and well validated outcome measures. <b>Check</b> <b>credibility</b> of treatment. Have a well defined entry criteria which includes a single condition only. Have a long term follow up. Enrol sufficient subjects, the number to be determined by a power calculation. Provide adequate acupuncture treatment as would be found in clinical practice.

In this way good quality trials can be undertaken which will yield reliable results and therefore add meaningful data to the body of knowledge appertaining to the effectiveness of acupuncture...|$|R
40|$|In the 1970 s in {{southern}} NSW, Australia, information {{was delivered to}} farmers through the transfer of technology (TOT) model. It was 'top down' with knowledge generated by researchers being passed onto farmers by extension officers. Farmers' knowledge was not respected by research and extension workers. In contrast Cropcheck is a farmer participatory program which benchmarks farmer crops to identify practices for lifting yields. With TOT there was good adoption of single factor technologies such as wheat varieties but by the late 1970 s to early 1980 s wheat yields were stagnant or only slowly improving. There was the realisation that farmers had valuable knowledge and that multiple factors were needed to increase productivity. To address these needs in developing countries many farmer participatory models were developed. This paper, based on my experiences as an extension officer, records development in a developed country of a farmer participatory crop benchmarking model called Cropcheck. This program benchmarks farmer crops to identify the checks (best practices) related to high yields. It {{has been successful in}} lifting crop yields and profitability. This paper discusses the development of the model for irrigated wheat, i. e. the Finley Five Tonne Irrigated Wheat Club (referred to hereafter as "Wheat Club") and adaption of the model for irrigated subterranean clover pasture, i. e. Subcheck. Since farmer participatory extension theory was undeveloped at that time, the development of the model was an intuitive learning process. The process was a planning, action and review cycle. Several years involving crop monitoring, farmer training, crop recording and reviewing results were needed to identify the objective checks consistently improving yields and gross margins. The results showed the more checks adopted the higher the yield and profitability. Farmers were trained in the learning steps of observing, monitoring, measuring, interpreting and recording their own crop practices. Farmer discussion groups were important for communication. Cropcheck has high farmer <b>credibility</b> because the <b>checks</b> are identified from farmer crops. Over a period of 6 Â years, yields of the "Wheat Club" increased by 50 %. With Subcheck the problem of reddened subclover and inconsistent production disappeared. The Cropcheck model has been adapted for many crops in eastern Australia.

40|$|It is {{sometimes}} {{necessary to make}} validity judgments about information with which we are unfamiliar, because we have no factual knowledge about the event. Under these circumstances, subjective evidence, such as whether the statement has been seen or heard in the past, {{may be used to}} judge validity. Previous research has shown that the repetition of unfamiliar, but plausible statements increases the judged validity of the statements. In other words, the more one hears a particular statement, the more one believes it to be true. The present study has been designed to explore this 2 ̆ 2 truth effect. 2 ̆ 2 The first experiment examined the influence of increasing age on the truth effect and recognition of repeated statements. Younger and older adults were asked to rate a series of statements for validity. Two weeks later, the subjects rated a similar list containing some new statements along with statements repeated from the first session. Subjects were also given a task to assess their recognition of repeated statements. The results indicated that older adults demonstrated the truth effect {{to a greater extent than}} younger adults, despite the fact that their recognition scores were much less accurate. These results indicate that repetition and recognition have independent influences on perceived validity. A second experiment was conducted to examine the effect of feedback on the truth effect and recognition judgments. It was proposed that ratings for repeated items in the second session would increase in judged validity due to the unintentional influence of familiarity. If feedback information was deliberately recollected, this misattribution of familiarity to <b>credibility</b> could be <b>checked</b> for false statements. Subjects were asked to rate statements for validity, and feedback as to the actual truth value of some of the items was given in the first session. Subjects rated repeated and new items in the second session for validity, as well as performing a source recognition task. The results of the second experiment showed that, again, both young and older adults demonstrate the truth effect. For young subjects, true statements were rated the truest, followed by non-feedback, nonrepeated, and false statements. The same pattern was found for older subjects, except that the false and non-repeated statements were rated similarly. As in the first experiment, older subjects were less accurate than young subjects at recognizing the source of repeated statements. Again, repetition and recognition were found to influence the truth effect independently. The results of this study indicate that the effects of repetition may influence older adults more than young adults, due to their less efficient memory for source. This deficit in source memory would serve to make older individuals less skeptical about the credibility of their knowledge, and thus more susceptible to false beliefs...|$|R
40|$|MA (Research Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Intergenerational {{relationships}} {{refer to}} relationships between people in alternate generational groups. The {{increasing numbers of}} older {{people all over the}} world highlight the need for studies on psychological processes that enhance well-being through intergenerational relationships. People from different generations are co-dependent for care and support. Older people constitute a diverse group: some may experience a depletion of energy, physical, financial and emotional resources, while others have good health, financial security and stable social support networks. What all people, including older people, have in common, however, is a need for meaningful relationships. This makes it worthwhile to explore the experiences of relationships with younger people from the perspective of older people. This study is important because research indicates that the relationships between older people (60 years and older) and adolescents and young adults are strained. An initial study on intergenerational care experiences from the perspective of people aged 60 years and older and young people in the middle-adolescent developmental phase (at 16 years) revealed a lack of empathy from the older generation towards the younger generation. It was decided to focus in this study on intergenerational empathy specifically. Mutual empathetic understanding is suggested as a means to overcome challenges between members of generations that have to compete for limited resources, especially in low-resource areas such as the specific rural African community studied in Vaalharts, South Africa. It is suggested that empathy could increase intergenerational understanding between older and younger people dealing with their respective developmental challenges. The research was conducted in a community with high levels of poverty and limited physical and material resources. The study is qualitative in nature and used an interpretive descriptive research design. This design provided the basis to explore the perceptions of empathy by using theoretical constructs to derive at an understanding of experiences in the community and specifically those of the older generation. The 18 participants were all older than 60 and Setswana speaking but were also proficient in Afrikaans and English. Eight of the participants (1 man and 7 women) participated in study using the Mmogo-method®. This is a projective technique that uses visual presentations to gain a deeper insight into meaning that is developed between the participants. For the Mmogo-method®, participants (older people) were invited to make visual representations of how they experienced care in relation to young people in the middle adolescent developmental phase, at around 16 years. A further 10 participants (4 men and 6 woman), who were not part of the Mmogo-method® project, participated in semi-structured interviews. These interviews provided them the freedom to elaborate on their own unique experiences. Semi- structured interviews also provide a certain amount of structure for the interviewer to make sure that detailed information on empathy in arising relevant conversations are obtained. Data were analysed using an inductive approach as well as thematic analysis of experiences about intergenerational care: empathy (and specifically, a lack of empathy) emerged as a recurrent theme. The literature shows a connection between empathy and care, which accordingly served as the focus of this study. The data were further subjected to a directed form of content analysis (deductive category application) which was conducted after literature and theory on intergenerational empathy have been consulted. A visual analysis was conducted on the visual presentations that the participants built as part of the Mmogo- method®. Trustworthiness was ensured by using the principles proposed by Guba’s model of trustworthiness and that include: obtaining thick descriptions, ensuring <b>credibility,</b> member <b>checking</b> and ensuring confirmabillity. Ethical consent to conduct this study was given by the Human Research Ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences in the North-West University (reference number NWU- 00053 - 10 -S 1). A gatekeeper was used to gain access to the community studied and participants gave their informed consent. The lack of empathy from the perspective or the older people emerged from the way in which older people viewed the relationship with the young solely from their own perspective and from their inability to place themselves in the position of the younger persons. Older people were at first unable to visualize the young in their caring relationships; they expressed negative and judgemental attitudes towards them and perceived that the young people are rejecting the wisdom of their elders. Older people resorted to outsiders to assist in communicating with and disciplining the young. The lack of empathy on the part of the older people for the young can have dire effects on their vital intergenerational relationships. It is recommended that community-based interventions be developed to promote empathy between the two generations. Master...|$|R
