5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating neurological tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II neurological symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the <b>critical</b> <b>parameter.</b> This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

In this paper, a single machine infinity bus (SMIB) system connected a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) -based wind energy conversion system (WECS) is considered to investigate the <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> and their sensitivity against damping factor. Linear analysis techniques such as eigenvalue analysis and participation factors are used to conduct the analysis.

40|$|<b>Critical</b> <b>parameters</b> are {{quantitative}} {{measures of}} performance {{that may be}} used to determine the overall ability of a design to serve its purpose. Although <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> figure in almost every field of design where there is a demand for progressive improvement, they do not appear to figure significantly in the design of interactive systems. As a result, systems are designed that are recognizably different from other systems but not necessarily better at doing the job intended. This paper discusses the role of <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> in design, and illustrates their lack of use in interactive system design by presenting a number of of examples drawn from the HCI literature. It identifies a consequent need for research to establish <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> for applications and to build models of the performance of designs against these parameters. Some ideas are presented on how <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> might be established for specific applications, and the paper concludes by summarising some of the benefits that might be gained from moving in this direction...|$|R

The time required for washing is increased by the square of the ratio of cake thicknesses. For example, if the thickness of the cake is doubled the washing time will increase roughly by a factor of 4.|$|E
25|$|The head-joint tube is tapered {{slightly}} {{towards the}} closed end. Boehm described {{the shape of}} the taper as parabolic. Examination of his flutes did not reveal a true parabolic curve, but the taper is more complex than a truncated cone. The head joint is the most difficult part to construct because the lip plate and tone hole have critical dimensions, edges, and angles which vary slightly between manufacturers and in individual flutes, especially where they are handmade. Head joint geometry appears particularly critical to acoustic performance and tone, but there is no clear consensus on a particular shape amongst manufacturers. Acoustic impedance of the embouchure hole appears the most <b>critical</b> <b>parameter.</b> Critical variables affecting this acoustic impedance include: chimney length (hole between lip-plate and head tube), chimney diameter, and radiuses or curvature of the ends of the chimney. Generally, the shorter the hole, the more quickly a flute can be played; the longer the hole, the more complex the tone. Finding a particularly good example of a flute is dependent on play-testing. Head joint upgrades are usually suggested as a way to improve the tone of an instrument.|$|E
30|$|Sensitivity {{analysis}} of the <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> with the OPAAT and RSM approaches provides significant understanding of <b>critical</b> <b>parameters.</b> The lateral distance between the injector hydraulic fracture and producer hydraulic fracture is the most <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> that affect oil recovery. Other critical factors are hydraulic fracture permeability of the production well and then the distance (acre spacing) between the injection and production wells. Natural fracture connectivity strongly influences the role of hydraulic fracture permeability and fracture half-length in the reservoir. These parameters become insignificant {{in the absence of}} natural and induced fractures in the formation.|$|R

25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in the tool displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E
500|$|The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), in harmonizing the {{disparate}} estimates of life-cycle GHG emissions for solar PV, {{found that the}} most <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> was the solar insolation of the site: GHG emissions factors for PV solar are inversely proportional to insolation. [...] For a site with insolation of 1700 kWh/m2/year, typical of southern Europe, NREL researchers estimated GHG emissions of 45ge/kWh. Using the same assumptions, at Phoenix, USA, with insolation of 2400kWh/m2/year, the GHG emissions factor would be reduced to 32g of CO2e/kWh.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the design}} of {{interactive}} systems, overall performance issues tend to receive less attention than provision of functionality. As a result, systems may not always offer perform-ance improvements to their users. In this paper we present some proposals for methods based {{on the use of}} application-specific <b>critical</b> <b>parameters,</b> i. e., performance parameters that measure how well the system serves its purpose. We argue that these parameters can provide a basis for dealing with performance issues in design. To construct this basis, {{there is a need to}} focus on identifying parameters through field studies, and on constructing models for use in making performance pre-dictions. We provide a number of examples of <b>critical</b> <b>parameters,</b> and discuss problems we have encountered in identifying them and in model construction. We summarise the results of a study of designers working with <b>critical</b> <b>parameters.</b> A final section of the paper discusses the feasibility of introducing <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> to HCI design practice...|$|R

To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 eV is required, which corresponds to photons with a wavelength of 91.2 nm or shorter. This is in the ultraviolet part of the electromagnetic spectrum, {{which means that the}} primary candidates are all sources which produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet and above. How numerous the source is must also be considered, as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the <b>critical</b> <b>parameter</b> for any source considered can be summarized as its [...] "emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume."

40|$|Two {{widely used}} models {{to find a}} sparse {{solution}} from a noisy underdetermined linear system are the constrained problem where the quadratic error is minimized subject to a sparsity constraint, and the regularized problem where a regularization parameter balances the minimization of both quadratic error and sparsity. However, the connections between these two problems has remained unclear so far. We provide an exhaustive description {{of the relationship between}} their globally optimal solutions. A partial equivalence between them always exists. We exhibit a sequence of <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> that partitions the positive axis into a certain number of intervals. For every regularization parameter inside an interval, there is a sparsity level such that the regularized problem and the constrained problem have the same global minimizers. At the values of the <b>critical</b> <b>parameters,</b> the optimal set of the regularized problem contains two optimal sets of the constrained problem. When the length of the sequence of <b>critical</b> <b>parameters</b> equals the number of all sparsity levels, both problems are quasi-completely equivalent.

40|$|The {{dielectric}} behaviour of polluted porcelain insulators is {{investigated by}} means of experimental tests and simulation methods. The elaboration of the experimental results, using well known mathematical models of polluted insulators, leads to {{the identification of the}} arc constants.

This allows the formulation of a generalised simulation model of polluted insulators.
