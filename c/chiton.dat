25|$|In Ancient Greece the simple, sleeved T-shaped tunics were {{constructed}} of three seamed tubes of cloth, {{a style that}} originated in the Semitic Near East, along with the Semitic-based word khiton, {{also referred to as}} a <b>chiton.</b> The belted worn linen <b>chiton</b> was the primary garment for men and women.|$|E
25|$|The {{first few}} decades {{of work with}} APT focused on metals. However, more recent {{work has been done}} on semiconductors, ceramic and {{geologic}} materials, with some work on biomaterials. The most advanced study of biological material to date using APT involved analyzing the chemical structure of teeth of the radula of <b>chiton</b> Chaetopleura apiculata. In this study, the use of APT showed chemical maps of organic fibers in the surrounding nano-crystalline magnetite in the <b>chiton</b> teeth, fibers which were often co-located with sodium or magnesium. This has been furthered to study elephant tusks, dentin and potentially human enamel.|$|E
25|$|The Romans adopted many {{facets of}} Greek culture {{including}} {{the same manner}} of dressing. The Celts and Germanic peoples wore a skirted garment which the historian Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC) called <b>chiton.</b> Below they wore knee-length trousers. The Anglo-Saxons, Normans, Franks and other people of Western and Northern Europe continued this fashion well into the Middle Ages, {{as can be seen}} in the Bayeux Tapestry.|$|E

25|$|Characteristic of its type, the Kore of Lyons is a pentelic marble {{sculpture}} measuring 64cm in height, 36cm {{wide and}} 24cm deep. It depicts the bust of a majestic young woman, who holds an offering against her breast, a bird, identified {{by some as}} a dove. The sculpture was painted. Influenced by the art of the Ionian coast, it is dressed in a <b>chiton</b> and himation. She wears a polos atop her head and earrings.|$|E
25|$|The Spartans {{used the}} same typical hoplite {{equipment}} as the other Greek neighbors; the only distinctive Spartan features were the crimson tunic (<b>chitōn)</b> and cloak (himation), and long hair, which the Spartans retained to a far later date than most Greeks. To the Spartans, long hair retained its older Archaic meaning as the symbol of a free man; to the other Greeks, by the 5th century, its peculiar association with the Spartans had come to signify pro-Spartan sympathies.|$|E
25|$|When he {{got bored}} with them, he {{considered}} returning {{them to their}} shell, but opted instead to find female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a <b>chiton,</b> freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The Raven felt responsible and very protective of them, thus many Haida myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind and combine {{the roles of the}} creator and the trickster.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} depictions, Athena {{is usually}} portrayed standing upright, wearing a full-length <b>chiton.</b> She is sometimes dressed in armor, {{and is often}} represented wearing a Corinthian helmet raised high atop her forehead. Her shield bears at its centre the aegis {{with the head of}} the gorgon (gorgoneion) in the center and snakes around the edge. It is in this standing posture that she was depicted in Phidias's famous lost gold and ivory statue of her, 36 m tall, the Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon.|$|E
25|$|The marble statues are {{on average}} 50 to 60cm high. One {{of which is}} a similar {{depiction}} of winged Aphrodite. The lower part of the figure is made of dark stone, so that the marble body comes to a better focus. Another female figure wearing a <b>chiton</b> and an overlying peplos, the right shoulder is a shawl. Both statues were likely imported over, either in Hellenic conquests and colonization, or through trade. They are painted with the favorite Hellenistic colors of the then ruling kings there.|$|E
25|$|For a long time, {{scholarship}} {{considered the}} younger girl as a boy. Recent research definitely {{proves that the}} chubby-cheeked child with ears sticking out is a girl. Around her neck is a leather band with a lunula pendant, an apotropaic amulet commonly worn by women or girls. Her <b>chiton</b> is violet in colour, a feature exclusive to females. Further it has partially fallen, exposing her left shoulder, an attribute of the goddess Aphrodite, aimed to underline erotic attraction. It is commonly used on the mummy portraits of women and even young girls. Thus, the child's gender is indubitably female.|$|E

5000|$|A mollusc valve is each {{articulating}} part of {{the shell}} of a mollusc. Each part {{is known as a}} valve {{or in the case of}} <b>chitons,</b> a [...] "plate". Members of two classes of molluscs: the Bivalvia (clams) and the Polyplacophora (<b>chitons)</b> have valves.|$|R
50|$|The radular {{teeth of}} <b>chitons</b> {{are made of}} magnetite, and the iron {{crystals}} within these {{may be involved in}} magnetoception, the ability to sense the polarity or the inclination of the Earth's magnetic field. Experimental work has suggested that <b>chitons</b> can detect and respond to magnetism.|$|R
25|$|These {{different}} influences (Ionian and Athenian) {{mean that}} even today {{the identification of}} the statue is not possible. However, according to some stylistic and technical criteria, the statue belongs to Attic sculpture of the Archaic period (thick hair, receding chin, almond shaped eyes) while undergoing Ionian influence (chiselled rounding, softened facial lines) which increased {{at the end of the}} sixth century. It must however be noted that the Ionian elements are in the majority, notably the typically Ionian long-sleeved <b>chiton,</b> the Ionian himation and the polos decorated with lotus flowers and palmettes. However the material, Pentalic marble from north of Athens, and the rigorous composition settle the question in favour of an Attic origin.|$|E
25|$|The rocky {{shores of}} Heard Island exhibit a clear {{demarcation}} between fauna {{of the lower}} kelp holdfast zone and the upper shore zone community, probably due to effects of desiccation, predation and freezing in the higher areas. The limpet Nacella kerguelensis is abundant in {{the lower part of}} the shore, being found on rock surfaces and on kelp holdfasts. Other common but less abundant species in this habitat include the <b>chiton</b> Hemiarthrum setulosum and the starfish Anasterias mawsoni. The amphipod Hyale sp. and the isopod Cassidinopsis sp. are closely associated with the kelp. Above the kelp holdfast zone, the littornid Laevilitorina (Corneolitorina) heardensis and the bivalve mollusc Kidderia bicolor are found in well-sheltered situations, and another bivalve Gaimardia trapesina trapesina has been recorded from immediately above the holdfast zone. Oligochaetes are also abundant in areas supporting porous and spongy layers of algal mat.|$|E
25|$|The basic garment {{for both}} genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic), often worn beneath {{one or more}} {{additional}} layers. In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the shoulders like a Greek <b>chiton,</b> to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from {{the eastern part of}} the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted. Though essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.|$|E
5000|$|While most <b>chitons</b> are herbivores, M. hindsii will graze on {{just about}} {{anything}} in its path that doesn’t escape including polychaetes, amphipods, barnacles, sponges and algae. This uncommon lifestyle most likely explains why M. hindsii are able to survive in areas too silty for other <b>chitons</b> ...|$|R

25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying breath that if she were to give Heracles a cloak (<b>chiton)</b> soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that this woman, who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or <b>chiton,</b> thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the genus}} {{is derived from the}} Greek brachys, short, and <b>chiton,</b> tunic, a {{reference}} to the loose seed coats. Brachychiton was for many years misconstrued as being of neuter gender—first by the genus describers Heinrich Wilhelm Schott and Stephan Endlicher and later by von Mueller and others—with the specific names then incorrectly amended. Thus the bottle tree's binomial was recorded as Brachychiton rupestre, now regarded as an orthographical variant. Besides [...] "Queensland bottle tree", common names for the species include [...] "narrow-leaved bottle tree" [...] and [...] "bottle tree".|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} pieces by Stoddart in Glasgow's Merchant City quarter. Italia, a 2.6 metre, glass re-in-forced polymer statue {{on top of}} Ingram Street {{represents}} the contribution of Italian traders to the area. Classical in style, the female form is swathed in a <b>chiton</b> and carries symbols of ancient Italy: a palm branch {{in her right hand}} and an inverted cornucopia in her left. On John Street, a trio of figures, Mercury, Mercurius and Mercurial form a triangle. The first two, identical figures, sit above the John St. façade of the Italian centre; their English and Roman names signify the two different manifestations of the deity in Roman mythology. Here, they embody a [...] "dialogue" [...] between ancient lore and modern city life. Opposite, on a plinth on the street, stands Mercurial, cast in bronze and with the adjectival form of the name, it complements the duality of the other two with an underlying unity.|$|E
2500|$|The basic item of {{classical}} Greek costume was the peplos, later the <b>chiton</b> (two rectangular pieces of cloth partially sewn together on both sides, with a [...] overfold or apoptygma), which {{evolved into the}} chemise, the most common item of underclothing worn {{by men and women}} for hundreds of years (also variously known as a smock or shift). In Sparta, women usually wore the <b>chiton</b> completely open on the left side.|$|E
2500|$|The statue has {{the compact}} and robust {{structure}} which {{is typical of}} this period in Attica {{and goes back to}} the [...] (Pergamon Museum SK 1800, first quarter of the sixth century). Ionian characteristics are clear, notably the costume, composed of a <b>chiton</b> with long sleeves and a himation pinned diagonally over one shoulder. In sculpture and Attic black figure pottery, contemporary women wear the sleeveless Doric peplos over a light <b>chiton</b> and the himation, when it is present at all, is pinned at both shoulders. The sole archaic Attic representation with wears the <b>chiton</b> without the peplos over it is the Berlin Goddess, but she wears the himation in the traditional symmetric manner. In Ionia on the other hand, the diagonal himation is very well attested from the second quarter of the 6th century BC, e.g. on the statues dedicated by Cheramyes; not only is the origin of this garment Ionian, but also the treatment of the drapery, which is found in the representations of the columnae caelatae of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (generally dated to 560 BC). Another stylistic element of the Kore of Lyons is the curve of the himation above the buttocks which is not subsequently imitated by Attic sculptors, but is fairly frequent in contemporary vase painting and marble sculpture of the Greek East.|$|E
