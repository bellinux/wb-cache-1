25|$|ITAR {{does not}} apply to {{information}} related to general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles that are commonly taught in schools and colleges or information that is in the public domain. Nor does it apply to general marketing information or basic system descriptions. Broad interpretations of these exceptions have faced several legal challenges. For example, <b>college</b> <b>professors</b> have been prosecuted for breaches of the AECA as a result of access to USML items by foreign graduate students and companies have been penalized for alleged breaches of the AECA for failing to properly remove USML items from material used to market defense articles. The U.S. Government has also taken action (albeit unsuccessfully) for the export of technical data that was allegedly already publicly available on the Internet.|$|E
