40|$|<b>Collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> in {{suspension}} {{have been shown}} to inhibit adenylate cyclase in human platelet preparations. Direct inhibition by <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> was observed when intact platelets were used, although secondary events such as ADP secretion or prostanoid formation were important contributors to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase after treatment of platelets with collagen. The nature of the direct inhibition caused by collagen has been investigated in platelet membrane preparations, with the following results. (1) <b>Collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> inhibit platelet membrane adenylate cyclase in a dose-dependent manner. (2) Inhibition of adenylate cyclase by thrombin, adrenaline or <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> could be abolished in the presence of guanosine 5 '-[beta-thio]diphosphate; half-maximal inhibition was obtained at about 100 microM for the inhibitory action of thrombin, and at about 500 microM for that of either adrenaline or collagen. (3) The action of each ligand was blocked to a similar extent by pertussis-toxin treatment of the platelet membranes. Taken together, these results indicate that the action of collagen, like that of thrombin and adrenaline, is G-protein-dependent. (4) inhibition of adenylate cyclase by <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> was additive with that caused by adrenaline, but co-operative with that caused by thrombin, suggesting that inhibitory pathways exists for collagen and adrenaline which are distinct from, but interactive with, that for thrombin. (5) Modification of the <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> by pepsin treatment attenuated the effects of collagen, whereas heat-denaturation of the <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> completely abolished their effects. These data suggest that the effects of collagen are specific, and depend on the detailed structure of the <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Oral submucous {{fibrosis}} is {{a chronic}} debilitating disease of oral mucosa and {{is characterized by}} generalized fibrosis of the oral soft tissues which tends to present itself clinically as palpable vertical fibrous bands. Traditionally, stains such as van- Geison and various forms of trichrome {{have been used to}} detect <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> in tissues. Thick and thin <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> {{play a vital role in}} maintaining connective tissue integrity. However, both these stains fail to reveal thin <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres.</b> A special stain- picrosirius red stain (PSR) that stained both thin and thick <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> was used in this study. Thus, the present study is to demonstrate the orientation and color of <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> in different grades of oral sub mucous fibrosis and normal mucosa and observed under polarized microscope. However, correlation to the grading of OSF will help in determining the changes in the connective tissue which precedes the neoplastic change in epithelium. O I...|$|R

50|$|The <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles in {{cattle hide}} are {{arranged}} in a complex weaving pattern. The fibres are often at angles as much as 90 degrees to the skin surface. Cattle hide also contains sweat glands, erector pili muscles and a distinct gradation in elastin levels, concentrated in {{the upper part of}} the skin. Kangaroo hide on the other hand has been shown to have a highly uniform orientation of fibre bundles in parallel with the skin surface. It does not contain sweat glands or erector pili muscles and elastin is evenly distributed throughout the skin thickness. This structural uniformity explains both the greater tensile strength of the whole leather and the greater retention of strength in splits. Bovine skin is much more complex in cross section. Hence in whole section it has many more weak points from which tears can start when placed under tension. In addition when sliced into splits the collagen fibres running at significant angles to the skin surface will be cut. These then become weak points in the structural strength.|$|E

The potential relationships between <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> deposition and myofibroblast population in diabetic wound healing were also examined. Forty young male streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats {{were randomly assigned to}} PEMF group or control group. 2  cm ×  2  cm square wounds were made at their back. The PEMF group received daily exposure of PEMF to the wounds, while control group was handled in the same manner except that the PEMF device was not activated. Wound tissues harvested on post-wounding day 7, 10 and 14 were fixed, processed and sectioned. The abundance, fibril alignment and fibre orientation of type I collagen were quantified with picro-sirius polarization method and image analysis software (Nikon NIS Element AR). Myofibroblast population data were adopted from our previous study. Correlation between myofibroblast population and <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> deposition was examined. There was significantly greater abundance of type I <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> in the PEMF group than in the control on day 7 (P = . 013), but not on day 10 or 14. No significant between-group differences were found in collagen fibril alignment and <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> orientation at any measured time points. Positive correlation was found between <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> deposition and myofibroblast population only on day 7 (r = . 729, P = . 007).

40|$|Objectives. The {{present study}} was done to {{evaluate}} birefringence pattern of <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> in different grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma using Picrosirius red stain and polarization microscopy and {{to determine if there}} is a change in <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> between different grades of oral squamous cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods. Picrosirius red stained 5 [*]μm thick sections of previously diagnosed different grades of squamous cell carcinoma and normal oral mucosa were studied under polarization microscopy for arrangement as well as birefringence of <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> around tumour islands. Results. It was found that thin <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> increased and thick <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> decreased with dedifferentiation of OSCC (P< 0. 0001  ). It was observed that there was change in polarization colours of thick fibres from yellowish orange to greenish yellow with dedifferentiation of OSCC indicating loosely packed fibres (P< 0. 0001). Conclusion. There was a gradual change of birefringence of collagen from yellowish orange to greenish yellow from well to poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, indicating that there is a change from mature form of collagen to immature form as tumour progresses.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} guidance {{is needed to}} understand how the collagen fabric evolves during the development of aneurysms. In this paper, we model the development of an aneurysm as a cylindrical/spherical membrane subject to 1 D enlargement; these conceptual models reflect the development of fusiform and saccular cerebral aneurysms. The mechanical response is attributed to the elastin and collagen. We introduce variables which define the elastin and <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration; these evolve to simulate growth/atrophy of the constituents. A hypothetical aneurysm model is analysed: collagen stretch is constant, elastin degrades and <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration can adapt to maintain mechanical equilibrium. An analytic expression for the rate of evolution of the fibre concentration is derived. The functional form is dependent on (i) the current <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> concentration, (ii) the deviations in the <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> stretch from the attachment stretch, (iii) the rate of change of fibre stretch, (iv) the rate of loss of elastin and (v) the ratio of load borne by elastinous and collagenous constituents. Finally, numerical examples of aneurysm development are considered. Suitable candidates for the fibre concentration evolution equations are identified that yield stabilization of the aneurysm even when there is complete loss of elastin. This theoretical analysis provides the basis for the development of physiologically realistic models of aneurysm development...|$|E

Cementum has function to give attachment to collagen fibres of the periodontal ligament, maintaining the integrity of the root, helping to maintain the tooth in its functional position in the mouth, and being involved in tooth repair and regeneration so in the orthodontic tooth movement can induce changes in the cementum. The aim of this research is to investigate that fixed orthodontic appliance can change the amount of periodontal ligament <b>collagen</b> <b>fibre</b> and the thickness of inserting periodontal ligament fibre bundles at pressure site of cementum. This experimental study was held in laboratory with post test only control group design. Twenty two (22) premolar sample from 11 patient were divided into 2 groups.

Biochemical analysis of the tissue showed a qualitative and quantitative defect in alpha 2 chain production of Type I collagen. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the aortic extract, two separate bands in the alpha 2 region and an increase of the alpha 1 to alpha 2 ratio were found. Examination by electron microscopy revealed elastic <b>fibre</b> degeneration, helical <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres,</b> and metabolically active modified smooth muscle cells. The formation of helical <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> is attributed to a defect {{in the development of}} chains and cross-links of collagen precursors produced by the hypertrophic smooth muscle cells.

A scheme for the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm and other connective tissue abnormalities in Marfan's syndrome is proposed as follows. Type I <b>collagen</b> <b>fibres</b> have decreased tensile strength because of a defect in the alpha 2 chain biosynthesis and decreased cross-linking. Over many years the wall of the ascending aorta is subjected to cyclic stresses and it dilates. Elastic fibres disintegrate.
