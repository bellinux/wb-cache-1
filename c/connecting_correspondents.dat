40|$|There has {{recently}} been increasing scholarly interest in early modern correspondence and specifically also in women’s letter writing and reading. Starting from the late Middle Ages familiar responsibilities and domestic obligations led many women to write to their absent husbands or other relatives to exchange health news and inform them about family affairs. It is however in the early modern period that corresponding with relatives and friends became a widespread social practice ranging from official to familiar and personal correspondence; in this period female literacy increased thus allowing growing numbers of women to write and read their own letters. A growing number of female voices can thus be heard depicting early modern social life. The article focuses on a neglected aspect of women’s correspondence: it investigates not the sender’s epistolary identity, but that of the recipient through {{the analysis of the}} personal correspondence of Lady Cornwallis Bacon. The main theme of the article is to show how the epistolary identity of an early modern gentlewoman was constructed by her correspondents. It is assumed that modes of communicating information and achieving a specific goal through letters varied not only according to the relationship <b>connecting</b> the <b>correspondents</b> but also the purpose and content of letters.  </p...|$|R
5000|$|Wilson {{was born}} on 1 July 1901 to Robert Charles Wilson of Dublin, a stockbroker, and Frances Lucinda Kellett, a {{descendant}} of Sir Henry Kellett. He had two other siblings, an elder brother Charles Herbert, and a younger sister, Edna, {{who went on to}} marry Sir Charles Read. His family were <b>connected</b> to war <b>correspondent</b> Lady Sarah Wilson and First World War Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson. His mother was alleged to have had an affair with Oscar Wilde, with whom she was a good friend, whilst in London, which would have made T.G. his illegitimate son. Weight was added to this claim by the fact that William Wilde, Oscar's father had an illegitimate son called Henry Wilson and that T.G. wrote the biography of Oscar's father. This gained T.G. the nickname 'Wilde bastard', leading T.G. to respond in 1942, after the publication of his book, 'I've often been called a bastard, but whatever I am I'm not a Wilde bastard.' ...|$|R

Notwithstanding {{that the}} effects appear only at the making and {{breaking}} of contact, (the current remaining unaffected, seemingly, in the interval,) I cannot resist the impression {{that there is some}} <b>connected</b> and <b>correspondent</b> effect produced by this lateral action of the elements of the electric stream during the time of its continuance (60. 242.). An action of this kind, in fact, is evident in the magnetic relations of the parts of the current. But admitting (as we may do for the moment) the magnetic forces to constitute the power which produces such striking and different results at the commencement and termination of a current, still {{there appears to be a}} link in the chain of effects, a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action, as yet unrecognised. If we endeavour to consider electricity and magnetism as the results of two forces of a physical agent, or a peculiar condition of matter, exerted in determinate directions perpendicular to each other, then, it appears to me, that we must consider these two states or forces as convertible into each other in a greater or smaller degree; i.e. that an element of an electric current has not a determinate electric force and a determinate magnetic force constantly existing in the same ratio, but that the two forces are, to a certain degree, convertible by a process or change of condition at present unknown to us. How else can a current of a given intensity and quantity be able, by its direct action, to sustain a state which, when allowed to react, (at the cessation of the original current,) shall produce a second current, having an intensity and quantity far greater than the generating one? This cannot result from a direct reaction of the electric force; and if it result from a change of electrical into magnetic force, and a reconversion back again, it will show that they differ in something more than mere direction, as regards that agent in the conducting wire which constitutes their immediate cause.|$|R

Seems as if Europe itself were waxing dim, and sinking to stupid sleep,--as we, in our poor royal person, full surely are. A Crown has been achieved, and diamond buttons worth 1,500 pounds apiece; but what is a Crown, and what are buttons, after all?--I suppose the tattle and SINGERIES of little Wilhelmina, whom he would spend whole days with; this and occasional visits to a young Fritzchen's cradle, who is thriving moderately, and will speak and do aperies one day,--are his main solacements in the days that are passing. Much of this Friedrich's life has gone off like the smoke of fire-works, has faded sorrowfully, and proved phantasmal. Here is an old Autograph Note, written by him at the side of that Cradle, and touching on a slight event there; which, as it <b>connects</b> two venerable <b>Correspondents</b> and their Seventeenth Century with a grand Phenomenon of the Eighteenth, we will insert here.

40|$|The Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6) {{protocol}} enables mobile nodes (MNs) {{to remain}} <b>connected</b> to other <b>correspondent</b> nodes (CNs) while roaming the IPv 6 Internet. Home and correspondent registrations are essential {{parts of the}} MIPv 6 protocol, whereby MNs register their care-of addresses (CoAs) with their home agents (HAs) and with their CNs, respectively. Security provision for home and correspondent registrations is a fundamental part of the MIPv 6 protocol and has been an open research issue since {{the early stages of}} the protocol. This thesis examines state-of-the-art protocols for securing home and correspondent registrations in MIPv 6 networks. The strengths and weaknesses of these protocols are discussed. The investigation of these protocols leads to the proposal of an enhanced home registration protocol and a family of correspondent registration protocols. The Enhanced Home Registration (EHR) protocol extends the basic home registration protocol defined in MIPv 6 to support the location authentication of MNs to their HAs. The EHR is based on novel ideas of segmenting the IPv 6 address space, using a symmetric CGA-based technique for generating CoAs, and applying concurrent CoAs reachability tests. As a result, EHR is able to reduce the likelihood of a malicious MN being successful in luring an HA to flood a third party with useless packets using MIPv 6. In addition, EHR enables HAs to help in correspondent registrations by confirming MNs' CoAs to CNs. Simulation studies of EHR have shown that it only introduces a marginal increase in the registration delay, but a significant increase in the signalling overhead as a cost of supporting the location authentication of MNs. The thesis also proposes a family of correspondent registration protocols. These protocols rely on the assistance of home networks to confirm the MNs' ownership of the claimed HoAs and CoAs. The protocols consist of three phases: a creation phase, an update phase and a deletion phase. Informal and formal protocol analyses have confirmed the protocols' correctness and satisfaction of the required security properties. The protocols have been simulated extensively and the results show that they produce lower registration delay and a reduction in the signalling overhead during update and deletion phases. This is at the cost of a varying increase, depending on the protocol variant, in the registration delay and signalling overhead during the creation phase.

40|$|Several {{factors can}} affect {{occupational}} accident frequency, namely economical factors, technologies used (low automation, discontinuous operating) job design, organization of work/environmental conditions and human factors. In particular, technological advances in industrial activities can {{give rise to}} improvement in productivity and in occupational health and safety, but not necessarily simultaneously. The beginning of the container transport dates back to 50 years ago, but while containerization changed everything, from ships and ports to patterns of global trade, its impact on work injuries was not explored at all. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between work organization, job experience, productivity and occupational accidents, from the starting of the container expansion to nowadays, considering Genoa port (Italy), one of the largest of the Mediterranean Sea. In order to minimize possible reporting biases, such as underreporting or reclassification to a lower level of severity, injury statistics are elaborated starting from data collected directly on-site, from internal accident or medical-aid reports. An in-depth statistical analysis on occupational injuries in the years 1980 – 2006 is carried out, with reference to frequency indexes, mechanism of injury and material causes. The increase of container-ships traffic and, consequently, the sharp change in port infrastructure involved a rapid modification also in the work organization, with particular reference to the number and characteristics of workforce (decrease from 5783 to nearly 1000 employees and increase of low experience workers from 28 % to 74 %). The striking high percentage increase of young or low experienced workers in handling container (and performing correlated new tasks) caused a remarkable increase of the risk for occupational injuries. In the studied port, we recorded an increase of the frequency index (injuries per hundred thousand hours worked) from 13. 0 to 29. 7. It results that the increased expansion of shipping container utilization is not <b>connected</b> to a <b>correspondent</b> human factor safety implementation. Main risk factors are pointed out, revealing an increase of accidents due to transport vehicle (+ 8. 3 %) and a reduction of accidents caused by substance or materials (− 4. 5 %). These factors show a statistical significant correlation with the new job tasks. Consideration of these findings may enable managerial solutions and workplace organization interventions for the prevention of injuries and safety performance improvement in port activities...|$|R
