50|$|As {{a student}} Ojeda {{became a member}} of the Democratic Republican Union (URD). In 1955 he began {{studying}} journalism at the Central University of Venezuela. In 1956 he became a reporter for El Nacional, based in the Miraflores Palace, and used this position to help organise the end of Jiménez' rule. On 11 June 1957 Ojeda invited two other URD members and a Communist, Guillermo García Ponce, to his home, and they agreed that the time was ripe to form a multi-partisan organisation aiming to overthrow Jiménez. The <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Junta</b> was soon joined by Democratic Action and COPEI, and used the only clandestine press left in Venezuela, that of the Communist Party of Venezuela, to publish a manifesto. The Junta ultimately played a leading role in coordinating the 1958 Venezuelan coup d'état the following January, including organising a general strike on 21 January. As the head of the <b>Patriotic</b> <b>Junta,</b> Ojeda emerged from the Jiménez dictatorship as the most important URD member after its leader, Jóvito Villalba.|$|R

50|$|José Daniel Ferrer's {{himself and}} his relatives, {{including}} his wife and children, {{as well as other}} members of the <b>Cuban</b> <b>Patriotic</b> Union have received the support of Amnesty International and the World Organization against Torture on numerous occasions for having been arrested, robbed of their homes and retained in an unknown whereabouts after police detentions. The international pressure of several human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and others, has always borne fruit in the liberation, time and again, of José Daniel Ferrer.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in just six days and contained fourteen tracks; opening with [...] "Chan Chan" [...] written by Compay Segundo, a four chord son that was to become what Cooder described as [...] "the Buena Vistas calling card"; and ending with a rendition of [...] "La Bayamesa", a traditional <b>Cuban</b> <b>patriotic</b> song (not {{to be confused with}} the Cuban national anthem of the same name). The sessions also produced material for the subsequent release, Introducing...Rubén González, which showcased the work of the Cuban pianist.|$|R
25|$|The second {{chapter in}} Ecuador's {{struggle}} for emancipation from Spanish colonial rule began in Guayaquil, where independence was proclaimed in October 1820 {{by a local}} <b>patriotic</b> <b>junta</b> {{under the leadership of}} the poet José Joaquín de Olmedo. By this time, the forces of independence had grown continental in scope and were organized into two principal armies, one under the Venezuelan Simón Bolívar in the north and the other under the Argentine José de San Martín in the south. Unlike the hapless Quito junta of a decade earlier, the Guayaquil patriots were able to appeal to foreign allies, Argentina and Gran Colombia, each of whom soon responded by sending sizable contingents to Ecuador. Antonio José de Sucre, the brilliant young lieutenant of Bolívar who arrived in Guayaquil in May 1821, was to become the key figure in the ensuing military struggle against the royalist forces.|$|R

Popular standards such as [...] "Winter Wonderland", the <b>Cuban</b> <b>patriotic</b> song [...] "Guantanamera" [...] and the 1958 Eurovision entry [...] "Volare" [...] are also widely adapted to suit players and managers. The tune [...] "Tom Hark" [...] is often played at many stadiums following a goal by the home team and for chants such as [...] "Thursday Nights, Channel 5", whilst [...] "Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)" [...] by Doris Day is generally reserved for matches where the venue of the final is Wembley Stadium.|$|R

50|$|Boyd {{was born}} in Panama City on September 24, 1851. He {{was the son of}} Archibaldo B. Boyd and Maria Lopez de Boyd. He was a {{businessman}} who became {{an active member of the}} <b>Patriotic</b> Revolutionary <b>Junta</b> that struggled to get Panama's independence from Colombia. He fought in favor of his country without thinking of the danger of the actions he undertook. He served in several positions: member of the Panama City Town Hall (1888); member of the Provisional Government Junta (1903); National Assembly senator (1910); head of state of Panama (1910); foreign relations minister (1911-1912); ambassador and minister in Germany, Netherlands, and Belgium; general consul; and business representative in Honduras and El Salvador.|$|R
2500|$|In 1961, the nº8 of the Military Tribune had as {{its title}} [...] "Let's {{end the war}} of Angola". The authors were linked to the <b>Patriotic</b> Action Councils (<b>Juntas</b> de Acção Patriótica - JAP), {{supporters}} of Humberto Delgado, and responsible for {{the attack on the}} barracks of Beja. The Portuguese Front of National Liberation (Frente Portuguesa de Libertação Nacional - FPLN), founded in December 1962, attacked the conciliatory positions. The official feeling of the Portuguese state, despite all this, was the same: Portugal had inalienable and legitimate rights over the colonies and this was what was transmitted through the media and through the state propaganda.|$|R
40|$|On August 16, 1961, C. Douglas Dillon, the United States Secretary of the Treasury, {{was at the}} Inter-American Economic and Social Conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay. The conference had progressed without {{interruption}} until Ernesto “Che” Guevara—the revolutionary and Cuban Minister of Industry—gave a speech rebuking the United States, calling its policies imperialistic and its hemispheric objectives insidious. Dillon had a hardline message in response: to acknowledge Guevara’s speech would “betray the thousands of <b>patriotic</b> <b>Cubans</b> who are still awaiting and struggling for the freedom of their country. ” Dillon reiterated that the United States would not recognize Castro’s permanency. Hours later, Guevara had a message for Richard Goodwin, {{a member of the}} U. S. delegation: the revolution could not be defeated, but for economic reasons, Cuba sought a modus vivendi with the United States. As evidence of his sincerity, Guevara said Cuba would consider restitutions for expropriated property and reconsider its relationship with the Soviet Union. Guevara’s encounter with Goodwin began a series of informal negotiations between Castro and the Kennedy administration. This schizophrenic diplomatic moment illustrates that even as public U. S. -Cuban relations epitomized Cold War hostility, several unofﬁcial discussions about normalization call into doubt this interpretive paradigm. This essay examines such contradictory political moments. Despite the enmity and ideological gap between the two states, a series of informal exchanges shows that normalization was a distinct policy possibility in the early 1960 s.
