50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and <b>counterbored</b> tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|E
5000|$|Model 1944 Carbine: This carbine was {{introduced}} into service in late 1944 (with 50,000 service-test examples produced in 1943) and remained in production until 1948. They were produced from 1943 to 1948 at the Izhevsk arsenal and only 1944 at Tula. Its specifications {{are very similar}} to the M1938, with the unique addition of a permanently affixed, side-folding cruciform-spike bayonet. A groove for the folded bayonet is inlet into {{the right side of the}} stock. These were in use not only by the Soviet Union, but also its various satellite nations. Many of these were <b>counterbored</b> post-war.|$|E
50|$|Weatherby's {{requirements}} {{included a}} bolt face which was countersunk into the bolt which would enclose the cartridge's casehead while the bolt head was enclosed in a <b>counterbored</b> barrel breach, {{which in turn}} would prevent the casehead from rupturing. If a rupture should occur, the bolt would have holes through which hot gases could be vented safely towards the side {{and away from the}} shooter's face. Further as an extra safety measure he required an enclosed or shrouded bolt sleeve that would prevent the hot gases from making their way through the bolt mechanism to the shooter's face. To Weatherby, the safety and strength of the design were paramount.|$|E
50|$|Countersinking : This {{process is}} similar to <b>counterboring</b> but the step in the hole is cone-shaped.|$|R
50|$|<b>Counterboring</b> : This process {{creates a}} stepped hole {{in which a}} larger {{diameter}} follows a smaller diameter partially into a hole.|$|R
50|$|WorkNC-CAD has {{advanced}} intelligent surface morphing for filling simple or complex cavities, automatic 2D feature recognition and cycle definition for drilling, <b>counterboring,</b> reaming and tapping, {{as well as}} automatic mold and die core separation.|$|R
5000|$|Counterbores {{are made}} with {{standard}} dimensions for a certain size of screw or are produced in sizes that {{are not related to}} any particular screw size. In either case, the tip of the counterbore has a reduced diameter section referred to as the pilot, a feature essential to assuring concentricity between the counterbore and the hole being <b>counterbored.</b> Counterbores matched to specific screw sizes generally have integral pilots that fit the clearance hole diameter associated with a particular screw size (e.g., [...]191 inches for a number 10 machine screw). Counterbores that are not related to a specific screw size are designed to accept a removable pilot, allowing any given counterbore size to be adapted to a variety of hole sizes. The pilot matters little when running the cutter in a milling setup where rigidity is assured and hole center location is already achieved via X-Y positioning.|$|E
40|$|A {{light at}} an {{aircraft}} landing site is simulated on a model board by the protruding output {{end of a}} precision cut optical fiber. The fiber is secured within a counterbore of a <b>counterbored</b> hole in the model board. The length of the precision cut fiber {{and the depth of}} the counterbore are closely controlled to ensure that the output end of the fiber protrudes a desired distance. The input end of the precision cut fiber is optically coupled to a collimated light source by a second optical fiber extending through the smaller diameter bore of the <b>counterbored</b> hole...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new joining by forming process for fixing {{longitudinally}} in position two metal sheets (or plates) perpendicular to one another, at room temperature. The proposed process employs a <b>counterbored</b> {{variant of the}} ‘mortise-and-tenon’ joint that eliminates the protrusion of the tenon beyond the mortise after mechanical locking by plastic deformation. The presentation draws from the workability limits and material stress-strain characterization to validation by joining and destructive pull-out testing. Results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} new proposed process for producing flat joint surfaces, which are advantageous over typical ‘mortise-and-tenon’ protruded surfaces in most applications. info:eu-repo/semantics/acceptedVersio...|$|E
50|$|A drill {{is a tool}} {{fitted with}} a cutting tool {{attachment}} or driving tool attachment, usually a drill bit or driver bit, used for boring holes in various materials or fastening various materials together. The attachment is gripped by a chuck {{at one end of}} the drill and rotated while pressed against the target material. The tip, and sometimes edges, of the cutting tool does the work of cutting into the target material. This may be slicing off thin shavings (twist drills or auger bits), grinding off small particles (oil drilling), crushing and removing pieces of the workpiece (SDS masonry drill), countersinking, <b>counterboring,</b> or other operations.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The Loughborough University of Technology Feature-Based Design System (LUTFBDS) allows detail design {{to be carried}} out in a {{computer}} aided design (CAD) environment by the addition of form features to stock material or part-machined components. An iconic user interface assists in the description parts in terms of a set of primitive features such as holes, pockets and slots or higher level compound features such as patterns of holes and <b>counterbored</b> holes. This feature representation is generated in parallel with the geometric data structure of the underlying boundary representation solid modeller. The feature representation is useful for a range of downstream manufacturing activities, but our research focusses on the integration of CAD with process planning. LUT-FBDS functions allows the designer or manufacturing engineer to progressively construct the final geometry of a part, and facilities are provided for the designer to modify parameters which relate to feature dimensions, location, orientation and relationships with other features. These changes may result in changes to the feature representation and hence {{there is a need for}} feature validation to ensure the integrity of the model...|$|E
