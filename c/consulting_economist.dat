30|$|And thirdly, echoing a point also {{stressed}} in Tobin’s list, in <b>consulting,</b> <b>economists</b> {{are responsible}} {{that all the}} economic effects of possible measures {{are taken into account}} and not only the most evident ones. Political analyses very often focus on especially influential and well organised groups. However, it is imperative that the impacts on poorly organised (e.g. consumers) or not organised groups (e.g. next generation) are made transparent by economic analyses. Ideally, economists represent {{the economy as a whole}} within politics.|$|R

30|$|Firstly {{and above}} all, economists in {{economic}} policy consulting act as {{advocates for the}} price mechanism. For non-specialists—and hence for most politicians—it is not apparent that a market economy is most efficiently guided by relative prices and not by detailed regulation. We economists have internalised Adam Smith’s invisible hand {{to a degree that}} we tend to forget that this brilliant insight is not intuitively evident. Politicians, who want to solve a problem, instinctively prefer organisational and legally verifiable regulation. One of the most central tasks of <b>consulting</b> <b>economists</b> is to point out, as convincingly as possible, alternative ways to achieve goals far more efficiently via undistorted relative prices and market mechanisms instead of detailed planning.|$|R

40|$|A {{hypothetical}} {{situation that}} illustrates a problem recently posed by a forensic economist may be stated as follows: If the plaintiff, an otherwise healthy white male, is injured catastrophically on his thirtieth birthday, and discovery problems and a crowded trial calendar prevent his case from being tried until his thirty-fifth birthday, may the <b>consulting</b> <b>economist</b> calculate the work {{life expectancy of}} the plaintiff using his age at trial? The altemative date for the calculation of the work life expectancy of the plaintiff is the date of injury. Simply stated, does the economist have the choice to use either date for the loss calculation? For {{the purpose of this}} hypothetical, the work life expectancy of a 30 year old white male is estimated to be 29. 3 years, while that of a 35 year old white male is estimated to be 24. 9 years,l The answer to this question lies not within the field of economics, but rather, within the field of law. It is unlikely, however, that there is any "black letter law " that holds that work life expectancy is to be calculated at a particular time; therefore, {{it will be necessary to}} apply legal reasoning to the question. Prior to discussing the question, it should be noted that the manner of reasonin...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{is one of}} the weakest links in modern economics. Despite an extensive and diverse literature (see Hebert and Link 1988; Casson 2003), entrepreneurship remains “the phenomenon which is most emphasized yet least understood by economists ” (S. M. Kanbur, quoted in Hebert and Link 1988, xvii). The entrepreneur “is at once one of the most intriguing {{and one of the most}} elusive in the cast of characters that constitutes the subject of economic analysis ” (Baumol 1993, 2). Many microeconomic theory and industrial organization texts omit mention of entrepreneurship altogether because neoclassical economics posits no need for it (Hebert and Link 1988, 156 – 57; Baumol 1993, 14). A few define entrepreneurship perfunctorily as the confluence of business decision making and ownership, and they attribute the “law ” of diminishing returns to the fixity of entrepreneurial capital within the firm (see, for example, Hirshleifer 1976, 228, 259). Survey texts expand this narrative by describing entrepreneurship as a factor of production, linking it to risk taking and innovation and tying entrepreneurial compensation to uncertainty and profits. The economic literature on entrepreneurship per se typically defines the entrepreneur descriptively (that is, atheoretically). The term entrepreneur originally denoted anyone who undertook a project, and it subsequently grew to mean a merchant, employer, or manager (Hebert and Link 1988, 45 – 46). It has become synonymous in its loosest usage with self-employment and occasionally with self-unemployment. Several social science disciplines, including economics, sociology, psychology, history, and political science, have produced descriptive definitions (Casson 2003, 9); there are at least a dozen “distinct themes within the economic literature ” alone (Hebert James A.
