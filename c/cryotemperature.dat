The crystals (P 42 $_ 1 $ 2, 407 Å × 407 Å × 171 Å) are suitable for X-ray crystallography analysis to 9 · 9 Å using synchrotron radiation at <b>cryotemperature.</b> Crystallographic data from native and a potential heavy-atom derivative have been collected...|$|E
40|$|Radiation damage can be {{a problem}} when {{utilizing}} ionizing X-radiation in macromolecular crystallography. The dose dependence of radiation damage to eight lysozyme crystals at room temperature (292 K) was investigated in order to provide an accurate comparison with <b>cryotemperature</b> (100 K) results and to allow researchers to calculate expected maximum room-temperature-crystal lifetimes prior to data collection. Results of intensity-loss analysis unexpectedly showed that the dose tolerated by a crystal is dependent on the dose rate according to a positive linear relationship (99 % correlation coefficient); a 60 % increase in dose rate gave a 4 -fold increase in crystal lifetime over the range studied. Alternative metrics of damage were also assessed from room temperature data. In the dose-rate range tested (6 Gy s(- 1) to 10 Gy s(- 1)), data collection at 100 K appears to offer a 26 - 113 times increase in the lifetime of the crystal...|$|E
40|$|Carbonic anhydrases (CAs; EC 4. 2. 1. 1) {{catalyze}} the interconversion of CO 2 and HCO 3 −, {{and their}} inhibitors {{have long been}} used as diuretics and as a therapeutic treatment for many disorders such as glaucoma and epilepsy. Acetazolamide (AZM) and methazolamide (MZM, a methyl derivative of AZM) {{are two of the}} classical CA inhibitory drugs that have been used clinically for decades. The jointly refined X-ray/neutron structure of MZM in complex with human CA isoform II (hCA II) has been determined to a resolution of 2. 2  Å with an Rcryst of ∼ 16. 0 %. Presented in this article, along with only the second neutron structure of a clinical drug-bound hCA, is an in-depth structural comparison and analyses of differences in hydrogen-bonding network, water-molecule orientation and solvent displacement that take place upon the binding of AZM and MZM in the active site of hCA II. Even though MZM is slightly more hydrophobic and displaces more waters than AZM, the overall binding affinity (Ki) for both of the drugs against hCA II is similar (∼ 10  nM). The plausible reasons behind this finding have also been discussed using molecular dynamics and X-ray crystal structures of hCA II–MZM determined at <b>cryotemperature</b> and room temperature. This study not only allows a direct comparison of the hydrogen bonding, protonation states and solvent orientation/displacement of AZM and MZM, but also shows the significant effect that the methyl derivative has on the solvent organization in the hCA II active site...|$|E

By means of macroscopic and microscopic balance models, an extensive analysis is carried out, {{including among others}} {{the investigation of the}} thermal effects during high-pressure system filling, venting losses during normal operation and inactivity, time-course of system pressure and temperature and gas delivery under various operating conditions. Model results were compared with experimental data, good agreement was obtained. The analysis also includes a comparison to other storage technologies such as cryo-compressed gas and liquefaction storage. The results show that cryo-adsorptive systems have storage characteristics comparable to compressed gas systems, but at a much lower pressure. They are also energetically more efficient than liquid hydrogen systems. However, the necessity of <b>cryotemperatures</b> and thermal management during operation and filling migh...|$|R
40|$|SummaryX-ray-induced {{chemistry}} modifies biological macromolecules structurally and functionally, even at <b>cryotemperatures.</b> The {{mechanisms of}} x-radiation damage in colored or redox proteins {{have often been}} investigated by combining X-ray crystallography with in crystallo ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Here, we used Raman microspectrophotometry to follow the onset of damage in crystalline lysozyme, notably that of disulfide bond breakage. The dose-dependent Raman spectra are consistent with a kinetic model for the rupture of disulfide bonds suggesting the rapid build up of an anionic radical intermediate. This intermediate may either revert back to the oxidized state or evolve toward protonated radical species or cleaved products. The data strongly suggest that back conversion of the anionic radical is significantly accelerated by X-rays, revealing an X-ray-induced “repair” mechanism. The possibility of X-ray-induced chemical repair is an important feature {{to take into account}} when assessing radiation damage in macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|Fringes and {{speckles}} {{occur within}} diffraction spots when a crystal is illuminated with coherent radiation during X-ray diffraction. The additional information in these features provides {{insight into the}} imperfections in the crystal at the sub-micrometre scale. In addition, these features can provide more accurate intensity measurements (e. g. by model-based profile fitting), detwinning (by distinguishing the various components), phasing (by exploiting sampling of the molecular transform) and refinement (by distinguishing regions with different unit-cell parameters). In order to exploit these potential benefits, the features due to coherent diffraction have to be recorded and any change due to radiation damage properly modelled. Initial results from recording coherent diffraction at <b>cryotemperatures</b> from polyhedrin crystals of approximately 2  µm in size are described. These measurements allowed information about the type of crystal imperfections to be obtained at the sub-micrometre level, together with the changes due to radiation damage...|$|R
40|$|Flow restricting {{devices were}} studied for their {{suitability}} as liquid water propellant flow limiters for the biowaste resistojet. Flow limiting during the start-up transient {{is required to}} prevent thrustor instabilities and icing which could result in heater failure in the electrical resistance heated thrustor (resistojet). The study was directed toward simple devices which would function passively (i. e., without power except from the propellant flow itself), and would offer high reliability and simplicity. In addition to the flow limiting devices, a thermal pumping system was studied to determine whether CO 2, desorbed from molecular sieves could be pumped thermally in a space station application. The thermal pump is considered a possible replacement for mechanical pumps. It involves a cyclic, constant volume cryopumping system which employs space radiators to achieve the <b>cryotemperatures.</b> The frozen CO 2 would be vaporized periodically, using a waste heat loop, to attain sufficient pressure to transfer {{a large portion of}} the trapped CO 2 to storage tanks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} to overcome the sensitivity limitations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy also of supported lipid bilayers. When investigated by solid-state NMR techniques the approach typically involves doping the samples with biradicals and their investigation at cryo-temperatures. Here we investigated the effects of temperature and membrane hydration on the topology of amphipathic and hydrophobic membrane polypeptides. Although the antimicrobial PGLa peptide in dimyristoyl phospholipids is particularly sensitive to topological alterations, the DNP conditions represent well its membrane alignment also found in bacterial lipids at ambient temperature. With a novel membrane-anchored biradical and purpose-built hardware a 17 -fold enhancement in NMR signal intensity is obtained by DNP {{which is one of}} the best obtained for a truly static matrix-free system. Furthermore, a membrane anchor sequence encompassing 19 hydrophobic amino acid residues was investigated. Although at <b>cryotemperatures</b> the transmembrane domain adjusts it membrane tilt angle by about 10 degrees, the temperature dependence of two-dimensional separated field spectra show that freezing the motions can have beneficial effects for the structural analysis of this sequence...|$|R
40|$|Radiation damage {{restricts the}} useful {{lifetime}} for macromolecular crystals in the X-ray beam, even at <b>cryotemperatures.</b> With {{the development of}} structural genomics pipelines, {{it will be essential}} to incorporate projected crystal lifetime information into the automated data collection software routines. As a first step towards this goal, a computer program, RADDOSE, is presented which is designed for use by crystallographers in optimizing the amount of data that can be obtained from a particular cryo-cooled crystal at synchrotron beamlines. The program uses the composition of the crystal and buffer constituents, as well as the beam energy, flux and dimensions, to compute the absorption coefficients and hence the theoretical time taken to reach an absorbed dose of 2 × 10 7 Gy, the so-called 'Henderson limit'. At this dose, the intensity of the diffraction pattern is predicted to be halved. A 'diffraction-dose efficiency' quantity is introduced, for the convenient comparison of absorbed dose per diffracted photon for different crystals. Four example cases are considered, and the implications for anomalous data collection are discussed {{in the light of the}} results from RADDOSE...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the family}} of 2 -oxoacid {{dehydrogenase}} multienzyme complexes catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids and are among the most remarkable enzymatic machineries in the living cell. These multienzyme complexes combine a highly symmetric (cubic or icosahedral) core with a dynamic and flexible arrangement of numerous subunits and domains surrounding the core. The center of the complex is formed by either 24 or 60 copies of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E 2) -a multidomain enzyme. The hollow icosahedral cores are composed of 60 identical subunits of the catalytic domain of E 2 with a molecular weight of about 1. 8 million Da. Bipyramidal crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction of the icosahedral core of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex from Enterococcus faecalis were grown up to 0. 7 mm in each dimension. The crystals belong to space group R 32 with a = b = 244. 3 A (hexagonal setting), and have a solvent content of 73 %. The asymmetric unit contains one-third of the molecule, i. e., 20 of the 60 subunits. Initial X-ray crystallographic data to 7 A resolution were collected at <b>cryotemperatures</b> at synchrotron facilities. Interestingly, the diffraction was improved significantly upon rehydrating dehydrated crystals and extended to 4. 2 A...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConfined {{water is}} of {{considerable}} current interest owing to its biophysical importance and relevance to cryopreservation. It {{can be studied}} in its amorphous or supercooled state in the “no-man’s land”, i. e., in the temperature range between 150 and 235 K, in which bulk water is always crystalline. Amorphous deuterium oxide (D 2 O) was obtained in the intermembrane spaces of a stack of purple membranes from Halobacterium salinarum by flash cooling to 77 K. Neutron diffraction showed that upon heating to 200 K the intermembrane water space decreased sharply with an associated strengthening of ice diffraction, indicating that water beyond the first membrane hydration layer flowed out of the intermembrane space to form crystalline ice. It was concluded that the confined water undergoes a glass transition at or below 200 K to adopt an ultraviscous liquid state from which it crystallizes to form ice {{as soon as it}} finds itself in an unconfined, bulk-water environment. Our results provide model-free evidence for translational diffusion of confined water in the no-man’s land. Potential effects of the confined-water glass transition on nanosecond membrane dynamics were investigated by incoherent elastic neutron scattering experiments. These revealed no differences between flash-cooled and slow-cooled samples (in the latter, the intermembrane space at temperatures < 250 K is occupied only by the first membrane hydration layers), with dynamical transitions at 150 and 260 K, but not at 200 K, suggesting that nanosecond membrane dynamics are not sensitive to the state of the water beyond the first hydration shell at <b>cryotemperatures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Radiation damage {{limits the}} amount of time that a {{macromolecular}} crystal diffracts when exposed to X-ray irradiation. Various aspects of this problem were inv~stigated in this work along with methods development for quantitative determination of the metal content of proteins and celIs. In particular, the iron storage protein ferritin was used to extend current understanding of the changes that occur in macromolecular crystals held at 100 K during exposure to X-rays. The characteristics of the expl!nsion in unit celI volume with absorbed dose and with temperature were examined and found to be distinguishable. A comparison between the iron loaded (holo) and the iron void (apo) forms of ferritin alIowed the contribution to the damage ofthe absorbing iron core to be determined. Glutaraldehyde cross-linking was also tested as a method to increase r~diation resistance. Experiments were carried out to establish the room temperature dose limit of protein crystals and compare this with the dose limit measured at <b>cryotemperatures.</b> Surprisingly, it was found that there was a significant decrease in radiation damage at higher dose rates. An online microspectrophotometer at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility was used to screen large numbers of potential radioprotectants at 100 K by monitoring the absorbance spectra of the 400 nm peak associated with a disulphide radical anion formed by X-ray cleavage of a disulphide bond. Ascorbate, quinone, TEMP and DIT were identified as effective radioprotectants. The most promising radioprotectant (ascorbate) was put into co-crystallisation and soaking trials with lysozyme to measure its protective effect against X-ray induced damage at 100 K and room temperature. For high throughput trace element detection, XRF was investigated, but calibration for proteins proved problematic. MicroPIXE was used for trace element mapping of wild type and Niemann Pick TypeC (a neurodegenerative disorder) cells to identify alterations in trace element composition.

40|$|Actually, the {{germplasm}} of Jatropha spp. is conserved {{as whole}} plants in field collections. Under this storage method, the genetic resources {{are exposed to}} disease, pest and natural hazards such as human error, drought and weather damage. Besides, field genebanks are costly to maintain and with important requirements of trained personnel. Thus, the development of efficient techniques to ensure its safe conservation and regeneration is therefore of paramount importance. In this work we describe a method for Jatropha curcas seeds cryoexposure and seedling recovery after thawed. In a first experiment, an efficient protocol for in vitro plant recovery was carried out using zygotic embryo or seeds with or without coat. In a second experiment, desiccated seeds with or without coat were exposed to liquid nitrogen and evaluated after cryoexposure. Germination percentages were variable among treatments, and seeds demonstrated tolerance to liquid nitrogen exposure under certain conditions. Seeds of J. curcas presented up to 99. 6 % germination after seed coat removal. Seeds with coat cultured in vitro did not germinate, and were 60 % contaminated. The germination of the zygotic embryos was significantly higher in the ½ MS medium (93. 1 %) than in WPM medium (76. 2 %), but from zygotic embryo, abnormal seedlings reached up to 99 %. Seeds with coat exposed to liquid nitrogen showed 60 % germination in culture after coat removal with good plant growth, and seeds cryopreserved without coat presented 82 % germination, but seedlings showed a reduced vigor and {{a significant increase in}} abnormal plants. Seeds cultured in vitro with coat did not germinate, independently of cryoexposure or not. This study reports the first successful in vitro seedling recovery methodology for Jatropha curcas seeds, after a cryopreservation treatment, and is recommended as an efficient procedure for in vitro plant recovery, when seeds are conserved in germplasm banks by low or <b>cryotemperatures...</b>|$|R
