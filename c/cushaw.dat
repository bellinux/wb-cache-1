5000|$|The <b>Cushaw</b> Hydroelectric Project is a 7.5 {{megawatt}} (MW) dam {{and power}} house facility {{owned and operated}} by Virginia Electric Power Company, operating as Dominion Virginia Power.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} {{constructed}} and began generating electric power in 1930 {{at the site}} of a former dam constructed in the 1800s also known as <b>Cushaw</b> Dam or Snowden Dam.The <b>Cushaw</b> Project consists of a 1,550-foot-long, 27-foot-high reinforced concrete dam, with a 1,500-foot-long spillway extending diagonally across the James River. The dam impounds a 138-acre reservoir with a surface elevation of 656 feet mean sea level (msl) at normal operating pool. The project’s powerhouse is integral with the dam and contains five generating units with a total installed capacity of 7,500 kilowatts. Project power is transmitted through a 2.3-kilovolt (kV) underground cable connected to a substation. Dominion operates the project remotely from its Bath County Pumped Storage project.|$|E

50|$|Cucurbita argyrosperma, {{also the}} Japanese pie pumpkin or <b>cushaw</b> pumpkin, and silver-seed gourd, is {{a species of}} winter squash {{originally}} from the south of Mexico. This annual herbaceous plant is cultivated in the Americas for its nutritional value: its flowers, shoots, and fruits are all harvested, but it is cultivated most of all for its seeds, which are used for sauces. It was formerly known as Cucurbita mixta.|$|E
50|$|Big Island is a census-designated {{place in}} far {{northern}} Bedford County, Virginia. The population {{as of the}} 2010 Census was 303.

5000|$|Crop, {{agricultural}} skill, {{and cultural}} refinements increased between AD 300 and 500 as the Hohokam acquired {{a new group}} of cultivated plants, presumably from trade with peoples in the area of modern Mexico. These new acquisitions included cotton, tepary bean, sieva and jack beans, <b>cushaw</b> and warty squash, and southwestern pigweed. Agave species had been gathered for food and fiber for thousands of years by southwestern peoples, but around 600, the Hohokam began cultivating agave, particularly Agave murpheyi ("Hohokam agave"), on large areas of rocky, dry ground. Agave became a major food source for the Hohokam to augment the food grown in irrigated areas. [...] Engineering improved access to river water and the inhabitants excavated canals for irrigation. Evidence of trade networks include turquoise, shells from the Gulf of California, and parrot bones from central Mexico. Seeds and grains were prepared on stone manos and metates. Ceramics appeared shortly before AD 300, with pots of unembellished brown used for storage and cooking, and as containers for cremated remains. Materials produced for ritual use included fired clay human and animal figures and incense burners.|$|E
40|$|Summary: We {{present an}} {{extension}} of <b>CUSHAW</b> 2 for fast and accurate alignments of SOLiD color-space short-reads. Our extension introduces a double-seeding approach to improve mapping sensitivity, by combining maximal exact match seeds and variable-length seeds derived from local alignments. We have compared the performance of <b>CUSHAW</b> 2 to SHRiMP 2 and BFAST by aligning both simulated and real color-space mate-paired reads to the human genome. The results show that <b>CUSHAW</b> 2 achieves comparable or better alignment quality compared to SHRiMP 2 and BFAST at an order-of-magnitude faster speed and significantly smaller peak resident memory size.

40|$|The {{majority}} of next-generation sequencing short-reads can be properly aligned by leading aligners at high speed. However, the alignment quality {{can still be}} further improved, since usually not all reads can be correctly aligned to large genomes, such as the human genome, even for simulated data. Moreover, even slight improvements {{in this area are}} important but challenging, and usually require significantly more computational endeavor. In this paper, we present <b>CUSHAW</b> 3, an open-source parallelized, sensitive and accurate short-read aligner for both base-space and color-space sequences. In this aligner, we have investigated a hybrid seeding approach to improve alignment quality, which incorporates three different seed types, i. e. maximal exact match seeds, exact-match k-mer seeds and variable-length seeds, into the alignment pipeline. Furthermore, three techniques: weighted seed-pairing heuristic, paired-end alignment pair ranking and read mate rescuing have been conceived to facilitate accurate paired-end alignment. For base-space alignment, we have compared <b>CUSHAW</b> 3 to Novoalign, <b>CUSHAW</b> 2, BWA-MEM, Bowtie 2 and GEM, by aligning both simulated and real reads to the human genome. The results show that <b>CUSHAW</b> 3 consistently outperforms <b>CUSHAW</b> 2, BWA-MEM, Bowtie 2 and GEM in terms of single-end and paired-end alignment. Furthermore, our aligner has demonstrated better paired-end alignment performance than Novoalign for short-reads with high error rates. For color-space alignment, <b>CUSHAW</b> 3 is consistently one of the best aligners compared to SHRiMP 2 and BFAST. The source code of <b>CUSHAW</b> 3 and all simulated dat...|$|E
40|$|The first {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} under green house and involved nine treatments: ‘Tsuyoi’ cucumber, ‘Shelper’ squash and ‘Green-stripped <b>cushaw</b> squash’ ungrafted plants and ‘Tsuyoi’ cucumber plants grafted onto ‘Shelper’ squash and ‘Green-stripped <b>cushaw</b> squash (lower, mid and upper region of the recommended and non-recommended rootstock, respectively). After grafting, plant tissue samples were collected 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 days after grafting for analysis of peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 7) and polyphenol oxidase (EC 1. 10. 3. 1) activity. In the second experiment, yield and number of marketable fruits were evaluated. The differences in peroxidase activity at the rootstock region and in polyphenol activity at the region between the scion and the rootstock seem to be determining factors for a successful grafting process, increasing the yield {{and the number of}} marketable fruits...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{next-generation}} sequencing (NGS) datasets poses {{a challenge to}} the align-ment of reads to reference genomes in terms of alignment quality and execution speed. Some available aligners have been shown to obtain high quality mappings at the expense of long execution times. Finding fast yet accurate software solutions is of high importance to research, since availability and size of NGS datasets continue to increase. In this work we present an efficient parallelization approach for NGS short-read alignment on multi-core clusters. Our approach takes advantage of a distributed shared memory programming model based on the new UPC++ language. Experimental results using the <b>CUSHAW</b> 3 aligner show that our implementation based on dynamic scheduling obtains good scalability on multi-core clusters. Through our evaluation, we are able to complete the single-end and paired-end alignments of 246 million reads of length 150 base-pairs in 11. 54 and 16. 64 min-utes, respectively, using 32 nodes with four AMD Opteron 6272 16 -core CPUs per node. In contrast, the multi-threaded original tool needs 2. 77 and 5. 54 hours to perform the same alignments on the 64 cores of one node.

40|$|Butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata Duch. Ex Poir) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular winter {{squashes}} grown in the United States. However, current consumers not only bake but also microwave squash. The flesh is much thinner at the bulb end of the fruit around the seed cavity than in the neck of the typical butternut squash so that the whole fruit does not cook uniformly during the microwave process. A smaller butternut type squash with a more uniform flesh thickness around most of the seed cavity would be expected to cook more uniformly in the microwave and would be useful to home gardeners and for the fresh market, but not for processors. A novel, small-sized, flavorful, flat-shouldered, globe-shaped fruit line NE-RBN- 4 of butternut quality was developed and released in 1997 as ‘Butterbowl’ (Fig. 1). No winter squash with these characteristics is presently available for consumers. A local panel expressed a strong interest in this squash because of its small size, excellent cooked quality, and attractive shape. Origin Segregation of plants with crookneck, long straight necks, short necks, pear, and nearround to flat-shouldered, globe fruit shapes were observed in the F 2 generation of the cross of true breeding crookneck lines NE-BNCR- 67 - 1 - 7 x Yellow <b>Cushaw</b> (Agway Co., Syracuse, N. Y.) (Ibrahim et al., 1973). The mutant BNCR- 67 - 1 - 7 was selected in ‘Butternut 23 ’ by the senior author. A number of S 4 inbred lines were derived subsequently from selfing circumthe F 2 plants with the novel neckless fruit. Seed was saved from an open-pollinated (OP) flat-shouldered, globe-shaped fruit of one of the S 4 lines. An S 6 inbred line NE-RBN- 4 was subsequently derived from selfing the above OP progeny and after testing was released with the name ‘Butterbowl’. Description ‘Butterbowl’ and two standard butternut cultivars, ‘Waltham’ and ‘Ponca’, were evaluated in field trials over 3 years (1992, 1994, 1995) at Lincoln, Nebr. Single-row plots of each cultivar were spaced 2. 4 m apart, with five plants spaced 1. 2 m apart within rows in a randomized complete-block design with five replications. Mean marketable fruit weight, fruit yield, and days to maturity were recorded. The reactions of the cultivars to the following disease and insect pests were recorded: black rot on fruit caused by the fungus Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm [anamorph: Phoma cucurbitacearum (Fr) Sacc] (at harvest); bacterial spot on foliage caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. cucurbitae (Bryon) Dowson (early August); powdery mildew on leaves caused by Erysiphe cichoracearum DC (end of August); and vine borer injury (Melitia cucurbitae Harris) (at harvest) ...|$|E
