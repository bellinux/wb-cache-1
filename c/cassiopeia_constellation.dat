50|$|NGC 663, {{also known}} as Caldwell 10, is young open cluster of about 400 stars in the <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation.</b> It has an {{estimated}} 400 stars and spans {{about a quarter of}} a degree across the sky. It can reportedly be detected with the unaided eye, although a telescope is recommended for best viewing. The brightest members of the cluster can be viewed with binoculars. Although the listed visual magnitude is 7.1, several observers have reported higher estimates.|$|E

50|$|After the {{alignment}} {{of stars in}} the <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation</b> on March 24, 1982, generating what {{is described as a}} second Star of Bethlehem, Damien realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1982 to prevent the Christ Child's return to power. A week after a string of thirty one infant deaths, Reynolds encounters DeCarlo as he reveals Damien's true identity to her while giving her evidence of the murders. The next day, Damien rapes and sodomises Reynolds. The following morning Reynolds discovers Damien's birthmark. Damien tells Peter to follow DeCarlo, resulting in Damien learning that his advisor, Harvey Dean, had concealed the date of his son's birth when Peter reports DeCarlo visiting Dean's wife Barbara and revealing her husband's role in the infant murders. Dean refuses to kill his son and makes preparations to flee the country, only to return home and be killed by his wife, Barbara, who has fallen under Damien's control and murdered their child.|$|E
50|$|By {{the events}} of Omen III: The Final Conflict, {{revealed}} to have attended Oxford, the adult Damien arranges his appointment as Ambassador to Great Britain and overseer of the United Nations Youth Associations. But his reason for taking on his father's position is that England is where the Second Coming will occur during an alignment in the <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation</b> {{and he needs to}} find and kill the Christ-child before his power completely wanes. While dealing with assassins under Father DeCarlo, who each possess a dagger of Megiddo salvaged from the ruins of the Thorn museum, Damien has his numerous followers kill every male English child born on the morning of March 24. But the Christ-child is revealed to have eluded Damien's followers. But another hindrance to his dominion comes from journalist Kate Reynolds and her adolescent son Peter, Damien's fascination with them proving to be his undoing as he is eventually killed when Reynolds stabs him in the back while he attempts to kill DeCarlo (after using Peter as a shield). Damien lives long enough to see a vision of Christ and dies telling Him that He has won nothing, his spiritual essence revealed to have endured his physical demise since only one dagger was used rather than all seven in a cross formation to ensure his complete death.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of the first gravitational microlensing event in a sparse stellar field involving the brightest (V= 11. 4 mag) and closest (∼ 1 kpc) source star to date. This event was discovered by an amateur astronomer A. Tago on 31 October 2006 as a transient brightening, by ∼ 4. 5 magnitude during a ∼ 15 day period, of a normal A-type star (GSC 3656 - 1328) in the <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation.</b> Analysis of both spectroscopic observations and the light curve indicates that this event was caused by gravitational microlensing, rather than an intrinsically variable star. Discovery of this single event over a 30 year period is roughly consistent with the expected microlensing rate for the whole sky down to V = 12 mag stars. However, the probability for finding events with such a high magnification (∼ 50) is much smaller by a factor ∼ 1 / 50, which implies that...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation</b> {{appears in}} the sky forming the “M ” mark and the “W ” mark, and this fact has {{certainly}} provoked {{the attention of the}} ancient shamans. In the rocky picture of Rocca Cavour (3500 B. C. – Piedmont, Northern Italy) (Fig. 1) the constellation at M size which is above the head of the shaman woman has been identified by archaeologists as “antropomorfo con cappello” that is anthropomorphous with a hat (Barale, 2001). In the euro-asiatic shamanism there is a sky zone in which spirits grow and after they descend from heaven to the earth, as it is said in the “Caldean Oracles”–fragment 115 : “ [...] from there it has been sent the soul, covered with intense feeling… ” (Tonelli, 1995). This Trascendence concept {{appears in the}} two specular images of Cassiopeia under the breasts of the shaman statuette of Passo di Corvo (5 300 B. C. – Puglia, Southern Italy) (Gimbutas, 1990) (Fig. 2). This concept is completed by the two butterflies below, which are symbols of the psyco-pump animal (Bellatalla & De Toffol, 1999) which, after death, takes back spirits to the constellation of provenance. Marija Gimbutas defines it as “the embodiment of the principle of Transformation ” (Streep, 1994). This same interpretation is also to apply to the feminine face of the vase of Porto Badisco, which has three W marks, one under each eye and one under the noise, and which has been presented in the show titled “Antichi segni dell’uomo ” (Ancient Signs of Men, Istituto Italiano di Preistoria e Protostoria (2005) (Fig. 3). Another image of three marks of Cassiopeia is in the “Grotta dei Cervi ” (Porto Badisco – Neo-eneolithic Age) (Maraschini, 1999) (Fig. 4) and also into the engravings of the Vinkovci vase, identified by prof. Aleksandar Durman of the Zagreb University (Vucedol Culture, 2 600 B. C.) in which the <b>Cassiopeia</b> <b>constellation</b> is shown in the Summer mark (as M size) and in Winter mark (as vertical size) (Gironi, 2001) (Figg. 5 - 6). In the cap of the funerary vase of Grotta Barche (Etruria, Central Italy, Last Bronze Age) there are two both opposite sizes (M and W marks) (Negroni Catacchio, 1995) (Fig. 7). In Sas Conca...|$|E
