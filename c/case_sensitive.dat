30|$|The {{antibiotic}} sensitivity profile {{was nearly}} similar to our earlier report. Gram-positive bacilli had good sensitivity to vancomycin in either group, {{similar to the}} EVS report [2], and the gram-negative bacilli had poor sensitivity to ceftazidime in either group, similar to our earlier report [1]. All ceftazidime resistant gram-negative bacilli in group A (in-house <b>cases)</b> were <b>sensitive</b> to imipenem. Additionally, 77.78 % of resistant isolates from referred <b>cases</b> were <b>sensitive</b> to amikacin. Imipenem appears to be good choice in gram-negative organisms resistant to ceftazidime and amikacin [15 – 17]. Amikacin could still be an alternative choice, though we have already reported emergence of gram-negative bacteria resistant to both ceftazidime and amikacin [18]. Hence it is prudent to always do a culture-sensitivity test for appropriate management.|$|R
