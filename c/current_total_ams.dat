40|$|Proposals on {{domestic}} support were submitted in the WTO agriculture negotiations by the USA, the EU, and the G- 20 in October 2005, {{based on the}} 2004 Framework agreement. This paper pays attention to the de minimis rules and the resulting de minimis allowances and projects future (2014) distorting support for the USA and the EU- 15. It calculates the constraints resulting from projected values of production combined with the U. S., EU and G- 20 proposals and compares their effectiveness in constraining components of distorting support and the projected future applied support. The de minimis rules {{make a difference in}} estimating how much distorting support can be provided in the future. Under the U. S. proposal the Overall commitment does not constrain either the USA or the EU. Under the EU and especially the G- 20 proposals the Overall commitment constrains distorting support to be less than the sum of the cap on blue and the maximum usable components. This maximum is smaller than the sum of the commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (AMS) and the de minimis allowances. The U. S. proposal constrains only one component (<b>Current</b> <b>Total</b> <b>AMS)</b> and this only for the EU. The EU proposal does not constrain projected future applied support in either the USA or the EU. The G- 20 proposal constrains the future <b>Current</b> <b>Total</b> <b>AMS</b> for both the USA and the EU. The G- 20 proposal constrains projected future Overall distorting support for the EU but not for the USA. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|Much {{confusion}} permeates {{discussions of}} the domestic support provisions of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture and in the ongoing Doha negotiations. The paper clarifies some conceptual distinctions {{with a view to}} dispelling some confusion, enhancing communication, and facilitating the representation of domestic support provisions in economic analysis. It distinguishes between classification of policy measures and measurement of support, between measures and support, among measures classified in various categories, between applied support and commitments, and between applied support that counts towards commitments and applied support that does not. It highlights certain issues, including the role of criteria in classifying policy measures (such as those labelled green box or blue box measures), the role of de minimis rules in measuring certain applied support (such as <b>Current</b> <b>Total</b> <b>AMS),</b> and how the time specificity of applied support may complicate analysis of domestic support provisions. It introduces schematic charts to complement the verbal exposition of classification and measurement rules under the Agreement on Agriculture and as suggested in the 2004 Framework of the Doha negotiations on agriculture.

40|$|This paper reviews recent {{agricultural}} policy changes in China and presents estimates of domestic {{support for the}} period 1996 - 2005. A set of relevant alternative subsidy-definition scenarios and their effects on the calculated levels of support are analyzed, and a projection of domestic support through 2013 is presented. The paper concludes {{with a discussion of}} new WTO rules that may be negotiated in the Doha Round and their implications for China. Based on standard WTO subsidy calculation methods, our results indicated that China's domestic support for the period 1996 - 2005 has been well below the limits agreed at its WTO accession. The market price support (MPS) component of the aggregate measure of support (AMS) in China has been below zero, and this has dwarfed the relatively small but positive non-product specific AMS and led to a zero <b>current</b> <b>total</b> <b>AMS</b> after de minimis. China has no AMS commitments but can provide trade-distorting domestic support to agricultural producers up to 8. 5 percent of the value of production (or RMB 561 billion). Thus there appears to be substantial room for China to extend its amber box subsidy measures through heavy use of the de minimis provision. We project domestic support notifications through 2013 based on specified assumptions about domestic policies, including changes in administered prices and commodity program coverage. New rules potentially negotiated in the Doha Round are expected to provide more constraints on subsidies. Due to China's developing country status, with no AMS commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture the impacts of these new constraints are shown to be limited, although our projections indicate that China may exceed its WTO commitment levels under certain price and commodity coverage scenarios.

40|$|The July 2004 Agriculture Framework is {{the basis}} for {{negotiations}} of modalities in agriculture in the WTO. The significant new ideas on domestic support include an Overall Reduction applying to the sum of Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (Total AMS), de minimis AMSs, and blue box payments (i. e., all non-green support), tiered harmonizing reductions of overall distorting support and Total AMS, caps on product-specific AMSs, cap on and criteria for blue box payments, lower de minimis, and review of green box criteria. This paper assesses how several of these provisions might constrain the future (2014) distorting domestic support of USA, EU, Japan, Canada, Brazil, and China. Future support is projected, paying particular attention to U. S. and EU support. The analysis uses a hypothetical 90 - 80 - 70 - 60 reduction scenario to estimate the remaining entitlements to support and calculates the cuts the six Members can accommodate without affecting projected future support. It also estimates the maximum support that can be used within the commitments, considering that simply summing the Total AMS commitment and all de minimis allowances overestimates the amount of support that can be provided (a product's AMS can not at the same time be de minimis and counted in <b>Current</b> <b>Total</b> <b>AMS).</b> The six Members can accommodate large cuts in commitments on overall distorting support and Total AMS. A cut of 75 percent would not bite into the U. S. future support and a 79 percent cut would not constrain future EU- 15 support. Large cuts would not force the other four Members to reduce support from what they have notified or provided in recent years. Large cuts will prevent reversals of support reductions. Harmonizing tiered cuts can effectively address the support entitlements of the large subsidizers. Altogether the provisions of the 2004 Framework allow for substantial reductions in distorting support, and the Overall Reduction can be particularly effective. The reduction scenario examined for the six Members reduces their combined usable entitlements to all distorting support by about half (from $ 301 bill. in the base period to $ 148 bill. in 2014) when applied to Total AMS, de minimis, and blue entitlement separately. Applying also the Overall Reduction reduces the combined usable entitlements by a further $ 84 bill., bringing their allowed distorting support down to $ 65 bill. However, this requires that Members agree to sizeable percentage cuts in the commitments on Overall Reduction and on Total AMS. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the economic costs of avoidable mortality (AM) in Colombia {{during the period}} 1998 to 2011, with the human capital perspective valuing the productivity lost. MethodsThe information of cases of avoidable death was identified from the Colombian official general mortality database, and we estimated the potential productivity years of life lost, assuming a productive life span between 18 years and 57 years and 18 years and 62 years in women and men, respectively. Two scenarios were built: lower loss with the minimum wage, and higher loss with the per capita gross domestic product. Total costs for the period were reported by sex and health event. Average cost per 1000 people was also estimated. All costs were adjusted and reported in 2012 US dollars. ResultsSixty-eight percent of the <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> in Colombia during the period 1998 to 2011 occurred during or before the productivity age. The <b>total</b> <b>AM</b> costs were estimated to range between US $ 80. 5 million and US $ 150. 4 million. Higher costs of AM were incurred in men. Events from the injuries group caused the higher productivity lost. ConclusionsAll the avoidable deaths in Colombia have a huge economic impact from the productivity lost perspective, equivalent to between 1. 6 % and 3. 0 % of the annual gross domestic product. The cost analyses in public health are an additional input for decision making and prioritization of intervention...|$|R
