5|$|Edward {{enjoyed a}} good {{relationship}} with Pope Clement V, despite the King's repeated intervention in the operation of the English Church, including punishing bishops with whom he disagreed. With Clement's support, Edward attempted to gain the financial support of the English Church for his military campaigns in Scotland, including taxation and borrowing money against the funds gathered for the crusades. The English Church did relatively little to influence or moderate Edward's behaviour during his reign, possibly because of the bishops' self-interest and <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> own protection.|$|E
5|$|The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, takes Scrooge to a joy-filled {{market of}} people buying {{the makings of}} Christmas dinner and {{celebrations}} of Christmas in a miner's cottage and in a lighthouse. Scrooge and the ghost also visit Fred's Christmas party. A major part of this stave is taken up with Bob Cratchit's family feast and introduces his youngest son, Tiny Tim, a happy boy who is seriously ill. The spirit informs Scrooge that Tiny Tim will die soon unless {{the course of events}} changes. Before disappearing, the spirit shows Scrooge two hideous, emaciated children named Ignorance and Want. He tells Scrooge to beware the former above all and mocks Scrooge's <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> welfare.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{played a}} major role in the British effort in the First World War. It {{especially}} provided manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. <b>Concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled. Clydeside shipyards and the engineering shops of west-central Scotland became the most significant centre of shipbuilding and arms production in the Empire. In the Lowlands, particularly Glasgow, poor working and living conditions led to industrial and political unrest. After the end of the war in June 1919 the German fleet interned in Scapa Flow was scuttled by its crews, to avoid its ships being taken over by the victorious allies.|$|E

25|$|Though still {{a matter}} for debate, the {{indemnity}} deal has complicated the question of ultimate blame.

The 2002 deal has appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at a quick fix.

25|$|India in the 16th century {{presented}} a fragmented picture of rulers, both Muslim and Hindu, who lacked <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> subjects {{and failed to}} create a common body of laws or institutions. Outside developments {{also played a role}} in shaping events. The circumnavigation of Africa by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498 allowed Europeans to challenge Muslim control of the trading routes between Europe and Asia. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, shifts in power pushed Babur of Ferghana (in present-day Uzbekistan) southward, first to Kabul and then to India. The dynasty he founded endured for more than three centuries.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the ransoming process, the CÃ¡zares {{were allowed}} to talk with their {{remaining}} relatives in three occasions.

Their second conversation was a lot shorter and emotive for the CÃ¡zares, however. By July 27, the kidnappers said they needed a final cash deliver in order to release them. The CÃ¡zares sent the money to Matamoros from Texas and eagerly awaited at a disclosed location for a white van {{that was supposed to}} deliver their relatives. The van never came and the phone line that the family used to contact the kidnappers was out of service. Weeks after that, the family decided to contact law enforcement.|$|E

25|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype of corporate America in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite frequent interactionsâ {{which has become a}} recurrent joke) and lack of <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life. Conan O'Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old age and extreme wealth.|$|E
25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters out of <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because readers will attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed {{that if he were}} to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it would put on he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E
25|$|For Congolese, mining is {{the easiest}} source of income, because the work is consistent, albeit for only 1 dollar per day. It is laborious, as miners walk for days in the forest to the ore, scratch it with hand tools and pan it. About 90% of young men in Congo do this. Research {{revealed}} that many Congolese leave farming because they need money quickly and cannot wait for crops to grow. Farming also presents obstacles. For example, a lack of roads makes it extremely difficult to transport produce to markets, and the harvest can be taken by militias or the Congolese army. Once their food is taken away or {{they can no longer}} grow food, people resort to mining to sustain themselves. Organized mines are usually run by corrupt groups like militias. Congolese have few tools to mine coltan, and no safety procedures or experience in mining. There is no government aid or intervention in many unethical and abusive circumstances. Miners consider coltan mining a way to provide for themselves in the face of widespread war and conflict and a government that has no <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> welfare.|$|E

25|$|In Sophocles' Antigone, when Oedipus {{stepped down}} as king of Thebes, he gave the kingdom to his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, both of whom agreed to {{alternate}} the throne every year. However, they showed no <b>concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> father, who cursed them for their negligence. After the first year, Eteocles refused to step down and Polynices attacked Thebes with his supporters (as portrayed in the Seven Against Thebes by Aeschylus and the Phoenician Women by Euripides). The two brothers killed each other in battle. King Creon, who ascended to the throne of Thebes, decreed that Polynices {{was not to be}} buried. Antigone, Polynices' sister, defied the order, but was caught. Creon decreed that she was to be put into a stone box in the ground, this in spite of her betrothal to his son Haemon. Antigone's sister, Ismene, then declared she had aided Antigone and wanted the same fate, but Creon eventually declined executing her. The gods, through the blind prophet Tiresias, expressed their disapproval of Creon's decision, which convinced him to rescind his order, and he went to bury Polynices himself. However, Antigone had already hanged herself in her tomb, rather than suffering the slow death of being buried alive. When Creon arrived at the tomb where she had been interred, his son Haemon attacked him upon seeing the body of his deceased fiancÃ©e, but failing to kill Creon he killed himself. When Creon's wife, Eurydice, was informed of the death of Haemon, she too took her own life.|$|E

Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment {{had one of the}} highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city. <b>Concern</b> <b>for</b> <b>their</b> families' standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled. After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the Battle of Loos, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of Lewis and Harris suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centres of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended.
