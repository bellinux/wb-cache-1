Analysis of Chariton's language has produced a range of proposals for dating. In the 19th century, before {{the discovery of the}} papyri, a date as late as the 6th century AD was proposed on stylistic grounds, while A. D.

500|$|Not all {{critics have}} praised Dragonlance and its creators. According to author Stephen Hunt, Wendy Bradley of Interzone {{magazine}} {{does not think}} highly of their work. Hunt feels that it is unusual for authors to receive such loathing among [...] "fantasy's literary mafia", saying, [...] "Behind every critic's scorn laden insult, there [...] that unsaid thought at the end: 'But I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> that!'" [...] Visions of Wonder, edited by David G. Hartwell and Milton T. Wolf, and published by the Science Fiction Research Association, argues that Dragonlance is published under the [...] "omnivore theory" [...] of publishing. In this theory, the readership {{is made up of}} teenagers, and completely replaces itself every three to five years. This allows publishers to release subpar novels and still reach a small yet profitable audience.|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events.

I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E

500|$|Cast member Wil Wheaton rewatched {{the episode}} for AOL TV in November 2006. He criticised {{the writing of}} Fontana in this episode, saying that around this time she {{appeared}} on a panel at a convention about how to solve [...] "The Wesley Problem", but when rewatching the episode he thought that [...] "maybe instead of sitting on this panel and trashing me, D.C Fontana <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> intelligent dialogue for me and helped solve the [...] "Wesley problem" [...] herself. I don't know, maybe she {{tried to do that}} and didn't get a lot of support {{from the rest of the}} producers and writing staff, but even I know of Dr. Channing's theory of not writing cliched dialogue for kids in science fiction, and then blaming the actor who is forced to deliver it." [...] Overall he criticised the [...] "very stiff" [...] dialogue throughout the episode, and called the set-up [...] "incredibly forced". He did highlight that Data acting out as Sherlock Holmes laid the foundation of future episodes which would expand on this.|$|E
500|$|Ravel was not by {{inclination}} a teacher, {{but he gave}} {{lessons to}} a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them. Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent. Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters. He warned Rosenthal {{that it was impossible}} to learn from studying Debussy's music: [...] "Only Debussy <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound." [...] When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they [...] "would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity". The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams, who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08. Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from [...] "the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the press}} conference both Trevor-Roper and Weinberg {{expressed}} their doubts at the authenticity, and stated that German experts needed to examine the diaries to confirm whether the works were genuine. Trevor-Roper {{went on to say}} that his doubts sprung from the lack of proof that these books were the same ones as had been on the crashed plane in 1945. He finished his statement by saying that [...] "I regret that the normal method of historical verification has been sacrificed to the perhaps necessary requirements of a journalistic scoop." [...] The leading article in The Guardian described his public reversal as showing [...] "moral courage". Irving, who had been described in the introductory statement by Koch as a historian [...] "with no reputation to lose", stood at the microphone for questions, and asked how Hitler <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> his diary in the days following the 20 July plot, when his arm had been damaged. He denounced the diaries as forgeries, and held aloft the photocopied pages he had been given from Priesack. He asked if the ink in the diaries had been tested, but there was no response from the managers of Stern. Photographers and film crews jostled to get a better picture of Irving, and some punches were thrown by journalists while security guards moved in and forcibly removed Irving from the room, while he shouted [...] "Ink!

500|$|In {{the post-war}} era {{there was a}} {{reaction}} against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss. Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began {{to work on a}} much smaller scale. His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments. Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for [...] "dépouillement" [...] – the [...] "stripping away" [...] of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials. Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces. Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality. Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work. Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera, and its influence is heard in his later music. Arnold Schönberg's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> without the example of Pierrot Lunaire. His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).|$|E
500|$|She {{was also}} an {{inspiration}} to poet Walt Whitman, who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature. Elizabeth Barrett Browning was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead. She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: [...] "The work she was preparing upon Italy {{would probably have been}} more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)". An 1860 essay collection, Historical Pictures Retouched, by Caroline Healey Dall, called Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century [...] "doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject". Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic Edgar Allan Poe wrote of the work as [...] "a book which few women in the country <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written,</b> and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller", noting its [...] "independence" [...] and [...] "unmitigated radicalism". Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was [...] "rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand".|$|E
500|$|While his output {{covered a}} wide range of topics, he {{is best known for his}} {{contributions}} to botanical history, taxonomy, botanical bibliography, and botanical illustration. Botanical Latin (4 editions 1966–1992), is his best known work, having become a standard reference and described as both the bible of plant taxonomists and a philological masterwork. It was begun during the war years and the first edition was basically a guide to Latin for botanists with no or limited knowledge of the language, which he described as a [...] "do-it-yourself Latin kit" [...] for taxonomists. Later, the work evolved into an etymological dictionary, but the Stearn learned that such a work had already been published in the Netherlands before the war. He then continued to expand it with the assistance of his wife and son, systematically collecting botanical terms from botanical texts. It is said that only he <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> this work, which explains not just the derivation of plant names but also the philological principles involved in forming those names. The work is considered responsible for the continued survival of Latin as the lingua franca of botany. In addition to this seminal text, he frequently delighted in the illumination that the classics could add to understanding plants and plant lore, such as his Five Brethren of the Rose (1965).|$|E

500|$|Although Darwin gives plant-women {{the central}} role in each {{vignette}} (a reversal of Linnaeus's classification scheme, which focuses on the male), few of the representations stray from stereotypical images of women. When the female and male reproductive organs are in a 1:1 ratio in a plant, Darwin represents traditional couplings. The women are “playful”, “chaste”, “gentle” and “blooming”. When the ratio is 1:2-4, the female becomes a “helpmate” or “associate” to the males, who have separate bonds to their “brothers”. Once he reaches 1:5-6, however, Darwin presents women as “seductive or wanton” or, at the other extreme, “needing protection”. By 1:8+, he presents “unambiguous metaphors of power and command, [...] being pictured as a saint, a reigning sovereign, a sorceress, a proto-industrialist [...] [...] [...] a priestess”. The images also present a largely positive view {{of the relationship between}} the sexes; there is no rape or sexual violence of any kind, elements central to much of Ovid and Linnaeus. There is also no representation of the marriage market, divorce or adultery (with one exception); the poem is largely pastoral. There are also no representations of intelligent women or women writers, although Darwin knew quite a few. The exception is the “Botanic Muse”, who has the botanical knowledge that the poem imparts; however, as Browne argues, few readers in the eighteenth century would have seen this as a liberating image for women since they would have been skeptical that a woman <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> the poem and inhabited the voice of the muse (they would have assumed that the anonymous writer was a man).|$|E
500|$|Lucy Mangan of The Guardian responded positively, noting it [...] "manages brilliantly to nod to {{just about}} every Whovian in-joke, {{demographic}} and fetish within the span of two tiny installments". The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn opined that the two Amys in [...] "Space" [...] and [...] "Time" [...] were [...] "a lot more fun to watch" [...] than the two in the sixth series episode [...] "The Girl Who Waited". Tor.com's Teresa Jusino, who had positive towards Amy's character in the past, was disappointed that {{the ending of the}} miniepisodes relied on [...] "too-easy, dated, sexist humor". She cited the fact that Rory dropping the coupling was blamed on Amy's short skirt rather than Rory himself, which implied that she had a [...] "responsibility to cover up, because 'men will be men'". In Who is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Robert Smith wrote that the episode was [...] "cute, plotted to perfection and ends precisely when it should, before it has the chance to outstay its welcome". He said that the episodes used Amy well, as it did not make her unlikable. On the other hand, his coauthor Graeme Burk said that the story was [...] "derivative and lazy" [...] and a [...] "missed opportunity". He likened the plot to that of Red Dwarf [...] "Future Echoes", and felt that Moffat <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> something better and funnier. Like Jusino, he thought that the [...] "blokey humor" [...] was [...] "misplaced", denying a broad audience appeal and leading to the sexist last line: [...] "Pond, put some trousers on!".

500|$|Paramount gave Bennett {{the green}} light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened, the fastest go-ahead the {{producer}} had received. He began writing the screenplay, noting that [...] "seventeen other people <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>written</b> [...] " [...] after the hints at Spock's resurrection in the previous film. Bennett and Nimoy used the open thread of Spock mind melding with McCoy at the end of The Wrath of Khan as a way to explain Spock's restoration. The idea and name of the Vulcan [...] "katra" [...] came from Bennett's discussions with Nimoy. The actor referred the producer to an episode of the television series, [...] "Amok Time", that suggested to Bennett a high level of [...] "spiritual transference" [...] among the Vulcans. Bennett admitted that the idea of Kirk and company going back to the Genesis planet to recover Kirk's [...] "noble self" [...] stemmed from a poem he read in a Star Trek fan magazine. The film's production acknowledged certain expectations from fans—Nimoy remarked that if Spock had not been resurrected and, instead, [...] "Captain Kirk turn to the camera and [...] 'Sorry, we didn't find him,' people would throw rocks at the screen." [...] A major issue Bennett wrestled with was how to introduce the story for people who had not seen The Wrath of Khan. Bennett said that his television producer mentality [...] "won out"; he added a [...] "previously in Star Trek..." [...] film device, and had Kirk narrate a captain's log, describing his feelings and sense of loss. Aware of the story's predictability, Bennett decided to have the USS Enterprise destroyed, and intended this plot element be kept a secret.|$|E
