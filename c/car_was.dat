50|$|In the Second World War, some <b>cars</b> had <b>been</b> {{destroyed}} in the Bombings of Hamburg.

In 1955, every single <b>car</b> has <b>been</b> equipped with a speedometer and an odometer. In the late 1950s, the A <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> renamed in T cars, the rebuilt B <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> renamed in TU1 cars. Beginning in 1959, 100 T <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> refurbished to lower the maintenance costs. These <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> called TU2 and were rebuilt and clad with stainless steel instead of metal panels. This procedure was completed in 1961.|$|R
5|$|The initial XJ220 concept <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{unveiled}} to {{the public}} at the 1988 British International Motor Show, held in Birmingham, England.

5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air {{from the back of the}} <b>car</b> <b>was</b> accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E
50|$|Stolen <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in foreign}} {{countries}} for several reasons. In underdeveloped countries, there are often fewer rules and less enforcement of laws pertaining to plates and title paperwork, so the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} noticed. Criminals are also hopeful that there is little incentive {{on the part of the}} victim to search in other countries, as even if the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found, recovery may cost more (in detective, legal, and transportation fees) than the <b>car</b> <b>is</b> actually worth. This is especially true if the stolen <b>car</b> <b>is</b> of low value.|$|R
