40|$|Abstract Destructive {{pulmonary}} inflammation {{can leave}} patients {{with only a}} single functional lung, resulting in anatomical and physiological changes that may interfere with subsequent cardiac surgeries. Such patients are vulnerable to perioperative cardiopulmonary complications. Herein, we report the first case, to our knowledge, of an autopneumonectomized patient who successfully underwent a modified Cox-Maze III procedure combined with valvular repairs. The three major findings in this case can be summarized as follows: (1) a median sternotomy with peripheral <b>cannulations,</b> such as femoral <b>cannulations,</b> can provide an optimal exposure and prevent the obstruction of vision that may occur {{as a result of}} multiple <b>cannulations</b> through a median sternotomy; (2) a modified septal incision combined with biatrial incisions facilitate adequate exposure of the mitral valve; and (3) the aggressive use of intraoperative ultrafiltration may be helpful for the perioperative managements as decreasing pulmonary water contents, thereby avoiding the pulmonary edema associated with secretion of inflammatory cytokines during a cardiopulmonary bypass. We also provide several suggestions for achieving similar satisfactory surgical outcomes in patients with a comparable condition. </p...|$|R
25|$|Central IV lines carry {{risks of}} bleeding, infection, gangrene, {{thromboembolism}} and gas embolism (see Risks below). They {{are often more}} difficult to insert correctly as the veins are not usually palpable and rely on an experienced clinician knowing the appropriate landmarks and/or using an ultrasound probe to safely locate and enter the vein. Surrounding structures such as the pleura and carotid artery are also at risk of damage {{with the potential for}} pneumothorax or even <b>cannulation</b> of the artery.|$|E
25|$|Non-registered staff {{carry out}} a number of roles, often working in direct patient care (often on wards), {{performing}} tasks such as personal care (washing and dressing), social care (feeding, communicating to patients and generally spending time with them) and more specialised tasks such as recording observations or vital signs (such as temperature, pulse and respiratory rate, or TPR) or measuring and assessing blood pressure, urinalysis, blood glucose monitoring, pressure sores (see Waterlow score) and carrying out procedures such as catheterisation and <b>cannulation).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{practice}} of a German paramedic is not specifically {{defined by a}} decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous <b>cannulation</b> and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Radulovacki {{accepted}} a teaching {{position with the}} Physiology Department in the College of Medicine at the University of Khartoum, Sudan. It was there that he invented an approach for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid using a cannula to the cisterna magna in the brain of cats. The <b>cannulation</b> method enabled researchers to obtain cerebrospinal fluid during sleep and wakefulness {{for the analysis of}} monoamine metabolites. This approach was of interest since Michel Jouvet’s Monoamine Theory of Sleep, with serotonin as the sleep inducing agent, was dominant at the time. Later, from 1970 to 1984, at the University of Illinois, Radulovacki published a series of papers dealing with the role of monoamines in sleep.|$|E
500|$|Paramedic – This is a {{high level}} of medical {{training}} and usually involves key skills not permissible for technicians, such as <b>cannulation</b> (and with it the ability to administer a range of drugs such as morphine), tracheal intubation and other skills such as performing a cricothyrotomy.

30|$|There were {{limitations}} to this study. Firstly, we tested only S. epidermidis {{due to its}} association with bloodstream infection during ECMO and its reported association with culture confirmed ECMO cannula infection [4]. We tested S. aureus in a previous laboratory study with the same results as S. epidermidis [25]. Secondly, microbiological and mechanical testing was performed using only one type of TA (butyl-cyanoacrylate) as our previous testing [25] demonstrated its superiority over octyl-cyanoacrylate. Thirdly, mechanical testing of the cannulas and tubing was performed separately rather than together as one continuous ECMO line. There are limitations in testing two mechanical systems in series, due to different strengths, inevitably that the load will not be shared evenly between the two sites, meaning one will always fail before the other at a similar failure force of that part on its own. Lastly, the use of TA to secure ECMO cannulas would not be appropriate for central ECMO <b>cannulations</b> therefore our findings could only be generalisable to peripheral <b>cannulations.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Another {{method of}} {{achieving}} constriction of the supplying artery is a tourniquet - a band tied tightly around a limb to restrict blood flow. [...] Tourniquets are routinely {{used to bring}} veins to the surface for <b>cannulation,</b> though their use in emergency medicine is more limited. [...] Tourniquet use is restricted in most countries to professionals such as physicians and paramedics, as this is often considered {{beyond the reach of}} first aid and those acting in good faith as a good samaritan. [...] A key exception is the military, where many armies carry a tourniquet as part of their personal first aid kit.|$|E
2500|$|A {{paramedic}} has a {{high level}} of pre-hospital medical training and usually involves key skills not performed by technicians, often including <b>cannulation</b> (and with it the ability to use a range of drugs to relieve pain, correct cardiac problems, and perform endotracheal intubation), cardiac monitoring, tracheal intubation, pericardiocentesis, cardioversion, needle decompression and other skills such as performing a cricothyrotomy. The most important function of the paramedic is to identify and treat any life-threatening conditions and then to assess the patient carefully for other complaints or findings that may require emergency treatment. In many countries, this is a protected title, and use of it without the relevant qualification may result in criminal prosecution. In the United States, paramedics represent the highest licensure level of prehospital emergency care. In addition, several certifications exist for Paramedics such as Wilderness ALS Care, Flight Paramedic Certification [...] (FP-C), and Critical Care Emergency Medical Transport Program certification.|$|E
2500|$|Emergency medical technicians, {{also known}} as Ambulance Technicians in the UK and EMT in the United States. In the United States, EMT is usually made up of 3 levels. EMT-B, EMT-I (EMT-A in some states) and EMT-Paramedic. The National Registry of EMT New Educational Standards for EMS renamed the {{provider}} levels as follows: Emergency Medical Responder (EMR), Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Advanced EMT (AEMT), and Paramedic. EMTs are usually able to perform {{a wide range of}} emergency care skills, such as Automated defibrillation, care of spinal injuries and oxygen therapy. [...] In few jurisdictions, some EMTs are able to perform duties as IV and IO <b>cannulation,</b> administration of a limited number of drugs, more advanced airway procedures, CPAP, and limited cardiac monitoring.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} patient safety, our institution has designed and implemented a teaching program in which residents are gradually given more responsibility in performing US-guided maneuvers: the first procedures performed by residents are vein and arterial <b>cannulations,</b> followed by loco-regional anesthesia, paracentesis, and finally lung and pleural procedures. Along this learning journey, the use of simulation technology for practicing chest tube positioning provides an important stepping stone before a resident moves on to real patients under a qualified supervision.|$|R
30|$|The United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has {{endorsed}} {{the use of}} ultrasound to guide the placement of central venous catheters to lessen the frequency of complications [12].

30|$|The {{complications}} {{inherent to}} transpulmonary thermodilution technique {{are in fact}} related to the venous and arterial catheterisations [71]. In particular, the arterial catheter is of larger diameter than common arterial cannula, because it includes a thermistor.

We now perform pre-operative hysterosaplingogram on women at increased risk of having tubal damage. It remains to be seen whether the high incidence of tubal damage early in our series was a statistical glitch or a true reflection of our population.|$|R
