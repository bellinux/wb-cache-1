5000|$|The SEC {{does not}} require a fund to offer {{breakpoints}} in the fund's <b>sales</b> <b>load.</b> But, if breakpoints exist, the fund must disclose them.

5000|$|Often {{associated}} with class 'A' shares of a mutual fund. Also known as Sales Charge, {{this is a}} fee paid when shares are purchased. Also known as a [...] "front-end load," [...] this fee typically goes to the brokers that sell the fund's shares. Front-end loads {{reduce the amount of}} your investment. For example, let's say you have $1,000 and want to invest it in a mutual fund with a 5% front-end <b>load.</b> The $50 <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> you must pay comes off the top, and the remaining $950 will be invested in the fund. The Maximum <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is 9%. The maximum <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> under NASD Rules is 8%.|$|R
5000|$|Class A shares usually {{charge a}} {{front-end}} <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> {{together with a}} small distribution and services fee.|$|R
50|$|A {{share is}} also a way of pricing <b>sales</b> charges (<b>loads)</b> on mutual funds in the United States. In an A share, the <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> is up front, {{typically}} at most 5.75% of the amount invested. In contrast is the B share {{that does not have}} an upfront charge, but instead has higher ongoing expenses {{in the form of a}} higher 12B-1 fee, and a contingent deferred sales charge that only applies if the investor redeems shares before a specified period. The maximum A share <b>sales</b> <b>load</b> is decreased for larger investment amounts as a volume discount.|$|R
5000|$|Associated with Class [...] "C" [...] Shares. As {{the name}} implies, {{this means that}} the fund does not charge any type of <b>sales</b> <b>load.</b> But, as {{outlined}} above, not every type of shareholder fee is a [...] "sales load." [...] A no-load fund may charge fees that are not <b>sales</b> <b>loads,</b> such as purchase fees, redemption fees, exchange fees, and account fees. Class [...] "C" [...] shares have the highest annual expense charges.|$|R
50|$|Redemption Fee — {{another type}} of fee that some funds charge their {{shareholders}} when they sell or redeem shares. Unlike a deferred <b>sales</b> <b>load,</b> a redemption fee is paid to the fund (not to a Stockbroker) and is typically used to defray fund costs associated with a shareholder's redemption.|$|R
50|$|Purchase Fee — A type of fee {{that some}} funds charge their {{shareholders}} when they buy shares. Unlike a front-end <b>sales</b> <b>load,</b> a purchase fee {{is paid to}} the fund (not to a Stockbroker) and is typically imposed to defray some of the fund's {{costs associated with the}} purchase.|$|R
5000|$|Performance {{is usually}} {{quantified}} by a fund's total return. In the 1990s, many different fund companies were advertising various total returns—some cumulative, some averaged, some {{with or without}} deduction of <b>sales</b> <b>loads</b> or commissions, etc. To {{level the playing field}} and help investors compare performance returns of one fund to another, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began requiring funds to compute and report total returns based upon a standardized formula—so called [...] "SEC Standardized total return" [...] which is the average annual total return assuming reinvestment of dividends and distributions and deduction of <b>sales</b> <b>loads</b> or charges. Funds may compute and advertise returns on other bases (so-called [...] "non-standardized" [...] returns), so long as they also publish no less prominently the [...] "standardized" [...] return data.|$|R
50|$|Class A shares {{typically}} {{impose a}} front-end <b>sales</b> <b>load.</b> They {{also tend to}} have a lower 12b-1 fee and lower annual expenses than other mutual fund share classes. Be aware that some mutual funds reduce the front-end load as the size of your investment increases. If you're considering Class A shares, be sure to inquire about breakpoints.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expense ratio}} {{of a stock}} or asset fund is the total {{percentage}} of fund assets used for administrative, management, advertising (12b-1), and all other expenses. An expense ratio of 1% per annum means that each year 1% of the fund's total assets {{will be used to}} cover expenses. [...] The expense ratio does not include <b>sales</b> <b>loads</b> or brokerage commissions.|$|R
50|$|Class C shares {{might have}} a 12b-1 fee, other annual expenses, and either a front- or {{back-end}} <b>sales</b> <b>load.</b> But the front- or back-end load for Class C shares tends to be lower than for Class A or Class B shares, respectively. Unlike Class B shares, Class C shares generally do not convert to another class. Class C shares tend to have higher annual expenses than either Class A or Class B shares.|$|R

40|$|On average, {{fees and}} {{expenses}} incurred by investors in long-term mutual funds declined in 2010. Stock fund investors in 2010 paid {{an average of}} 95 basis points (0. 95 percent) in fees and expenses, down 3 basis points from 2009. Fees and expenses of bond funds declined 1 basis point, to 72 basis points. Expense ratios of stock funds declined in 2010, while expense ratios of bond funds were unchanged. The average expense ratio of stock funds fell 2 basis points to 84 basis points, after having risen the previous year. Bond fund expense ratios remained unchanged at 64 basis points.

40|$|Prior {{research}} shows that mutual fund investors are often aware of up-front charges like <b>sales</b> <b>loads,</b> but they are less mindful of annual operating expenses, even though both types of fees lower overall performance. This study documents the historical trend and recent abuse of annual mutual fund expenses. As the industry becomes more adept at segmenting customers by level of investment sophistication, we claim that load mutual fund companies {{take advantage of this}} ability and charge higher expenses to their target customer: the less-knowledgeable investor. No-load fund companies, which tend to attract the more sophisticated investor, offer lower expenses. For example, over 2000 – 2004 the average annual expense ratio of load equity funds was 50 basis points higher than no-load equity funds. We show evidence of this widening cost disparity since the early 1990 s among new and existing equity, bond, and index funds. We also document a growing abuse of sales distribution or 12 b- 1 fees among funds that are closed to new investors, almost all of which are load funds. Thus, load fund investors are more susceptible to paying higher expenses and receiving lower returns over time.

50|$|While private {{placement}} life insurance ("PPLI") (a product {{also known as}} insurance wrappers) first developed in the United States, the industry has witnessed significant growth in the placement of PPLI offshore. Offshore insurance companies specializing in PPLI typically offer the product as a financial service for high net worth clients and price their services as a provider, {{rather than as a}} traditional insurance carrier. For example, most offshore carriers are prohibited to maintain a domestic sales force; therefore, their products often do not include significant <b>sales</b> <b>loads</b> and commissions. Also, offshore carriers rarely engage in advertising. These reduced marketing costs enable the offshore carrier to provide PPLI to high-net-worth clients at a significantly reduced cost.|$|R

Also, unsurprisingly, we find fund families with high expense ratios serve investors less well than those with low expense ratios, and, unsurprisingly in light of research on the US mutual fund market, the return reduction is larger than can be accounted for by the difference in expense ratios. Surprisingly, for most mutual funds we find high and similar expense ratios.

The problem was that the root account used by systems administrators when reconfiguring parts of the system, was able to edit any of the audit trails created by the system. Freedman designed a new product, PowerBroker, that was similar in concept to today's sudo products, but which allowed centralized control and auditing of an entire network even down to the keystroke level, with the logs stored on a dedicated remote computer to which the system administrators typically did not have access. By vetting all access and logging through this remote machine, a secure log could be maintained. The system was ported to over 22 versions of UNIX to accommodate the newer, larger networks with hundreds or thousands of machines. Dean Huxley was responsible for most of the system-level programming on PowerBroker with Kevin Chmilar and Earle Lowe also contributing.|$|R
