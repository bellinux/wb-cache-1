The method uses a predictive feedforward element combined with a fuzzy logic controller to achieve accurate control over engine temperature.

40|$|Abstract — Adjusting {{operating}} {{temperature of the}} engine in the steady state and during warm-up improves fuel consumption and reduces engine emission through higher {{operating temperature}}s. Also it can improve thermal comfort by faster cabin heater performance. Thermal fluid analysis by 1 -D simulation is an effective tool for studying {{the control of the}} entire cooling system and optimization of engine performance by using active control thermal management systems which allow high tolerance for coolant temperature across speed-load map of the engine. In this work a 1 -D simulation model (GT-SUITE) was used to evaluate the effect of warm-up improvement on powertrain performance by using electric <b>coolant</b> pumps and <b>fans,</b> electronic control valve, and an electronic control system with PID feedback. Firstly, the cooling system model was validated with experimental data, and then replaced with an advanced thermal management system. The effect of fan speed and pump speed on engine coolant temperature with different thermal management strategy during warm up was studied. Depending on the operating conditions, the results showed an improvement in brake specific fuel consumption (3 - 9 %) and stability improvement in outlet coolant temperature due to controller tuning during steady state operation...|$|R

40|$|Air {{conditioning}} {{energy saving}} has increasingly {{become the focus}} of attention and study, as the increase of air conditioning energy consumption. Recovery of condensing heat is one of the important air conditioning energy saving technology for not only increasing energy efficiency ratio，but also reducing peak and filling valley, and balancing power load. In this paper, the phase change material developed by us was used as heat storage medium, and was researched in dual energy storage air conditioning system that could store cold both energy and condensing heat of air conditioning. Specifically, the following subjects have been accomplished: (1) the phase transition properties of sodium acetate trihydrate was studied, its supercooling and precipitation were solved, its latent heat, transformation temperature and thermal conductivity were measured and improved in order to develop a new phase change material used in dual energy air conditioning. (2) the dual energy storage air conditioning experimental equipment was put up including the material researched by us in its heat accumulator. Experiment study has been carried out in the space cooling and water heating mode, cool storage and water heating mode, and space cooling and heat storage mode in this system. The effect on the whole performance of this system was investigated by changing coolant flux, heat water flux and fan coil air flow. The results showed: (1) CMC could control the precipitation of sodium acetate trihydrate, Na 4 P 2 O 7 &# 8226; 10 H 2 O and Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O could resolve supercooling of this system, and sodium chloride solution could adjust its transformation temperature. (2) The phase change material’s latent heat was 241 J/g, transformation temperature was about 53 ℃, thermal conductivity was above 0. 8 W/m&# 8226;K, which was composed by 88. 11 wt%CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O+ 1. 54 wt%CMC+ 1. 54 wt%Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O + 8. 81 wt% NaCl (26. 5 wt%). (3) In the space cooling and water heating mode, the greater heat water flux, the better whole performance of the dual storage system. The integrated energy efficiency ratio (IEER) of this system was 7. 14, as the heat water flux was 410 L/h. (4) In space cooling and heat storage mode, the research showed that heat storage had little effects on space cooling, but the IEER was greatly improved that was useful for air conditioning energy saving. In this mode, the greater <b>coolant</b> flux and <b>fan</b> coil air flow, the greater IEER of this system. The value of IEER could research 7. 06, when the fan coil air flow was 1033 m 3 /h and coolant flux was 972 L/h. 随着社会经济的发展，空调用量增大、能耗不断增加，空调节能日益成为人们关注和研究的焦点。空调冷凝热回收是一种重要的空调节能技术，不仅能提高空调能效比，还能起到削峰填谷、平衡电力负荷的作用。 本文采用自行研制的三水醋酸钠基相变材料储存回收的冷凝热，并在可同时 蓄冷和蓄热的双蓄能空调实验平台进行综合性能研究，具体研究内容包括：（ 1 ）研究三水醋酸钠的相变特性，解决其过冷和析出问题，测量和改善其相变潜热、相变温度和导热率等性能参数，配制出一种可应用于空调冷凝热回收系统中的优质相变材料；（ 2 ）搭建双蓄能实验平台，并在该平台上进行制冷兼供热水、蓄冷兼供热水、制冷兼蓄热等模式下的实验研究，同时研究了冷冻水流量、热水流量、风机盘管风量对机组整体性能的影响。 实验结果表明：（ 1 ）羧甲基纤维素能有效抑制CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O析出，该体系中加入焦磷酸钠和Na 2 HPO 4 &# 8226; 12 H 2 O均可克服过冷问题，同时加入一定浓度的NaCl溶液可起到调整其相变温度和降低液态粘稠度的作用。（ 2 ） 88. 11 wt%CH 3 COONa&# 8226; 3 H 2 O+ 1. 54 wt%羧甲基纤维素+ 1. 54 wt%十二水磷酸氢二钠+ 8. 81 wt%浓度为 26. 5 wt%的NaCl溶液混合而成的相变材料，相变温度在 53 ℃左右，相变潜热为 241 J/g，导热率大于 0. 8 W/m&# 8226;K，是一种可用于空调冷凝热回收的较理想的相变材料。（ 3 ）双蓄能空调机组在制冷兼供热水模式下运行，热水流量越大，机组整体性能越好，当热水流量为 410 L/h时，机组综合能效比IEER高达 7. 14 ，热水温度为 42. 1 ℃。（ 4 ）对双蓄能空调机组在制冷兼蓄热模式下运行进行研究表明，蓄热对机组制冷端的影响很小，但机组综合能效比得到大幅提高；在该模式下，冷冻水流量和风机盘管风量的越大，机组的综合能效比IEER越大，当风机盘管风量为 1033 m 3 /h、冷冻水流量为 972 L/h时，机组综合能效比可达 7. 06...|$|R
40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{integration}} between tools for analysis and simulation of cooling system at Volvo Group Trucks Technology. At {{the same time}} it is a consequent step in evaluating GT-SUITE as a tool for analysis and simulation of cooling systems. The interaction between the truck's cooling system and the engine has so far not been modeled in its entirety in a completely integrated, detailed model capable of simulating transient runs. This work marks the first steps in this direction. A number of different methods for modeling cooling system performance exist. This project focuses on 1 D simulation tools, which are generally preferred in the context of transient simulations of power train and engine installation systems. The Cooling Analysis and Simulations group at Volvo Group Trucks Technology uses KULI as 1 D simulation tool for analysis of cooling performance. Volvo Powetrain, on the other hand, uses GT-SUITE for engine simulations. It is expected {{to improve the quality of}} the simulation, (i. e the accuracy of the results) and improve system integration by using one tool for both areas of simulation. GT-SUITE is a powerful tool for modeling the uid-dynamics and heat-transfer phenomena, which occur in the cooling system. The work includes a detailed model of the main coolant circuit since this is vital for the authenticity of the transient simulation. This thesis is a natural continuation of a project performed by the author during the summer of 2012, which evaluated GT-SUITE as a tool for steady-state simulation of cooling systems[13]. The basic models of the cooler package were developed and calibrated during this project. This work delivers two transient models of FH 13 liter Euro 6 cooling system integrated with a predictive engine model, provided by Volvo Powertrain. As a first step, all necessary models and control algorithms were obtained from different technical units within the organization and were further reworked and refined to fit the purpose of this work. Such are the engine model obtained from BF 66360 System Analysis and Simulation at Volvo Powertrain, the fan control model provided by BF 72362 Cooling Systems at Powertrain Installation and the coolant pump control model from BF 69317 Vehicle Functions. Component performance data was as well acquired for different components within the coolant circuit: thermostat valve, coolant pump, engine oil cooler, etc. GEM 3 D was used to ease the process of creating authentic models of the coolant logistic components (pipes, hoses, owsplits, etc) The first model produced in this work, delivers a basic representation of the physics in the system and its main aim is to prove the technical feasibility of the concept. It includes all necessary functional features : working <b>fan</b> control, <b>coolant</b> pump mode control, function for temperature compensation for the effect of air recirculation. The model was used to obtain critical cooling system-related parameters from Hamburg-Kassel drive cycle and critical parameters were compared to measurements from tests. The results, acquired from the first model have satisfactory consistency with the data from test. Average coefficient of determination achieved by the model is R 2 > 0. 85, which for most of the parameters is higher than the results given by the currently available program for transient simulations. The rate of execution of the model was successfully increased to 1 x Real Time. The second model implements two-way communication between the engine model and the cooling system model: the temperature on the outlet of the CAC and torque consumed by <b>coolant</b> pump and <b>fan</b> are fed back to the engine model and therefore the interaction between the performance of the two separate systems is partially accounted for. Average coefficients of determination achieved from this model are similar to the ones from the model with single connectivity. Execution time rate did not alter significantly in comparison to the previous model. The implemented interaction between the subsystems allows for a predictive model of the boost temperature and investigations on fuel economy. The work has proven the feasibility and the integrability of an engine model and a model of a cooling system in GT being controlled in Simulink environment. This paper can be seen as a comprehensive manual to building, tuning and executing such a model...|$|R
