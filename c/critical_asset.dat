40|$|Abstract: Confidentiality, {{integrity}} and availability (C-I-A) are the security requirements fundamental to any computer system. Similarly, the hardware, software and data are important <b>critical</b> <b>assets.</b> These two {{components of a}} computer security framework are entwined; such that a compromise in the C-I-A requirements {{may lead to a}} compromise of the <b>critical</b> <b>assets.</b> The C-I-A requirements and the <b>critical</b> <b>assets</b> of a computer system are well researched areas; however they may be insufficient to define the needs of a summative e-assessment system. In this paper, we do not discard the existing components; rather we propose security requirements and related components that are specific to summative e-assessment systems. ...|$|R

2500|$|Reconstitution (occurs {{after an}} event) [...] - The last {{phase of the}} CIP life cycle, {{involves}} actions taken to rebuild or restore a <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> capability {{after it has been}} damaged or destroyed.

2500|$|After {{the source}} or cause of an {{infrastructure}} event is eliminated or contained, the infrastructure and its capabilities must be restored. [...] Reconstitution {{is the last}} phase of the critical infrastructure protection. Reconstitution {{is probably the most}} challenging and least developed process of the life cycle. DoD <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> owners have the major responsibility for reconstitution.|$|E
2500|$|During the Mitigation phase, DoD <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> owners, DoD installations, and Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, {{work with}} the National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) to develop, train for, and {{exercise}} mitigation responses for various scenarios. [...] When there is a warning, emergency, or infrastructure incident, the <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> owners, installations, and Sector CIAOs initiate mitigation actions to sustain service to the DoD. They also provide mitigation status information to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. The NMCC monitors for consequences from an event within one Defense Infrastructure sector that are significant enough to affect other sectors. For events that cross two or more sectors, the NMCC advises on the prioritization and coordination of mitigation actions. When event threats or consequences continue to escalate, the NMCC directs mitigation actions by sector to ensure a coordinated response across the DoD. The NMCC and the JTF-CNO keep the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, apprised of any significant mitigation activities.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} a common {{operational}} picture has been utilized by the military for situational awareness in warfare domains for many years. With the emergence of cyberspace as a domain, there is a necessity to develop doctrine and tools to enable situational awareness for key-decision makers. Our study analyzes key elements that define cyber situational awareness to develop a methodology to identify assets within key cyber terrain, thus enabling situational awareness at the tactical level. For {{the purposes of this}} work, we treat <b>critical</b> <b>assets</b> to be key cyber terrain, given that no formal study has determined differences between asset criticality and key cyber terrain. Mission- and operationally- based questions are investigated to identify <b>critical</b> <b>assets</b> with the TOPSIS methodology. Results show that the ICS system can be evaluated using TOPSIS to identify <b>critical</b> <b>assets</b> contributing to key cyber terrain, enabling further research into other interconnected systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the optimal placement of {{intrusion detection system}} (IDS) sensors and prioritization of IDS alarms, using attack graph analysis. Our attack graphs predict the various possible ways of penetrating a network to reach <b>critical</b> <b>assets.</b> In particular, automated analysis of network configuration and attacker exploits provides an attack graph showing all possible paths to <b>critical</b> <b>assets.</b> We then place IDS sensors to cover all these paths, using the fewest number of sensors. The sensor-placement problem we pose is an instance of the NP-hard minimal set cover problem, which we solve through a greedy algorithm. Through our approach, all traffic along vulnerable paths to critical resources is monitored, with no deployment of unnecessary sensors. Then, through our predictive vulnerability-based attack graphs, we prioritize IDS alarms based on their level of threat (attack graph distance) to <b>critical</b> <b>assets.</b> The predictive power of our attack graphs then provides the necessary context for appropriate attack response. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Remediation (occurs {{before an}} event) - The Remediation phase {{involves}} precautionary measures and actions taken before an event occurs {{to fix the}} known cyber and physical vulnerabilities that could cause an outage or compromise a National Defense Infrastructure, or NDI, or <b>critical</b> <b>asset.</b> [...] For example, remediation actions may include education and awareness, operational process or procedural changes or system configuration and component changes.|$|E

2500|$|When {{incidents}} compromise a DoD computer network, the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) {{directs the}} response activities. These activities {{are designed to}} stop the computer network attack, contain and mitigate damage to a DoD information network and then restore minimum required functionality. [...] JTF-CNO also requests and coordinates any support or assistance from other Federal agencies and civilian organizations during incidents affecting a DoD network. [...] When incidents impact any other DoD owned assets, installation commanders and <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> owners follow traditional channels and procedures to coordinate responses. This includes notifying affected Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, in the initial notice and status reporting.

2500|$|A {{primary purpose}} of the Mitigation phase is to {{minimize}} the operational impact on other critical Defense Infrastructures and assets when a <b>critical</b> <b>asset</b> is lost or damaged. As an example, if there is a U.S. installation, SiteA, located in a host nation. SiteA is a tier1 asset, meaning that if it fails, the Combatant Commands mission fails. [...] SiteA has mutual Global Information Grid Command Control (GIG/C2), information interdependencies with SitesB and C. [...] In addition, other Defense Infrastructure sectors rely on SiteA for mission capabilities. [...] In this scenario, what could be the impact if the supply line to the commercial power plant that provides the installation’s primary power is accidentally severed. [...] Because of all the interdependencies, losing this asset is more than the loss of just one site. It means the loss of other sector capabilities.|$|E
2500|$|The National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) is {{the primary}} {{national}} warning center for significant infrastructure attacks. [...] <b>Critical</b> <b>asset</b> owners, DoD installations, and Sector CIAOs monitor the infrastructure daily. Indications of an infrastructure incident are reported to the National Military Command Center, or NMCC. [...] If indications are on a computer network, they are also reported to the Joint Task Force Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO). [...] The NMCC and JTF-CNO assess the indications and pass them to the NIPC and appropriate DoD organizations. [...] When the NIPC determines that an infrastructure event is likely to occur, is planned, or is under way, it issues a national warning. For DoD, the NIPC passes its warnings and alerts to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. [...] These warnings and alerts are then passed to the DoD components. The warning may include guidance regarding additional protection measures DoD should take.|$|E
