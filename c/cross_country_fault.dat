40|$|The {{protection}} of {{electricity distribution network}} has been the important topic in terms of reliable and safe power supply for the customers. The field of distribution automation deals with the protection and safety of the electricity distribution network. Recently the topic of centralized protection system has become a hot topic for research and many companies, who are dealing with protection relays, {{have been working on}} centralized protection architectures. Traditional protection relays (intelligent electronic device, IED) have the protection blocks for the faults classified as single phase to earth fault, short circuit faults but it is lacking the ability to detect the type of the earth faults termed as cross country earth faults. In cross country earth faults two different phases of the same or different feeder are experiencing the earth fault at different position along the feeder. When the phases are earthed then they are short circuited through the ground. The objective of this thesis is to develop an algorithm to detect the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> using the available protection tools so that the algorithm can be implemented in centralized protection without the need of any new measuring device. The thesis is divided into two parts. In the literature study part, different types of faults of medium voltage network (e. g. single phase to earth fault, double phase short circuit fault, phase to phase to earth fault and <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault),</b> have been discussed along with some of protection techniques for these faults. The details about the IEC 61850 standard, the research prototype of centralized protection system of ABB and its protection blocks are also the part of the literature study. The medium voltage network can have neutral isolated or compensated but for this thesis neutral isolated network was the main focus for the research. In the research part, basics of the algorithm for the detection of the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> are explained {{with the help of the}} flow charts. The algorithm was tested by different fault scenarios in the PSCAD simulation environment in which three medium voltage (MV) overhead feeders were modelled and also in the real time digital simulator (RTDS) in which two feeders were overhead MV lines while one feeder was MV cable feeder. In each test case, the fault resistances were varied and behavior of the algorithm was observed. The observations obtained from the testing of algorithm through simulations have proved that algorithm is able to detect the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> and separate the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> from other types of double phase faults. The algorithm is using the protec-tion block signal (i. e. directional earth fault protection block of the IED) for getting triggered. The practical issues relating to its implementation in centralized protection system are highlighted at the end of the thesis. Moreover the algorithm has reduced the time of operation against the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> as compared to the directional earth fault protection block of IED. It was also observed that there are some cases when the fault resistances and the distance between the faults are small then the algorithm detect the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> as the phase to phase to earth fault. For future there is still space for the improvement of the algorithm especially in the cases where the fault is wrongly detected. In addition the algorithm for the compensated neutral network still needs to be developed for the detection of cross country faults. In the nut shell, it can be said that the new developed algorithm for the detection of the <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>fault</b> covers almost all the cases and it does not need any new measur-ing device for working. It is also using the protection block of IEDs of ABB so it is easy to implement it in centralized protection system as IEDs are basic blocks for this kind of system...|$|E

Aiming at the {{misoperation}} of {{the conventional}} phase selector by phase current-difference during some <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>faults,</b> a fault phase selector is developed. Based on the fault lines of the corresponding fault phase are selected, a novel synthesis fault phase selector using voltages and currents in single circuit at single side is proposed, {{which is based on}} comparing the difference of fault voltages to make sure all the fault phase in the lines and judging the phase degree and amplitude condition of the fault currents. Used this scheme and the phase current difference, the fault phase may be picked up correctly in double circuit lines on the same tower, especially in <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>faults.</b> ...|$|R

Although the concept is not new, the advent of modern control equipment allows fresh opportunities {{for them to be}} used to save lives and to decrease the cost and inconvenience to industry and the community in general that is caused by electricity supply interruptions without incurring large expenditure. Earth fault currents are reduced to almost zero, thus eliminating many short time power supply interruptions and preventing damage to the electricity supply system {{at the time of the}} initial fault. Because of the reduction in damage at the time of the fault, many longer duration interruptions are avoided. It is common for live high voltage conductors to be close to the ground and for the fault not to be detected by conventional power system protection equipment. Arc suppression coil systems can detect high impedance earth faults and broken conductors which cannot be detected by conventional protection systems. There are many system abnormalities which can cause neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems. The appropriate action to be taken by the protection system depends on the type of system abnormality. The causes of neutral voltages in arc suppression coil systems are analysed and criteria are developed to differentiate between them based on the phase angle and magnitude of the neutral voltage. Fully computerised power system protection systems are now being implemented. These modern protection systems will be able to utilise the criteria developed in this research to take immediate appropriate action based on the neutral voltage caused by the system abnormality. In existing distribution systems there is a widespread use of two single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in open-delta configuration to provide economic in-line three phase voltage regulation. An original method of representing open delta regulators in symmetrical component analyses is developed. It is shown that when open-delta regulators are used in a power system equipped with an arc suppression coil very high voltages can occur. A solution is proposed whereby three single phase pole mounted auto-transformers connected in a closed-delta arrangement are used. One of the potential problems with these systems is <b>cross</b> <b>country</b> <b>faults</b> caused by the neutral voltage displacement combined with the transient voltages at the time of the initial earth fault. These transient over-voltages are analysed in detail and a method of testing the capability of existing system components to withstand the over-voltages is developed. Simple methods to estimate the transient voltages on overhead power systems are derived. A new method of minimising the transient over-voltages is proposed. ...|$|R
