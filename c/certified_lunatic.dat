5000|$|... "There {{had been}} a manor house at Glynde Bourne (as it was often spelt) since the fifteenth century", but the exact age {{of the house is}} unknown. Some {{surviving}} timber framing and pre-Elizabethan panelling makes an early sixteenth-century date the most likely. In 1618, it came into the possession of the Hay family, passing to James Hay Langham in 1824. He inherited his father's baronetcy and estate in Northamptonshire in 1833 which under the terms of his inheritance should have led to him relinquishing Glyndebourne, but as a <b>certified</b> <b>lunatic</b> he was unable to do so. After litigation the estate passed to a relative, Mr Langham Christie, but he later had to pay Â£50,000 to persuade another relative to withdraw a rival claim.|$|E
50|$|At The Statesman, she was {{the first}} to expose the travesty of women in {{so-called}} custodial protection: rape victims, women who were falsely <b>certified</b> as <b>lunatics</b> to get them conveniently out of the way in property disputes, or even those who were just destitute. The scourge of dowry deaths, the ingrained gender prejudice of the police force which prevented the registering of cases, and actual custodial rape all became regular subjects of her editorials and special comment pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Nesbit's {{career was}} dogged by scandal, {{the first of}} which broke in 1885 when he was arrested for wilful {{trespass}} in Melbourne, apparently pursuing a lady who spurned him. He spent a week in Melbourne Gaol before being sent to Kew Lunatic Asylum, having been <b>certified</b> a <b>lunatic.</b> After several months he was released and sent back to South Australia, but on the steamer back to Adelaide he jumped overboard and swam back to Melbourne, where he was returned to the asylum. He began to acquire something of a reputation and was described in Adelaide gossip as an [...] "absinthe-drinking, woman-loving, tobacco-enslaved ... Prince of Bohemia". He was a talented painter, a member of the Adelaide Easel Club, a Shakespeare scholar, and an engaging speaker. He was confined again in 1896 in Adelaide Lunatic Asylum, running in 1896 for the House of Assembly once more without success. He was now a firm opponent of Kingston.|$|R
