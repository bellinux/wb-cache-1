50|$|Coherent Fibre OpticsIf {{a bundle}} of fibres could be {{arranged}} such that {{the ends of the}} fibres were in matching locations at either end, then focusing an image {{on one end of the}} bundle would produce a 'pixel-ated' version at the further end which could be viewed via an eyepiece or captured by a camera. A German medical student, Heinrich Lamm produced a crude <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> in the 1930s of perhaps 400 fibres. Many of the fibres were misaligned and it lacked proper imaging optics. It also suffered from leakage where adjacent fibres touched; which degraded the image still further. To produce a useful image, the bundle would need to contain not a few hundred but tens of thousands of fibres all correctly aligned. In the early 1950s, Hopkins devised a way to accomplish this. He proposed winding a single continuous length of fibre in a figure-of-eight around a pair of drums. Then, when sufficient turns had been added, a short section could be sealed in resin, cut through and the whole straightened out to produce the required <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle.</b> Having polished the ends, he was then able to add the optics he had designed to provide an objective and eyepiece. Once enclosed in a protective flexible jacket the 'fibroscope' (now more commonly called a fiberscope) was born. Details of this invention were published in papers by Hopkins in Nature in 1954 and Optica Acta in 1955. However, the bare fibres still suffered from light leakage where they touched. At the same time a Dutchman, Abraham van Heel was also trying to produce coherent bundles and had been researching the idea of cladding each fibre to reduce this 'cross-talk'. In fact he published details of his work in the very same issue of Nature. Eventually a system for cladding fibres with a layer of glass of lower refractive index was developed (see Larry Curtis et al.) which reduced the leakage to such an extent that the full potential of the fiberscope was realised.|$|E

40|$|Many modern {{writers have}} criticized the notion that {{property}} consists of a bundle of rights in some determinate thing as a weak conception that invites increased government control over private property, especially real estate.

First, the notion of property as a bundle of rights long antedates the Progressive era, when it lay {{at the center of}} both Roman and common law views of property. Second, the bundle-of-rights theory does not imply that private property has no determinate meaning. To the contrary, traditional systems of private property all had a <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> of rights that included exclusive possession, use, development and disposition of property that belonged to the original owner who acquired by first possession. Thereafter, the division of property rights created by voluntary transactions, such as leases or mortgages, may have made it somewhat more difficult to identify "the owner," philosophically. But it had the far greater advantage of allowing for gains from trade. The use of this system, moreover, implies strong protection against state control, so long as it is understood that the state must pay for each stick in the bundle that it takes and is never allowed to say that it can take one or more sticks for free so long as the original owner keeps some residual sticks.

The myofilaments are associated in a single <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> extending throughout the fiber cross-section. The absence of discrete "myofibrils" in well preserved cardiac muscle is emphasized. The abundant mitochondria confined in clefts among the myofilaments often have slender prolongations, possibly related to changes in their number or their distribution as energy sources within the contractile mass. The large T tubules that penetrate ventricular cardiac muscle fibers at successive I bands are arranged in rows and are lined with a layer of protein-polysaccharide. Longitudinal connections between T tubules are common. The simple plexiform sarcoplasmic reticulum is continuous across the Z lines, and no circumferential "Z tubules" were identified. Specialized contacts between the reticulum and the sarcolemma are established on the T tubules and the cell periphery via subsarcolemmal saccules or cisterns.

40|$|In vitro studies {{conducted}} in Aplysia and chick sensory neurons indicate {{that in addition to}} microtubule assembly, long microtubules in the C-domain of the growth cone move forward as a <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> during axonal elongation. Nonetheless, whether this mode of microtubule translocation contributes to growth cone motility in vivo is unknown. To address this question, we turned to the model system Drosophila. Using docked mitochondria as fiduciary markers for the translocation of long microtubules, we first examined motion along the axon to test if the pattern of axonal elongation is conserved between Drosophila and other species in vitro. When Drosophila neurons were cultured on Drosophila extracellular matrix proteins collected from the Drosophila Kc 167 cell line, docked mitochondria moved in a pattern indicative of bulk microtubule translocation, similar to that observed in chick sensory neurons grown on laminin. To investigate whether the C-domain is stationary or advances in vivo, we tracked the movement of mitochondria during elongation of the aCC motor neuron in stage 16 Drosophila embryos. We found docked mitochondria moved forward along the axon shaft and in the growth cone C-domain. This work confirms that the physical mechanism of growth cone advance is similar between Drosophila and vertebrate neurons and suggests forward translocation of the microtubule meshwork in the axon underlies the advance of the growth cone C-domain in vivo. These results highlight the need for incorporating en masse microtubule translocation, in addition to assembly, into models of axonal elongation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila central {{brain is}} {{composed}} of approximately 100 paired lineages, with most lineages comprising 100 – 150 neurons. Most lineages {{have a number of}} important characteristics in common. Typically, neurons of a lineage stay together as a coherent cluster and project their axons into a <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> visible from late embryo to adult. Neurons born during the embryonic period form the primary axon tracts (PATs) that follow stereotyped pathways in the neuropile. Apoptotic cell death removes an average of 30 – 40 % of primary neurons around the time of hatching. Secondary neurons generated during the larval period form secondary axon tracts (SATs) that typically fasciculate with their corresponding primary axon tract. SATs develop into the long fascicles that interconnect the different compartments of the adult brain. Structurally, we distinguish between three types of lineages: PD lineages, characterized by distinct, spatially separate proximal and distal arborizations; C lineages with arborizations distributed continuously along the entire length of their tract; D lineages that lack proximal arborizations. Arborizations of many lineages, in particular those of the PD type, are restricted to distinct neuropile compartments. We propose that compartments are “scaffolded” by individual lineages, or small groups thereof. Thereby, the relatively small number of primary neurons of each primary lineage set up the compartment map in the late embryo. Compartments grow during the larval period simply by an increase in arbor volume of primary neurons. Arbors of secondary neurons form within or adjacent to the larval compartments, resulting in smaller compartment subdivisions and additional, adult specific compartments...|$|E

In the original application that prompted this development, the precise assembly of lenses and optical fibers serves as a single-mode spatial filter for a visible-light nulling interferometer. The precision of alignment must be sufficient to limit any remaining wavefront error to a root-mean-square value of less than 1 / 10 of a wavelength of light. This wavefront-error limit translates to requirements to (1) ensure uniformity of both the lens and fiber arrays, (2) ensure that the lateral distance from the central axis of each lens and the corresponding optical fiber {{is no more than a}} fraction of a micron, (3) angularly align the lens-sheet planes and the fiber-bundle end faces to within a few arc seconds, and (4) axially align the lenses and the fiber-bundle end faces to within tens of microns of the focal distance. Figure 2 depicts the apparatus used in the alignment procedure. The beam of light from a Zygo (or equivalent) interferometer is first compressed by a ratio of 20 : 1 so that upon its return to the interferometer, the beam will be magnified enough to enable measurement of wavefront quality. The apparatus includes relay lenses that enable imaging of the arrays of microscopic lenses in a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera that is part of the interferometer. One of the arrays of microscopic lenses is mounted on a 6 -axis stage, in proximity to the front face of the bundle of optical fibers. The bundle is mounted on a separate stage. A mirror is attached to the back face of the bundle of optical fibers for retroreflection of light. When a microscopic lens and a fiber are aligned with each other, the affected portion of the light is reflected back by the mirror, recollimated by the microscopic lens, transmitted through the relay lenses and the beam compressor/expander, then split so that half goes to a detector and half to the interferometer.

The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) measures the solar spectral irradiance in the EUV at a wide range of temperatures (7, 000 K to 10 MK), capturing the complete evolution of the transition region and corona during solar flares. The goal of this thesis is to use the new observations obtained by EVE to quantify how the EUV spectral irradiance varies in response to solar flares. Most observation-based research on solar flares is done by studying individual, usually large, solar flares. My work takes a different approach. From 1 May 2010 to 31 August 2011, SDO observed over 750 solar flares. I created the EVE flare catalog to examine all of these events to produce a complete picture of the EUV variability of flares. In the process, I discovered that flares can be placed into one of five EUV flare categories. The EUV irradiance signature of these categories is unique and closely related to the magnetic structure of the flare region. Confined flares are the most ubiquitous type of flare. They are non-eruptive flares and appear as the sudden brightening of a <b>coherent</b> <b>bundle</b> of coronal loops. Localized eruptive flares are small point-like flares associated with EUV surges or jets. Arcade flares are the classic CSHKP-type flare and are identified observationally by an eruption followed by arcade of flare loops in the corona and two bright ribbons of footpoint emission in the chromosphere and transition region. EUV late phase flares are characterized by two spatially and temporally separate but related reconnection events. Finally, flares that do not fit into any of the four other flare categories are called 2 ̆ 2 strange 2 ̆ 2 flares. I also used the Enthaply-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) code to model the heating rate of the corona during flares. By fitting the input parameters of the model to the EVE data, I determined that the rate of energy release during reconnection strongly influences the EUV irradiance signature. Each of these EUV flare categories has a different heating rate profile, which is related to the underlying magnetic structure of the flare region...|$|E

However, the image transmitted by an incoherent fiber-optic bundle can be unscrambled (or, from a different perspective, decoded) by digital processing of the output image if the mapping between the input and output fiber-end positions is known.
