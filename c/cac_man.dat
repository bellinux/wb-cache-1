40|$|We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} this ""response-to-injury"" hypothesis of atherosclerosis {{by studying the}} interaction between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in predicting the presence of coronary artery calcification (<b>CAC)</b> in asymptomatic <b>men.</b> We Studied 526 men (46 +/- 7 years of age) referred for electron-beam tomography (EBT) exam. The prevalence of CAC was determined across LDL-C tertiles (low: = 140 mg/dl) within tertiles of SBP (low: = 131 mmHg). CAC was found in 220 (42 %) men. There was no linear trend {{in the presence of}} CAC across LDL-C tertiles in the low (p = 0. 6 for trend) and middle (p = 0. 3 for trend) SBP tertile groups, respectively. In contrast, there was a significant trend for increasing CAC with increasing LDL-C (1 st: 44 %; 2 nd: 49 %; 3 rd: 83 %; p < 0. 0001 for trend) in the high SBP tertile group. In multivariate logistic analyses (adjusting for age, smoking, triglyceride levels, HDL-cholesterol levels, body mass index, and fasting glucose levels), the odds ratio for any CAC associated with increasing LDL-C was significantly higher in those with highest SBP levels, whereas no such relationship was observed among men with SBP in the lower two tertiles. An interaction term (LDL-C x SBP) incorporated in the multivariate analyses was statistically significant (p = 0. 038). The finding of an interaction between SBP and LDL-C relation to <b>CAC</b> in asymptomatic <b>men</b> support the response-to-injury model of atherogenesis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Development and {{progression}} of atherosclerosis involves recruitment and binding of circulating leukocytes to areas of inflammation within the vascular endothelium mediated by a {{diverse array of}} cellular adhesion molecules. A polymorphism in the endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (E-selectin) gene has been implicated in early-onset, angiographically defined, severe atherosclerotic disease because it profoundly affects ligand recognition and binding specificity, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} cellular adhesion. Relationships between the E-selectin S 128 R polymorphism and coronary artery calcification (CAC), a marker of atherosclerosis detected with noninvasive electron beam computed tomography, were examined in 294 asymptomatic women aged 40 – 88 years and 314 asymptomatic men aged 30 – 80 years from the Epidemiology of Coronary Artery Calcification Study. The E-selectin polymorphism was not associated with presence of <b>CAC</b> in <b>men</b> of any age or in women over age 50. In women 50 years of age or younger the E-selectin polymorphism was significantly associated with presence of CAC after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking. The significant association between E-selectin and CAC in women 50 years of age or younger may suggest that the 128 R allele is a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis in younger asymptomatic women, who typically have lower levels of traditional risk factors and reduced adhesion molecule expression due to the presence of higher levels of endogenous hormones...|$|R
40|$|Objective—Circulating {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) predict {{cardiovascular}} events. In contrast, {{an association between}} CRP and direct measures of atherosclerosis has not been established clearly. In the largest study to date, we examined the association of plasma CRP with coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 914 asymptomatic subjects in the Study of Inherited Risk of Coronary Atherosclerosis (SIRCA). Methods and Results—In age-adjusted, cross-sectional analysis, there was a weak association between plasma CRP levels and CAC in women (odds ratio [OR] for ordinal regression, 1. 1 [1. 04 to 1. 17] per 1. 0 mg/L increase in CRP; P 0. 005) but not in men. The association between CRP and CAC in women remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors (OR, 1. 08 [1. 00 to 1. 14]; P 0. 048) but was lost after further adjustment for body mass index (BMI) (OR, 1. 02 [0. 94 to 1. 08]; P 0. 7). Conclusions—In SIRCA, CRP {{was not associated with}} <b>CAC</b> in <b>men,</b> and a weak association in women was lost after adjustment for BMI. The relation between CRP and clinical events might not be related to atherosclerotic burden. Measures of inflammation, such as CRP, and indices of atherosclerosis, such as CAC, are likely to provide distinct information regarding cardiovascular risk.

40|$|International audienceWe tested {{whether the}} {{association}} between bone mineral density (BMD) and coronary artery calcification (CAC) varies according to dyslipidemia in community-living individuals. Between 2002 and 2005, 305 women and 631 men (mean age of 64 years), who were not taking lipid-lowering medications or estrogen were assessed for spine BMD, CAC, and total (TC), HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. Participants were a random sample from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) without clinical cardiovascular disease. Spine BMD at the L 3 vertebrate was performed by computer tomography (CT). CAC prevalence was measured by CT. The total cholesterol to HDL ratio (TC:HDL) [*]≥[*] 5. 0 {{was used as the}} primary marker of hyperlipidemia. The association of BMD with CAC differed in women with TC:HDL[*]<[*] 5. 0 versus higher (p-interaction[*]=[*] 0. 01). In age- and race-adjusted models, among women with TC:HDL[*]<[*] 5. 0, each SD (43. 4 mg/cc) greater BMD was associated with a 25 % lower prevalence of CAC (prevalence ratio [PR] 0. 75, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 63 - 0. 89), whereas among women with higher TC:HDL, higher BMD was not significantly associated with CAC (PR 1. 22, 95 % CI 0. 82 - 1. 82). Results were similar using other definitions of hyperlipidemia. In contrast, no consistent association was observed between BMD and <b>CAC</b> in <b>men,</b> irrespective of the TC:HDL ratio (p interaction 0. 54). The inverse association of BMD with CAC is stronger in women without dyslipidemia. These data argue against the hypothesis that dyslipidemia is the key factor responsible for the inverse association of BMD with atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesVascular {{calcification}} {{has been}} associated inconsistently to low bone mineral density and fractures. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate the associations between coronary artery calcification (CAC) and BMD change, BMD and fracture risk in elderly subjects of the population-based Rotterdam Study. MethodsBMD was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and CAC through Electron-Beam Computed Tomography in 582 men and 694 women. We investigated the associations between BMD change (6. 4 years follow-up) and CAC at follow-up and between BMD and CAC (measured simultaneously). In sensitivity analyses we stratified analyses for estradiol levels in women. The association between CAC and fracture risk (9 years follow-up) was tested through competing-risks models. Models were sex-stratified and adjusted for age, body mass index, smoking, bisphosphonate use and age at menopause. ResultsThere was no association between BMD change and <b>CAC</b> in <b>men.</b> In women, each 1 % increase in annual BMD loss was significantly associated with higher follow-up CAC [β =  0. 22 (0. 06 – 0. 38), p= 0. 006; prevalence ratio: 4 %]. Stratified analyses showed significant associations between BMD loss and follow-up CAC only in women with lower estradiol levels. We found no association between CAC and fracture risk and no association between BMD and CAC cross-sectionally. ConclusionsBMD loss was associated with higher follow-up CAC in women, which might be related to low estrogen levels. No association between CAC and BMD or fracture risk was found. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms that might underlie the association between BMD change and coronary calcification in women...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} {{of public health}} {{significance}} due to its highest rates of mortality. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular events can often result in fatal or disabling non-fatal events. More than half of CHD fatal events do not show earlier symptoms. Early identification of subclinical atherosclerosis and establishment of preventive control are important to reduce CHD mortality and morbidity. The present study aimed to examine: 1) whether n- 6 fatty acids are inversely associated with plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and fibrinogen; 2) whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis; and 3) whether Japanese men have lower incidence or progression of <b>CAC</b> than Caucasian <b>men,</b> and further if marine n- 3 fatty acids are inversely associated with incidence or progression of CAC. To test these aims, the Electron-Beam Tomography, Risk Factor Assessment among Japanese and U. S. Men in Post-World War II Birth Cohort (ERA-JUMP) study was utilized. The findings were: 1) in a population-based cross-sectional-sample of 915 men aged 40 - 49, serum n- 6 fatty acids were inversely and significantly associated with PAI- 1 but not with fibrinogen; 2) in 295 middle-aged men of a population-based cross-sectional sample, Japanese men showed lower levels of serum vitamin D, despite their habitual fish intake as a major dietary intake, than Caucasian or Japanese-American men. Further, vitamin D deficiency {{was not associated with}} subclinical atherosclerosis as measured by intima-media thickness (IMT) and CAC, except for significant associations on IMT in a univariate model among Caucasian <b>men,</b> and on <b>CAC</b> in both univariate and multivariate models among Japanese-American men; and 3) in the follow-up study of 472 men, Japanese men had a significantly lower incidence and progression of <b>CAC</b> than Caucasian <b>men.</b> Japanese men showed significant risk reduction on incident CAC associated with marine n- 3 PUFA. However, Japanese and Caucasian men showed no significant associations of marine n- 3 PUFA on the progression of CAC. Future studies to examine the causal associations as well as underlying mechanisms are warranted. From the public health importance, these findings extend our understanding of n- 3 and n- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D related to subclinical atherosclerosis as well as help to establish public health guidelines...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} examines {{three separate}} but inter-related research questions. After reviewing scientifically relevant {{literature in the}} first chapter, the second chapter compares the prevalence of carotid plaque among the three major race-ethnic groups in the Electron-beam computed tomography, Risk factor Assessment among Japanese and U. S. Men in the Post-World War II birth cohort (ERA JUMP Study). This study shows that carotid plaque, a biomarker of subclinical atherosclerosis, is significantly lower among men in Japan and South Korea than in the US. This difference is independent of traditional risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD). Further, it shows that only age, hypertension and diabetes are cross-sectionally associated with the prevalence of carotid plaque. The third chapter examines the association between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and coronary artery calcification (CAC), an established biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis and a strong predictor of future CHD risk. baPWV is a non-invasive and convenient measure of arterial stiffness and is clinically used in eastern Asia {{as a tool for}} assessing future cardiovascular risk. This study found that increasing baPWV is cross-sectionally associated with increasing prevalence of <b>CAC</b> among middle-aged <b>men</b> in the ERA JUMP study, including White men in the US. The final and fourth chapter of the manuscript examines the association of serum levels of soy isoflavones and equol, with <b>CAC</b> among Japanese <b>men</b> in Japan. Japanese consume soy and soy products regularly. Isoflavones are a component in soy and are known to have anti-atherosclerotic properties. Equol is a potent isoflavone produced from the dietary isoflavone daidzein by action of intestinal bacteria. This study shows that individuals who have bacteria to convert daidzein to equol, i. e. equol producers, have lower CAC than equol non-producers. These three studies, individually and as a whole, contribute significantly to the public health knowledge. Japan has significantly lower atherosclerosis than the US in spite of a similar level of risk factors. Several lessons may be learned from Japan in an effort to reduce CHD mortality in the US. baPWV may potentially provide similar information to clinicians as CAC without exposing the patient to radiation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Advanced glycation end {{products}} (AGE) {{have been}} implicated in diabetic vascular complications through activation of pro-inflammatory genes. AGE-modified proteins are also targeted by the immune system resulting in the generation of AGE-specific autoantibodies, but the association of these immune responses with diabetic vasculopathy remains to be fully elucidated. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether antibodies against apolipoprotein B 100 modified by methylglyoxal (MGO-apoB 100) are associated with coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods. We measured antibodies against MGO-apoB 100 in plasma from 497 type 2 diabetic patients without clinical signs of cardiovascular disease. Severity of coronary disease was assessed as coronary artery calcium (CAC) imaging. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG levels recognizing MGO-apoB 100 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Anti-MGO-apoB 100 IgM antibody levels were higher in subjects with a low to moderate CAC score (≤ 400 Agatston units) than in subjects with a high score (> 400 Agatston units; 136. 8 ± 4. 4 vs. 101. 6 ± 7. 4 arbitrary units (AU), P < 0. 0001) and in subjects demonstrating no progression of CAC during 30 months of follow-up (136. 4 ± 5. 7 vs. 113. 9 ± 6. 2 AU in subjects with progression, P < 0. 0001). Subjects with a family history of premature myocardial infarction had lower levels of anti-MGO-apoB 100 IgM. Female subjects had higher levels of anti-MGO-apoB 100 antibodies and lower <b>CAC</b> than <b>men.</b> Accordingly, high levels of IgM against MGO-apoB 100 are associated with less severe and a lower risk of progression of coronary disease in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Conclusions. Although conclusions regarding causal relationships based on epidemiological observations need to be made with caution, our findings suggest the possibility that anti-MGO-apoB 100 IgM may be protective in diabetic vasculopathy...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is {{produced}} {{by a variety of}} tissues including those of the cardiovascular system. Recent clinical studies have suggested a significant correlation between elevated OPG serum level and cardiovascular mortality. Since coronary artery calcification (CAC) is positively associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, we carried out a study to investigate whether OPG serum level is associated with the severity of CAC in non diabetic centrally obese men. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done on seventy non diabetic centrally obese <b>men.</b> <b>CAC</b> score was determined by using dual source computed tomography (DSCT). OPG serum level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS for windows ver 16. ANOVA was performed to analyze mean, maximum, minimum value, and standard deviation. Spearman correlation test was performed to determine the correlation between OPG serum level and CAC score. Significance value was defined as alpha level= 0. 05 based on two-tailed tests. RESULTS: OPG serum level was significantly correlated with CAC score. The severity of CAC increased with the increase of OPG level. Age was significantly correlated with OPG serum level and CAC score. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that serum OPG level was associated with the severity of CAC, which highlights that OPG could be involved in the progression of CAC in non diabetic obese men.

40|$|Growing {{evidence}} suggests that neighborhood characteristics may influence the risk of coronary heart disease. No studies have yet explored associations of neighborhood attributes with subclinical atherosclerosis in younger adult populations. Using data on 2, 974 adults (1, 699 women, 1, 275 men) aged 32 - 50 years in 2000 from the Coronary Artery Disease Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study and 2000 US Census block-group-level data, the authors estimated multivariable-adjusted associations of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and perceived neighborhood cohesion with odds of coronary artery calcification (CAC) 5 years later. Among women, the quartiles of highest neighborhood deprivation and lowest cohesion were associated with higher odds of CAC after adjustment for individual-level demographic and socioeconomic factors (for deprivation, odds ratio = 2. 49, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 22, 5. 08 (P for trend = 0. 03); for cohesion, odds ratio = 1. 87, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 10, 3. 16 (P for trend = 0. 02)). Associations changed only slightly after adjustment for behavioral, psychosocial, and biologic factors. Among men, neither neighborhood deprivation nor cohesion was related to <b>CAC.</b> However, among <b>men</b> in deprived neighborhoods, low cohesion predicted higher CAC odds (for interaction between neighborhood deprivation and cohesion, P = 0. 03). This study provides evidence on associations of neighborhood deprivation and cohesion with CAC in younger, asymptomatic adults.

40|$|Coronary artery calcium (CAC) {{assessed}} by non-contrast cardiac CT {{has been shown}} to be an independent factor from the Framingham risk factors in predicting cardiovascular events. However, many patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have low CAC score. A recent study that re-analyzed the previous CAC CT scan of MESA cohort showed that in subjects with global lower density, CAC was associated with higher risk of ACS. We aimed to further evaluate the characteristics of CAC attenuation features in ACS subjects, in comparison to asymptomatic and stable angina pectoris (SAP) groups. In a period of 18 months, 524 consecutive subjects received standard CAC CT scans in our department; 278 of 524 subjects with presence of <b>CAC</b> (225 <b>men,</b> age = 60. 6 ± 9. 5 years; ACS = 41, SAP = 78, asymptomatic = 159) were enrolled. Agatston score, number of plaques (NP) per subject and mean (HMEAN) and standard deviation (HSD) of attenuation of each calcified plaque were measured. Three regression models to distinguish the groups were built: model 1, conventional risk factors only; model 2, Agatston score plus model 1; model 3, plaque attenuation features plus model 2. Agatston score in ACS group (median = 112. 9) was higher than in the asymptomatic group (median = 54. 4, P = 0. 028) and similar to the SAP group (median = 237. 8, P = 0. 428). Calcified plaques in the ACS group showed lower (HMEAN = 180. 5) and more homogenous (HSD = 31. 2) attenuation than those of the asymptomatic group (HMEAN = 205. 9, P = 0. 002; HSD = 52. 4, P = 0. 006) and the SAP group (HMEAN = 204. 1, P = 0. 016; HSD = 54. 4, P = 0. 011). Model 3 significantly improved the distinction between ACS and asymptomatic groups (area under curve [AUC] = 0. 93) as compared to model 2 (AUC = 0. 83, P = 0. 003) and model 1 (AUC = 0. 79, P = 0. 001). Calcified plaques in the ACS group were characteristically of low and homogenous CT attenuation. With validation in a large cohort, analysis of CT attenuation features may improve risk stratification of ACS using CAC CT scan...|$|R
40|$|Background: The gender {{disparity}} in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is greatest between {{young men and}} women. However, the causes of that are not fully understood. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the relationship between insulin resistance and the presence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to identify risk factors that may predispose young men and women to CVD. Methodology/Principal Findings: Insulin resistance and CVD risk factors were examined in 8682 Korean men and 1829 women aged 30 – 45 years old. Insulin resistance was estimated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and CAC was measured using computed tomography. Women were less likely to be insulin resistant (upper quartile of HOMA-IR, 18 % vs. 27 %, p, 0. 001) and had a lower prevalence of CAC (1. 6 % vs. 6. 4 %, p, 0. 001). Even when equally insulin resistant men and women were compared, women continued to have lower prevalence of CAC (3. 1 % vs. 7. 2 %, p = 0. 004) and a more favorable CVD risk profile. Finally, after adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, insulin resistance remained an independent predictor of <b>CAC</b> only in <b>men</b> (p = 0. 03). Conclusions/Significance: Young women have a lower risk for CVD and a lower CAC prevalence compared with men.

40|$|Background—Elevated {{levels of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) are {{associated}} with increased risk for incident cardiovascular events {{on the basis of}} observations from several prospective epidemiological studies. However, less is known regarding the relationship between CRP levels and atherosclerotic burden. Methods and Results—We measured CRP in 3373 subjects 30 to 65 years of age who were participating in the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic, population-based, probability sample. Electron-beam CT scans were used to measure coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 2726 of these subjects, and MRI was used to measure aortic plaque in 2393. CRP levels were associated with most traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects with CAC had higher median CRP levels than those without CAC (men: median, 2. 4 versus 1. 8 mg/L, P 0. 001; women: median, 5. 2 versus 3. 6 mg/L, P 0. 001), and there was a modest trend toward increasing CRP levels with increased <b>CAC</b> levels in <b>men</b> (P for trend 0. 003) but not in women (P for trend 0. 08). Male subjects with aortic plaque also had higher CRP levels than those without (median, 2. 3 versus 1. 8; P 0. 001). In multivariate analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, and estrogen and statin medication use, the associations between CRP levels and CAC and CRP levels and aortic plaque were no longer statistically significant. Conclusions—In a large, population-based sample, subjects with higher CRP levels had a modest increase in the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis, but this association was not independent of traditional cardiovascular ris...|$|R

40|$|Adipose tissue {{radiodensity}} {{detected by}} computed tomography (CT) is hypothesized {{to be associated}} with differences in adipose tissue composition which may {{contribute to the development of}} coronary atherosclerosis independent of epicardial adipose tissue volume. The aim of the present study is to quantify the relation between epicardial adipose tissue radiodensity and presence, distribution, and density of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. A total of 140 patients of the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease (SMART) study underwent cardiac-CT angiography. Ordinal logistic and linear regression was used to quantify the relation between epicardial adipose tissue radiodensity (in Hounsfield Units, HU) and CAC. One SD lower attenuation (5 HU) was associated with a 1. 90 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 14 to 3. 19) higher odds for men and a 1. 07 (95 % CI 0. 41 to 2. 75) higher odds for women of being in a higher CAC class (0, 1 to 100, 101 to 400, and > 400), independent of age, coronary artery bypass graft history, epicardial adipose tissue volume, and body mass index. One SD lower attenuation was not associated with more diffuse distribution of CAC, but increased the odds of being in a higher tertile of CAC density per plaque (odds ratio 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 18 to 2. 66). In conclusion, low epicardial adipose tissue CT attenuation is associated with higher <b>CAC</b> scores in <b>men</b> at high risk for cardiovascular disease, independent of epicardial depot volume and body mass index. Present results suggest a potential role for epicardial adipose tissue radiodensity as a measure of adipose tissue composition and may inform on the contribution of epicardial adipose tissue composition to coronary atherosclerosis...|$|R
