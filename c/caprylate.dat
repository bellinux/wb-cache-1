In all, 87. 19 % of the hexanic extract from fruits relative composition were evaluated, in which 72. 81 % were beta- and alpha-amyrin esters, suggesting that they may be chemical markers for M. subsericea. Hexadecanoic acid, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, (E) - 9 -octadecenoic acid ethyl ester, and octadecanoic acid ethyl ester were also identified. Ethanolic crude extracts from leaves, stems, and hexanic extract from fruits exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923.

40|$|Phytosterols {{and their}} {{derivatives}} occur naturally {{in the cell}} membranes of plants and are present at low levels in grains, fruits, and vegetables as well as marine algae. In addition to their well-known effect in lowering low-density lipoprotien cholesterol, phytosterols possess other biological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antiatherogenicity, and anti-carcinogenic potential. Thus, they have recently received much scientific and commercial attention {{for the production of}} nutraceuticals and ingredients for development of functional foods. While most of the research and commercial interest has been on phytosteryl esters with vegetable oil fatty acid mixtures of different chain length, the objectives of this work were to explore enzymatic preparation of phytosteryl esters with phenolic acids or specific fatty acids of interest, such as caprylic acid, oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Phenolic acids are potent antioxidants that scavenge free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. Caprylic acid, oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are representatives of medium-chain, long-chain monounsaturated and long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively. The health benefits of these fatty acids are well documented. Esterification of phytosterols with phenolic acids, caprylic acid, oleic acid or docosahexaenoic acid may render them better physiochemical properties such as lipid solubility, miscibility, oxidative stability and hence bioactivity and bioavailability. Thus, novel phytosteryl esters, prepared enzymatically, may offer the health benefits of phytosterols and those of phenolic acids, caprylic acid, oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, possibly in an additive or synergistic manner. This thesis describes methods for successful enzymatic or chemoenzymatic preparation of selected phytosteryl esters. The identity of the phytosteryl esters so produced was confirmed by using different analytical methods. The enzymatic synthesis of phytosteryl <b>caprylates</b> was optimized using response surface methodology. The antioxidant activity of phytosteryl phenolates was determined using different in vitro assays in a variety of model systems. They exhibited antioxidant activity that was system-dependent and followed different antioxidant mechanisms. Phytosteryl phenolates, especially phytosteryl caffeates, provide an opportunity for future use as food antioxidants. The cholesterol-lowering effect of phytosteryl oleates and docosahexaenoates was evaluated using an apo-E deficient mouse model. Preliminary results indicted that they may be used as excellent ingredients in nutraceuticals and functional foods for cholesterol-lowering purposes. However, phytosteryl oleates and docosahexaenoates exhibited no triacylglycerol-lowering effect in this animal model; in fact they increased the total plasma triacylglycerols level, as expected for this model. Therefore, other animal models may be employed to determine their triacylglycerol-lowering effect. Further research on the evaluation of biological activities of phytosteryl esters so prepared is necessary in order to shed further light on the extent of the beneficial health effects of conjugated compounds reported in this thesis...|$|R

Their best dog had a peak post reimplantation creatinine of 50 mg/l (0.44 mmol/l). Liu used well hydrated dogs undergoing a mannitol diuresis and stored the kidneys at 9 °C - 10 °C using a perfusate derived from human PPF. The PPF was further fractionated {{by using a}} highly water-soluble polymer (Pluronic F-38), and sodium acetyl tryptophanate and sodium <b>caprylate</b> {{were added to the}} PPF as stabilisers to permit pasteurisation. To this solution were added human albumin, heparin, mannitol, glucose, magnesium sulphate, potassium chloride, insulin, methyl prednisolone, carbenicillin, and water to adjust the osmolality to 300-310 mosmol/kg. The perfusate was exchanged after 3.5 days storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg or less, at a pump rate of 60 per minute. Perfusate pH was 7.12-7.32 (at 37 °C), Pco2 27-47 mm Hg, and Po2 173-219 mm Hg. In a further report on this study Humphries [...] found that when the experiments were repeated with a new batch of PPF no survivors were obtained, and histology of the survivors from the original experiment showed glomerular hypercellularity which he attributed to a possible toxic effect of the Pluronic polymer.|$|E

To improve yields in plasma product manufacturing, a new viral reduction process has been developed using the fatty acid <b>caprylate.</b> As licensure of plasma products warrants thorough evaluation of pathogen reduction capabilities, the present study examined susceptibility of enveloped viruses to inactivation by <b>caprylate</b> in protein solutions with varied pH and temperature. In the immunoglobin-rich solutions from Cohn Fraction II + III, human immunodeficiency virus, Type- 1, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and pseudorabies virus were inactivated by <b>caprylate</b> concentrations of {{greater than or equal}} to 9 mM, {{greater than or equal to}} 12 mM, and greater than or equal to 9 mM, respectively. Compared to solvent-detergent treatment, BVDV inactivation in Fraction II + III solution was significantly faster (20 - 60 fold) using 16 mM <b>caprylate.</b> Caprylate-mediated inactivation of BVDV was not noticeably affected by temperature within the range chosen manufacturing the immunoglobulin product. In Fraction II + III solutions, IgG solubility was unaffected by less than or equal to 19 mM <b>caprylate.</b> In albumin solution from Cohn supernatant IV- 1, 40 mM <b>caprylate</b> rapidly inactivated BVDV, demonstrating versatility in inactivating enveloped viruses potentially present in other protein solutions. Our data show that <b>caprylate</b> is a robust enveloped virus inactivating agent for immunoglobulins and albumin which may potentially be utilized for other proteins; viral inactivation was not adversely affected by protein content and the buffer composition conditions evaluated.

Aim: We aimed to investigate the effect of intraduodenal (ID) fat hydrolysis on GLP- 1 release and test whether the signal is mediated through cholecystokinin (CCK) - 1 receptors. Design and Setting: Thirty-four healthy, male ambulatory volunteers were studied in three consecutive, randomized, double blind, crossover studies. Intervention: There were three interventions: 1) 12 subjects received an ID fat infusion with or without orlistat, an irreversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, in comparison with vehicle; 2) 12 subjects received ID sodium oleate (C 18 : 1), ID sodium <b>caprylate</b> (C 8 : 0), or ID vehicle; and 3) 10 subjects received ID sodium oleate with and without the CCK- 1 receptor antagonist dexloxiglumide or ID vehicle plus iv saline (placebo). The effect of these treatments on GLP- 1 concentrations and CCK release was quantified. Results: The following results were reached: 1) ID fat induced significant increase in GLP- 1 concentrations (P > 0. 004), and inhibition of fat hydrolysis by orlistat abolished this effect; 2) sodium oleate significantly stimulated GLP- 1 release (P > 0. 008), whereas sodium <b>caprylate</b> was ineffective compared with controls; and 3) dexloxiglumide administration abolished the effect of sodium oleate on GLP- 1. ID fat or sodium oleate significantly stimulated plasma CCK (P > 0. 006 and P > 0. 004) compared with saline, whereas sodium <b>caprylate</b> did not.

Eighteen Staphylococcus strains belonging to the species Staphylococcus xylosus (5), S. saprophyticus (3), S. equorum (4), S. carnosus (4) and S. simulans (2), previously isolated from different types of Southern Italian fermented sausages, were screened for proteinase, aminopeptidase and esterase activities. Most of the staphylococci strains lacked detectable levels of proteinase activity against casein-fluorescein isothiocynate. In the active strains, this activity was extracellular or cell-envelope associated. The studied staphylococci strains also showed low levels of aminopeptidase activities, which preferentially hydrolysed substrates containing L-methionine, L-leucine and L-phenylalanine as N-terminal residue. In contrast, all staphylococcal strains possessed significant activity against short-chain fatty acid esters. The maximum esterase activities were detected in whole-cell suspensions and cell-free extracts {{and to a lesser extent}} in the extracellular medium. The substrates preferentially hydrolysed were ρ-nitrophenyl (ρ-NP) butyrate and ρ-NP <b>caprylate</b> and, secondly, ρ-NP palmitate. The extracellular extracts of most of the strains were only active against ρ-NP butyrate except for those of S. equorum (SI 3, SI 4) and S. simulans (Ssm 12, Ssm 21), which also hydrolysed ρ-NP <b>caprylate</b> and ρ-NP palmitate.

Weak activities were observed for valine arylamidase, beta-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. No activities could be demonstrated for cystine arylamidase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, alpha-galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, beta-glucuronidase, alpha-glucosidase, alpha-mannosidase, and alpha-fucosidase. Enzymatic activities of pseudomonads may provide useful information about their pathogenesis and information for identification of Pseudomonas species...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{drugs that}} stimulate the {{isolated}} hypodynamic frog heart {{have been tested}} {{for their ability to}} stimulate hearts freshly perfused in calcium-free Ringer solution. Ouabain and digitoxigenin regularly caused stimulation, veratridine did so occasionally. Hydrogen peroxide, tannic acid, paullinia tannin (from Paullinia pinnata, Linn.), sodium oleate and sodium <b>caprylate</b> did not stimulate. The stimulant action of ouabain could be prevented or greatly reduced by prior perfusion with either of the two tannins or with hydrogen peroxide. Hearts perfused for 3 to 4 hr with calcium-free Ringer solution, or hearts perfused for shorter periods of time with calcium-free Ringer solution containing the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid, behave unusually in that when perfusion with low-calcium Ringer solution is resumed twitch tension does not return for periods ranging from 10 to 90 min. Ouabain is unable to stimulate these “calcium-depleted” hearts. It is suggested that hydrogen peroxide, the two tannins, oleate and <b>caprylate</b> stimulate by causing the heart to increase the uptake of calcium from the perfusion fluid to a superficial site where calcium is necessary for the propagation of excitation from the cell membrane inwards. A special feature of the action of cardiac glycosides may be their ability to enable the heart to utilize in a similar way the intracellular stores of calcium...|$|E
40|$|Lipase from Candida rugosa was covalently {{immobilized on}} Sepabeads EC-EP for {{application}} for amyl <b>caprylate</b> synthesis in an organic solvent system. Several solvents {{were tested in}} terms of biocatalyst stability and the best result was obtained with isooctane. The lipase-catalyzed esterification in the selected system was performed in batch and fluidized bed reactor systems. The influence of several important reaction parameters including temperature, initial water content, enzyme loading, acid/alcohol molar ratio, and time of addition of molecular sieves is carefully analyzed {{by means of an}} experimental design. Almost complete conversion (> 99 %) of the substrate to ester could be performed in a batch reactor system, using lipase loading as low as 37 mg g- 1 dry support and in a relatively short time (24 hrs) at 37 ï¿½C, when high initial substrate molar ratio of 2. 2 is used. Kinetics in a fluidized bed reactor system seems to still have a slightly better profile than in the batch system (90. 2 % yields after 14 hrs). The fluidized bed reactor operated for up 70 hrs almost with no loss in productivity, implying that the proposed process and the immobilized system could provide a promising approach for the amyl <b>caprylate</b> synthesis at the industrial scale...|$|E
40|$|The Escherichia coli {{esterase}} YbfF displays high activity towards 1, 2 -O-isopropylideneglycerol (IPG) butyrate and IPG <b>caprylate,</b> and {{prefers the}} R-enantiomer of these substrates, producing the S-enantiomer of the IPG product in excess. To improve {{the potential of}} the enzyme for the kinetic resolution of racemic esters of IPG, an enhancement of the activity and enantioselectivity would be highly desirable. Molecular docking of the R-enantiomer of both IPG esters into the active site of YbfF allowed the identification of proximal YbfF active site residues. Four residues (25, 124, 185 and 235) were selected as targets for mutagenesis, in order to enhance YbfF activity and enantioselectivity towards IPG esters. Random mutagenesis at positions 25, 124, 185 and 235 yielded several best YbfF variants with enhanced activity and enantioselectivity towards IPG esters. The best YbfF mutant, W 235 I, exhibited a 2 -fold higher enantioselectivity than wild-type YbfF, with an E= 38 for IPG butyrate and an E= 77 for IPG <b>caprylate.</b> Molecular docking experiments further support the enhanced enantioselectivity shown experimentally and the structural effects of this amino acid substitution on the active site of YbfF are provided. The engineered W 235 I mutant is an attractive catalyst for practical applications in the kinetic resolution of IPG esters...|$|E
40|$|We report {{development}} of a polymer gel with a catalytic activity that can be switched on and off when the solvent composition is changed. The gel consists of two species of monomers. The major component, N-isopropylacrylamide, makes the gel swell and shrink {{in response to a}} change in composition of ethanol/water mixtures. The minor component, vinylimidazole, which is capable of catalysis, is copolymerized into the gel network. The reaction rate for catalytic hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl <b>caprylate</b> was small when the gel was swollen. In contrast, when the gel was shrunken, the reaction rate increased 5 times. The activity changes discontinuously as a function of solvent composition, thus the catalysis can be switched on and off by an infinitesimal change in solvent composition. The kinetics of catalysis by the gel in the shrunken state is well described by the Michaelis–Menten formula, indicating that the absorption of the substrate by the hydrophobic environment created by the N-isopropylacrylamide polymer in the shrunken gel is responsible for enhancement of catalytic activity. In the swollen state, the rate vs. active site concentration is linear, indicating that the substrate absorption is not a primary factor determining the kinetics. Catalytic activity of the gel is studied for substrates with various alkyl chain lengths; of those studied the switching effect is most pronounced for p-nitrophenyl <b>caprylate...</b>|$|E

The ability of Mucor miehie and Candida cylindracea lipases, free or immobilized, to catalyze amidation reaction was shown. Products were purified and characterized. To optimize the reaction, some reaction conditions were assessed like temperature, type of shaking {{and amount of}} enzyme, on a model amidation reaction between butyl <b>caprylate</b> and MBCD-NH 2. Among the biocatalysts tested, Lipozyme {{was found to be}} the most active, requiring low loading, being robust at 70 °C even under magnetic agitation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: 1) The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new natural {{preservative}} system to improve the weak points of natural polyhydric alcohols together with the efficiency of natural plants as a preservative. Polyhydric alcohols (glyceryl <b>caprylate</b> and ethylhexylglycerin) and antimicrobial plants (S. radix, A. nilotica and C. reticulata) were tested using the disc diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method for their antimicrobial activity against the common poultry pathogens, respectively. A study of the preservative efficacy of the cosmetic formulations containing the optimized preservative system demonstrated sufficient preservative efficacy against bacteria and eukaryotic test microbes. These results suggest that the natural preservative system includin...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme {{activities}} of four strains of Legionella pneumophilia were investigated {{by using the}} API ZYM system (API System S. A., F- 38390 Montalieu Vercieu, France) and synthetic substrates. Aminopeptidases were detected specifically against L-alanine, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-cystine, L-glutaminic acid, glycine, L-histidine, L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-lysine, L-methionine, L-phenylalanine, L-tryptophan, L-tyrosine, and L-valine. Furthermore, the bacteria possesses esterase activity splitting propionate, butyrate, caproate, <b>caprylate,</b> and caprate, but not laurate, myristate, palmitate, and stearate, esters. The enzymes studies were inhibited partially by aprotinin. No inhibition of phosphatase (pH range, 5. 4 to 8. 5) or of phosphoamidase was observed. Activities of arylsulfatase, chymotrypsin, trypsin, and glycosidases could not be detected...|$|E
