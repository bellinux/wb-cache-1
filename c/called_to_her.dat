5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> brother, then {{closed the door and}} placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
25|$|Purdy's mother {{remarried}} in September 1969; she divorced {{her husband}} four years later. Albert Gulart, Sr., Purdy's stepfather, said Purdy was an overly quiet child who cried often. In fall 1973, Kathleen separated from Gulart and moved {{with her children}} from Stockton to the Sacramento area. In December of that year, the Sacramento Child Protective Services were twice <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> residence, on allegations that Kathleen was physically abusing her children. When Purdy was thirteen, he struck his mother {{in the face and}} was permanently banned from her house. He lived on the streets of San Francisco for a while, before being placed in foster care by authorities. He was later placed in the custody of his father, who was living in Lodi, California at the time. While attending Lodi High School, Purdy became an alcoholic and a drug addict, and attended high school sporadically.|$|E
500|$|Kate {{reported}} to police {{that when she}} <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> mother after escaping onto the garage roof, Green had been [...] "terribly upset" [...] and called to Kate to jump into her arms. Though Green missed catching her daughter when she did jump, Kate was not hurt. When the two ran into Farrar minutes later, Kate said that Farrar had been accusatory toward Green and Green had been crying and worried about her missing children.|$|E
6000|$|At last Malleville, who {{had fallen}} a little behind, heard Phonny <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in tones of great delight. She hastened on. In a moment she saw Phonny before her just coming out from among the bushes and <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Just {{then she}} heard Phonny's voice around a corner, <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

500|$|Not {{willing to}} let public {{sentiment}} over the executions subside, Dyer {{knew that she had}} to go through with her martyrdom. [...] After the winter she returned to the Bay Colony in May 1660, and was immediately arrested. On the 31st of the month she was brought before Endecott, who questioned her briefly, and then pronounced her execution for the following day. [...] On 1 June, Dyer was once again led to the gallows, and while standing at the hanging tree for the final time, Wilson, who had received her into the Boston church 24 years earlier and had baptized her son Samuel, <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] His words were, [...] "Mary Dyer, O repent, O repent, and be not so deluded and carried away by deceit of the devil." [...] Her reply was, [...] "Nay, man, I am not now to repent." [...] With these final words, the ladder was kicked away, and she died when her neck snapped.|$|E
500|$|The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne QC, {{began his}} case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that {{three hours after}} the shootings his nephew {{had told him that}} he [...] "must have done it". He said that since his nephew had come to live with him {{following}} his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.|$|E
500|$|Marie became {{seriously ill}} on 15 November, and Alice was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> bedside, {{but by the}} time she arrived, Marie had choked to death. A distraught Alice wrote to Queen Victoria that the [...] "pain is beyond words". Alice kept the news of Marie's death secret from her {{children}} for several weeks, but she finally told Ernest in early December. His reaction was even worse than she had anticipated; at first he refused to believe it. As he sat up crying, Alice broke her rule about physical contact with the ill and gave him a kiss. At first, however, Alice did not fall ill. She met her sister Victoria as the latter was passing through Darmstadt on the way to England, and wrote to her mother with [...] "a hint of resumed cheerfulness" [...] on the same day. However, by Saturday, 14 December, the anniversary of her father's death, she became seriously ill with the diphtheria caught from her son. Her last words were [...] "dear Papa", and she fell unconscious at 2:30am. Just after 8:30am, she died. Alice was buried on 18 December 1878 at the Grand Ducal mausoleum at Rosenh√∂he outside Darmstadt, with the Union Flag draped over her coffin. A special monument of Alice and her daughter Marie was erected there by Joseph Boehm.|$|E

2500|$|Hutchinson was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> church {{trial on}} Thursday, 15 March 1638 {{following}} a four-month detention in Roxbury, weary and in poor health. [...] The trial {{took place at}} her home church in Boston, though many of her supporters were either gone or compelled to silence. [...] Her husband and other friends had already left the colony {{to prepare for a}} new place to live. [...] The only family members present were her oldest son Edward with his wife, her daughter Faith with her husband Thomas Savage, and her much younger sister Katharine with her husband Richard Scott. [...] The complement of ministers was largely the same as it had been during her civil trial, though the Reverend Peter Bulkley from Concord took part, as did the newly arrived Reverend John Davenport who was staying with John Cotton and preparing to begin a new settlement at New Haven.|$|E
2500|$|By March 1924 Puccini had {{completed}} the opera up to the final duet. However, he was unsatisfied with {{the text of the}} final duet, and did not continue until 8 October, when he chose Adami's fourth version of the duet text. On 10 October he was diagnosed with throat cancer and on 24 November went to Brussels, Belgium, for treatment. There he underwent a new and experimental radiation therapy treatment. Puccini and his wife never knew how serious the cancer was, as the news was revealed only to his son. Puccini, however, seems to have had some inkling of the possible seriousness of his condition since, before leaving for Brussels, he visited Toscanini and begged him, [...] "Don't let my Turandot die". [...] He {{died of a heart attack}} on 29 November 1924, when it had seemed that the radium treatment was succeeding. His step-daughter Fosca was in fact joyfully writing a letter to an English friend of the family, Sibyl Seligman, telling her that the cancer was shrinking when she was <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father's bedside because of the heart attack.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of Tuesday, March 18, Effie went to check on Joan after the doctor had left for the day. [...] She found Joan in a soiled nightgown; when she moved her to help her change into a fresh gown, Effie saw that Joan had been lying in dried feces. [...] Two towels had been placed under her due to a recent loose bowel {{movement}} that appeared to contain blood. The maid {{did her best to}} help Joan into the bathroom to clean her. [...] As she did this, Effie noticed that Joan's face began turning blue. [...] The maid hurriedly cleaned up Joan and the soiled bed and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband, who also worked for the Hills, to phone Mrs. Hill's parents' home at once. When there was no answer, Archie Green tried unsuccessfully to reach John Hill at his office and left a message. [...] Rhea Robinson was unaware of Joan's condition when her husband dropped her off at the Hill home to visit her daughter.|$|E
60|$|Dorothy was {{thinking}} so earnestly {{as they walked}} along {{that she did not}} notice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled {{over to the side of}} the road. Indeed he was obliged <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> help him up again.|$|R

60|$|He rushed {{beyond the}} barrier and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to follow.

Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition.|$|E
60|$|The student then {{resumed his}} place upon the couch, and <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to enter.|$|E

5000|$|Lord Steyn {{described}} {{the actions of}} Burstow as follows: [...] "During an eight month period in 1995 covered by the indictment he continued his campaign of harassment. He made some silent telephone <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He also made abusive <b>calls</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He distributed offensive cards in the street where she lived. He was frequently, and unnecessarily, at her home and place of work. He surreptitiously took photographs of the victim and her family. He sent her a note which {{was intended to be}} menacing, and was so understood." ...|$|R

60|$|Bartley came {{round and}} lifted her in; the girl <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> horse, and drove up into the road and away.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{she heard}} footsteps, {{and the voice}} of the Hebrew <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> softly, but she took no notice. After a moment or two it sounded again, {{somewhat}} louder.|$|R
60|$|She {{swept out}} of the room, and her aunt, who entered it, after <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in vain, stood with Lemuel, and heard her mount the stairs, sobbing, <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own room, and lock herself in.|$|R
60|$|He clung <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as {{a troubled}} child might, {{with his arms}} clasped round her, and his head against her breast. And a mist rose up before her, and strange, {{commanding}} voices seemed <b>calling</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

60|$|He feared this <b>call</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> memory, yet {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> put <b>her</b> <b>to</b> a test. <b>Her</b> eyes dilated--the light shaded; they grew sad, dark, humid gulfs of thought. But the old, somber veil, the insane, {{brooding}} stare, did not return.|$|R
