5000|$|In {{some places}} this fish is {{threatened}} by habitat loss due to sedimentation and deteriorating water quality from agricultural and urban development. In addition, activities which impede or slow water flow during spawning are {{a threat to the}} survival of this species. The introduced round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) may also compete with the <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> for space and resources and is a potential predator of eggs. However, overall the <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> has a wide range and large total population with many sub-populations, no particular threats have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a [...] "least concern species".|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{channel and}} point bar {{changes over time}} in the Pearl River, a meandering, Coastal Plain stream in Mississippi and Louisiana. We interpreted extreme changes in bar area as evidence of channel instability and related this to the diversity and abundance of darters in the river. Darters were less diverse and abundant in more disturbed reaches in comparison with relatively undisturbed reaches. Darter abundance {{was positively correlated with}} proximity to extreme bar-area changes. The relationship between <b>channel</b> instability and <b>darter</b> abundance observed here points to the importance of landscape level ap-proaches to in-stream habitat management. The results suggest that river management practices that prevent or mitigate extreme changes in channel or sediment dynamics should be adopted for the benefit of benthic communities...|$|R

50|$|The fish is {{native to}} North America, where it has a highly {{localized}} distribution. It is uncommon in Canada but disjunct populations {{can be found in}} Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, it is found in Little Rideau Creek, in tributaries of the Bay of Quinte, and in Lakes Erie and St. Clair. Along the Huron-Erie corridor, it has been collected from the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers. In Quebec, it occurs in some tributaries of the St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. In the United States, the <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> is more common, occurring in the Ohio and lower Mississippi basins.|$|E
50|$|The <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> prefers {{pools and}} riffles of small- to {{medium-sized}} rivers, {{but can also}} be found in shallow, slow current areas of large rivers. Substrate preferences include sand, gravel or rock. This fish has also been found in lakes along sand and gravel beaches where wave action is gentle and the current slow. Communal spawning occurs in the spring and early summer in upstream areas with moderate to fast current and over fine gravel or small rocks. Males establish breeding territories. Females spawn with successive males and lay 4 to 10 eggs in each nest; 350 to 700 eggs in total. There is no parental care.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> (Percina copelandi) is {{a species}} of fish in the perch family, Percidae, and the {{subfamily}} Etheostomatinae. It is native to North America where it typically occurs in the sandy or gravelly shallows of lakes and in small and medium-sized rivers in riffles over sand, gravel or rock bottoms. It is a small fish ranging from 34 to 72 mm in length, olive brown with darker speckles and sometimes with a dark spot below the eye and dark blotches along the flank. It feeds mostly on insect larvae and other small invertebrates and breeds in small streams. This species is listed as threatened by the Canadian Species at Risk Act (SARA) but overall it has a wide range and numerous sub-populations and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a [...] "least concern species".|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the habitat {{preference}} (or use), distribution and growth of darters (<b>Channel</b> <b>Darter</b> Percina copelandi, Logperch Percina caprodes, Fantail Darter Etheostoma flabellare, Tessellated Darter Etheostoma olmstedi and Johnny Darter Etheostoma nigrum) in tributaries of the Ottawa River, Québec, Canada. The Channel Darter’s habitat can be characterised by coarse heterogeneous substrate with water velocities greater than 0. 25 m/s in zones with low bank slopes. Its distribution is limited to five tributaries of the Ottawa River, downstream from the first physical barrier. The Logperch and Fantail Darter’s habitats were similar to that of the <b>Channel</b> <b>Darter,</b> although the Fantail Darter was present in shallower waters. The Tessellated Darter was spatially partitioned from the others; the species seems to be a habitat generalist. The Johnny Darter was the least abundant darter and seems to prefer coarse heterogeneous substrate. The majority of growth in length was attained during the first year in all species. Growth rates were affected by the presence of parasites in the <b>Channel</b> <b>Darter</b> and Fantail Darter, non-parasitized individuals growing faster than parasitized individuals. Growth rates also differed among males and females in the <b>Channel</b> <b>Darter,</b> males growing faster than females...|$|E
40|$|The <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> (Percina copelandi) has a wide, disjunct {{distribution}} {{throughout much}} of the eastern United States west of the Appalachian Mountains, ranging as far west as portions of Oklahoma and Kansas (1). Miller and Robison (2) report the range of this species in Oklahoma to extend only as far west as the upper Blue River drainage of Johnson County in the south and Salt Creek in Osage County in the north (Fig. 1). Here we report the recent discovery of the <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> in East Cache Creek and at least one of its tributaries in southwest Oklahoma. On August 25, 1984, a Chattanooga Oklahoma High School biology class, under the instruction of Alvie Claborn, collected two channel darters from East Cache Creek on Fort Sill Military Reservation in Comanche County, Oklahoma, near Hoyle Bridge, 1 river-km below its confluence with Medicine Creek. The darters measured 37 and 42 mm standard length respectively, and were collected in the only run that occured in approximately 75 m of the stream sampled. Maximum depth in the run was 50 cm, and the substrate consisted of small to medium gravel, whereas the remainder of the stream sampled was composed of shallow pools with sand and silt on a gravel substrate...|$|E
40|$|Round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) {{were first}} {{documented}} within the St. Clair River in 1990, and subsequently impacted native benthic fishes, including sculpins and darters, through direct predation and competition for space and prey. In {{order to identify}} long-term impacts on fish species associated with the round goby invasion in the St. Clair River, Michigan, I compared fish community composition and diet overlap between round goby and native species in 1994 with similar data from 2011. All fish were collected by trawls (3 -, 5 -, 7 -, 9 -, 11 -m depths) and seines (1 m) in May, July, and September 2011, and compared to similar data collected in May, June, and September 1994. Catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) for rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) and round goby significantly decreased in the nearshore zone between 1994 and 2011. In the offshore zone, relative abundance of northern madtom (Noturus stigmosus) decreased significantly between 1994 and 2011, while round goby relative abundance both increased and decreased, depending on month. CPUE of <b>channel</b> <b>darter</b> (Percina copelandi), johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum), mottled sculpin (Cottus bardii), and round goby also significantly decreased in the offshore zone between 1994 and 2011. There was significant diet overlap between round gobies and native rainbow darter in 1994, suggesting diet overlap and competition for food contributed to rainbow darter population declines in the St. Clair River from 1994 to 2011. However, significant diet overlap was also found in both years between round goby and other native species that did not decline from 1994 to 2011. In 2011, round gobies showed significant diet overlap with rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) in the nearshore zone, and significant overlap with logperch (Percina caprodes) and trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) in the offshore zone. In 1994, reliance on zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) by adult round goby prevented frequent significant diet overlap from occurring between large round gobies and native species that could not consume zebra mussels, but in 2011, round gobies, logperch, and trout-perch all consumed quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis). These results suggest that differential foraging strategies allowed some native fish to forage without competition from round goby, and that the negative impacts of the round goby invasion and establishment on fish species diversity within the St. Clair River may be isolated to a few species, and due to competition for other resources, such as space. Establishment of the round goby within Great Lakes tributaries, nearshore environments, and more recently the Mississippi River basin will likely have differing impacts on native fish communities based on the pre-existing communities, other environmental stressors, and foraging habits of native fishes...|$|E
