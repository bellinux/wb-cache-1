The firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) {{was awarded the}} $25.6 million contract, with {{construction}} to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority financial interest in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were discovered to be extremely minor the contract was awarded.|$|E

Renamed the BBC Micro, the system was adopted by most schools in the United Kingdom, changing Acorn's fortunes. It was also moderately successful as a home computer in the UK despite its high cost. Acorn also employed the machine to simulate and develop the ARM architecture which, many years later, has become hugely successful for embedded systems, including tablets and cellphones. In 2013 ARM was {{the most widely used}} 32-bit instruction set architecture.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{issued a}} <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>bids</b> to tunnel under the Anacostia River in July 1984, and awarded the $25.6 million {{contract}} {{to the firm}} of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) in December 1984. The debate over the route {{for the remainder of}} the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984 when the original route was re-selected. The U.S. district court approved Metro's decision. Funding for Green Line construction fell into place in 1985. Construction on the line started in 1985. Survey and clearing work for the twin 2,500-foot (762 m) Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985. The completion date for the two tunnels was estimated at late 1987.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{merchant}} ships calling at Finnish ports and requiring icebreaker assistance {{during the winter}} months had increased steadily since the first Finnish state-owned icebreakers, Murtaja and Sampo, were built in the 1890s. In 1902 General Nikolai Sjöman, the director of the Finnish Pilot and Lighthouse Authority, made a proposal to the Senate of Finland for the construction of the third state-owned icebreaker. While reluctant at first, in May 1906 the Senate announced that the old Murtaja could be replaced with a new icebreaker and a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>bids</b> was sent to a number of suitable shipyards. On 4 September 1906 a decision was made to order a new icebreaker even though no buyer had been found for the old Murtaja.|$|E

25|$|While {{the weight}} limit was {{indefinite}} (pending full {{rehabilitation of the}} bridge), NPS officials said the lanes and sidewalks would be closed {{six to nine months}} to allow workers to shore up the corroded beams and bascule span. The Department of Transportation issued a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>bids</b> on May 26, 2015, and said a contractor will be chosen on June 18. The $5 million project is to cover repair or replacement of expansion joints, steel, structural concrete; drainage improvements; concrete sidewalk repair; restoration of the asphalt atop the bridge deck; and debris removal. Cianbro Corp. of Maine, which rehabbed the bridge a decade earlier, won a $2.5 million contract to begin the repairs, which were estimated to take about six months to complete. (The work would only allow lane re-openings, but not remove the 10-ton weight limit.) Work was to begin on the bridge in late August or early September 2015.|$|E
25|$|In February 1997 the Finnish National Board of Navigation {{signed a}} {{contract}} worth FIM 303 million with Finnyards {{for the construction of}} a new multipurpose icebreaker. While initially only FIM 280 million was reserved for the new icebreaker, this was later increased by FIM 23 million as the planned vessel proved to be more expensive than expected. While an open <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>bids</b> was arranged by the Board of Navigation as dictated by the European Union rules, only Finnyards and Kværner Masa-Yards, another Finnish shipyard, sent in their tenders, and Finnyards won the contract because of shorter delivery time. The new multipurpose icebreaker was to be delivered in March–April 1998. Also designed by ILS, the new vessel resembles the older Finnish multipurpose icebreakers, but is slightly smaller, less powerful and has open-propeller Azipod units instead of Aquamasters with ducted propellers as the latter had proved to be problematic in ice.|$|E

Bids for a single-screw [...] "European-type" [...] icebreaker similar to the German icebreaker Eisbrecher I were received from German shipbuilder AG Vulcan Stettin, Danish Burmeister & Wain and Swedish shipyards Kockums AB and Bergsunds Mekaniska Verkstads AB. An expert committee appointed by the Senate recommended the second Swedish design, which was the second cheapest at 445,000 Swedish kronor, and the contract was signed with Bergsundet on 25 May 1889.|$|E
2500|$|Space for {{a chapel}} {{had been set}} aside when Woodland was first laid out in 1853.

Even the new public vault was proving far too small to accommodate the heavy number of remains which built up during the winter. The cemetery superintendent again pushed for a chapel in 1869, but no action was taken until early 1880 when the city hired local landscape architect E.O. Schwaegerl (who had designed Riverside Cemetery) and oft-used local architect Alexander Koehler to design the chapel. The city finally issued a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>bids</b> in September 1880. Contracts to the following were awarded on October 4: [...] For cut stone and masonry work, J.
