500|$|Tharoor {{once said}} that when he began his {{political}} career he was approached by the Congress, the Communists, and the BJP. He chose Congress because he felt ideologically comfortable with it. In March 2009 Tharoor contested the Indian General Elections as a candidate for the Congress Party in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. His opponents included P. Ramachandran Nair of the Communist Party of India (CPI), Neelalohitadasan Nadar of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), MP Gangadharan of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and PK Krishna Das of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

50|$|After the Kingdom {{was overthrown}} by a coup d'état led by Muammar Gaddafi in 1969, {{revenues}} of the Kingdom were overprinted L.A.R. in Arabic.

It instructed its <b>consular</b> and <b>passport</b> officers everywhere, that Irish Free State passports {{were not to be}} recognised if the holder was not described in the passport as a [...] "British Subject".

The issue continued to be a thorny one until the early 1930s.|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{ministries}} {{the world}} over have many similar features, but they all differ significantly in their operational and staffing needs from their domestic ministry counterparts. Their essential work is the management of all aspects of bilateral relations between countries; they are also {{deeply involved in the}} activities of multilateral organisations and are routinely called upon to respond to unpredictable international events over which they have little or no control. At the high policy level, the subject matter of their work ranges from trade and security to human rights and the environment. For most of these pursuits, foreign ministries function according to international rules that are often also the subject of domestic laws to enforce them. At the other end of their responsibilities are the travel-related <b>consular</b> and <b>passport</b> services so much in demand in this age of globalisation. In this period, international events assumed much greater immediacy for domestic policy-makers, thanks mainly to the enormous improvements in communications which brought international events into the home more than ever before.

50|$|A {{legal name}} change {{is merely the}} first step in the name-change process. A person must officially {{register}} the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the Social Security Administration, Bureau of <b>Consular</b> Affairs (for <b>passports),</b> the Federal Communications Commission, the Selective Service System and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.|$|R
