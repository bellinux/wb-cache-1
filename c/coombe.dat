5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: <b>Coombe</b> Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. <b>Coombe</b> Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of <b>Coombe,</b> with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E

5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and <b>Coombe</b> Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E

25|$|<b>Coombe</b> {{is located}} between the green spaces of Shirley (Addington) Hills, Lloyd Park, Ballards and <b>Coombe</b> Wood.
