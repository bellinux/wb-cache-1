40|$|The S-NPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument, a polar {{orbiting}} Earth {{remote sensing}} instrument built using a strong MODIS background, employs a similarly designed on-board <b>calibrating</b> <b>source</b> - a V-grooved blackbody for the thermal emissive bands (TEB). The central wavelengths of most VIIRS TEBs {{are very close}} to those of MODIS {{with the exception of the}} 10. 7 micron channel. To ensure the long term continuity of climate data records derived using VIIRS and MODIS TEB, it is necessary to assess any systematic differences between the two instruments, including scenes with temperatures significantly lower than blackbody operating temperatures at approximately 290 K. Previous work performed by the MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) at NASAGSFC used the frequent observations of the Dome Concordia site located in Antarctica to evaluate the calibration stability and consistency of Terra and Aqua MODIS over the mission lifetime. The near-surface temperature measurements from an automatic weather station (AWS) provide a direct reference useful for tracking the stability and determining the relative bias between the two MODIS instruments. In this study, the same technique is applied to the VIIRS TEB and the results are compared with those from the matched MODIS TEB. The results of this study show a small negative bias when comparing the matching VIIRS and Aqua MODIS TEB, implying a higher scene temperature retrieval for S-VIIRS at the cold end. Statistically no significant drift is observed for VIIRS TEB performance over the first 3. 5 years of the mission...|$|E

The potential impact on the reconstructed images of deviations from the ideal activity is discussed. Results from simulated and real data {{for a pair of}} block detectors suggest that planar or annular sources can be equally suitable for a normalization procedure if their geometry and their intersections with the system lines-of-response (LORs) are properly taken into account. When comparing an annulus with a centered planar source, both filled with the same total activity, the planar source produces twice the count rate with a 92 % of trues versus 66 % of trues for the annulus. Scatter and randoms are lower by factors of 3 and 4 respectively in the planar case. We conclude that, although planar and annular sources can be suitable for a normalization procedure if their geometries are properly taken into account, planar source normalization results are better than those of an annulus, particularly if the normalization does not consider the effect of scatter correction, more significant for the annulus source than for the planar oneThis work has been partially funded by projects PI 052583 and PI 052583 (Ministerio de Sanidad), BFM 2003 - 04147 -C 02 - 01 (Ministerio de Edcucación y Ciencia) and CD-TEAM (Ministerio de Industria, CENIT program), Spai...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{satellite}} {{instruments that}} measure Earth-reflected solar radiation in the visible and near infrared wavelength regions have been calibrated for radiance response in a two-step method. In the first step, the spectral {{response of the}} instrument is determined using a nearly monochromatic light source, such a lamp-illuminated monochromator. Such sources only provide a relative spectral response (RSR) for the instrument, since they do not act as <b>calibrated</b> <b>sources</b> of light nor do they typically fill the field-of-view of the instrument. In the second step, the instrument views a <b>calibrated</b> <b>source</b> of broadband light, such as lamp-illuminated integrating sphere. In the traditional method, the RSR and the sphere spectral radiance are combined and, with the instrument's response, determine the absolute spectral radiance responsivity of the instrument. More recently, an absolute calibration system using widely tunable monochromatic laser systems has been developed, Using these sources, the absolute spectral responsivity (ASR) of an instrument can be determined on a wavelength-hy-wavelength basis. From these monochromatic ASRs. {{the responses of the}} instrument bands to broadband radiance sources can be calculated directly, eliminating the need for <b>calibrated</b> broadband light <b>sources</b> such as integrating spheres.
