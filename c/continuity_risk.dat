40|$|The {{viability}} of a telemedicine {{system is the}} strength of its business continuity. Business continuity can only stand if the telemedicine system remains continuously feasible. This article studies telemedicine risk in terms of its feasibility on all its five components: economical, technical, social, operational, and legal/ethical. Any deficiencies in {{one or more of the}} feasibility components will affect the system business <b>continuity</b> <b>risk</b> and can lead to infeasibility and possible dissolution. The telemedicine computing environment is full of uncertainties and ambiguities and it just involves too much background knowledge that Bayesian theory cannot accommodate.

To {{prevent the}} {{interruption}} of an organization’s daily {{operations in the}} event of a catastrophe, organizations must reconsider the importance of creating awareness and being prepared for the unexpected. The importance of business continuity for the survival of any organization during a crisis or disaster has become a prominent factor within the modern organization. Organizations must fully understand the importance of this factor and the impact it could have on the organization. Adequate and effective actions and procedures should be in place to address the organization’s business <b>continuity</b> <b>risks.</b> The study investigated the different business <b>continuity</b> <b>risks</b> that an organization faces in its internal and external environment and the concept and principles of an effective business continuity plan to address and manage these risks. This was done by way of a comprehensive literature study on business continuity factors as well as an empirical study of established business continuity practices at the audit clients of the four largest audit firms. The study found that there are various categories of business <b>continuity</b> <b>risks</b> that are applicable to the modern organization, but although the majority of organizations are aware of the risks that they are faced with not all organizations fully understand the impact of these risks on the organization and therefore not all organizations have effective and adequate business continuity plans in place to address and manage these risks.

Special importance is given to the problem of supply chain sustainability. The critical element of success in business is maintaining continuous operations.

Insurance has a pivotal role in business and supply chain <b>continuity</b> <b>risk</b> management. As well as in all other cases, insurance cannot directly safeguard companies from accidents and subsequent disruptions but is the most important source of indemnification for losses when insured events materialize.

We conclude that insurance, as an integral part of risk management efforts, should be combined together with other risk management techniques in order to provide business and supply chain continuity...|$|E
40|$|The {{accelerated}} technological change, trend reversals and thus, shortened innovation cycles {{represent the}} current central challenges for established companies. This {{results in an}} increased pressure on firms to maintain their competitiveness. In order to remein competitive in the long-run, {{it will not be}} sufficient to only develop incremental innovations. In addition, new business fields need to be developed by the means of radical innovation and new business models. As revealed in this contribution, the development of radical innovations and new business models, however, requires the stepping out of the firm-specific "comfort zone". This refers to the classic strengths and paradigms of established companies, which can be described through term s such as efficiency, <b>continuity,</b> <b>risk</b> minimization and conflict aversion. A successful "stepping out of the comfort zone" can be enaled by a systematic design in the four action fields structure, process, culture and market access. Beside an innovation-centred development environment in form of a separate innovation path for the structure action field, highly iterative processes are required. In the market access action field, product placements need to be focused on practical usability insead of technological virtuosity. Ultimately, especially a defined failure culture, trust in employees as well as continuous impulses build the basis for the successful development of radical innovations and new business models {{on the part of the}} culture action field...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Severe {{flooding}} in Queensland, Australia in late 2010 and into February of 2011 resulted in significant losses to infrastructure, equipment and coal production. Xstrata Coal (XC) mines suffered {{billions of dollars}} worth of losses, resulting in insurance premiums increasing drastically in subsequent months. These events prompted Xstrata‟s top management to reconsider {{the way in which they}} managed risk. Initial revelations were that the focus of Risk Management had largely been on the areas of Health and Safety and that, particularly in South Africa, the outcome of all management‟s efforts to manage risk had been to comply with the relevant legislation. There was clearly an attempt to avoid litigation resulting in potential prosecution. The most stringent of this legislation was that of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 24 of 996), as promulgated by the Department of Mineral Resources. The requirements were prescriptive to the extent that mine management was required to utilise the Hazard Identification Risk Assessment process to identify hazards, assess the associated risk and apply mitigation, largely in order to prevent incidents which could affect the health and safety of employees. Little regard was given to the fact that mining houses could endure severe financial losses as a result of catastrophic events, which could stop production for significant periods of time. Whilst Xstrata did recognise Business <b>Continuity</b> <b>Risk</b> (BCR), the risk assessment process which was introduced along with the CURA risk register displayed a distinct division between Health and Safety Risk and BCR. Furthermore, this was not a systematic process. Initial risk categories were prescribed by XC mainly based on experiences in Australia. The floods prompted a rethink and Xstrata‟s prescription to conduct business <b>continuity</b> <b>risk</b> assessments (BCRAs) coincided perfectly with this writer‟s exposure to the Enterprise Risk Management Elective at the University of Stellenbosch‟s Business School. As the General Manager of the iMpunzi Complex that comprises three coalmines, it was the responsibility of the writer to carry out the instruction to review the business continuity process. Consequently, the research is intended to assess the current Risk Management environment within Xstrata Coal South Africa by means of an analysis of current documentation and interviews with select key personnel who largely influence and impact the management of risk in the company. Thereafter, the study will progress to the methodology involved in the Risk Assessments, followed by an assessment of the knowledge, skills and qualifications required for the relevant, accountable managers appointed to manage the risks. The findings of the research were that whilst there was quite a rigid framework, which was aligned with ISO 31000 principles for risk management, there were shortcomings in the methodology of the risk assessment process, as well as the considerations for dealing with latent or residual risk. To this extent, the writer recommended: A risk assessment template which prescribes, but is not limited to, the hazards which may be prevalent on a coal mine, including hazards specific to iMpunzi Complex; A revised template for the Risk Treatment Plan, which takes cognisance of Residual Risk; Other recommendations, which may deal with minor findings of the study...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{various aspects}} of the integrity monitoring of GPS applied to civil aircraft navigation in different phases of flight. These flight phases include en route, terminal, non-precision approach and precision approach. The thesis includes four major topics: probability problem of GPS navigation service, risk analysis of aircraft precision approach and landing, theoretical analysis of Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) techniques and RAIM availability, and GPS integrity monitoring at a ground reference station. Particular attention is paid to the mathematical aspects of the GPS integrity monitoring system. The research has been built upon the stringent integrity requirements defined by civil aviation community, and concentrates on the capability and performance investigation of practical integrity monitoring systems with rigorous mathematical and statistical concepts and approaches. Major contributions of this research are: • Rigorous integrity and <b>continuity</b> <b>risk</b> analysis for aircraft precision approach. Based on the joint probability density function of the affecting components, the integrity and continuity risks of aircraft precision approach with DGPS were computed.

40|$|Certification {{challenges}} and higher than anticipated development {{costs for the}} Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) have motivated the investigation of alternative approaches for achieving Category I precision approach and landing service. One proposed alternative is the Local Airport Monitor (LAM). This concept would rebroadcast Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) differential corrections in LAAS format while using an on-airport receiver to monitor the WAAS corrections and tighten the broadcast error bounds to the level required for a Category I approach. The LAM proposal would thus merge the capabilities of WAAS and LAAS to achieve Category I with an architecture similar to that proposed for precision approach with the Ground-Based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS). This paper examines a method for implementing the LAM using a range-domain concept for the LAM ground facility. The cornerstone to the implementation is a modified Vertical Protection Level (VPL) equation {{that takes into account}} the discrepancy between the WAAS pseudorange corrections and the locally measured pseudorange corrections. This modified protection level equation can be implemented without requiring any changes to existing airborne receiver equipment. Specifically, through a careful manipulation of the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) message, the aircraft’s existing protection levels are transformed into the desired LAM protection levels. Simulation indicates that a baseline LAM implementation achieves reasonable integrity and availability performance even without a specialized multipath limiting antenna. However, baseline availability and continuity are severely degraded for a Vertical Alert Limit (VAL) below 12 m. Two optional modifications are thus introduced to augment availability in support of a 10 m VAL. The first technique exploits prior knowledge of the WAAS error distribution, and the second computes <b>continuity</b> <b>risk</b> on an ensemble basis, rather than a specific (worst-case) basis. Simulations of these modifications suggest they provide acceptable availability, even for a VAL of 10 m...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{extremes}} {{have created}} a considerable impact on Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the UK during the recent years, especially on SMEs in the construction sector. Evidence {{in relation to the}} recent weather extremes have demonstrated that SMEs are some of the worst impacted by the Extreme Weather Events (EWEs) and have confirmed them as a highly vulnerable section of the UK economy to the impact of extreme weather. This is of particular importance to the construction industry, as an overarching majority of construction companies are SMEs who account for the majority of employment and income generation within the industry. Whilst construction has been perceived as a sector significantly vulnerable to the impacts of EWEs, there is scant evidence of how construction SMEs respond to such events and cope with their impact. Based on the evidence emerged from case studies of construction SMEs, current coping strategies of construction SMEs were identified. Some of the strategies identified were focused at organisational level whereas others were focused at project level. Further, some of the strategies were general risk management / business continuity strategies whereas others have been specifically developed to address the risk of EWEs. Accordingly, coping strategies can be broadly categorised based on their focus; i. e. those focused at project or organisational level, and based on the risks that they seek to address; i. e. business / <b>continuity</b> <b>risks</b> in general or EWE risk specifically. By overlapping these two aspects; their focus and risks that they seek to address, four categories of coping strategies can be devised. There are; general risk management strategies focused at business level, general risk management strategies focused at project level, EWE specific strategies focused at business level, and EWE specific strategies focused at project level. It is proposed that for a construction SME to effectively cope with the impact of EWEs and develop their resilience against EWEs a rich mix of these coping strategies are required to suite the particular requirements of the business...|$|R
