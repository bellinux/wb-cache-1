30|$|In {{the early}} years, China {{imported}} {{a large amount}} of shearers including <b>chain</b> <b>haulage</b> type and hydraulic haulage type. Since the 1970 s, China has started to manufacture shearers. In the eighties, the hydraulic haulage shearers met the requirements for extracting coal seams with heights from 1.5 to 4.5  m. In addition, the difficulties in integrating all mining equipment had been overcome. There were about 50 types of shearers. Up to the 1990 s, large power hydraulic haulage shearer developed in China has gone into mass production. Furthermore, the high performance electric haulage shearer had been developed, and is currently at an advanced level in the world, with a cutting height of 5.5  m. In China, the application of large power electric haulage shearers enables the increase of coal production at a fully mechanized face from 1 Mtpa to 4 Mtpa or even 10 Mtpa. Currently, several series of electric haulage shearers are manufactured in China. In addition, the electric shearers are equipped with intelligent monitoring, control and protection systems, and applied with information processing and sensor technologies to achieve electro-mechanization.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{works out}} the problematic of increasing quality in information flow in road haulage. The thesis highlights logistic <b>chains</b> of road <b>haulage</b> of both carload freight and colli deliveries. Research project {{took place in}} two divisions of the biggest south bohemian transport company ČSAD JIHOTRANS a. s. The specified quality improvement of information flows comes out from implementation of new information technologies. The dissertation thesis {{is not only the}} description of new functions of implemented technologies, but it mainly describes consequential changes, which are necessary to perform in order to reach requested improvements...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue-crack {{propagation}} and threshold behaviour of a C-Mn steel containing boron {{has been}} investigated at a range of strength levels suitable for mining chain applications. The heat-treatment variables examined include two austenitizing temperatures (900 degree C and 1250 degree C) {{and a range of}} tempering treatments from the as-quenched condition to tempering at 400 degree C. In mining applications the <b>haulage</b> <b>chains</b> undergo a 'calibration' process which has the effect of imposing a tensile prestrain on the chain links before they go into service. Prestrain is shown to reduce threshold values in these steels and this behaviour is related to its effects on the residual stress distribution in the test specimens...|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{the most}} {{advanced}} systems involved continuous loops of rope operated like a cable car system. Some mines used endless chains before wire-rope became widely available. [...] The endless chain system originated in the mines near Burnley (England) around 1845. An endless rope system was developed in Nottinghamshire around 1864, and another independently developed near Wigan somewhat later (also in England). [...] In these systems, individual cars or trains within the mine could {{be connected to the}} cable by a grip comparable to the grips used on surface cable car systems. [...] In some mines, the <b>haulage</b> <b>chain</b> or cable went {{over the top of the}} cars, and cars were released automatically when the chain or cable was lifted away by an overhead pulley. Where the cable ran under the cars, a handheld grip could be used, where the grip operator would ride on the front car of the train working the grip chained to the front of the car. In some cases, a separate grip car was coupled to the head of the train. [...] At the dawn of the 20th century, endless rope haulage was the dominant haulage technology for the main haulage ways of underground mines.|$|R
40|$|Containerisation has {{dramatically}} changed international transportation; it {{has affected the}} speed and costs of the transportation of goods. The largest share of costs of container transportation is related to inland transportation. The performance of the container transportation chain as a whole determines its competitive position. Disruptive events occur in the transportation chain, {{and if they are}} not mitigated effectively, the disruptions will be propagated through the chain. Robustness of the container transportation chain is key to acquiring and maintaining a good competitive position. This research investigates to what extent the hinterland network configuration, like merchant haulage and terminal haulage, influences the robustness of the hinterland container transportation chain. During this research a discrete event simulation model has been developed for the hinterland transport chain between Rotterdam and the Ruhr district. Three different disruption scenarios are studied during the simulation runs: delay of a vessel, low water levels in the Rhine River, and a combination of both. This research shows that changing hinterland network configuration of the transport <b>chain</b> from merchant <b>haulage</b> to terminal haulage is an effective way of increasing the transport chain’s robustness, thereby increasing the competitive position of the terminal. The model results can be used to support container terminal operators with the strategic decision of whether or not to invest in terminal haulage.

40|$|Rock salt is {{globally}} predominantly mined by {{drilling and}} blasting. Despite the hazards {{associated with the}} handling of explosives and the complexity of a blasting operation, mechanical mining methods have not played {{a big role in}} winning operations. Mechanical mining methods have been used in rocksalt mines mainly for development or special tasks for many years, but it is improvements of machine weight and cutter motor performance made in the last years that have allowed for an economically feasible mining. Besides roadheaders and Marietta miners mainly used for drifting in rocksalt mines, continuous miners have been utilized in winning mainly in US potash mines. In comparison to the first mentioned machines continuous miners offer unique features making them especially suitable for the use in rocksalt mines. This thesis investigates the suitability of continuous miners for the production of rocksalt. The investigation includes specific boundary conditions as a basis for continuous miner operations as well as the layout of continuous miner systems with emphasis on the <b>haulage</b> <b>chain.</b> The economic and technical viability is demonstrated based on two mine layouts using continuous and batch haulage. The task is achieved by the use of a computer-based tool which has been developed for this investigation. It allows for evaluating a continuous miner operation based on changeable boundary conditions in an arbitrary rocksalt mine. The tool allows for appraising the stability of the selected panel layout, for checking the continuous miner power against minimum power required to cut the rock, for determining the production rates as well as the haulage system performance and for ascertaining the excavation time of a mine panel. Finally, the tool permits to calculate the cost per tonne of the continuous miner system...|$|R
