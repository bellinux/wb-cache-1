40|$|Abstract: Efficiency of an {{automotive}} {{disc brake}} system {{is affected by}} several factors such as lateral run out (LRO), <b>caliper</b> <b>housing</b> stiffness, lining compressibility, seal/groove design, brake fluid, and pad material. A minor deviation {{in any of these}} factors may lead to problems like brake noise, vibration and off-brake caliper drag in the brake system. This paper presents an experimental study of the effect of LRO on calliper drag by measuring drag with respect to LRO for different types of callipers at varied speeds. This study is important because in automotive industry, different methods are used for testing different types of calipers with different LRO values. Results indicate that the effect of increasing LRO on off-brake caliper drag is caliper dependent...|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each <b>caliper</b> <b>houses</b> six pistons.|$|R
