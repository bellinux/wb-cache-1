The Bader–Ofer method favors larger lists, meaning that a <b>joint</b> <b>list</b> is more likely to receive leftover seats than each list would individually. If such a <b>joint</b> <b>list</b> were to receive a leftover seat, the Bader–Ofer method would be applied a second time to determine which of the parties that make up the <b>joint</b> <b>list</b> would receive it.

30|$|An {{experimental}} study on <b>combined</b> steel-to-timber <b>joints</b> with nails and bolts is conducted in this study. Principal results are as follows: The initial stiffness and effective allowable resistance of <b>combined</b> <b>joints</b> depend obviously on clearances in predrilled bolt-holes. The <b>combined</b> <b>joints</b> with nails and bolts have high potential of energy capacity to resist strong earthquake forces. There are upper limits of clearances in predrilled bolt-holes that allow advantages of considering the synthetic resistance of <b>combined</b> <b>joints</b> in practical structural design. <b>Combining</b> the <b>joint</b> components with appropriate design will give higher performance against strong earthquakes increasing the safety margin and energy capacity until the failure. The <b>combined</b> <b>joints</b> {{should be designed}} under the restrictions of particular specifications in closed design systems because the advantages of <b>combining</b> the <b>joint</b> components are influenced obviously by various actual conditions, which are too difficult to consider in detail in open design systems.|$|R
