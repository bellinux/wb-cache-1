50|$|The {{procedure}} {{consists of}} making a hockey-stick shaped incision along the ulnar border. This incision is made between the fifth and sixth dorsal compartment. Being careful not to harm any essential structures, like the posterior interosseous nerve, the incision is continued between the extensor carpi ulnaris and the extensor digiti quinti, until the ulna is found. The ulnar head is then removed. A guide wire is then inserted in the medullary canal of the ulna, allowing centralization for a <b>cannulated</b> drill bit. A poly-ethylene ball, which {{will serve as the}} prosthesis, is then placed over the distal peg. After confirming full range of motion, the skin will be closed.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, CT guided {{radiofrequency}} ablation {{has emerged as a}} less invasive alternative to surgical resection in the care of benign bone tumors, most notably osteoid osteomas. In this technique, which can be performed under conscious sedation, a RF probe is introduced into the tumor nidus through a <b>cannulated</b> needle under CT guidance and heat is applied locally to destroy tumor cells. Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment of osteoid osteomas in the early 1990s, it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, with 66 to 96% of patients reporting freedom from symptoms. While initial success rates with RFA are high, symptom recurrence after RFA treatment has been reported, with some studies demonstrating a recurrence rate similar to that of surgical treatment.|$|E
50|$|The next {{aspect of}} the surgery is {{preparation}} and placement of the reconstruction grafts. The preparation can be done while the other steps are being completed by another surgeon or physician’s assistant. The semitendinosus tendon can be harvested using a hamstring stripper for use as the reconstruction autograft. The autograft is sectioned into a 16-cm length for the sMCL reconstruction and 12-cm length for the POL reconstruction. These lengths are also used if the surgery is done with cadaver allograft. The sMCL and POL grafts are pulled into their respective femoral tunnels and each secured with a <b>cannulated</b> bioabsorbable screw. The grafts are passed distally along their native courses to the tibial attachments. The sMCL is passed under sartorius fascia (and any remaining sMCL fibers). Both grafts are passed (but not yet secured) into their respective tibial tunnels using the existing eyelet pins. If simultaneous cruciate ligament surgery is underway, the cruciate reconstructions are secured before securing the medial ligaments.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} was first developed in 1927 by the Portuguese physician and neurologist Egas Moniz at the University of Lisbon to provide contrasted x-ray cerebral angiography {{in order to}} diagnose several kinds of nervous diseases, such as tumors, artery disease and arteriovenous malformations. Egas Moniz is recognized as the pioneer in this field. Moniz performed the first cerebral angiogram in Lisbon in 1927, and Reynaldo Cid dos Santos performed the first aortogram {{in the same city}} in 1929. In fact, many current angiography techniques were developed by the Portuguese at the University of Lisbon. For example, in 1932, Lopo de Carvalho performed the first pulmonary angiogram via venous puncture of the superior member, in 1948 the first cavogram was performed by Sousa Pereira. Radial access technique for angiography {{can be traced back to}} 1953, where Eduardo Pereira first <b>cannulated</b> the radial artery to perform a coronary angiogram. With the introduction of the Seldinger technique in 1953, the procedure became markedly safer as no sharp introductory devices needed to remain inside the vascular lumen.|$|E
5000|$|Linster's recent {{research}} has shown that neuromodulators such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, which are the two main neuromodulators for olfactory sensory processing in the adult main olfactory bulb (OB), aid in discrimination between chemically similar odorants in <b>cannulated</b> rats. [...] The rats showed a reduction in spontaneous discrimination between similar odors when nicotinic acetylcholine receptors were blocked, and they showed a significant enhancement in spontaneous discrimination when the efficacy of cholinergic inputs was increased by unblocking these receptors. However, when the rats were observed during reward-motivated odor-discrimination tasks, the difference in cholinergic uptake by nicotinic receptors produced no significant behavioral changes. Linster's findings show that the OB is a highly plastic structure that is directly modulated by olfactory experience and the perception of odors. This plasticity of the OB in turn leads to behavioral changes based on how an odor is processed and paired with reward associations. [...] Linster took these studies even further by examining how neural mechanisms such as these play a role in habituation and olfactory memory based on different periods of exposure to odors.|$|E
5000|$|PTPµ is {{expressed}} in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and in capillaries in the developing brain. [...] The expression of PTPµ in HUVEC cells increases at higher cell density. [...] Studies of PTPµ expression in animal tissues have demonstrated that PTPµ is preferentially expressed in endothelial cells of arteries and capillaries and in cardiac smooth muscle, in addition to brain cells. [...] Because of this specialized expression in arterial endothelial cells, and because PTPµ is found to associate with proteins involved in maintaining endothelial cell-cell junctions, such as VE-cadherin, [...] PTPµ is hypothesized to regulate endothelial cell junction formation or permeability. PTPµ {{has been shown to}} be involved in mechanotransduction that results from changes in blood flow to influence endothelial cell-mediated blood vessel dilation, a process induced by “shear stress.” [...] When PTPmu is missing in mice (PTPmu -/- knock-out mice), <b>cannulated</b> mesenteric arteries show reduced flow-induced (or “shear stress” induced) dilation. [...] PTPmu tyrosine phosphatase activity is activated by shear stress. [...] Caveolin 1 is a scaffolding protein enriched in endothelial cell junctions that is also linked to shear stress regulated responses. [...] Caveolin 1 is dephosphorylated on tyrosine 14 in response to shear stress and PTPmu is hypothesized to catalyze this reaction.|$|E
50|$|If {{a patient}} {{needs to be}} treated with surgery, a {{standard}} surgical procedure would be called for; the patient would be resting in Fowler’s position, a semi-sitting position, under general anesthesia. The exact size, shape, and distance between the acromion to the midpoint of the cyst are measured by a digital radiograph or MRI scan. A small, longitudinal skin incision, about 1 cm long, is made {{at the center of the}} cyst. Next, by using a trephine or drill bit, a small aperture is made inside the incision. Fluids contained in the cyst are drained and curved, metal impactors are used to break any septa, or membranes, within the cyst. Curettes are then used to remove the entire cyst from the diaphysis. After the removal of the cystic membrane, a 95% ethanol solution is injected into the cavity to produce a chemical cauterization to burn away any residual active membrane for 30 seconds and then aspirated. Saline solution is then immediately injected into the cavity to wash out any residual ethanol solution and to mitigate any damage to healthy tissue; this irrigation process of ethanol and saline solutions is repeated for another 2 to 3 times. A curved impactor is inserted into the cavity and used to penetrate the boundary between the cyst and bone marrow; the intentional penetrations will allow bone marrow cells to migrate into the cavity to produce a source of osteoinductive cells, cells that induce bony growth. Furthermore, the cavity is completely filled with bone graft substitute, such as calcium sulfate. Finally, one <b>cannulated</b> screw is placed into the aperture.|$|E
50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study in vivo the over-all fatty acid specificity of the mechanisms involved in chylomicron cholesterol ester and triglyceride formation during fat absorption in the rat. Mixtures containing similar amounts of two, three, or four C14-labeled fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids), but with varying ratios of unlabeled fatty acids, were given by gastric intubation to rats with <b>cannulated</b> thoracic ducts. The chyle or chylomicron lipid so obtained was chromatographed on silicic acid columns to separate cholesterol esters and glycerides (the latter being 98.2% triglycerides). After assaying each lipid class for total radioactivity, gas-liquid chromatography was employed to measure the total mass {{and the distribution of}} mass and of radioactivity in the individual fatty acid components of each lipid fraction. The specific radioactivity of each fatty acid in each fraction could then be calculated. The data provided quantitative information on the relative specificity of incorporation of each fatty acid into each chylomicron lipid class and on the relative extent to which each fatty acid in each lipid fraction was diluted with endogenous fatty acid. With the exception of a slight discrimination against stearic acid, the processes of fatty acid absorption and chylomicron triglyceride formation displayed no specificity for one fatty acid relative to another. In contrast, chylomicron cholesterol ester formation showed marked specificity for oleic acid, relative to the other three fatty acids. This specificity was not significantly altered by varying the composition of the test meal, by including cholesterol in the test meal, or by feeding the animal a high-cholesterol diet for several weeks preceding the study. Considerable dilution of the dietary fatty acids with endogenous fatty acids was observed. In one experiment, 43% of the chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids was of endogenous origin. Relatively more (54%) of the cholesterol ester fatty acids was of endogenous origin.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} Loewi began his {{experiments}} {{there was much}} discussion among scientists whether communication between nerves and muscles was chemical or electrical by nature. Experiments by Luigi Galvani in the 18th century had demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve resulted in twitching of the leg muscles, and from this he developed the concept of bioelectricity. This led {{to the idea that}} direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation. However, work by John Newport Langley had suggested that in the autonomic nervous system communication in the ciliary ganglion was chemical. Loewi's experiments, published in 1921 http://www.springerlink.com/media/hb5c1xjkyj5xwgb1va6q/contributions/x/0/1/3/x01314653605h385.pdf, finally settled the issue, proving that synaptic transmission was chemical.Loewi performed a very simple yet elegant experiment. Using an isolated frog heart he had previously found that stimulation of the vagus nerve resulted in a slowing of the heart rate, while stimulation of the sympathetic nerve caused the heart rate to speed up (Figure 1). He reasoned that stimulation of either the vagus or sympathetic nerve would cause the nerve terminal to release a substance which would either slow or accelerate the heart rate. To prove this, he took a frog heart, which had been <b>cannulated</b> in order to perfuse the fluid surrounding the heart, and electrically stimulated the vagus nerve until the heart rate slowed. He then collected the fluid surrounding the heart and added it to a second frog heart which had been stripped of its vagal and sympathetic nerves. By adding the fluid surrounding the first heart to the second heart, he caused the heart rate of the second heart to slow down. This proved that stimulation of the vagus nerve caused the release of a substance which acted upon the heart tissue and directly caused the heart rate to slow down. (Figure 2) This substance was called vagusstoff. Vagustoff was later confirmed to be acetylcholine and was found to be the principal neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
30|$|Burghardt et al. {{proposed}} two {{modifications in}} order to avoid hardware failure.

Solid screws are stronger and bear the mechanical stresses more than <b>cannulated</b> screws [12]. The mechanical strength of a screw depends on the core diameter.
