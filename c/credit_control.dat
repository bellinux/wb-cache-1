40|$|We {{have entered}} {{a world of}} {{conjoined}} monetary and macroprudential policies. But can they function smoothly in tandem, and with what effects? Since this policy cocktail {{has not been seen}} for decades, the empirical evidence is almost non-existent. We can only fix this shortcoming in a historical laboratory. The Radcliffe Report (1959), notoriously skeptical about the efficacy of monetary policy, embodied views which led the UK to a three-decade experiment of using <b>credit</b> <b>controls</b> alongside conventional changes in the central bank interest rate. These non-price tools are similar to policies now being considered or used by macroprudential policymakers. We describe these tools, document how they were used by the authorities, and craft a new, largely hand-collected dataset to help estimate their effects. We develop a novel identification strategy, which we term Factor-Augmented Local Projection (FALP), to investigate the subtly different impacts of both monetary and macroprudential policies. Monetary policy acted on output and inflation broadly in line with consensus views today, but <b>credit</b> <b>controls</b> had markedly different effects and acted primarily to modulate bank lendin...|$|R

40|$|Fifty {{years ago}} Milton Friedman {{published}} a book entitled A Program for Monetary Stability. In it he outlined a number of suggestions {{for the conduct of}} monetary and fiscal policies that he thought would contribute to monetary stability and pari passu to price stability and a greater degree of output/employment stability. In this paper I review some of his policy prescriptions in light of the financial and economic crisis of 2007 - 2009. From the perspective of financial development the world today is much different from the world that Friedman knew in the late 1950 ’s. In what way would his policy recommendations have to be modified to account for these changes in financial development? To stabilize the banking system we argue that his proposal for 100 percent reserves or narrow banking merits serious consideration in current policy discussions. To stabilize asset markets we propose two policies that Friedman would not likely endorse. The first is to reinstate selective <b>credit</b> <b>controls</b> in the areas of the securities markets and the real estate market. The second policy designed to dampen excessive variability in the stock market is for the Central Bank to carry out some open market operations in an index fund of equities.
