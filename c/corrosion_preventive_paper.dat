40|$|Lifetime Testing of <b>Corrosion</b> <b>Preventive</b> Compounds (CPCs) was {{performed}} to quantify performance in the various environments to which the Space Shuttle Orbiter is exposed during a flight cycle. Three CPCs are approved for use on the Orbiter: HD Calcium Grease, Dinitrol AV- 30, and Braycote 601 EF. These CPCs have been rigorously tested {{to prove that they}} mitigate corrosion in typical environments, but little information is available on how they perform in the unique combination of the coastal environment at the launch pad, the vacuum of low-earth orbit, and the extreme heat of reentry. Currently, there is no lifetime or reapplication schedule established for these compounds that is based on this combination of environmental conditions. Aluminum 2024 coupons were coated with the three CPCs and exposed to conditions that simulate the environments to which the Orbiter is exposed. Uncoated Aluminum 2024 coupons were exposed to the environmental conditions as a control.

40|$|Aircraft paint schemes (paint and sealant) are a {{key element}} of <b>corrosion</b> <b>preventive</b> measures, and {{ensuring}} that such schemes and other coatings are effective and durable under service conditions is essential if corrosion costs and maintenance costs are to be minimized. Coatings can degrade under the influence of environmental factors such as exposure to moisture, high temperature, ultraviolet radiation, and so forth. Coating failure is often particularly evident at joints, and while failure may be accelerated in some regions by local variations in coating thickness and geometry at features such as edges, or by erosion, {{it is likely that the}} displacements which occur at these locations under service loads will be a contributing factor. The impact of in-service mechanical loading on coating degradation has so far received little attention, despite clear evidence that coatings tend to fail first at specific sites such as sheet ends and around fastener heads. This paper argues that the magnitude of the applied service loads and the nature of the load history should be considered in predicting and assessing rates of coating degradation, and that development of a thermomechanical history is a more appropriate approach. The likely impact of joint displacements on the protection of aging aircraft is also discussed...|$|R

This document is the Final Report for Phase I evaluations, which included physical property, corrosion resistance, and NASA spaceport environment compatibility testing and analysis of fifteen CPC types.

40|$|The intense anodic {{action of}} {{sacrificial}} zinc pigments ensured viable galvanic {{function of the}} highly porous liquid zinc-rich paints (ZRPs) result in deteriorated long-term corrosion resistance often accompanied by cathodic delamination phenomena. In our approach, such a efficacy problem related to the <b>corrosion</b> <b>preventive</b> function of ZRPs is addressed by the application of intimately structured anodic inhibitor particles composed of nano-size alumina and either polyelectrolyte-modified or chemically functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) supported polypyrrole (PPy) in one specific zinc-rich hybrid paint formulation providing balanced active–passive protective functionality. High dispersity of the nanotube-free PPy-deposited inhibitor particles (PDIPs) with uneven polymer distribution on the alumina carrier was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations. Furthermore, the MWCNT-embedded PDIPs indicated almost complete surface coverage of the alumina-nanotube carriers by PPy with decreased microstructure dispersity which is attributed {{to the effect of}} double-flocculants type co-deposition of the oppositely charged polymers causing coalescence of the modified particles. Depending on the amount of the nanotubes and their proportion to the quantities of the deposited PPy and polyelectrolyte as well as the concentration of the surfactant, varied micron-scale association of the PDIPs in the suspensions of dissolved alkyd matrix was disclosed by rheology characterization carried out at particular solid contents similar to hybrid paint formulation. The evenly distributed but less densely packed nano-structure of PPy was evidenced on the polyelectrolyte-modified nanotubes by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy whereas more compact polymer film formation was confirmed on the surface of functionalized nanotubes. According to the greater electrical conductivity, enhanced electroactivity and reversibility of the nanotube-embedded PDIPs were indicated over the nanotube-free particles by cyclic voltammetry, depending on the type and the amount of the nanotubes and their modification.

40|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) {{generation}} {{is becoming a}} very important player within the renewable energy sector thanks to increased introduction of these facilities into the conventional electricity market. CSP plants become dispatchable when integrating thermal energy storage (TES) systems which allow electricity production {{at any time of}} the year. Sensible TES using nitrate salts mixtures as storage fluid are the most extended arrangement for commercial CSP facilities. In addition to storage time, dimensions, thermal-mechanical requirements, among others, corrosion compatibility between high temperature nitrate salts, and structural materials is a key factor to take into consideration for the final storage system design. Many scientific contributions have been developed regarding metallic alloys corrosion performance in nitrate salts at laboratory scale. Accordingly, lack of technical background is identified about nitrates corrosion in relevant operation conditions. Therefore, a corrosion testing device (CTD) was designed to evaluate corrosion behavior of structural materials inside high temperature nitrate salts storage tanks in operation. Furthermore, A 516 Gr 70 carbon steel was evaluated at different exposures times by using the CTD in the TES-PS 10 pilot plant. Results reported within this study show the feasibility of the CTD to be used at commercial scale allowing <b>corrosion</b> <b>preventive</b> maintenance practices and materials selection optimization. Moreover, A 516 Gr 70 carbon steel displayed an excellent corrosion performance after nitrate salts exposure being recommended for long time service under continuous and intermittent exposure to nitrate salts. In addition to low corrosion rates, carbon steel generated protective and well adhered iron oxide layers without significant localized phenomena. Finally, negligible susceptibility to crevice and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) phenomena is showed by carbon steel under test conditions.

In this work we have used the EIS method to study the behavior of coated and uncoated airframe aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 corroding in 0. 5 M aqueous NaCl; crevice corrosion in this alloy has also been studied via use of simulated joints. ^ The EIS spectra observed on coated specimens yield a characteristic, two time constant spectrum that can be modeled by a circuit incorporating a geometric coating capacitance, a 2 ̆ 2 pore 2 ̆ 2 resistance, a polarization resistance and a double layer resistance and the decrease of coating capacitance and polarization resistance {{can be related to}} the degradation of the coating. ^ The EIS spectra for coated 2024 -T 3 aluminum with simulated joint showing crevice corrosion display three semicircles on the Nyquist plot, which can be modeled by a circuit with three time constant. For the third time constant, a crevice-related capacitance and a charge transfer resistance corresponding to the crevice were used to model the impedance spectra with good fitting results; and values of the crevice resistance can be justified with results from measuring the surface morphology changes for simple crevice geometry created by placing a micro slide on top of 2024 -T 3 aluminum in aqueous 0. 5 M NaCl solution. ^ The corrosion behavior in aqueous 0. 5 M NaCl of 2024 -T 3 aluminum treated with a wool wax (lanolin) based <b>corrosion</b> <b>preventive</b> coating was studied via EIS and DC electrode polarization. The wool wax coating was found to be very corrosion preventative for this alloy in the aqueous saline environment whether applied to freshly prepared surfaces or to corroded specimens removed from simulated service. ^ An EIS procedure can be designed that contributes a new NDE technique for the detection of corrosion on aircraft structures. This is especially sensitive to crevice corrosion which cannot be detected by other NDE methods. ...|$|R
