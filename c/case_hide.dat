40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the results of two new {{experiments}} that assess the formation of macrofractures on bone tools subject to non-hunting-related activities. Our experiments were designed to assess the formation of macrofracture types that develop on bone tools that have been accidentally dropped and {{those that have been}} used in domestic activities, in this <b>case,</b> <b>hide</b> piercing. Whilst acknowledging that macrofracture analysts should take into account a margin of error when interpreting macrofracture results, our results suggest that the classification criteria for potential bone-tipped hunting weapons be refined to exclude all fractures other than spin-off fractures larger than 6 mm. We concur with other researchers that macrofracture analysis, while constituting a heuristically profitable tool, should be used as part of a multi-analytical approach...|$|E
