5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, <b>cellulase,</b> to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches are {{generally}} omnivorous; the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), for example, feeds {{on a great}} variety of foodstuffs including bread, fruit, leather, starch in book bindings, paper, glue, skin flakes, hair, dead insects and soiled clothing. Many species of cockroach harbor symbiotic protozoans and bacteria in their gut which are able to digest cellulose. In many species, these symbionts may be essential if the insect is to utilize cellulose; however, some species secrete <b>cellulase</b> in their saliva, and the wood-eating cockroach, Panesthia cribrata, is able to survive indefinitely on a diet of crystallized cellulose while being free of micro-organisms.|$|E
5|$|Most {{grasshoppers}} are polyphagous, eating vegetation {{from multiple}} plant sources, {{but some are}} omnivorous and also eat animal tissue and animal faeces. In general their preference is for grasses, including many cereals grown as crops. The digestive system is typical of insects, with Malpighian tubules discharging into the midgut. Carbohydrates are digested mainly in the crop, while proteins are digested in the ceca of the midgut. Saliva is abundant but largely free of enzymes, helping to move food and Malpighian secretions along the gut. Some grasshoppers possess <b>cellulase,</b> which by softening plant cell walls makes plant cell contents accessible to other digestive enzymes.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis feeds {{mainly on}} diatoms living on stones, {{scraping}} biofilms and also consuming detritus. It can also consume Cyanobacteria and green algae as a poor-quality food supply. Cyanobacteria contain toxins and indigestible mucopolysaccharides, and green algae have cellulose in their cell walls (Theodoxus species have no <b>cellulase</b> enzymes to digest cellulose). They also graze on zygotes and germlings of brown alga Fucus vesiculosus, when the alga is small up to 1mm. Peters and Traunspurger (2012) studied {{the effect of}} the grazing of Theodoxus fluviatilis on epilithic meiofauna and algae.|$|E
5|$|The stomach of Artiodactyls {{is divided}} into four sections: the rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum (only {{ruminants}} have a rumen). After the plant material is consumed, it is mixed with saliva in the rumen and reticulum and separates into solid and liquid material. The solids lump {{together to form a}} bolus (or cud), and is regurgitated. When the bolus enters the mouth, the fluid is squeezed out with the tongue and swallowed again. Ingested food passes to the rumen and reticulum where cellulytic microbes (bacteria, protozoa and fungi) produce <b>cellulase,</b> which is needed to break down the cellulose in plants. Perissodactyls, in contrast to the ruminants, store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where it is fermented by bacteria. Carnivora have a simple stomach adapted to digest primarily meat, as compared to the elaborate digestive systems of herbivorous animals, which are necessary to break down tough, complex plant fibers. The caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the large intestine is not sacculated or much wider than the small intestine.|$|E
5|$|Termites are detritivores, {{consuming}} dead {{plants at}} any level of decomposition. They also {{play a vital role}} in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as Trichonympha, in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own <b>cellulase</b> enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.|$|E
25|$|The dictyostelids {{are another}} group {{formerly}} classified among the fungi. They are slime molds that feed as unicellular amoebae, but aggregate into a reproductive stalk and sporangium under certain conditions. Cells of the reproductive stalk, {{as well as}} the spores formed at the apex, possess a cellulose wall. The spore wall has been shown to possess three layers, the middle of which is composed primarily of cellulose, and the innermost is sensitive to <b>cellulase</b> and pronase.|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, <b>cellulase,</b> glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{different}} kinds of cellulases are known, which differ structurally and mechanistically. Synonyms, derivatives, and specific enzymes associated with the name [...] "cellulase" [...] include endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase (beta-1,4-glucanase, beta-1,4-endoglucan hydrolase, endoglucanase D, 1,4-(1,3,1,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase), carboxymethyl <b>cellulase</b> (CMCase), avicelase, celludextrinase, <b>cellulase</b> A, cellulosin AP, alkali <b>cellulase,</b> <b>cellulase</b> A 3, 9.5 <b>cellulase,</b> and pancellase SS. Enzymes that cleave lignin have occasionally been called cellulases, but this old usage is deprecated; they are lignin-modifying enzymes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Cellulase</b> {{action is}} {{considered}} to be synergistic as all three classes of <b>cellulase</b> can yield much more sugar than the addition of all three separately. Aside from ruminants, most animals (including humans) do not produce <b>cellulase</b> in their bodies and can only partially break down cellulose through fermentation, limiting their ability to use energy in fibrous plant material.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Cellulase</b> Unit is {{a unit of}} {{measurement}} for the enzyme <b>Cellulase.</b> One <b>Cellulase</b> Unit (CU) is that activity that will produce a relative fluidity change of one in 5 minutes in a defined carboxymethylcellulose substrate under the conditions of an assay (50 deg Celsius, pH 4.5). Cellulases enzymatically split cellulose {{into a variety of}} hexoses, this is called hydrolysis.|$|E
50|$|Methyl lactate is a colorless clear liquid, {{completely}} miscible {{with water}} and most organic liquids. It is considered as a green solvent as it is easily biodegradable. It is a solvent for nitrocellulose, <b>cellulase</b> acetate, <b>cellulase</b> acetobutyrote and <b>cellulase</b> acetaprapionate. It {{is used in the}} manufacture of lacquers and dopes where it contributes high tolerance for diluents, good flaw and blush resistance.|$|E
50|$|The lower DP cello-oligosaccharides (DP2-6) are {{sufficiently}} {{soluble in water}} to act as viable substrates for <b>cellulase</b> enzymes. However, as these substrates are themselves 'reducing sugars', they are not suitable for use in traditional reducing sugar assays because they generate a high 'blank' value. However their <b>cellulase</b> mediated hydrolysis can be monitored by HPLC or IC methods to gain valuable information on the substrate requirements of a particular <b>cellulase</b> enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Penicillium occitanis is {{a species}} of the genus of Penicillium which {{produces}} <b>cellulase</b> and pectinase. The mutant Pol6 produces a very high amount of <b>cellulase</b> and pectinase. This mutant might be used for industrial use.|$|E
50|$|Demain further {{recalled}} that he “was {{drawn into the}} <b>cellulase</b> area by some comments I was asked to present at a symposium dealing with <b>cellulase</b> of the fungus Trichoderma viride (later Trichoderma reesei),” and his work in this field resulted in the discovery “that the extracellular <b>cellulase</b> of Clostridium thermocellum ATTC 27405 could attack crystalline cellulose,” which was “the first demonstration of a true <b>cellulase</b> produced by a bacterium.” This enzyme later proved to be “useful in the conversion of cellulose to glucose, since it degraded cellobiose, the inhibitor of <b>cellulase</b> action.” An important theory proposed by Demain, which he showed to be valid, was that antibiotics occur in nature and that they help to ensure {{the survival of the}} organisms that produce them. This theory was at odds with the prevailing assumption of the day, namely that antibiotics were laboratory artifacts.|$|E
50|$|Candex {{contains}} the fibre digesting enzymes, <b>cellulase</b> and hemicellulase. The manufacturer claims because yeast cell walls are built mainly of fibre, which is mostly {{made of the}} complex carbohydrate, cellulose, <b>cellulase</b> and hemicellulase are capable of killing yeast.|$|E
50|$|Within {{the above}} types {{there are also}} {{progressive}} (also known as processive) and nonprogressive types.

50|$|A {{viscometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the decrease in viscosity of a solution containing a water-soluble cellulose derivative such as carboxymethyl cellulose upon incubation with a <b>cellulase</b> sample. The decrease in viscosity is directly proportional to the <b>cellulase</b> activity. While such assays are very sensitive and specific for endo-cellulase (exo-acting <b>cellulase</b> enzymes produce little or no change in viscosity), they are limited {{by the fact that it}} is hard to define activity in conventional enzyme units (micromoles of substrate hydrolyzed or product produced per minute).|$|E
50|$|Like most Chaetomium species, C. globosum {{decomposes}} plant cells using hyphal <b>cellulase</b> activity.

They can decay a variety of wood types such as aspen and pine and even change the colour of paper and books. The <b>cellulase</b> activity of C. globosum functions best at temperatures ranging from 25-32 degrees Celsius and is stimulated by nitrogen and biotin. <b>Cellulase</b> is inhibited by ethyl malonate.|$|E

50|$|CMC {{has also}} been used {{extensively}} to characterize enzyme activity from endoglucanases (part of the <b>cellulase</b> complex). CMC is a highly specific substrate for endo-acting cellulases, as its structure has been engineered to decrystallize cellulose and create amorphous sites that are ideal for endoglucanase action. CMC is desirable because the catalysis product (glucose) is easily measured using a reducing sugar assay, such as 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid. Using CMC in enzyme assays is especially important in regard to screening for <b>cellulase</b> enzymes that are needed for more efficient cellulosic ethanol conversion. However, CMC {{has also been}} misused in earlier work with <b>cellulase</b> enzymes, as many had associated whole <b>cellulase</b> activity with CMC hydrolysis. As the mechanism of cellulose depolymerization has become more understood, exocellulases are shown to be dominant in the degradation of crystalline (e.g. Avicel) and not soluble (e.g. CMC) cellulose.|$|E
5000|$|T. reesei is an {{important}} commercial and industrial micro-organism due to its <b>cellulase</b> production ability. Many strains of T. reesei have been developed since its discovery, with heavy emphasis on increasing <b>cellulase</b> production. These [...] "improvement programs" [...] originally consisted of classical (ionising-radiation-based and chemical-based) mutagenesis, which led to strains capable of producing 20 times as much <b>cellulase</b> as the QM6a isolate. The ultimate aim {{in the creation of}} hypercellulolytic strains was to obtain a carbon catabolite derepressed strain. This derepression would allow the T. reesei strain to produce cellulases under any set of growth conditions, even in the presence of glucose.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, {{while many}} {{internet}} sites claim that <b>cellulase</b> enzymes might degrade the chitin found in yeast cell walls, once again no evidence is presented for this. Enzymes {{are known to}} be highly specific and in general cellulases have not been found to be active on chitin. To quote one scientific article: [...] "The purified <b>cellulase</b> was devoid ofchitinase, pectinase and mannanase activities". [...] Moreover, in contrast to the previously mentioned fact that yeast bioengineered to make cellulases remain healthy, when a chitinase gene was bioengineered into the same yeast strain it resulted in complete growth inhibition. This again suggests cellulases do not in general contain significant chitinase activity. Similarly, although many internet sites claim <b>cellulase</b> degrades yeast biofilms, no peer-reviewed scientific evidence was offered in support of this. The exact chemical composition of yeast biofilms remains poorly understood and although there is evidence for it containing many different types of polysaccharides, there was no evidence presented that it contains cellulose or is susceptible to <b>cellulase</b> digest.|$|E
