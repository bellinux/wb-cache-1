2500|$|As was {{explained}} above, already in 1895 Lorentz succeeded in deriving Fresnel's dragging coefficient (to {{first order of}} v/c) and the Fizeau experiment by using the electromagnetic theory {{and the concept of}} local time. After first attempts by Jakob Laub (1907) to create a relativistic [...] "optics of moving bodies", it was Max von Laue (1907) who derived the coefficient for terms of all orders by using the <b>colinear</b> case of the relativistic velocity addition law. In addition, Laue's calculation was much simpler than the complicated methods used by Lorentz.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{an array of}} dipoles {{can be used to}} realize {{substantial}} directivity in a particular horizontal direction. In a broadside array the dipoles can again be arranged <b>colinear</b> (end to end), or side by side, or both. The antennas are then fed in the same phase. This creates greater gain in the direction perpendicular to the antennas, at the expense of most other directions. Unfortunately that also means that the direction opposite the desired direction also has a high gain, whereas high gain is usually desired in one single direction. The power which is wasted in the reverse direction, however, can be recovered using a large planar reflector, as is accomplished in the reflective array antenna, increasing the gain in the desired direction by another 3nbsp&dB ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1851 {{the south}} {{peak of the}} {{mountain}} was selected by Colonel Leander Ransom as the initial point [...] where the Mount Diablo Base and Mount Diablo Meridian lines intersect [...] for cadastral surveys of a large area. [...] Subsequent surveys in much of California, Nevada and Oregon were located with reference to this point. Toll roads up the mountain were created in 1874 by Joseph Seavey Hall and William Camron (sometimes [...] "Cameron"); Hall's Mount Diablo Summit Road was officially opened on May 2, 1874. [...] Camron's [...] "Green Valley" [...] road opened later. [...] Hall also built the 16-room Mountain House Hotel near the junction of the two roads, a mile below the summit (2,500 foot elevation, operated through the 1880s, abandoned 1895, burned c. 1901). As far north as Meridian Road, {{on the outskirts of}} Chico, California, the summit was used as a reference point. The road is <b>colinear</b> with the summit, and is named for the meridian which intersects it.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specific}} and terse location descriptor is always used, {{in which the}} townships and sections are indexed based on (1) the township's position relative to the initial point, (2) the section's location within the designated township, and (3) the principal meridian reference. [...] Township, range, and section are abbreviated as T, R, and S, respectively, and cardinal bearings from the initial point by N, S, E, and W; each principal meridian also has its established abbreviation. [...] Thus, for example, the description [...] "T1SR20E S13 MDM" [...] reads as follows: Township 1 South, Range 20 East, Section 13, Mount Diablo Meridian. [...] That is, the 13th section in the first township south of the baseline (in this case, the Mount Diablo Baseline) and the 20th township east of the principal meridian (the Mount Diablo Meridian). [...] Since township and range lines are six miles apart, the [...] "T1SR20E" [...] part of the designation instantly places the location somewhere between zero and six {{miles south of the}} baseline, and 114 and 120 miles east of the principal meridian. [...] Knowing how sections are numbered within townships, we identify section 13 as therefore occupying the one square mile located 2 to 3 miles south, and 119 to 120 miles east, of the Mount Diablo initial point (in central California). [...] Note that the sections within a township are numbered in an unconventional, Boustrophedon pattern (Fig. 2), in which alternating rows are numbered in opposite directions, starting from section 1 in the northeast corner and ending with section 36 in the southeast corner, as per Figure 2. Therefore, section 13 is adjacent to the eastern range line of the designated township. [...] Numbering in this pattern ensures that numerically sequential sections within the same township are physically adjacent, and share <b>colinear</b> boundaries.|$|E

50|$|The model {{considers}} bonding {{of three}} <b>colinear</b> atoms. For example, in xenon difluoride (XeF2), the linear F&minus;Xe&minus;F unit {{is described by}} a set of three molecular orbitals (MOs) derived from <b>colinear</b> p-orbitals on each atom. The Xe&minus;F bonds result from the combination of a filled p orbital in the central atom (Xe) with two half-filled p orbitals on the axial atoms (F), resulting in a filled bonding orbital, a filled non-bonding orbital, and an empty antibonding orbital. The two lower energy MO's are doubly occupied. The bond order for each Xe-F bonds is 1/2, since the only bonding orbital is delocalized over the two Xe-F bonds.|$|E

50|$|For {{determining}} the instant {{centre of rotation}} of the third element of the linkage, the body BAC, the two points A and B are used because its moving characteristics are known, as derived from {{the information about the}} links P1-A and P2-B. The direction of speed of point A is indicated by vector VA. Its instant centre of rotation must be perpendicular to this vector (as VA is tangentially located on the circumference of a circle). The only line that fills the requirement is a line <b>colinear</b> with link P1-A. Somewhere on this line there is a point P, the instant centre of rotation for the body BAC. What applies to point A also applies to point B, therefore this instant centre of rotation P is located on a line perpendicular to vector VB, a line <b>colinear</b> with link P2-B. Therefore, the instant centre of rotation P of body BAC is the point where the lines through P1-A and P2-B cross.|$|E
