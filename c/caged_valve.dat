40|$|AbstractMore than 300 {{epicardial}} Doppler color flow mapping {{studies on}} 23 {{different types of}} clinical and preclinical valves were performed after implantation in the mitral position in sheep. The transducers were placed directly on the heart to obtain the greatest possible resolution. Studies were performed in each animal under different hemodynamic conditions by varying heart rate and cardiac output. Eighty-six valves were studied late (20 to 52 weeks), whereas the remainder were studied early (0 to 10 days) after operation. The valves included 3 types of ball and <b>cage</b> <b>valves,</b> 3 types of disc and <b>cage</b> <b>valves,</b> 7 types of tilting disc valves, 1 type of bileaflet hemidisc mechanical valve, 13 types of porcine aortic valves and 5 types of bovine pericardial valves. The results of these studies were compared with those obtained in 40 studies of 20 native mitral valves. Doppler color velocity/flow profiles were imaged in real time with simultaneous electrocardiographic gating; the aortic flow was also displayed for the timing of velocity/flow events. Native normal mitral valves had no in-orifice flow disturbances and laminar low velocity/flow directed toward the left ventricular apex. Ball and cage and disc and <b>cage</b> <b>valves</b> had high velocity peripheral jets and vortices of velocity/flow reversals distal to the occluders. Tilting disc valves had differing velocity/flow patterns determined by their orientation in the mitral anulus. Bileaflet hemidisc valves had three jets, which decayed 1. 5 cm downstream. Porcine aortic and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves had high velocity, turbulent, nonaxisymmetric jets (more severe for the latter). These observations are similar and complementary to those obtained by in vitro flow visualization techniques and those obtained by laser Doppler anemometry. As such, they provide an important interface between the in vitro assessment of prosthetic valve function and the clinical utility of Doppler color velocity flow imaging technology...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} for simultaneous estimation of multiphase flow rate and stream composition {{has been developed}} to be applied in a multiple restriction assembly composed of two orifice meters and a <b>cage</b> trim <b>valve.</b> These differential pressure elements are typical instrument installed in the wellhead of production wells in Urucu field (Petrobras/Brazil). To deliver composition and rates four steps were done: 1) a multi-rate well test - an experimental procedure carried out in real operation conditions. 2) modeling of multiphase flow expansion process through <b>cage</b> trim <b>valves.</b> 3) performance and validation of multiphase flow through orifice plate meters {{by the use of}} homogeneous and slip models. 4) tuning and metering procedures for coupling the valve and orifice plate models. The last investigation developed a full field production optimization procedure honouring pressure and routing constraints to be applied in multiple wells. Essentially, the research performed in this thesis is an experimental work followed by numerical modeling. Model errors and performance validation were calculated on the basis of measured data from a multi-rate well test. This field scale experiment consisted in a sequential step response test followed by a transient and a steady state period “a priori” to each next step. Three wells named Well 1, Well 2 and Well 3 were single routed to a test separator. Two types of well performance were investigated: 1) production with stream composition variation caused by gas/water coning. 2) production with steady state composition. Eight wellhead variables were monitored: two orifice plate differential pressures, the differential pressure and temperature through the <b>cage</b> <b>valve,</b> the downstream choke pressure, the wellhead pressure and temperature and the gathering system temperature. The field scale experiments generated a database composed by 1781 test points, averaged in 30 minutes interval.

40|$|A {{cause of}} early death after aortic valve {{replacement}} with a caged-ball prosthesis is obstruction to left ven-tricular outflow because the prosthesis {{is too large}} for the aortic root. Of 68 patients dying within two months of aortic valve replacement, death in ten, each of whom had had intractable low cardiac output after operation, was attributed at necropsy to prosthetic aortic stenosis, despite the use of small sized (8 A Starr-Edwards) prostheses in seven of them. The diameters of the aorta at the sinotubular junction, determined from the preoperative cineangiograms, in the seven patients with prosthetic stenosis were 30 in all but one, and the poppet clearances ranged from 12 to 19 mm (avg. 15). Thus, prosthetic aortic stenosis is likely to develop after aortic valve replacement with rigid-framed <b>caged</b> ball <b>valves</b> if the preoperative aortograms disclose aortic diameters at the sinotubular junctions to be < 30 mm.

2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow.

In 2007, we noted an increase in both flooding and cases of clinical dehydration in our mouse population. Using manufacturer's specifications for a water flow rate of 25 to 50 mL/min, we initiated a wide-scale screening of all valves used. During a 4 -mo period, approximately 17, 000 valves were assessed, of which 2200 failed according to scoring criteria (12. 9 % overall; 7. 2 % low flow; 1. 6 % no flow; 4. 1 % leaky). Factors leading to valve failures included residual metal shavings, silicone flash, introduced debris or bedding, and (most common) distortion of the autoclave-rated internal diaphragm and O-ring. Further evaluation revealed that despite normal autoclave conditions of heat, pressure, and steam, an extreme negative vacuum pull caused the valves’ internal silicone components (diaphragm and O-ring) to become distorted and water-permeable. Normal flow rate often returned after a ‘drying out’ period, but components then reabsorbed water while on the animal rack or during subsequent autoclave cycles to revert to a variable flow condition. On the basis of our findings, we recalibrated autoclaves and initiated a preventative maintenance program to mitigate the risk of future valve failure...|$|R

Two failed valves, one apparently unfailed but defective valve, and one unused valve, were examined by scanning electron microscopy and metallographic section. In the first two valves (removed 12 and 23 months after implantation) fracture {{was associated with the}} welds joining the short strut to the valve ring. The fracture surfaces in all cases were heavily faceted and showed branching cracks. Extensive wear had occurred on one fracture surface in the first case, suggesting that one leg of the short strut had failed before the other, though this had been clinically undetectable. The third valve was removed owing to failure of the suturing (24 months after implantation) but one leg of the short strut was found to be completely fractured. The other leg showed extensive cracking and porosity in the weld region. A metallographic section taken through the weld region of the fourth (unused) valve illustrated several sizable defects directly attributable to the welding process.

40|$|Cavitation is a harmful {{phenomenon}} {{for control}} valves. Starting from noise and vibration, cavitation can bring erosion and pitting of mechanical parts.

40|$|The first {{surgical}} {{heart valve}} replacement was undertaken {{over half a}} century ago since when there has been a continuing quest to develop a prosthesis with the perfect combination of durability, haem-atological compatibility and haemo-dynamic performance. Early <b>caged</b> ball mechanical <b>valves</b> were robust but asso-ciated with red cell trauma and rapidly fol-lowed by introduction of mono-leaflet and bi-leaflet designs which remain in use today. Introduced later in the 1960 s, bio-prosthetic valves consisting of pericardial or valve tissue mounted on a frame and sewing ring were initially conceived for use in elderly patients unlikely to outlive the valve, or in other patients at risk of bleeding complications associated with anticoagulation. Until recently, mechanical valves have remained the logical choice in patients < 65 years of age given the minimal rates of primary valve failure. 1 However, advances in the longevity and haemodynamic performance of modern bioprostheses and the emerging potential for transcatheter treatment when they degenerate seem set to challenge this paradigm. 2 Stentless bioprosthetic valves offer the potential for (A) further improvements in the flow dynamics of cardiac output and consequent haemodynamic performance, (B) remodelling and dynamic adaptation to the anatomy of the aortic root with resulting progressive increase in the effect-ive orifice area, and (C) enhanced regres-sion of left ventricular hypertrophy with improved clinical outcomes. Although initial comparative studies demonstrated superior haemodynamics, prospective randomised controlled trials against modern stented bioprosthetic valves with lower profile frames, thinner sewing rings and excellent haemodynamic characteris-tics 3 have shown no major differences in clinical and echocardiographic endpoints at 1 -year follow up. ...|$|R
40|$|Globe valves {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} types of valve used for {{throttling}} applications for all sizes due to better controllability and wider range. One of the major limitations associated with the use globe valves in liquid application is cavitation and it takes place both in part open and in fully open conditions due to varied reasons. There are different designs of globe valves available but for control <b>valve</b> applications, <b>cage</b> and plug designs are widely employed. Cage and plug design consists of body, <b>valve</b> <b>cage,</b> plug and an actuating mechanism. Actuating mechanism is connected to the valve plug which is a moving part, through valve shaft. There are many investigations reported about the flow visualization and numerical simulation of normal type globe valves. But study on <b>valves</b> with <b>cage</b> and plug design are not reported in detail. The objective of the present study is to provide a three dimensional analysis of flow through a globe <b>valve</b> with <b>cage</b> and plug design with emphasis on the inception and development of cavitation in detail. Cavitation reduction is achieved by breaking the flow in the form of more than one liquid jet, thereby increasing the turbulence inside the valve flow path. The numerical simulation was done using GAMBIT to set up geometry and grid and FLUENT to solve difference equation postulated from the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid in motion. The k-epsilon model was used for turbulence. Results of five configurations of the cage with constant flow areas and valve stroke are presented in this paper. The numerical results were verified with an experimental program employing total flow measurement and pressure drop created by the valve at full opening. The study was conducted for different jet configurations to generalize the results of the study. Experimental validation was done in the water test facility with an operating pressure of 1. 6 MPa and flow rate of 0. 05 m 3 /s.

In the project, the failure steel seal ring is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel seal ring used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy seal ring was compared with the failed seal ring. The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used seal ring, along with smaller grain size than the new seal ring. To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used seal ring. At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used seal ring were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the seal ring failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the seal ring failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used seal ring decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used seal ring. The applied load lead to seal ring failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale. These changes of microscopic structure ultimately reflected in critical plastic deformation of used seal ring...|$|R

To this end, a multi-rate test was implemented in two production wells routed individually to a test separator in field operational conditions.

The ranges of fluid properties and flow conditions achieved during the experiment were: wellhead pressure from 9073 kPa to 13, 278 kPa, wellhead temperature from 47. 8 C to 53. 5 C, downstream choke pressure from 6770 kPa to 7913 kPa, downstream choke temperature from 41. 6 C to 49. 1 C, gas–oilratio from 1144 Sm 3 =Sm 3 to 2068 Sm 3 =Sm 3, water-cut from 4. 64 % to 58. 35 %, standard oil specific gravity from 0. 7988 to 0. 8058, standard gas specific gravity from 0. 7340 to 0. 7550, standard oil flow rate from 46 : 86 Sm 3 =d to 266 : 65 Sm 3 =d, standard gas flow rate from 62 : 68 103 Sm 3 =d to 296 : 65 103 Sm 3 =d, standard water flow rate from 18 : 06 m 3 =d to 159 : 33 m 3 =d. The wells tested showed a different dynamic behavior: while well # 2 did not vary significantly the stream composition with flow rate, well # 1 produced under gas coning, a near well-reservoir phenomenon that governs {{the contribution of the}} reservoir gas-cap to the total stream composition. The multi-rate tests generated two data sets with 1424 flow conditions through two flange-tap orifice plates installed upstream (wellhead) and downstream of a <b>cage</b> choke <b>valve.</b> The ranges of orifice variables were: orifice diameter from 0. 03479 m to 0. 0430 m, beta factor from 0. 4946 to 0. 6507, differential pressure from 15 kPa to 187 kPa. The virtual metering system presented in Paz et al. (2010) was used to correlate the experimental data. The associated model, suitable for differential pressure measuring devices, includes effects such as flow concentration and slip (through Chisholm’s correlation), generalizing the mass flow rate versus pressure drop relationship for multiphase flow. The total mass flow rate depends on a set of variables evaluated at metering conditions: density and viscosity of the liquid and gas phase, mass quality, pressure drop across the flow meter and geometry (contraction area and beta factor). The determination of the fluid properties at metering conditions was made by using black-oil correlations. These correlations are based on a set of input variables at standard condition that characterizes the stream composition such as gas–oil ratio, water–oil ratio and specific gravities of each phase. A comparison was made between the multiphase flow rates predicted by the model and the ones simultaneously measured at the test separators. The oil, gas and water standard volumetric flow rate deviations (coefficients of variation of the root mean square deviations) were below 3 : 52 %. It was theoretically demonstrated and experimentally verified that a systematic error exists when the homogeneous model (equal phase velocities) is considered in the formulation, resulting in a flow rate underestimation. When the homogeneous model was used to correlate the data, this effect increased the deviation up to 10 : 5 %. Flow pattern at the wellhead was characterized as intermittent and annular-mist. Lockhart–Martinelli parameter varied from 0. 362 to 0. 836; despite of the experimental data being beyond the wet gas region, the multi-rate tests showed that Chisholm’s over-reading can be successfully extrapolated to these rang...|$|R

After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
