500|$|Sally Hemings' {{documented}} duties at Monticello included being a nursemaid-companion, lady's maid, chambermaid, and seamstress. It is {{not known}} whether she was literate, and she left no known writings. She was described as very fair, with [...] "straight hair down her back". Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, described her as [...] "light colored and decidedly good looking". As an adult, she may have lived in a room in Monticello's [...] "South Dependencies", a wing of the mansion accessible to the main house through a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{limestone}} {{building has}} slate and lead roofs above the attics. The two-storey west front, {{which was built}} in the 1690s, has three bays of each side of the central doorway, which has Doric columns, with smaller pavilions at the ends of the wings. One of the wings creates a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> to the church of St Peter. The east front, which was added around 1704, has shallow projecting wings and a central door under a balustrade with an Italianate double staircase leading down to the lawns. A central pedestal is inscribed [...] "virtute et veritate". Above it is an eagle statue, carved by John Harvey of Bath, representing the family crest of the Blathwayt family.|$|E
500|$|At {{the centre}} of the new castle was a {{circular}} keep, with three ovoid towers and bastions around it on the north-west, north-east and south sides, and a gatehouse to the north. These were surrounded by two curtain walls, forming a triangular inner and outer ward. Covered stone passageways, three storeys high, linked the towers, the keep and the gatehouse. The outer ward was grassed over, with a stone cesspool {{by the side of the}} north-east tower, linked by sewers to the inside of the castle. The castle was entered through a doorway in the rear of the gatehouse, originally called the [...] "Half Moon", linked by a stairway in the <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> to the keep. There were four tiers of guns in the finished castle, from the ground level up to the roof of the keep, and a total of 142 firing points for cannon and handguns; their design closely resembling those at nearby Walmer and Deal castles.|$|E
50|$|The school {{consists}} of three buildings, connected by <b>covered</b> <b>passageways.</b> The main building, underneath the tsunami shelter, has 23 classrooms and houses the administrative offices and gym.|$|R
50|$|Carrier Hall was one {{of several}} {{buildings}} which students plundered for riot material in 1962. Branching off from the two-story main section is a rear section connected by two <b>covered</b> <b>passageways.</b> This section also contains two stories and is slightly inset and setback from the main section.|$|R
50|$|The 1812 Fire of Moscow {{reduced the}} monastery to ashes. The nunnery was closed {{down and the}} grounds stood empty until the 1860s, when Mikhail Bykovsky {{designed}} a new monastery compound. The domed katholikon, loosely based on Brunelleschi's works, is connected by <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> to other buildings. The grounds are thus divided into four lots.|$|R
2500|$|Dinas Brân is {{basically}} a rectangular castle with the longer sides running east-west. Beyond the northern wall the steep natural slope falls sharply several hundred feet whilst the southern and eastern walls are defended by a 20 feet deep ditch. At the south eastern corner where the ditch is at its deepest stands the Keep which looks out onto a relatively easy approach to the castle from the River Dee. The two-storey Keep {{would have been the}} strongest part of the castle with its own defended approach through a narrow passage. Next to the Keep at the north eastern corner is the gatehouse which was originally approached by a wooden bridge spanning the ditch. There is however almost no evidence remaining of the bridge and its supporting structure so that the exact configuration remains unclear. The bridge was also overlooked by the Keep which allowed archers stationed there to guard the entrance. The Gatehouse had two towers either side of a decorated <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> into the castle courtyard.|$|E
2500|$|Tomb of Salim Chishti: A {{white marble}} encased {{tomb of the}} Sufi saint, Salim Chisti(1478–1572), within the Jama Masjid's sahn, courtyard. The {{single-storey}} structure is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with mother-of-pearl mosaic. Surrounding it is a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> for circumambulation, with carved Jalis, stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier mausolea of the early 15th century Gujarat Sultanate period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine brackets, which support sloping eaves around the parapet. [...] On {{the left of the}} tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of Islam Khan I, son of Shaikh Badruddin Chisti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general in the Mughal army in the reign of Jahangir. The tomb is topped by a dome and thirty-six small domed chattris and contains a number of graves, some unnamed, all male descendants of Shaikh Salim Chisti.|$|E

50|$|The palace {{takes its}} present name from Pyotr Kharitonov, Rastorguyev's son-in-law. He {{inherited}} {{the property in}} 1824 and employed architect Mikhail Pavlovich Malakhov to connect the buildings {{with a series of}} <b>covered</b> <b>passageways.</b> An English park on the grounds was also commissioned by Kharitonov. His harsh treatment of the serfs gave rise to a bevy of legends about a network of underground chambers and passages where his peasants were tortured.|$|R
50|$|The new Nursing Home {{was blessed}} by the Most Reverend James Cuskelly, Auxiliary Bishop of Brisbane and opened by Senator, The Hon. Don Grimes, Minister for Social Security, on Sunday 17 June 1984. The new complex {{connected}} to the old building via <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> and provided four 4-bed wards, seven 2-bed wards and five single rooms. Work on renovation of the old building commenced in February 1985 and comprised the construction of 42 single rooms with ensuites.|$|R
50|$|Elawa Farm, Lake Forest, Illinois, Neo-Georgian farm {{complex for}} A. Watson Armour, 1917, {{built as a}} weekend house Armour, an heir of the Armour and Company meatpacking fortune, lived on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. The {{projected}} main house, designed by David Adler in neo-Georgian style, to which the farm group was expressly suited, was never built; instead paired gatehouses were linked to the farm group by extensive gardens. Low eaved pitched roofs and linking <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> characterize Hopkins' symmetrically-massed brick farm group at Elawa Farms.|$|R

5000|$|The Shan State Museum holds two of {{his classic}} works: [...] "The Hopong Springs" [...] and [...] "The Stately Procession of the Hpaung-Daw-Oo Buddha Images". The National Museum in Yangon {{displays}} other masterpieces including [...] "the Isle of Myeik", [...] "Scenic Ranaung", [...] "The Inlay Floating Bazaar", [...] "Scenic Environs of Dawei", [...] "Maungmagan" [...] and [...] "Some of our Ethnic Brethren". His last work {{was a series of}} scenes from the Jatakas for the [...] "Shwe Mokhti" [...] pagoda in Dawei, where they hang in the <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> to the pagoda.|$|R
5|$|The project {{lowered the}} height of the castle considerably, {{destroying}} much of the fortification in the process. The upper storeys of the keep, the towers, the <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> and the gatehouse were all demolished, along with some of the buildings in the inner ward. The resulting rubble was used to backfill the outer ward, raising its height and effectively turning the inner ward into a dry moat. The inner curtain wall was reduced to one storey in height, and the outer curtain wall was refaced. An esplanade and wall-walk were built around the remaining outer walls, which supported at least eight gun emplacements.|$|R
5000|$|Built {{on a plane}} arc of a circle, {{the three}} main streets (Amaury de Sévérac, Duke of Arpajon, Belvezet) radiate around the Place de la Fontaine. They open on other streets and carayrolles, lanes {{sometimes}} appointed stairs due to the terrain, under houses, <b>covered</b> <b>passageways,</b> vaulted or not. [...] Divided into 6 districts, artisans and merchants thrived in these walls and, in particular, the weavers who made cadis, quite thick woolen and uncombed for making, among other things, military clothing. Sheets and paintings were also manufactured and sold in the city, with convoys of saddles animals {{in the south of}} France and to Genoa in Italy.|$|R
50|$|A sixteen-foot <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> {{connected}} the tower {{to the two}} story keeper’s dwelling, allowing for extra protection when the keepers {{would go to the}} tower in harsh weather. A full cellar was built under the house, and here the keepers would store personal items as well as oil for the lamp.|$|E
50|$|The toilets {{are located}} {{out of view}} behind {{concrete}} walls at each end. The central area is open for bathing. For Karen culture the bathing area is partly privatized, this is achieved by the slanting bamboo facade, obstructing the view into the building. The facade also creates a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> linking the two functions together.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the term}} {{referred}} to a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> that traversed the ditch outside the curtain of a fortress. Fire from this point could cover the ditch between the ravelin and the curtain wall to deter any attempt to storm the wall. Thus the passageway was equipped with musket ports and cannon ports that fired along the ditch.|$|E
5000|$|The {{buildings}} on the knoll were built in 1839 and comprised a large three-story central building with columns and two wings. The wings, with 33 rooms each, were separated by 20 feet from the main building and connected to it via two-story <b>covered</b> <b>passageways.</b> The central building housed classrooms, offices, staff apartments, and dining facilities, a library and reading room on the second floor, and a large room {{on the third floor}} which might serve as a chapel, while the other two buildings served as separate male and female dormitories. The two-mile-long Lake Moswansicut could be seen from the third-floor chapel. The buildings were designed by Russell Warren, the leading Greek Revival architect in New England in the 20th century, ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{appearance}} of the neighborhood is heavily influenced by the central role that Lyon played in silk industry. The vast majority of buildings in the area feature large vaulted ceilings with exposed wooden rafters. The larger internal height available in these buildings, compared to other areas in Lyon, was necessary to house the tall silk looms that were operated in the area.Of note, also, are the traboules of Croix-Rousse. These are <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> used by silk merchants to travel and ferry material between buildings while being sheltered from rain.It has since been subject to gentrification, and now exhibits a vibrant cultural scene. La Croix-Rousse has always possessed a unique atmosphere compared {{to the rest of}} the city. As an illustration, some inhabitants call themselves [...] "Croix-roussiens" [...] (Croix-Roussians).|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} built to allow a direct {{connection}} between the Astram Line and the Sanyo Main Line. Initial plans were to have a circular shell <b>cover</b> the entire <b>passageway</b> connecting the Astram Line and JR West stations. The contract for design was awarded to C+A Coelacanth and Associates in 2012, with a planned opening sometime in 2014. However, structural concerns caused the opening to be delayed by one year, and caused the circular shell to be cut back so it no longer <b>covered</b> the <b>passageway.</b> The station opened on March 14, 2015. [...] A green roof was later installed in the passageway sometime during 2015.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Ducal Burial Vault (Russian: Великокняжеская усыпальница) is the {{purpose-built}} mausoleum of the Grand Dukes and Duchesses of Russia in the Peter and Paul Fortress. The Neo-Baroque domed {{structure is}} frequently {{mistaken for a}} part of the Peter and Paul Cathedral due to architectural similarities. A <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> leads from the mausoleum to the cathedral, where the Russian emperors and empresses lie in state.|$|E
50|$|The Sacristy was {{connected}} to the church by a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway,</b> probably to provide shelter for the Vicars Choral as they processed to their midnight offices in the church. The passageway was subsequently demolished, and the present Princess Street now cuts across its path. Although alterations have occurred over the years, much of the building dates back to {{the last quarter of the}} fifteenth century.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{section of}} the hotel, built as a prominent demonstration of confidence in Cleveland's future development, {{appears to have been}} erected by 1852, but appears to have remained unoccupied for several years. Known colloquially as Bigge's Folly, and formally as Cleveland House, it contained two sitting rooms and five bedrooms with a kitchen and servants' rooms connected via a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway.</b> The core was surrounded by a 3 metres wide verandah.|$|E
5|$|Improvements {{were carried}} out between 1852 and 1856 {{at a cost of}} over £6,725. The keep was adapted to support 32-pounder (14.5kg) guns, the seaward-facing bastions and curtain walls were {{reinforced}} with brick casemates and new gun positions, and the moat was deepened to protect against any surprise attack. Two batteries were built to the west and east of the castle, protected by shingle and earth and linked to the old castle by <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> called caponiers; a defensible barrack block was built beside the western battery, to provide further protection against any attack from the land. The result was that Hurst was re-established as a powerful fortification, equipped with fourteen 32-pounder guns, fifteen 8-inch (203mm) shell guns and two 32-pounder carronades; in wartime, these required a team of 440 men, with a peacetime garrison of 105 soldiers. Fort Albert was built across the water on the Isle of Wight to provide supporting fire. The old inn was first reused as the garrison canteen and then demolished.|$|R
50|$|Rev. F.D. Newham {{founded the}} English School, {{under the control}} {{and support of the}} British {{administration}} in 1900. George Jeffery designed a building complex, which was later called the Wolseley Barracks. The general outline of the original design consisted of three blocks, arranged symmetrically, surrounding a courtyard where the entrance was provided by a small, but rusticated guardhouse. The wide arch of the entrance gate recalls the Girls' Schools' arcade. The lower, <b>covered</b> <b>passageways</b> gave access to the connection between the two-floor blocks. The central block with a pitched roof had a lantern above the entrance, strengthened by a projected gate, by a rusticated arch and a terrace surrounded by a balustrade over the entrance. Classrooms were arranged on the corridors, as to be oriented inwards, towards the inner courtyard. Jeffery's design followed a simplified Neo-Classical style amalgamated with colonial architecture. Pilasters with Doric capitals on the ground floor the wide arch, yellow sandstone, rustication at the ground floor, passageways enriched with pointed arches, the wooden Iattice girders peculiar to the Cypriot colonial architecture and quoin at comer were among the architectural details.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>covered</b> alley or <b>passageway,</b> {{often with}} shops, {{may be called}} an arcade. The origin of the word alley is late Middle English, from alee [...] "walking or passage", from [...] "go", from ambulare [...] "to walk".|$|R
50|$|The Gothic-style barbican, {{built around}} 1498, {{is one of}} only three such {{fortified}} outposts still surviving in Europe, and the best preserved. It is a moated cylindrical brick structure with an inner courtyard 24.4 meters in diameter, and seven turrets. Its 3-meter-thick walls hold 130 embrasures. The barbican was originally linked to the city walls by a <b>covered</b> <b>passageway</b> that led through St. Florian's Gate and served as a checkpoint for all who entered the city.|$|E
5000|$|Sally Hemings' {{documented}} duties at Monticello included being a nursemaid-companion, lady's maid, chambermaid, and seamstress. It is {{not known}} whether she was literate, and she left no known writings. She was described as very fair, with [...] "straight hair down her back". Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, described her as [...] "light colored and decidedly good looking".

A cobbled courtyard surrounded the keep, separating it from the external defences, and containing a well in the north-west corner. Underground passageways led from the entrance bastion to outside the castle walls, either to allow the garrison to escape in an emergency or to assault a besieging force.|$|R
5000|$|In Ancient Roman {{architecture}} a cryptoporticus (from Latin crypta and porticus) is a <b>covered</b> corridor or <b>passageway.</b> The usual English is [...] "cryptoportico".

A lanai may also be a <b>covered</b> exterior <b>passageway.</b> Disney animator Dorse Lanpher (1935-2011) notes in his memoirs the large covered lanais on the ocean side of his Honolulu hospital. Today, air-conditioned buildings such as hotels often offer [...] "enclosed" [...] rather than [...] "open" [...] lanais, sometimes meaning a large dining hall with a 'wall' of sliding glass doors.|$|R
