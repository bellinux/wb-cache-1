50|$|This <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> {{management}} involves redefining pricing {{strategy and}} developing disciplined pricing tactics. The key objective of a pricing strategy is anticipating the value created for customers and then setting specific prices to capture that value. A company {{may decide to}} price against their competitors or even their own products, but the most value comes from pricing strategies that closely follow market conditions and demand, especially at a segment level. Once a pricing strategy dictates what a company wants to do, pricing tactics determine how a company actually captures the value. Tactics involve creating pricing tools that change dynamically, in order to react to changes and continually capture value and gain revenue. Price Optimization, for example, involves constantly optimizing multiple variables such as price sensitivity, price ratios, and inventory to maximize revenues. A successful pricing strategy, supported by analytically-based pricing tactics, can drastically improve a firm's profitability.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{policy goals}} {{frequently}} depend upon investment in particular technologies, or categories of technology. Whilst the British government has often espoused {{the virtues of}} technological neutrality, UK policies now seek to promote nuclear power, coal with CO 2 capture and storage, and renewable energy. Policy decisions are often informed by estimates of cost per unit of output (for example, Â£/MWh), also known as levelised costs. Estimates of these costs for different technologies are often used to provide a 'ballpark' guide to the levels of financial support needed (if any) to encourage uptake, or direct investment away from the technologies the market might otherwise have chosen. Levelised cost estimates can also help to indicate the cost of meeting public policy objectives, and {{whether there is a}} rationale for intervention (for example, based on net welfare gains). In the UK electricity sector, investment is undertaken by private companies, not governments. Investment is driven by expected returns, in the light of a range of risks related to both costs and revenues. Revenue risks are not captured in estimates of cost or cost-related risks. An important <b>category</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> risk is associated with electricity price fluctuations. Exposure to price risks differs by technology. Low electricity prices represent a revenue risk to technologies that cannot influence electricity prices. By contrast, 'price makers' that set marginal prices are, to an extent, able to pass fuel price increases through to consumers. They have an inherent 'hedge' against fuel and electricity price fluctuations. Based on recent research by the UK Energy Research Centre, this paper considers the implications of such price risks for policy design. The authors contrast the range of levelised costs estimated for different generating options with the spread of returns each is exposed to when electricity price fluctuations are factored in. Drawing on recent policy experiences in the renewable energy arena, in the UK and elsewhere, the authors provide an assessment of investment risk in policy effectiveness and consider how policy design can increase or ameliorate price risk. They discuss the circumstances under which policy goals might be best served by 'socialising' price risk, through fixed price policies. The importance of increased and explicit attention to revenue risk in policymaking is discussed, along with the means by which this might be achieved.

40|$|The major {{intent of}} the {{investigation}} {{was to determine the}} existing level of cost differentials for selected education program categories in the state <b>of</b> Indiana. The <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> prekindergarten and kindergarten, grades one through six, grades seven through-twelve, mentally handicapped, physically handicapped, compensatory and vocational education were selected as program categories for study. Secondary concerns were to describe the patterns of 1971 - 72 public school funding for the state of Indiana by government level and to recommend a new concept for distribution of state funds to Indiana local schools based on the developed program cost differentials. Sources <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> were taken from Report of Statistical Information for Indiana School Corporations 1971 - 72 School Year for the 1967 - 68, 1968 - 69, 1969 - 70, 1970 - 71, 1971 - 72 school years. Percentages as to major <b>categories</b> <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> were computed for the above years. The Education Cost Differential Basic Data Instrument was developed for collecting data to achieve the major purpose of the study. Seventy-four Indiana school corporations were sampled from a population of all Indiana reorganized school corporations which had grade organizational patterns of 6 - 6, 6 - 2 - 4, or 6 - 3 - 3 for the school year 1971 - 72. Eighteen responded with timely usable data. State cost differentials for each program were computed by dividing reported net current operating expenditures for each program area by total full time equivalent pupils in ADM for the program. State cost differentials were computed by dividing the average cost per full time equivalent pupil in ADM for each program by the cost per pupil for the basic program, grades one through six. Conclusions of the study included: 1. The major fiscal support for public school corporations in Indiana is provided from localsources. 2. Percentage <b>of</b> the total <b>revenue</b> from local sources has constantly increased for the public school systems from July 1, 1967 through June 30, 1972. 3. The Indiana General Assembly has not provided fiscal support commensurate with the rising costs of public education. 4. Federal support as a percentage of total fiscal support of public education in Indiana is below the national average. 5. Elementary programs, grades one through six, have the lowest net current operating expenditure and were assigned a cost differential index of 1. 000. 6. Secondary programs, grades seven through twelve, represent the second lowest net current operating expenditure with a cost differential index of 1. 095. 7, The cost differential index for vocational education programs is 1. 256. 8. Prekindergarten and kindergarten have a cost differential index of 1. 271. 9. The cost differential index for compensatory education is 1. 633. 10. Mentally handicapped programs have a computed cost differential index of 2. 559. 11. The cost differential index for physically handicapped programs is 2, 821. In comparing Indiana cost differential indices with cost differential indices developed in similar studies but different populations, the vocational index of 1. 256 is indefensibly lower and, therefore, questioned. Only five of the 18 respondents supplying data may account for the variation. The Indiana General Assembly should enact legislation which would provide a distribution formula for state aid to local school districts which weights per pupil allocations based upon program cost indices. The weighted pupil concept could be effectively employed to determine state allocations by multiplying the number of weighted pupils in ADM by a uniform dollar allotment for pupils with an index of 1. 000. The cost of the state guaranteed program, to avoid built-in inequities, should be defined as net current operating expenditures. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

To identify this channel I model fragmentation of …scal power in a political agency setup with legislative bargaining. First, legislators lack common pool incentives when bene…ts cannot be targeted. Second, fragmentation of agenda power in the legislature weakens voters’control over agenda setters by reducing the value of their o ¢ ce –weak external accountability.

In 2004, the top four commodity <b>categories</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>revenue</b> per carload averaged $ 2, 971 per carload compared to an average of $ 770 for intermodal carloads. The high potential profitability of carload traffic suggests that railroads should try to further grow this segment of traffic, especially in an era of limited railway capacity. To do this, they must meet the increasing logistical needs of their customers by providing more consistent, reliable service than has previously been the case for carload traffic. The classification terminal is a key determinant in the service reliability of manifest freight. Terminal performance also impacts network efficiency. A regression analysis for six Class I railroads showed a statistically significant relationship between average system-wide terminal dwell and average manifest train speed. As average dwell time increased, average manifest train speed decreased. The R 2 values ranged from 20. 7 % to 34. 7 %.

The industry, {{which is}} lead by Zespri Group Limited, the {{statutory}} monopoly for the country's kiwifruit export, {{is the second}} most important producer of kiwifruit in the world. In a relative stable world kiwifruit industry, New Zealand has enjoyed buoyant returns in the last seasons. However, it is starting to feel the pressures for consolidation and globalisation, as well as other opportunities and threats. This situation is forcing kiwifruit service providers to plan strategically for the future and change. In this context, Satara Co-operative Group Limited came to life in June 2002, as one of the biggest post harvest operators in the industry, controlling 16. 5 % and 10 % of kiwifruit and avocado volumes, respectively. However, although the hybrid cooperative started after a merger with a new strong corporate identity, it had neither a complete strategic analysis nor a written strategic plan to follow. Separately, a strategic management implementation tool called the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has had worldwide acceptance and success in the last 10 years. In light of Satara's current strategic circumstances, the tool arises as a feasible and timely strategic solution for the organization. This research investigated whether Satara Co-op Ltd has a competitive advantage in the New Zealand kiwifruit industry through a complete strategic analysis. The research also studied whether the organization's competitive strategics could be implemented through the Balanced Scorecard framework. The research was based on the case study methodology that used extensive secondary data research, personal interviews and visits to relevant industry stakeholders, including: Zespri Group Ltd, Seeka Kiwifruit Industries, New Zealand Fruit Growers Federation, Aongatete Packhouses, Trevelyans Packhouses, and New Zealand Avocado Industry Council, amongst others, as well as in depth interviews to Satara Co-op Ltd executive and managerial positions. The case study data was analysed using pattern matching and explanation building. The results showed that {{it was not possible to}} conclude based on tangible data whether Satara Co-op Ltd had a competitive advantage. However, when available tangible data was added to intangibles and stakeholder's statements about the organization, along with the application of the SELECT framework, it was possible to determine that Satara's competitive advantage was based in its cooperative structure, scale and geographic diversity as well as its future diversification capabilities under different scenarios. The case study results also acknowledged that Satara Co-op Ltd strategies could be implemented through the Balanced Scorecard framework, as its strategies and available information allow the implementation of the framework building blocks, which are objectives, measures, targets and initiatives in four perspectives, namely financial, customer, internal processes and learning and growth.
