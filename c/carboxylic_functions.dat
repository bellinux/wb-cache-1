These deposits are detrimental to oil production and therefore the knowledge of Arn and its properties is of paramount importance. In this report Isothermal Titration Calorimetry was used to better understand interaction of Arn with asphaltenes. The study was held under three main topics:&# 173;	The aggregation of Arn in organic solvents;&# 173;	The interaction of Arn and asphaltenes;&# 173;	The interaction of Arn and asphaltene fractions. Fractionation was carried out using silica particles. Arn molecules interact in organic solvents, and the data obtained were consistent with a dimer model.

Cetirizine and levocetirizine were 600 -fold more selective for H 1 receptors {{compared with a}} panel of receptors and channels. Binding {{results indicated that the}} interaction between cetirizine, its enantiomers, and histamine is compatible with a competitive behavior, in contrast with the noncompetitive profile of cetirizine and levocetirizine observed in isolated organs. Binding kinetics provided a suitable explanation for this observation, because levocetirizine dissociated from H 1 receptors with a half-time of 142 min; that of (S) -cetirizine was only 6 min, implying that the former could act as a pseudo-irreversible antagonist in functional studies. The <b>carboxylic</b> <b>function</b> of levocetirizine seemed responsible for its long dissociation time. Indeed, hydroxyl or methyl ester analogs dissociated more rapidly from H 1 receptors, with half-times of 31 min and 7 min, respectively. The importance of the <b>carboxylic</b> <b>function</b> of levocetirizine for the interaction with the H 1 receptor was further supported by the results from the mutation of Lys 191 to Ala 191. This mutation decreased the dissociation half-time of levocetirizine from 142 to 13 min and reduced its affinity from 3 to 12 nM, whereas the affinity and dissociation kinetics of hydroxyl and methyl ester analogs were hardly affected. The mutation of Thr 194 reduced the binding stereoselectivity by selectively enhancing the affinity of the distomer. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
