This {{is done by}} first characterizing the deformations of ten dimensional N= 1 SYM which are induced by a constant bispinorial coupling ∫ ΨHΨ ¯ plus a minimal purely bosonic <b>completition</b> {{and then by the}} appropriate dimensional reduction. We find a whole class of new models for the matrix strings and a generalization of the supernumerary supersymmetric models as far as the matrix theory for particles is concerned. A companion deformation of the IKKT matrix model is also discussed. ...|$|E
