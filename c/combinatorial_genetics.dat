40|$|The {{systematic}} {{functional analysis}} of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> {{has been limited}} by the throughput {{that can be achieved}} and the order of complexity that can be studied. To enable massively parallel characterization of genetic combinations in human cells, we developed a technology for rapid, scalable assembly of high-order barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be quantified with high-throughput sequencing. We applied this technology, <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> en masse (CombiGEM), to create high-coverage libraries of 1, 521 two-wise and 51, 770 three-wise barcoded combinations of 39 human microRNA (miRNA) precursors. We identified miRNA combinations that synergistically sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy and/or inhibit cancer cell proliferation, providing insights into complex miRNA networks. More broadly, our method will enable high-throughput profiling of multifactorial genetic combinations that regulate phenotypes of relevance to biomedicine, biotechnology and basic science.

40|$|New {{therapeutic}} {{strategies are}} needed to treat infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria, which constitute a major growing threat to human health. Here, we use a high-throughput technology to identify combinatorial genetic perturbations that can enhance the killing of drug-resistant bacteria with antibiotic treatment. This strategy, <b>Combinatorial</b> <b>Genetics</b> En Masse (CombiGEM), enables the rapid generation of high-order barcoded combinations of genetic elements for high-throughput multiplexed characterization based on next-generation sequencing. We created ~ 34, 000 pairwise combinations of Escherichia coli transcription factor (TF) overexpression constructs. Using Illumina sequencing, we identified diverse perturbations in antibiotic-resistance phenotypes against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Specifically, we found multiple TF combinations that potentiated antibiotic killing by up to 10 [superscript 6]-fold and delivered these combinations via phagemids to increase the killing of highly drug-resistant E. coli harboring New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase- 1. Moreover, we constructed libraries of three-wise combinations of transcription factors with > 4 million unique members and demonstrated that these could be tracked via next-generation sequencing. We envision that CombiGEM could be extended to other model organisms, disease models, and phenotypes, where it could accelerate massively parallel <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> studies for {{a broad range of}} biomedical and biotechnology applications, including the treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections.

40|$|Oral Presentation 5 The orchestrated {{action of}} genes {{controls}} complex biological traits, yet the systematic discovery of gene combinations that modulate these phenotypes in human cells is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. Harnessing {{the power of}} synthetic biology and next-generation sequencing technologies, we developed CombiGEM (<b>Combinatorial</b> <b>Genetics</b> En Masse) as a powerful platform for high-throughput functional characterization of combinatorial genetic perturbations in human cells. CombiGEM enables rapid, scalable assembly of high-order barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries, and multiplexed quantification of all library members by using next-generation sequencing technologies. The genetic elements included in CombiGEM libraries can be arbitrary, including microRNAs, gene expression/knockdown constructs, synthetic-biology circuit components, and programmable CRISPR-Cas genome editing tools. We envision that this technology platform will be applicable to {{a broad range of}} biological settings, and will enable the systematic identification of genetic combinations that regulate complex biological processes and diseases...|$|E
40|$|The small {{phenolic}} molecule salicylic acid (SA) {{plays a key}} role in plant defense. Significant progress has been made recently in understanding SA-mediated defense signaling networks. Functional analysis of a large number of genes involved in SA biosynthesis and regulation of SA accumulation and signal transduction has revealed distinct but interconnecting pathways that orchestrate the control of plant defense. Further studies utilizing <b>combinatorial</b> approaches in <b>genetics,</b> molecular biology, biochemistry and genomics will uncover finer details of SA-mediated defense networks as well as further insights into the crosstalk of SA with other defense signaling pathways. The complexity of defense networks illustrates the capacity of plants to integrate multiple developmental and environmental signals into a tight control of the costly defense responses...|$|R
40|$|Human-specific small insertions and deletions (HS indels, with lengths < 100 bp) are {{reported}} to be ubiquitous in the human genome. However, whether these indels contribute to human-specific traits remains unclear. Here we employ a modified McDonald–Kreitman (MK) test and a <b>combinatorial</b> population <b>genetics</b> approach to infer, respectively, the occurrence of positive selection and recent selective sweep events associated with HS indels. We first extract 625, 890 HS indels from the human–chimpanzee–macaque–mouse multiple alignments and classify them into nonpolymorphic (41 %) and polymorphic (59 %) indels {{with reference to the}} human indel polymorphism data. The modified MK test is then applied to 100 -kb partially overlapped sliding windows across the human genome to scan for the signs of positive selection. After excluding the possibility of biased gene conversion and controlling for false discovery rate, we show that HS indels are potentially positively selected in about 10 Mb of the human genome. Furthermore, the indel-associated positively selected regions overlap with genes more often than expected. However, our result suggests that the potential targets of positive selection are located in noncoding regions. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate that the genomic regions surrounding HS indels are more frequently involved in recent selective sweep than the other regions. In addition, HS indels are associated with distinct recent selective sweep events in different human subpopulations. Our results suggest that HS indels may have been associated with human adaptive changes at both the species level and the subpopulation level...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic biology {{has been}} heralded {{as a new}} {{bioengineering}} platform {{for the production of}} bulk and specialty chemicals, drugs, and fuels. Here, we report {{for the first time a}} series of 74 novel compounds produced using a <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> approach in baker’s yeast. Based on the concept of “coevolution ” with target proteins in an intracellular primary survival assay, the identified, mostly scaffold-sized (200 − 350 MW) compounds, which displayed excellent biological activity, can be considered as prevalidated hits. Of the molecules found,> 75 % have not been described previously; 20 % of the compounds exhibit novel scaffolds. Their structural and physicochemical properties comply with established rules of drug- and fragment-likeness and exhibit increased structural complexities compared to synthetically produced fragments. In summary, the synthetic biology approach described here represents a completely new, complementary strategy for hit and early lead identification that can be easily integrated into the existing drug discovery process...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} control of inorganic crystal formation, morphology and assembly {{is of interest}} to biologists and biotechnologists studying hard tissue growth and regeneration, {{as well as to}} materials scientists using biomimetic approaches for control of inorganic material fabrication and assembly. Biomimetics requires an accurate understanding of natural mechanisms at the molecular level. Such understanding can be derived from the use of metal surfaces to study surface recognition by proteins together with <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> techniques for selection of suitable peptides. Polymerization of these peptides produces engineered polypeptides large enough to encode their own folding information with low structural complexity while enhancing binding affinity to surfaces. The low complexity of such polypeptides can aid in analyses leading to modeling and eventual manipulation {{of the structure of the}} folded polypeptide. Here we present structure predictions for gold-binding protein sequences, originally selected by combinatorial techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations lasting 5 ns were carried out using solvated polypeptides at the gold surface to assess the dynamics of the binding process and the effects of surface topography on the specificity of protein binding. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> for {{conditional}} transgene activation allows studying {{gene function}} with temporal and tissue specific control like the Gal 4 -UAS system, which has enabled sophisticated genetic studies in Drosophila. Recently this system was adapted for zebrafish and promising applications have been introduced. Here, we report a systematic optimization of zebrafish Gal 4 -UAS genetics by establishing an optimized Gal 4 -activator (KalTA 4). We provide quantitative data for KalTA 4 -mediated transgene activation in dependence of UAS copy numbers {{to allow for}} studying dosage effects of transgene expression. Employing a Tol 2 transposon-mediated KalTA 4 enhancer trap screen biased for central nervous system expression, we present a collection of self-reporting red fluorescent KalTA 4 activator strains. These strains reliably transactivate UAS-dependent transgenes and can be rendered homozygous. Furthermore, we have characterized the transactivation kinetics of tissue-specific KalTA 4 activation, {{which led to the}} development of a self-maintaining effector strain “Kaloop. ” This strain relates transient KalTA 4 expression during embryogenesis via a KalTA 4 -mediated autoregulatory mechanism to live adult structures. We demonstrate its use by showing that the secondary octaval nucleus in the adult hindbrain is likely derived from egr 2 b-expressing cells in rhombomere 5 during stages of early embryogenesis. These data demonstrate prolonged and maintained expression by Kalooping, a technique that can be used for permanent spatiotemporal genetic fate mapping and targeted transgene expression in zebrafish...|$|E
40|$|F-actin {{networks}} are important structural determinants of cell shape and morphogenesis. They are regulated {{through a number}} of actin-binding proteins. The function of many of these proteins is well understood, but very little is known about how they cooperate and integrate their activities in cellular contexts. Here, we have focussed on the cellular roles of actin regulators in controlling filopodial dynamics. Filopodia are needle-shaped, actin-driven cell protrusions with characteristic features that are well conserved amongst vertebrates and invertebrates. However, existing models of filopodia formation are still incomplete and controversial, pieced together {{from a wide range of}} different organisms and cell types. Therefore, we used embryonic Drosophila primary neurons as one consistent cellular model to study filopodia regulation. Our data for loss-of-function of capping proteins, enabled, different Arp 2 / 3 complex components, the formin DAAM and profilin reveal characteristic changes in filopodia number and length, providing a promising starting point to study their functional relationships in the cellular context. Furthermore, the results are consistent with effects reported for the respective vertebrate homologues, demonstrating the conserved nature of our Drosophila model system. Using <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics,</b> we demonstrate that different classes of nucleators cooperate in filopodia formation. In the absence of Arp 2 / 3 or DAAM filopodia numbers are reduced, in their combined absence filopodia are eliminated, and in genetic assays they display strong functional interactions with regard to filopodia formation. The two nucleators also genetically interact wit...|$|E
40|$|Here, we {{describe}} the multiple lentiviral expression (MuLE) system that allows multiple genetic alterations to be introduced simultaneously into mammalian cells. We created a toolbox of MuLE vectors that constitute a flexible, modular system for the rapid engineering of complex polycistronic lentiviruses, allowing combinatorial gene overexpression, gene knockdown, Cre-mediated gene deletion, or CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated (where CRISPR indicates clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene mutation, together with expression of fluorescent or enzymatic reporters for cellular assays and animal imaging. Examples of tumor engineering were used to illustrate the speed and versatility of performing <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> using the MuLE system. By transducing cultured primary mouse cells with single MuLE lentiviruses, we engineered tumors containing up to 5 different genetic alterations, identified genetic dependencies of molecularly defined tumors, conducted genetic interaction screens, and induced the simultaneous CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated knockout of 3 tumor-suppressor genes. Intramuscular injection of MuLE viruses expressing oncogenic H-RasG 12 V together with combinations of knockdowns of the tumor suppressors cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 A (Cdkn 2 a), transformation-related protein 53 (Trp 53), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) allowed the generation of 3 murine sarcoma models, demonstrating that genetically defined autochthonous tumors can be rapidly generated and quantitatively monitored via direct injection of polycistronic MuLE lentiviruses into mouse tissues. Together, our results demonstrate that the MuLE system provides genetic power for the systematic investigation of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human diseases...|$|E
40|$|We {{have devised}} a {{procedure}} using monovalent phage display to select for stable mutants in the pro-domain of the serine protease, subtilisin BPN'. In complex with subtilisin, the pro-domain assumes a compact structure with a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet and two three-turn alpha-helices. When isolated, however, the pro-domain is 97 % unfolded. These experiments use combinatorial mutagenesis to select for stabilizing amino acid combinations at a particular structural locus and determine how many combinations {{are close to the}} maximum protein stability. The selection for stability is {{based on the fact that}} the independent stability of the pro-domain is very low and that binding to subtilisin is thermodynamically linked to folding. Two libraries of mutant pro-domains were constructed and analyzed to determine how many combinations of amino acids at a particular structural locus result in the maximum stability. A library comprises all combinations of four amino acids at a structural locus. Previous studies using <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> have shown that many different combinations of amino acids can be accommodated in a selected locus without destroying function. The present results indicate that the number of sequence combinations at a structural locus, which are close to the maximum stability, is small. The most striking example is a selection at an interior locus of the pro-domain. After two rounds of phagemid selection, one amino acid combination is found in 40 % of sequenced mutants. The most frequently selected mutant has a deltaG(unfolding) = 4 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C, an increase of 6 kcal/mol relative to the naturally occurring sequence. Some implications of these results on the amount of sequence information needed to specify a unique tertiary fold are discussed. Apart from possible implications on the folding code, the phage display selection described here should be useful in optimizing the stability of other proteins, which can be displayed on the phage surface...|$|E
40|$|The orchestrated {{action of}} genes {{controls}} complex biological phenotypes, yet the systematic discovery of gene and drug combinations that modulate these phenotypes in human cells is labor intensive and challenging to scale. Here, {{we created a}} platform for the massively parallel screening of barcoded combinatorial gene perturbations in human cells and translated these hits into effective drug combinations. This technology leverages {{the simplicity of the}} CRISPR-Cas 9 system for multiplexed targeting of specific genomic loci and the versatility of <b>combinatorial</b> <b>genetics</b> en masse (CombiGEM) to rapidly assemble barcoded combinatorial genetic libraries that can be tracked with high-throughput sequencing. We applied CombiGEM-CRISPR to create a library of 23, 409 barcoded dual guide-RNA (gRNA) combinations and then perform a high-throughput pooled screen to identify gene pairs that inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth when they were targeted. We validated the growth-inhibiting effects of specific gene sets, including epigenetic regulators KDM 4 C/BRD 4 and KDM 6 B/BRD 4, via individual assays with CRISPR-Cas–based knockouts and RNA-interference–based knockdowns. We also tested small-molecule drug pairs directed against our pairwise hits and showed that they exerted synergistic antiproliferative effects against ovarian cancer cells. We envision that the CombiGEM-CRISPR platform will be applicable to a broad range of biological settings and will accelerate the systematic identification of genetic combinations and their translation into novel drug combinations that modulate complex human disease phenotypes.
