5|$|In December 2008, LatinoJustice PRLDEF {{filed an}} unusual {{international}} petition with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> the United States was failing to protect Latinos living within its borders and was thus falling short of several human rights manifestos.|$|E
5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by <b>charging</b> <b>that,</b> when Chandler was a senator, he {{had voted}} in favor of declaring World War II, but soon after {{resigned}} his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor}} of the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Elissa Wall filed {{a multimillion-dollar}} {{lawsuit against the}} FLDS, Warren Jeffs, and the UEP Trust with the {{expressed}} intention to assist {{other members of the}} FLDS in leaving the community. The suit was ongoing for several years afterwards, and a CPA filed a counter-lawsuit in response, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Wall's family, not the FLDS or the UEP Trust, was responsible for her underage marriage. In June 2009, she offered to settle the suit for $308,000, the land her family lives on, and some other properties.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter over his own remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> he had improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial {{charges against the}} five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate {{the actions of the}} senators relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated the rules of the Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
5|$|Later, Owsley's tenure {{would be}} marred by a {{conflict}} with Benjamin Hardin, his Secretary of State. Hardin believed that by supporting Owsley in the gubernatorial election, he would obtain some influence in Owsley's choices for other appointments. Tensions between Hardin and Owsley worsened as Hardin became increasingly frustrated with his lack of influence. On September 1, 1846, Owsley removed Hardin from his cabinet, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Hardin had abandoned his duties {{because he did not}} reside in Frankfort. Hardin challenged this premise for his removal, and when Owsley nominated George B. Kinkead to replace Hardin, the state senate voted 30â€”8 that no vacancy existed. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld this decision. Vindicated, Hardin then resigned, charging Owsley with practicing nepotism. In the Kentucky Constitution of 1850, the governor was stripped of his power to remove the Secretary of State from office.|$|E
5000|$|In John 19:7 the Jews cry out to Pontius Pilate [...] "Crucify him" [...] {{based on}} the <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> Jesus [...] "made himself the Son of God." [...] The <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> Jesus had {{declared}} himself [...] "Son of God" [...] was essential to the argument of the Jews from a religious perspective, as the <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> he had called himself King of the Jews was important to Pilate from a political perspective, for it meant possible rebellion against Rome.|$|R

50|$|Some feminists {{are opposed}} to pornography, arguing {{that it is an}} {{industry}} which exploits women and is complicit in violence against women, both in its production (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (where they <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment). They <b>charge</b> <b>that</b> pornography contributes to the male-centered objectification of women and thus to sexism.|$|R
5|$|Lawsuits {{were filed}} against Barr by GOP members in Pennsylvania {{to prevent the}} {{candidate}} from appearing on the state's ballot on charges that the Libertarian Party tricked individuals into signing the state's ballot access petition. Commonwealth Court Judge Johnny Butler dismissed these allegations on September 16, allowing Barr {{to remain on the}} state's ballot. The Barr campaign filed a lawsuit to prevent John McCain and Barack Obama from appearing on the ballot in Texas, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> the candidates' parties did not reach the state's August 26 deadline to report their nominations to the Secretary of State. Texas Secretary of State Esperanza Andrade reported that all the correct paperwork was filed, though neither the Democratic nor Republican parties formally nominated their candidates (at their respective conventions) until after the deadline.|$|E
5|$|Nearing {{the end of}} her term as {{lieutenant}} governor, Collins {{announced her}} intent to run for governor in 1983. Her opponents for the Democratic nomination included Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane and Grady Stumbo, the former secretary of the state's Department of Human Resources. Collins had the support of many leaders in the Democratic Party, but just before the primary, Governor Brown endorsed Stumbo, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> both Sloane and Collins would use their gubernatorial appointment power to dispense party patronage. Although this was a common practice at the time, Brown notably shunned it during his term. With 223,692 votes, Collins edged out Sloane (219,160 votes) and Stumbo (199,795 votes) to secure the nomination. Sloane asked for a recanvass of the ballots, but ultimately decided it would not change the outcome and conceded defeat.|$|E
5|$|No {{sooner had}} Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley {{reversed}} course and began stumping for Taylor. Though he insisted he {{only wanted to}} defend his administration from Democratic attacks, Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley kicked off his tour {{of the state in}} Louisville, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. As evidence, he cited Goebel's lack of support from Democrat John G. Carlisle, his former ally, as well as Senator William Lindsay, W. C. P. Breckinridge, John Y. Brown, Theodore Hallum, W. C. Owens, Wat Hardin, and William Stone. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Bradley and Republican leader (and later governor) Augustus E. Willson toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket, often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.|$|E

5|$|The Cooper {{hijacking}} {{marked the}} beginning of the end for unfettered and unscrutinized airline travel. Despite the initiation of the federal sky marshal program the previous year, 31 hijackings were committed in U.S. airspace in 1972; 19 of them were for the specific purpose of extorting money and most of the rest were attempts to reach Cuba. In 15 of the extortion cases the hijackers also demanded parachutes. In early 1973 the FAA began requiring airlines to search all passengers and their bags. Amid multiple lawsuits <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> such searches violated Fourth Amendment protections against search and seizure, federal courts ruled that they were acceptable when applied universally, and when limited to searches for weapons and explosives. In contrast to the 31 hijackings in 1972, only two were attempted in 1973, both by psychiatric patients, one of whom intended to crash the airliner into the White House to kill President Nixon.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in the campaign, the Austrian command staff was in full confusion. Ferdinand began to openly oppose Mack's command style and decisions, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> the latter spent his days writing {{contradictory}} orders that left the Austrian army marching back and forth. On 13 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north: one under Johann Sigismund Riesch headed towards Elchingen to secure the bridge there and the other under Franz von Werneck went north with most of the heavy artillery. Ney hurried his corps forward to reestablish contact with Dupont, who was still north of the Danube. Ney led Loison's division to the south of Elchingen on the right bank of the Danube to begin the attack. Malher's division crossed the river farther east and moved west toward Riesch's position. The field was a partially wooded flood plain, rising steeply to the hill town of Elchingen, which had a wide field of view. The French cleared the Austrian pickets from a bridge, then a regiment boldly attacked and captured the abbey {{at the top of the}} hill at bayonet point. During the Battle of Elchingen, the Austrian cavalry was also defeated and Reisch's infantry fled toward Ulm. Ney was given the title Duke of Elchingen for his impressive victory.|$|E
5|$|October 9, 1944, {{was another}} {{in a string of}} days {{consisting}} of accused men testifying on the witness stand. This day, however, Thurgood Marshall, chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sat in on the proceedings. Marshall had flown to the Bay Area on a special wartime travel priority arranged by Navy Secretary Forrestal. The NAACP had given the mutiny trial top importance due to the U.S. Navy's policy of putting Negroes into dirty and dangerous jobs with no hope of advancement. Although Marshall was allowed to observe the trial, as a civilian he was ineligible to take an official role in the men's defense. After hearing five of the men defend themselves, Marshall spoke to the 50 men and then conferred with Veltmann's defense team. The next day, Marshall held a press conference, <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Judge Advocate Coakley was handling the case in a prejudicial manner. Marshall said that, from a review of the proceedings and his conversations with the accused, he could only see these men being tried for lesser charges of individual insubordination, not mass mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party <b>charging</b> <b>that</b> Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed to the next step of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4â€“4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E
