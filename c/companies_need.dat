2500|$|Corporate social {{irresponsibility}} in {{the supply}} chain has greatly affected the reputation of companies, leading {{to a lot of}} cost to solve the problems. For instance, incidents like the 2013 Savar building collapse, which killed over 1000 people, pushed companies to consider the impacts of their operations on society and environment.
