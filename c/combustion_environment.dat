50|$|Due to {{the high}} {{temperature}} of the <b>combustion</b> <b>environment,</b> only certain types of material can operate in situ. The majority of NOx sensors developed have been made out of ceramic type metal oxides, with the most common being yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), which is currently used in the decades-old oxygen sensor. The YSZ is compacted into a dense ceramic and conducts oxygen ions (O2−) at the high temperatures of a tailpipe such at 400 °C and above. To get a signal from the sensor a pair of high-temperature electrodes such as noble metals (platinum, gold, or palladium) or other metal oxides are placed onto the surface and an electrical signal such as the change in voltage or current is measured {{as a function of}} NOx concentration.|$|E
50|$|The {{combustion}} time of {{the aluminum}} particles in the hot combustion gas varies depending on aluminum particle size and shape. In small APCP motors with high aluminum content, the residence {{time of the}} combustion gases {{does not allow for}} full combustion of the aluminum and thus a substantial fraction of the aluminum is burned outside the combustion chamber, leading to decreased performance. This effect is often mitigated by reducing aluminum particle size, inducing turbulence (and therefore a long characteristic path length and residence time), and/or by reducing the aluminum content to ensure a <b>combustion</b> <b>environment</b> with a higher net oxidizing potential, ensuring more complete aluminum combustion. Aluminum combustion inside the motor is the rate-limiting pathway since the liquid-aluminum droplets (even still liquid at temperatures 3000 K) limit the reaction to a heterogeneous globule interface, making the surface area to volume ratio an important factor in determining the combustion residence time and required combustion chamber size/length.|$|E

40|$|In <b>combustion</b> <b>environments,</b> {{volatilization}} of SiO 2 to Si-O-H(g) {{species is}} a critical issue. Available thermochemical data for Si-O-H(g) species were used to calculate boundary layer controlled fluxes from SiO 2. Calculated fluxes were compared to volatilization rates Of SiO 2 scales grown on SiC which were measured in Part 1 of this paper. Calculated volatilization rates were also compared to those measured in synthetic combustion gas furnace tests. Probable vapor species were identified in both fuel-lean and fuel-rich <b>combustion</b> <b>environments</b> based on the observed pressure, temperature and velocity dependencies {{as well as the}} magnitude of the volatility rate. Water vapor is responsible for the degradation of SiO 2 in the fuel-lean environment.

50|$|This model {{takes into}} {{consideration}} only the final concentration of species and {{takes into account}} only the global nature of combustion process where the reaction proceeds infinitely fast as a single step process without much stress on the detailed kinetics involved. The reactants are assumed to react in stoichiometric proportions. The model also deduces a linear relationship between the mass fractions of fuel, oxidant and the non dimensional variable mixture fraction. The model also takes into account an additional assumption that the mass diffusion coefficients of all species are equal. Owing to this additional assumption the model only solves one extra partial differential equation for mixture fraction and after solving the transport equation for the mixture fraction the corresponding mass fractions for fuel and oxidant are calculated. This model can very well be applied to a <b>combustion</b> <b>environment</b> where laminar diffusion effects are dominant and the combustion proceeds via non premixed fuel and oxidant streams diffusing into each other giving rise to a laminar flame.|$|E

40|$|Two commercially {{available}} additive-containing silicon nitride materials were exposed in four environments which range in severity from dry oxygen at 1 atm pressure, and low gas velocity to an actual turbine engine. Oxidation and volatilization kinetics were monitored at temperatures ranging from 1066 to 1400 C. The {{main purpose of}} this paper is to examine the surface oxide morphology resulting from the exposures. It was found that the material surface was enriched in rare earth silicate phases in <b>combustion</b> <b>environments</b> when compared to the oxides formed on materials exposed in dry oxygen.

40|$|Hypersonic {{air-breathing}} engines rely on scramjet combustion processes, {{which involve}} high speed, compressible, and highly turbulent flows. The <b>combustion</b> <b>environment</b> and the turbulent flames {{at the heart}} of these engines are difficult to simulate and study in the laboratory under well controlled conditions. Typically, wind-tunnel testing is performed that more closely approximates engine testing rather than a careful investigation of the underlying physics that drives the combustion process. The experiments described in this paper, along with companion data sets being developed separately, aim to isolate the chemical kinetic effects from the fuel-air mixing process in a dual-mode scramjet <b>combustion</b> <b>environment.</b> A unique fuel injection approach is taken that produces a nearly uniform fuel-air mixture {{at the entrance to the}} combustor. This approach relies on the precombustion shock train upstream of the dual-mode scramjet combustor.

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} {{is an important}} physical phenomenon in <b>combustion</b> <b>environments.</b> For the understanding of existing- and the design of new <b>combustion</b> <b>environments</b> computational modelling is a useful tool as it can describe the different transport phenomena. This thesis has focused on studying thermal radiative property models of the participating media, gases and particles. Two specific <b>combustion</b> <b>environments</b> have also been studied, from a thermal radiation perspective. The focus is on radiative property models that are useful specifically for engineering purposes. These property models are often developed from more advanced spectral models by means of correlative or other methods to simplify {{the treatment of the}} radiative transfer. One such model is the non-correlated statistical narrow band (SNB) model, which drops spectral relation between intensity and transmissivity, which is used in the correlated SNB model. By doing so a significant decrease in computational demand can be achieved. The accuracy of this model has been questioned in the literature although it has been suggested as an appropriate option for sooty environments. The assessment of the model revealed that it only gives good predictions in large geometries and highly sooty environments. Because of th...|$|R

In such applications these materials {{are exposed to}} combustion gases and deposit-forming corrodents. In this paper combustion environments are defined for various applications. These environments lead to five main types of corrosive degradation: passive oxidation, deposit-induced corrosion, active oxidation, scale/substrate interactions, and scale volatility.
