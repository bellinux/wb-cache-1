5|$|The {{available}} {{laboratory tests}} for influenza <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve.</b> The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests. According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 50–75% and specificity of 90–95% {{when compared with}} viral culture. These tests may be especially useful during the influenza season (prevalence=25%) but {{in the absence of}} a local outbreak, or peri-influenza season (prevalence=10%).|$|E
5|$|The {{congress}} is noteworthy {{because of the}} extent of democratization which took place within the party. The role of the Central Committee in decision-making was strengthened, {{and the role of the}} Politburo as a supreme organ was weakened. Inner-party accountability was strengthened.

5|$|Due {{to these}} delays, Urobuchi issued an apology to viewers. However, he also {{indicated}} that the postponements could be viewed {{in a positive light}} because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule. Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most likely would have been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of the}} series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E

25|$|Washington, Thorn and Dillingham {{developed}} the Calhoun Colored School {{according to the}} Hampton-Tuskegee model. First, students would receive a basic elementary education and then an industrial education {{at the high school}} level. This model envisioned preparing students for the work available in the rural areas in which most of them lived. Boys would become farmers and perhaps skilled tradesmen, and girls would become wives and homemakers, as well as laundresses, dressmakers, or domestic workers. The best students were encouraged to become teachers and work in the community or outlying areas to promote further education along the Hampton-Tuskegee model. There was a great push to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> literacy among both children and adults, and teaching was a high calling.|$|E
25|$|The PLAN Coastal Defence Force is a {{land-based}} {{fighting force}} and {{branch of the}} PLAN with a strength of around 25,000 personnel. Also known as the coastal defense troops, they serve to defend China's coastal areas from invasion via amphibious landings or air-attack. Throughout the 1960s to 1980s, the Coastal Defense Force was focused on defending China's coast from a possible Soviet sea-borne invasion. With {{the fall of the}} Soviet Union, the threat of an amphibious invasion of China has diminished and therefore the branch is often considered to no-longer to be a vital component of the PLAN.

25|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Prius {{is designed}} to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost. These objectives were achieved {{through the development of}} a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery, electric motor and gasoline engine technologies. It features improved batteries with higher energy density; smaller electric motors, with higher power density than the previous Prius motors; and the gasoline engine features a thermal efficiency greater than 40% (that of the third-generation Prius is 38.5%). The Prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10% each generation, and Toyota has set the challenge to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> at this rate.|$|E
25|$|Wines {{made from}} Nebbiolo are {{characterized}} by their ample amounts of acidity and tannin. Most examples are wines built for aging {{and some of the}} highest quality vintages need significant age (at least a decade or more) before they are palatable to many wine drinkers and can <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> in the bottle for upward of 30 years. As Nebbiolo ages, the bouquet becomes more complex and appealing with aromas of tar and roses being the two most common notes. Other aromas associated with Nebbiolo include dried fruit, damsons, leather, licorice, mulberries, spice as well dried and fresh herbs. While Barolo & Barbaresco tend to be the heaviest and most in need of aging, wines made in the modernist style are becoming more approachable at a young age. Lighter styles from Carema, Langhe and Gattinara tend to be ready drink within a few years of vintage. Nebbiolo from California and Australia will vary from producer and quality of vineyard.|$|E
25|$|The 11th Five-Year Program (2006–10), {{announced}} in 2005 {{and approved by}} the National People's Congress in March 2006, called for greater energy conservation measures, including development of renewable energy sources and increased attention to environmental protection. Guidelines called for a 20% reduction in energy consumption per unit of GDP by 2010. Moving away from coal towards cleaner energy sources including oil, natural gas, renewable energy, and nuclear power is an important component of China's development program. Beijing also intends to <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> energy efficiency and promote the use of clean coal technology. China has abundant hydroelectric resources; the Three Gorges Dam, for example, will have a total capacity of 18 gigawatts when fully on-line (projected for 2009). In addition, the share of electricity generated by nuclear power is projected to grow from 1% in 2000 to 5% in 2030. China's renewable energy law, which went into effect in 2006, calls for 10% of its energy to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.|$|E
