60|$|Notwithstanding the {{foregoing}} objections, I cannot doubt, after reading Mr. Wallace’s excellent essay, that {{looking to the}} birds of the world, {{a large majority of}} the species in which the females are conspicuously coloured (and in this case the males with rare exceptions are equally conspicuous), build concealed nests for the sake of protection. Mr. Wallace enumerates[215] a long series of groups in which this rule holds good; but it will suffice here to give, as instances, the more familiar groups of kingfishers, toucans, trogons, puff-birds (<b>Capitonidæ),</b> plaintain-eaters (Musophagæ), woodpeckers, and parrots. Mr. Wallace believes that in these groups, as the males gradually acquired through sexual selection their brilliant colours, these were transferred to the females and were not eliminated by natural selection, owing to the protection which they already enjoyed from their manner of nidification. According to this view, their present manner of nesting was acquired before their present colours. But it seems to me much more probable that in most cases as the females were gradually rendered more and more brilliant from partaking of the colours of the male, they were gradually led to change their instincts (supposing that they originally built open nests), and to seek protection by building domed or concealed nests. No one who studies, for instance, Audubon’s account of the differences in the nests of the same species in the Northern and Southern United States,[216] will feel any great difficulty in admitting that birds, either by a change (in the strict sense of the word) of their habits, or through the natural selection of so-called spontaneous variations of instinct, might readily be led to modify their manner of nesting.|$|E

50|$|The black-spotted barbet (Capito niger) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>Capitonidae</b> family. It is found in forests in northeastern South America, ranging {{as far south as}} the Amazon River and as far west as the Branco River. Previously, it {{included}} the gilded barbet of the southern and western Amazon Basin as subspecies. As currently defined, the black-spotted barbet is monotypic.|$|E
50|$|It {{often has}} been placed with the other barbets in the <b>Capitonidae.</b> However, DNA studies have {{confirmed}} that this arrangement is paraphyletic; New World barbets are {{more closely related to}} toucans than they are to Old World barbets.

50|$|The scarlet-hooded barbet (Eubucco tucinkae) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>Capitonidae</b> family. It is endemic to humid lowland forest in the {{south-western}} Amazon Basin in south-eastern Peru, north-western Bolivia and south-western Brazil; {{the majority of its}} range is in Peru-(60%?). It is generally uncommon. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Eubucco where both sexes have red to the head, the female being superficially similar to the male lemon-throated barbet.|$|E
50|$|The African barbets are {{birds in}} the family Lybiidae. They were usually united with their New World and Asian {{relatives}} in the <b>Capitonidae</b> for quite some time, but this has been confirmed {{to be limited to}} the main New World lineage. There are 42 species ranging from the type genus Lybius of forest interior to the tinkerbirds (Pogoniulus) of forest and scrubland.

50|$|Eubucco is a genus of {{colourful}} {{birds in}} the <b>Capitonidae</b> family. They are found in humid forest in South and Central America, and the species have almost entirely allo- or parapatric distributions. Slightly smaller than {{the members of the}} genus Capito, members of the genus Eubucco are all sexually dimorphic, have stubby yellowish bills, green backs, yellow to the neck or underparts, and, at least in the males, red to the head. Typically seen singly or in pairs, they are primarily frugivorous, but also take arthropods.|$|E
50|$|The orange-fronted barbet (Capito squamatus) is {{a species}} of bird in the <b>Capitonidae</b> family. It is found in forests in western Ecuador and extreme southwestern Colombia. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss. Both male and female orange-fronted barbets are mostly black and white, and have a red forecrown. The chest of the male bird is very pale yellowish and the throat is white, while these sections are black in the female bird. Unlike the male, the female also has whitish edging to the mantle and wing-coverts.|$|E
50|$|The Galbulidae and Bucconidae {{are often}} {{separated}} into a distinct Galbuliformes order. Analysis of nuclear genes confirms that {{they form a}} lineage of their own, but suggests that they are better treated as a suborder. The other families form another monophyletic group of suborder rank, but the barbets were determined to be paraphyletic {{with regard to the}} toucans and hence, the formerly all-encompassing <b>Capitonidae</b> have been split up. The woodpeckers and honeyguides are each other's closest relatives. According to some researchers, the entire order Piciformes should be included as a subgroup in Coraciiformes.|$|E
5000|$|The lemon-throated barbet (Eubucco richardsoni) is {{a species}} of bird in the New World barbet family <b>Capitonidae.</b> The species {{is closely related to}} the flame-throated barbet ( [...] Eubucco aurantiicollis), and several {{authorities}} consider them the same species. These two species are the only in their genus to live in the lowlands. There are two subspecies, the nominate race, E. r. richardsoni, found in central and southern Columbia, eastern Ecuador and northern Peru, and E. r. nigriceps (Chapman, 1928), found in north-east Peru and the extreme north west of Brazil.|$|E
50|$|Capito is a genus {{of birds}} in the <b>Capitonidae</b> family. They are found in humid forests in South America, with a single species {{extending}} into eastern Panama. Slightly larger than {{the members of the}} genus Eubucco, members of the genus Capito are all sexually dimorphic and thickset, and have stubby pale bills that often are tipped black. With the exception of the somewhat aberrant scarlet-crowned barbet, black, red, orange, yellow and white are the dominating colours in their plumage, and males have at least partially black backs. Typically seen singly or in pairs, they are primarily frugivorous, but also take arthropods.|$|E
