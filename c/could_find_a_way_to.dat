25|$|The nobility in France {{was never}} an entirely closed class. Nobility and {{hereditary}} titles were distinct: while all hereditary titleholders were noble, most nobles were untitled, although many assumed titres de courtoisie. Nobility could be granted by the king or, until 1578, acquired by a family which had occupied a government or military post of high enough rank for three generations. Once acquired, nobility was normally hereditary in the legitimate male-line for all male descendants. Wealthy families found ready opportunities to pass into the nobility: although nobility itself could not, legally, be purchased, lands to which noble rights and/or title were attached could be and often were bought by commoners who adopted use of the property's name or title and were henceforth assumed to be noble if they <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> be exempted from paying the taille to which only commoners were subject. Moreover, non-nobles who owned noble fiefs were obliged to pay a special tax (franc-fief) on the property to the noble liege-lord. Properly, only those who were already noble could assume a hereditary title attached to a noble fief (i.e. a barony, viscounty, countship, marquisate or dukedom), thereby acquiring a title recognised but not conferred by the French crown.|$|E

Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise.

2500|$|In 1977, Daoud Khan {{presented}} {{a new constitution}} to the National Assembly, which wrote in several new articles and amended others. He also began to moderate his socialist policies. In 1978, there was a rift with the PDPA. Internally, Daoud attempted {{to distance himself from}} the communist elements within the coup. [...] He was concerned about the tenor of many communists in his government and Afghanistan's growing dependency on the Soviet Union.

2500|$|On 9 February 2010, in {{an address}} to the General Synod of the Church of England, Williams warned that {{damaging}} infighting over the ordination of women as bishops and gay priests could lead to a permanent split in the Anglican Communion. He stressed that he did not [...] "want nor relish" [...] the prospect of division and called on the Church of England and Anglicans worldwide to step back from a [...] "betrayal" [...] of God's mission and to put the work of Christ before schism.

I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we <b>could</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, {{in the midst of the}} Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that it would be better if candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E

Old Ursula, who was cook, chambermaid, housekeeper, laundress, and everything else for Father Peter, and had been Marget's nurse in earlier years, said God would provide.

By this time the Pinkies had advanced halfway to the walls of the City, so the first thing the Boolooroo did was to order all the gates closed and locked, and then he placed a line of soldiers on the wall to prevent any of the Pinkies from climbing over.

Margaret had slipped away from him, and if once she escaped from Spain he knew that he would never see her more. For aught he knew, she might already have escaped or be married to Peter Brome. The very thought of it filled him with madness. There had been a conspiracy against him; he was outwitted, robbed, befooled. Well, hope still remained--and vengeance. He could still fight Peter, and perhaps kill him. He could hand over Castell, the Jew, to the Inquisition.

When the accident occurred, {{through no fault of}} mine, I was, fortunately, the only person injured; but my employer was so incensed over the damage to his automobile that he never even sent to inquire whether I lived or died.
