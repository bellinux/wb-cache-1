5|$|The video {{starts with}} Madonna {{coming to a}} ballet studio {{carrying}} a boombox. She switches it on as the clock ticking sound of the music starts. Wearing a pink leotard, Madonna starts gyrating to the music while doing warm up exercises. The scene interchanges {{with a group of}} people on the street who start dancing to the music while listening to a similar boombox. They also display aspects of the physical discipline Parkour, while climbing over buildings and jumping from staircases. As the song starts, Madonna dances to the music in the ballet studio. The second verse shows her continuing dancing while the people from the street take their boombox and board a taxi. Scenes are interspersed with people dancing in a Chinese restaurant and Parisian streets. In the meantime, Madonna finishes her workout in the ballet studio, drops her towel, changes her clothes and <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the street. The people on the taxi, leave it and take the Underground instead. After another round of dancing in the train, the intermediate music starts. Madonna is shown mingling with some dancers on a dance floor and riding on a boombox. As the song starts again, Madonna and the people from the street, who act as her background dancers, all dance on a Dance Dance Revolution machine in a gaming parlor. The video ends showing Madonna lying on the ballet studio floor. The video was nominated for five awards at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards including Best Female Video, Dance Video, Pop Video, Best Choreography and the Video of the Year award although it did not win any of them.|$|E

The long-standing relationship between France and India has resulted in extensive co-operation in the domains of aerospace and civil nuclear energy besides military matters.

500|$|The desperate straits of the United Company, and {{the success}} of The Relapse in saving it from collapse, are attested in a private letter from 19 November 1696: [...] "The other house [...] has no company at all, and unless a new play <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Saturday revives their {{reputation}}, they must break." [...] The new play is assumed to have been The Relapse, and it turned out the success Rich needed. [...] "This play", notes Colley Cibber in his autobiography, [...] "from its new and easy turn of wit, had great success, and gave me, as a comedian, a second flight of reputation along with it." [...] Charles Gildon summarises: [...] "This play was received with mighty applause." ...|$|E
500|$|A private {{letter from}} 19 November 1696 {{reported}} that Drury Lane [...] "has no company at all, and unless a new play <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Saturday revives their reputation, they must break." [...] The new play {{is assumed to}} have been John Vanbrugh's The Relapse, {{and it turned out}} the success the company needed. Christopher Rich continued as its head until 1709, when the patent in question was actually revoked amid a complex tangle of political machinations. A lawyer named William Collier was briefly given the right to mount productions in Drury Lane, but by 1710 the troupe was {{in the hands of the}} actors Colley Cibber, Robert Wilks, and Thomas Doggett – a triumvirate that eventually found themselves sharply satirised in Alexander Pope's Dunciad. In 1713 Barton Booth replaced Doggett.|$|E
500|$|Mestra's {{story is}} one of the best {{preserved}} and most studied sections of the Catalogue. She had the ability to change her shape at will, a skill which her father Erysichthon exploited in service of a ravening hunger with which he had been cursed and for which reason the people had nicknamed him Aethon ( [...] , Aithon, [...] "Blazing"). He would marry off Mestra for the bride prices she garnered, only to have the girl return home in some different form. The most notable victim of this plot was Sisyphus, who, despite his characteristic cunning, could never retain custody of his would-be daughter-in-law. Strife arose between Sisyphus and Erysichthon which no mortal could resolve, and the case was handed over to another authority. The text is damaged at this point, and identity of the mediator is a matter of dispute, as is the nature of the verdict rendered. [...] Exactly how this judgement resolves the quarrel over Mestra is obscure, but Sisyphus ultimately <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the losing end, for Mestra does not bear children to Glaucus. Instead Poseidon whisks her off to Kos, where she bears Eurypylus to the god. Eurypylus' descendents rule the island, which is sacked by Heracles in a brief allusion to the great hero's adventures. On his way home from attacking Troy for the horses of Laomedon, he assaulted Kos before going on to participate in the gigantomachy.|$|E

2500|$|Indian cuisine is {{extremely}} {{popular in the}} United Kingdom. [...] The hybrid dish [...] "Chicken tikka masala" [...] always <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> top as the UK's favourite meal The dish likely originated from the British Punjabi community which runs most Indian restaurants in the UK. There are around 9,000 Indian restaurants located across the UK, which equates to approximately one per 7,000 people. The popularity of the Indian curry in the UK was mainly made by South Indians, Bangladeshi, and Punjabi restaurateurs, where 85 percent of Indian restaurants in the UK are in fact owned by Bangladeshi Sylheti Bengalis. Over 2 million Britons eat at Indian restaurants in the UK every week, with a further 3 million cooking at least one Indian based meal at home during the week. [...] Veeraswamy, located on Regent Street in London, is the oldest surviving Indian restaurant in the UK, having opened in 1926.|$|E

2500|$|News {{regarding}} Leno leaked via {{an obscure}} website, FTV Live, {{by the following}} morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien {{as soon as they}} arrived, and although O'Brien had a hint of what was to come, explained the proposed changes. [...] "I know how hard I worked for this", responded O'Brien. [...] "It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in." [...] Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the Tonight studio. TMZ reported on the story, and, according to Bill Carter in The War for Late Night, essentially reversed the rumor with a headline reading, [...] "NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno <b>Comes</b> <b>Out</b> <b>on</b> Top." [...] O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien ("the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action", wrote Carter), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.|$|E

After all, a game that's story-driven lives and dies on the quality of said story." [...] He compared it to Her Story as something that could [...] "prove to be [...] very cool." [...] This sentiment was echoed by Kyle LeClair of Hardcore Gamer, writing that [...] "VA-11 Hall-A sure looks great and has quite a unique hook to it, so we'll be sure to try and wet our whistles with it when it <b>comes</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the PC". Graham Smith of Rock, Paper, Shotgun claimed that although [...] "VA-11 Hall-A, whose punctuation I already resent having to type, is skirting with genres I don't care about: anime-styled visual novels", he found VA-11 HALL-As branching-style plotline to be more engaging that an average [...] "linear and relatively uninteractive" [...] visual novel.

2500|$|Comic Book Resources ranks Victor von Doom {{as their}} fourth {{favorite}} Marvel character.

Fellow journalist Jason Stanhope called his [...] "master of sorcery and technology an unusual combination", and also felt [...] "his inner sense of nobility sets him apart from lesser villains, in a similar manner to Magneto." [...] Von Doom has also been favorably regarded by those who wrote for the character; Stan Lee declared Doom his favorite villain, saying that Doom [...] "could come to the United States and he could do almost anything, and we could not arrest him because he has diplomatic immunity. Also, he wants to rule the world and if you think about it, wanting to rule the world is not a crime.", that Doom technically isn't a villain. Mark Waid echoed Lee's assessment of the character, stating that Doom [...] " [...] got a great look, a great visual design [...] a dynamite origin." ...|$|E
