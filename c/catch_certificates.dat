40|$|On 29 September 2008, the European Commission (EC) passed Regulation 1005 / 2008 ‘establishing a Community {{system to}} prevent, deter and {{eliminate}} illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing’ (the EC IUU Regulation). The Regulation {{will come into}} force on 1 January 2010. The Regulation has the following major implications for the Australian seafood export industry: a. All consignments of wild caught fish and fish product (with exceptions) will be prohibited from being imported into European Union Member States, unless a catch certificate accompanies them. The catch certificate must contains the harvest details of the fish (e. g. vessel and master’s name and number, fishing licence number, date and location of capture, landing weights, details of processing on board) in addition to export, import and transport details. b. Australian authorities are to validate <b>catch</b> <b>certificates</b> and in doing so, {{have the power to}} provide such validation and attest to the veracity of the catch certificate. c. Australia is to provide prior notification to the EC certifying its arrangements with respect to conservation and management measures which must be complied with by its fishing vessels. d. Australia will be required to verify consignments and associated <b>catch</b> <b>certificates</b> where the importing State doubts its legitimacy and will also need to be prepared for ‘on-the-spot audits’ of its catch certification and validation process...|$|E
40|$|Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing {{has played}} a major role in the {{overexploitation}} of global fish populations. In response, international regulations have been imposed and many fisheries have been “eco-certified” by consumer organisations, but methods for independent control of <b>catch</b> <b>certificates</b> and eco-labels are urgently needed. Here we show that by using gene- associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), individual marine fish can be assigned back to population of origin with unprecedented high levels of precision. By applying high differentiation SNP assays in four commercial marine fish on a pan-European scale we find 93 - 100 % of individuals could be correctly assigned to origin in policy-driven case studies. We show how case- targeted SNP assays can be created and forensically validated using a centrally maintained and publicly available database. Our results demonstrate how application of gene-associated markers will likely revolutionise origin assignment and become highly valuable tools for fighting illegal fishing and mislabelling worldwide.

40|$|The fishery {{sector is}} a {{significant}} contributor to national income {{as well as a}} source of employment for local people. The export value of Vietnamese fisheries product is around US$ 4 billion annually. The tuna fisheries have become a key contributor to Vietnamese seafood export. The main markets for Vietnamese tuna products are the European Commission (EC), United States (US) and Japan. Vietnamese fisheries are considered as small-scale and traditional, with a large number of actors. The large number of actors coupled with incoherence between the legal frameworks and fishing practices has led to an increase in illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activities. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), IUU fishing is a global problem that is negatively affecting the environment, ecosystems, biodiversity, fish stocks and social-economic conditions of people. To deter and eliminate IUU fishing, the EC adopted the IUU regulation, which came into effect from 1 st January 2010. The IUU regulation applies to all countries that have fish trade with the EC. The goals of the regulation are sustainable resource management and exploitation, while providing sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. According to the IUU regulation, the import of fishery products into the EC is only allowed when accompanied by a certified catch certificate that ensures that the products is not a result of IUU fishing. Thus, in order to export fish to the EC, Vietnam has introduced <b>catch</b> <b>certificates.</b> Although fisheries regulations in Vietnam have improved, there are mismatches between the Vietnamese regulations and the EC’s IUU regulation. In its implementation of the IUU regulation, the Vietnam’s tuna longline fisheries is facing various problems and challenges with regards to the process of issuing <b>catch</b> <b>certificates</b> and fishing licenses, resources management and conservation, lack of an updated resource database, keeping logbooks and reporting, low education of fishers, and corruption. This thesis analyzes these problems and challenges. The study found that due to the inconsistencies between the EC’s IUU regulation and the Vietnamese regulations as well as Vietnam’s practical implementation of these regulations, there seems to be limitations to how effective the combat against IUU fishing will be. Despite the apparent implementation of EC regulations in Vietnam, IUU fishing activities still take place and IUU fish products are still being exported to the EC from Vietnam...|$|E

40|$|Fish and {{fishery product}} sector plays an {{important}} role in Sri Lanka’s social and economic life. Deep sea fishing is the main occupation of over two hundred thousands of families in coastal belt. Seafood export sector has a significant scope to uplift their living standards by creating a good market demand for Sri Lankan fishery products. As the main buyer of Sri Lankan fish products, European Union enforced restrictions over Sri Lankan fishery products by demanding assurance against illegal fishing. Even though the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources of Sri Lanka laid a strong foundation for a managed and controlled fishery, most of the effort fell apart due to absence of electronic vessel monitoring system. Projects initiated to introduce commercial vessel monitoring systems failed due to unbearable cost and no localization to support literacy level of Sri Lankan fishermen. This project researched on introducing an electronic vessel monitoring system to eliminate illegal fishing and maintain higher sustainability rate of marine lives while providing evidences for legal and controlled fishery in Sri Lanka. To fulfill the main objective as low cost and localized solution, the design was aimed to introduce a vessel monitoring system as an application which converts fisherman’s mobile phone into a vessel monitoring system by utilizing common features of smartphones such as GPS receiver, mobile data access, internal storage and Unicode compatibilities. Going beyond the vessel monitoring system, design was embedded E-Logbook as a separate section to records fish catch details, to be used as a good source of information which helps to maintain higher sustainability rate of marine lives by identifying feeding and breeding grounds. Administration console facilitates harbor officers to record fishing trip details while the monitoring console shows continuous vessel’s positions to overlook the trip route. Systems executes a rule based verification at the end of each fishing trip to ensure the legality of its catch and suitability of exporting to European market. System certifies the catch when the vessel have sailed only in legal zone and the catch satisfied commercial fishing regulation. Harbor officers do not release the harvest without <b>catch</b> <b>certificate.</b> That gives a good assurance of Sri Lanka compliance with international trade regulations and marine policies for sustainable fishery...|$|R
40|$|Correctness of data {{residing}} in a database is vital. While integrity constraint enforcement can often ensure data consistency, it is inadequate {{to protect against}} updates that involve careless, unintentional errors, e. g., whether a specified update to an employee’s record was for the intended employee. We propose a novel approach that is complementary to existing integrity enforcement techniques, to guard against such erroneous updates. Our approach is based on (a) updaters providing an update certificate with each database update, and (b) the database system verifying the correctness of the update certificate provided before performing the update. We formalize a certificate as a (challenge, response) pair, and characterize good certificates as those that are easy for updaters to provide and, when correct, give the system enough confidence that the update was indeed intended. We present algorithms that efficiently enumerate good challenges, without exhaustively exploring the search space of all challenges. We experimentally demonstrate that (i) databases have many good challenges, (ii) these challenges can be efficiently identified, (iii) certificates can be quickly verified for correctness, (iv) under natural models of an updater’s knowledge of the database, update <b>certificates</b> <b>catch</b> {{a high percentage of}} the erroneous updates without imposing undue burden on the updaters performing correct updates, and (v) our techniques are robust across a wide range of challenge parameter settings...|$|R
