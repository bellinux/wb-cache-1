5000|$|Anarchist Aragon (July 21, 1936 - 1939) was {{a period}} in Aragon's history, within {{the larger context of}} the Spanish Revolution, characterised by {{collective}} land ownership reform, social redistribution, <b>communalisation</b> of agrarian areas, attempts to eliminate the social influence of the Catholic Church, and worker economic and political management largely without the direction of a state. The period is generally agreed to have started at the Siege of the Alcázar, a highly symbolic Nationalist victory in Toledo in the opening stages of the Spanish Civil War, although anarchist communist thought was widely prevalent in such areas as Andalusia, the Levante, most of Aragon, as well as in Anarchist Catalonia. Mass collectivisation and the broad implementation of libertarian communist ideas occurred very quickly, largely voluntarily.|$|E
5000|$|The Khmer Rouge was {{determined}} to turn the country into a nation of peasants in which the corruption and [...] "parasitism" [...] of city life would be completely uprooted. <b>Communalisation</b> was implemented by putting men, women and children {{to work in the}} fields, which disrupted family life. The regime claimed to have “liberated” women through this process, and according to Zal Karkaria, [...] "appeared to have implemented Engels's doctrine in its purest form: women produced, therefore they had been freed." [...] On the surface, society in Democratic Kampuchea was strictly egalitarian. This was not the case in practice, however. Members and candidate members of the CPK, local-level leaders of poor peasant background who collaborated with the Angkar, and members of the armed forces had a higher standard of living {{than the rest of the}} population.|$|E
5000|$|In 2002, the Indian {{coalition}} government {{led by the}} Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) changed the school textbooks for social sciences and history, {{on the ground that}} certain passages offended the sensibilities of some religious and caste groups. Romila Thapar, who was the author of the textbook on Ancient India for class VI, objected to the changes made without her permission that, for example, deleted passages on eating of beef in ancient times, and the formulation of the caste system. She questioned whether the changes were an, [...] "attempt to replace mainstream history with a Hindutva version of history", with the view to use the resultant controversy as [...] "election propaganda." [...] Other historians and commentators, including Bipan Chandra, Sumit Sarkar, Irfan Habib, R.S. Sharma, Vir Sanghvi, Dileep Padgaonkar and Amartya Sen also protested the changes and published their objections in a compilation titled, <b>Communalisation</b> of Education.|$|E
50|$|The opening {{years of}} the twentieth century were stormy. The {{political}} scenario was undergoing a change, and the British were beginning to feel a bit uneasy. Discontentment was brewing. Political discontent was growing from the inability of the government to organise effective relief during the period of plague and famine. To stem the discontent, the British played the political trump card with great aplomb. For the first time, they used their divide-and-rule political game with great force. From 1870 onwards, the British started inciting the Hindus and the Muslims to form their own political parties to establish their distinct religious identities. That was perhaps the beginning of the <b>communalisation</b> of politics. The British not only encouraged the two communities to form political parties along religious line but also took various constructive steps to create a situation in which Hindus and Muslims would be forced to think in a way as if their religious identity is at peril. That culminated in the partition of Bengal in 1905. The partition was made along communal lines. This partition provided an impetus to the religious divide and the All India Muslim League and All India Hindu Mahasabha were formed. Both organisations aimed at fanning communal passions.|$|E
5000|$|A {{summary of}} Storch’s teachings in Zwickau {{was made in}} a letter, dated 18 December 1521, to Duke Johann of Saxony. The letter was {{probably}} written by the new Lutheran preacher at St Mary’s Church, Nikolaus Hausmann: “some men doubted whether the belief of the godfather can be of use in the baptism. And some {{think that they can}} be blessed without being baptised. And some state that the Holy Bible is not useful in the education of men, but that men can only be taught by the Spirit, for if God had wanted to teach men with the Bible, then He would have sent us a Bible down from heaven. And some say that one should not pray for the dead. And suchlike horrible abominations which are giving your Lordship’s town an unchristian and Picardish name.” In 1529, Melanchthon looked back to 1521 and described Storch’s doctrines: “God had shown him in dreams what He wanted. He claimed that an angel had come to him and had said that he would sit upon the throne of the Archangel Gabriel, and would thus be promised mastery over all the earth. He also said that saints and the Elect would reign after the destruction of the Godless, and that, under his leadership, all the kings and princes of the world would be killed and the Church would be cleansed. He arrogated to himself the judgment of souls, and claimed that he could recognise the Elect. He simply laughed about Mass, baptism and communion. He invented certain worthless tricks with which he intended to prepare men for the reception of the Spirit: if they spoke little, dressed poorly and ate poorly and together demanded the Holy Spirit of God...” [...] The Lutheran Mark Wagner listed eight articles of faith proposed by Storch, which included: a condemnation of the ‘Christian’ institution of marriage, whilst propagating the idea that ‘anyone can take women whenever his flesh commands him...and live with them promiscuously as he wishes’; a call for the <b>communalisation</b> of property; an invective against secular and ecclesiastical authorities; arguments against infant baptism - but not, incidentally, in support of adult baptism; condemnation of the ceremonies of the Church; and a proclamation of Free Will in matters of faith.|$|E

40|$|Of late, the {{discussion}} in the publicsphere as regards communalismand education has centered around two problems. One, the <b>communalisation</b> of higher education, particularly of disci-plines such as history and philosophy; and two, the danger of institutions of religious education – be they ‘mathas’, ‘madarsas’, or missions – becoming the proponents of political ideologies and thus the breeding grounds of communally-minded subjects. However, there {{does not seem to}} have been much attention directed towards trying to imagine how educational processes and institutions could be used in order to analyse communalism and, through such a process of analysis, persuade young citizens to tur...|$|E
40|$|This article {{looks at}} the {{trajectory}} from secular feminism to Islamic feminism to Muslim holistic feminism, examining the changing meanings of ‘the secular’ and ‘the religious’ and the ways they intersect in the different modes of feminism. It contrasts the open, inclusive nature that typifies the secular feminisms Muslim and non?Muslims created {{in the twentieth century}} in contexts of anti?colonial struggle and early nation?state building with the communalism of the new Muslim holistic feminism now emerging in global space at a time when religious identity is fore?fronted and there is an international preoccupation with Muslim women's rights. The article argues that the <b>communalisation</b> of women's rights activism or the privileging of Muslim women's rights occurring at the global level and being exported to local terrain can be divisive and threatening national unity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{address the}} {{limitations}} in dominant interpretations of CBD work and workspaces {{to account for}} complex processes of reconfiguration currently being experienced {{in the form of}} office work, the positioning of office workers and the material and discursive processes shaping CBD workspaces. Drawing on a case study of Sydney, Australia, it examines the impact of economic financialisation on the constitution of office work, highlighting a movement towards practices of association, interaction and shared work space. Then, through an exploration of the design discourses driving the creation of new configurations of office space, an investigation is presented of the connections between new forms of office work and new subjectivities of office workers. Finally, it is argued that interconnections between new forms of work, workspaces and workplace subjectivities are transforming the process of producing CBD office spaces in complex ways that blur the boundaries between so-called public and private realms in a process termed <b>communalisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|This article explores {{political}} conflicts {{about the}} organisation of public services in Sweden c. 1900 – 1920. The authors argue that political decisions {{play a vital}} role in shaping the political economy of public services. The case studies analysed are the political debates about the <b>communalisation</b> of the tramway system in Stockholm, and the nationalisation of Sweden’s last private telephone company. In both cases, the transfer of the service to public organisation was a lengthy process, ending in the late 1910 s. This is explained using the concept of publicness. Drawing on three discursive chains, the argument is that the political development was affected by the politicians conception of the political community, the form of organisation and by perceptions of values such as equal access and modernity. In the case of the tramways, public organisation was seen as the best option to defend the public against corruption and self-interest. In the case of the telephones, free market competition was seen as a guarantee for an efficient and cost- effective service. The reason for this difference, is argued, was that the debate on the tramways articulated a clearer notion of publicness, where equal access and public opinion carried larger weight. ...|$|E
40|$|Wirtschaftspolitische Weichenstellungen in der Energiepolitik werden in der BRD nicht nur von den nationalen und supranationalen Gesetzgebungsinstanzen, sonder in sehr hohem Ausmass auch von den Kommunen gepraegt. Der ordnungspolitische Handlungsspielraum der Kommunen wird dabei von den Gemeindeordnungen der jeweiligen Bundeslaender festgelegt, die eine Fortentwicklung der ''Deutschen Gemeindeordnung'' von 1935 darstellen. Viele Gemeinden haben nicht gezoegert, diese Handlungsmoeglichkeiten insbesondere durch die Gruendung von eigenen Versorgungsunternehmen auszunuetzen. Die Kommunalisierung der Energieversorgung steht jetzt wieder im Mittelpunkt vieler Diskussionen, wobei nicht nur eine verstaerkte Gruendungsaktivitaet als solche, sondern darueber hinaus eine Dezentralisierung der Kraftwerksstruktur gemeint ist. (orig.) Points {{relating}} to economic {{policy in the}} German energy policy are shaped not only by national and supranational legislative powers, but also {{to a large extent}} by the local authorities. The areas under local authority are set out at a country level, illustrating a further development of the ''Germany law governing local authorities'' in 1935. Many areas have not hesitated to use their powers in establishing their own supply utilities. The <b>communalisation</b> of the energy supply brings it once again to the forefront of discussions; it represents strengthened founding opportunities as well as the decentralisation of the power plant structure. This study aims to illustrate and provide an economic interpretation of the fourth and fifth regulations on hindrances to competition against the background of the present intervention system and current market structure of the energy sector (chapter 2 and 3). Further to that, the improvements of local authority's opportunities to construct their own electricity production capacity in the new framework are explored, and the likely economic consequences (chapter 4). A summary and evaluation of the results is given in chapter 5.
