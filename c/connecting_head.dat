5000|$|The NFL {{spent years}} trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged <b>connecting</b> <b>head</b> {{injuries}} sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 {{that the number of}} head injuries had remained [...] "remarkably the same over the course of four years." [...] The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in Neurosurgery that “NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury.” Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes “Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.” However, when Dr. Bennet Omalu examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster, he discovered a new brain disease, which he called Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in Neurosurgery in July 2005. The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler Terry Long (American football). Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname [...] "Dr. No." [...] In September 2009, The New York Times published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson Greg Aiello publicly said, [...] "the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys." [...] Two months later Aiello told New York Times reporter Alan Schwarz that [...] "it's quiet obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems." [...] It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.|$|E
40|$|Cylinder head {{production}} {{exemplifies the}} need for scheduling and sequencing techniques in the casting industry. In particular, loading areas <b>connecting</b> <b>head</b> production casting to cooling stages are subject to problems that can avalanche to headaches as severe as line shutdown. For a particular casting plant, the suggested solution must offer near-optimum answers. Furthermore, the solution must involve low computation time with minimal computer hardware, software, or training additions. The use of schedules to assign cooling conveyor hangers to loaders at specific intervals ensures regular head transfer by attempting to seize all possible opportunities to free the loaders. A genetic algorithm (GA) is solves the case study problem by simulating evolution to generate these schedules. GA 2 ̆ 7 s {{are known for their}} ability to save time in schedule calculations in addition to producing accurate results. The proposed GA attempts to solve a typical cylinder head casting dilemma using the data and information provided from the case study plant. A linear programming model (LPM) was also developed to pattern the case study situation and solved using the LINGO software. The LPM acts as a benchmark for the GA in terms of computation time and accuracy. The proposed GA was eventually named the Casting Production System Genetic Algorithm (CPSGA). In addition to the GA, a graphical user interface (GUI) was designed into the CPSGA structure for improved simplicity in operation by the user. In the end, CPSGA was able to meet all the provisions originally demanded for any case study plant solution.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} a stepping molecular motor consisting of two <b>connected</b> <b>heads.</b> Directional motion of the stepper takes place along a one-dimensional track. Each head is subject to a periodic potential without spatial reflection symmetry. When the potential for one head is switched on, it is switched off for the other head. Additionally, the system is subject to the influence of symmetric, white Lévy noise that mimics the action of external random forcing. The stepper exhibits motion with a preferred direction which is examined by analyzing the median of the displacement of a midpoint between the positions of the two heads. We study the modified dynamics of the stepper by numerical simulations. We find flux reversals as noise parameters are changed. Speed and direction appear to very sensitively depend on characteristics of the noise...|$|R
