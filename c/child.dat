5|$|<b>Child</b> labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the <b>child</b> work force in the age group 4–16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National <b>Child</b> Labour project estimated <b>child</b> labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the <b>child</b> labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} <b>child</b> labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the <b>child</b> labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing <b>child</b> labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on <b>child</b> labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing informal education, free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing <b>child</b> labour like compensation for the <b>child</b> employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of <b>child</b> labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on <b>child</b> labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made.
