5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jack reconnects {{with a friend}} from high school, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), and ponders the possibility of romance as Nancy's marriage is falling apart. When Liz ends up buying an expensive necktie that Jack already owns, they agree to spend zero dollars on their gifts. Jack gets Liz a program from her performance of The Crucible framed in wood from her high school stage — and does not reimburse his office assistant, Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy) for fuel costs. In return, Liz <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bomb threat to Penn Station, keeping Nancy in New York, and finally Jack arranges for Liz to fulfill her dream of meeting Larry Wilcox as Officer Jon Baker from the show CHiPs.|$|E

Reddington briefly escapes custody to meet with Zamani, revealing that unbeknownst to the FBI, he masterminded the ploy, as well as the attack on Tom. Reddington removes the tracking device and places it with Zamani, which helps the FBI track down and kill the latter. Keen finds the daughter and a bomb in her backpack. Reddington <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clandestine bomb tech to disable the bomb, who then escapes with it. Reddington tells Elizabeth that her husband, with whom she is trying to adopt a baby, is not what he appears to be.|$|E

In Roles v Nathan 2 All ER 908 a pair of chimney sweeps were called to clean the flues of a boiler. The engineer warned them about the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning if the chimney sweeps cleaned the flues with the fires still lit, but they disregarded his warning and continued until they were overwhelmed by carbon monoxide and died. The Court of Appeal held that the occupier was not liable, because the chimney sweeps had been warned and a householder who <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specialist to deal with defective property can reasonably expect the specialist to guard against any obvious dangers.|$|E

500|$|Hershiser picked Roberto Alomar off {{at first}} base to end the eighth inning. When the game went into extra innings, Hershiser {{did not want to}} continue: [...] "I really didn't want to break it", Hershiser said. [...] "I wanted to stop at 58. I wanted me and Don to be {{together}} at the top. But the higher sources (Lasorda and Perranoski) told me they weren't taking me out of the game, so I figured, what the heck, I might as well get the guy out." [...] Through the first nine innings, no Padre had reached second base. Lasorda, Perranoski and Ben Hines all felt he owed it to the game and to himself to continue. Hershiser made it through the tenth inning, with the record-setting out being a Keith Moreland flyball caught by right fielder José González. However, he had some close <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> couple of innings. Marvell Wynne struck out swinging to open the inning, but reached first base after a wild pitch evaded [...] catcher Mike Scioscia. The following two hitters, Santiago and Randy Ready, moved Wynne over to third with two outs. Then, Garry Templeton was given an intentional base on balls. Templeton advanced to second base before the final out was recorded.|$|E
500|$|The {{tour was}} {{announced}} on 13 February 1992, {{a little more}} than two weeks before opening night on 29 February at Lakeland Civic Center in Lakeland, Florida. For the opening leg, 32 concerts at indoor arenas in North America were scheduled from February through April. Two days after the tour announcement, tickets for some of the shows first went on sale. While the band had toured North America every year between 1980 and 1987, they had been absent from the region's tour circuit for over four years before Zoo TV. The US concert business was in a slump at the time, and the routing of the first two legs generally allowed only one show per city. This was intended to announce the band's return to major cities, to gauge demand for ticket sales, and to re-introduce the notion of a [...] "hot ticket" [...] to concertgoers. Tickets for the opening show in Florida sold out over the phone in four minutes, demand exceeding supply by a factor of 10 to 1. To combat ticket scalping, the band avoided selling tickets in box offices as much as possible, preferring to sell over the telephone instead. Several cities' telephone systems were overwhelmed when Zoo TV tickets went on sale; Los Angeles telephone company Pacific Bell reported 54million <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-hour period, while Boston's telephone system was temporarily shut down.|$|E

Between each pair of composed function calls, the bind operator can inject into the monadic value some additional information that is not accessible within the function, and pass it along.

[...] When this occurs, the service's ability to provide service to emergency <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> timely manner will often degrade, because of decreased unit availability.

2500|$|At this dire and {{critical}} {{point in the}} battle when the XIV Corps lines were wavering and in disorder, on his own initiative, Bugler William J.

Carson attached himself to the 18th U.S. Infantry's color guard and rallied part of that regiment. Surprised by this sudden stand of defiance, the Confederates slowed their pursuit of the men in retreat. Joined by the 9th Ohio Infantry and the 17th Ohio Infantry, remaining regulars then counterattacked and recaptured the Regular Brigade's artillery. General King then reformed the remaining regulars who had fallen back and sent a party to bring the guns back to the brigade's current position. They were able to do so but did not have enough time or men to save the remaining equipment or ammunition before the Confederates renewed their attack.|$|E
2500|$|The Forward related how one {{individual}} felt: [...] "'There's a great frustration that American Jews {{want to do}} something,' said Ira Youdovin, {{executive vice president of}} the Chicago Board of Rabbis. [...] 'In 1947, some number would have enlisted in the Haganah, ' he said, referring to the pre-state Jewish armed force. [...] 'There was a special American brigade. [...] Nowadays you can't do that. [...] The battle here is the hasbarah war,' Youdovin said, using a Hebrew term for public relations. [...] 'We're winning, but we're very much concerned about the bad stuff.'" [...] Indicative of the diversity of opinion is a 2003 Boston Globe profile of the CAMERA media watchdog group in which Mark Jurkowitz observes: [...] "To its supporters, CAMERA is figuratively - and perhaps literally - doing God's work, battling insidious anti-Israeli bias in the media. [...] But its detractors see CAMERA as a myopic and vindictive special interest group trying to muscle its views into media coverage." [...] A former spokesman for the Israeli Consulate in New York City said that the result of this lobbying of the media was: “Of course, a lot of self-censorship goes on. Journalists, editors, and politicians are going to think twice about criticizing Israel if they know they are going to get thousands of angry <b>calls</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matter of hours.
