5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In Grady v.

5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses from moving, {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E

5|$|Townships and chapelries {{which were}} {{separately}} rated for poor law purposes were formed into civil parishes in 1866. The borough of Leeds contained eleven parishes {{and part of}} two others, and no changes were made to their boundaries until 1894. The Local Government Act 1894 provided that no parish <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> {{in more than one}} local government area, with parishes being divided or amalgamated as required.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of the Solar System, and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter wheels on each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
40|$|The {{suggestions}} made above will doubtless {{require some}} {{more time in}} the field spent in studying the collections made during a day.

25|$|These {{medium wave}} {{emissions}} were modulated with {{a period of}} about , which was interpreted as Saturn's rotation period. Nevertheless, the evidence available in the 1970s was too inconclusive and some scientists thought that Saturn might lack a magnetic field altogether, while others even speculated that the planet <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> beyond the heliopause. The first definite detection of the saturnian magnetic field was made only on September 1, 1979, when it was passed through by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which measured its magnetic field strength directly.|$|E

He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.|$|E
25|$|After {{creating}} four clay sculptures to memorialize his children, Meštrović died {{in early}} 1962, aged 79, in South Bend, Indiana. His funeral Mass was concelebrated by {{the bishops of}} Šibenik, Josip Arnerić, and bishop of Split-Makarska Frane Franić. His remains were interred at a mausoleum in his childhood home of Otavice. Communist Yugoslav authorities had originally promised the Meštrović family that his remains <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> in repose at the cathedrals in Zagreb and Split. Once his remains had arrived in Yugoslavia, however, the authorities reneged and did not allow this to take place. After communist officials interfered during his funeral, his son Mate Meštrović sharply criticized the level of religious freedom in the country.|$|E
25|$|The North Carolina Sounds occupy most of {{the coast}} from Cape Lookout (North Carolina) to the Virginia border. With their eastern borders marked by the Outer Banks, they were almost ideally located for raiding Northern {{maritime}} commerce. Cape Hatteras, the easternmost point in the Confederacy, is {{within sight of the}} Gulf Stream, which moves at a speed of about 3 knots (1.5m/s) at this latitude. Ships in the Caribbean trade would reduce the time of their homeward journeys to New York, Philadelphia, or Boston by riding the stream to the north. Raiders, either privateers or state-owned vessels, <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> inside, protected from both the weather and from Yankee blockaders, until an undefended victim appeared. Watchers stationed at the Hatteras lighthouse would then signal a raider, which would dash out and make a capture, often being able to return the same day.|$|E

500|$|It gave {{two reasons}} for the populist surge across Europe: The [...] "movements tap into a deep discontent with the {{mainstream}} parties in Europe's political systems. Every funding scandal, every politician found to be corrupt, adds more wind to these parties' sails. The European Union, lacking decisive leadership in times of financial difficulty, is an ideal further focus for this ire;" [...] and that populist appeals rely on having [...] "an enemy to hand. This enemy is anyone coming from the outside – immigrants. Anti-immigrant rhetoric {{is the only thing}} in common between the politics of these parties. More mainstream politicians such as David Cameron or Angela Merkel then start to adopt this rhetoric. Add to this the hurt inflicted on Europe's populations due to the financial crisis and stagnant growth, and populists have ready material with which to work." [...] It postulated that a solution <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> with a [...] "traditional approach", which the UK-based paper said was most effectively implemented by the group Hope Not Hate, though it only solved a part of the problem in [...] "exposing the extremes of the populist parties". It added that more mainstream parties {{on both sides of the}} political spectrum need to change as well by ensuring high standards of propriety and ethics and by articulating what it termed [...] "positive and optimistic economic and political solutions" [...] rather than what it said was populist rhetoric.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 1970s, {{ambulance}} service was largely unregulated.

2500|$|In 1954, the Farmer board also {{overturned}} the NLRB's long-standing rule against employer interrogation of employees about protected union activities. The standard enunciated in Standard-Coosa-Thatcher Co. held that any employer inquiry into an employee's {{support for the}} union was a per se violation of section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. But in Blue Flash Express, the Farmer board held that all questioning was acceptable, absent any clearly coercive content (such as promises, threats, etc.). A year later, the Farmer-led board concluded in Gummed Products Company that employers <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> to workers so long as those lies were not so egregious that they [...] "lowered campaign standards" [...] {{to the point where}} worker wishes could no longer be determined.|$|E
2500|$|In casting Good Morning, Miss Bliss, Peter Engel {{knew the}} success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel {{particularly}} envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who [...] "would be that incorrigible kid who <b>could</b> <b>lie</b> to your face, letting you know very well that he's lying, and make you love him for it all the same." [...] Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but {{he turned out to be}} one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel's casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen's charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.|$|E
