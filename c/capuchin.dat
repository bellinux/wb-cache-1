5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is {{an animal}} behavior {{that can be}} linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as <b>capuchin</b> monkeys, tamarins, marmosets, rats, and pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Edinburgh Zoo {{is home to}} a {{world-class}} primate behavioural research centre, Living Links. Living Links consists of a field station and research centre that was developed in a partnership with the University of St Andrews.

50|$|Wedge-capped <b>capuchins</b> {{have been}} {{compared}} to tufted <b>capuchins</b> to discern the relationship between locomotion and skeletal proportions. Wedge-capped <b>capuchins</b> spent relatively more time running and jumping through the forest canopy while tufted <b>capuchins</b> spent more time walking and moving slowly. As such, wedge-capped <b>capuchins</b> have relatively longer limbs (particularly the hind limbs) than tufted <b>capuchins.</b>|$|R
50|$|According {{to genetic}} studies led by Lynch Alfaro in 2011, the gracile and robust <b>capuchins</b> diverged {{approximately}} 6.2 million years ago. Lynch Alfaro suspects that the divergence {{was triggered by}} {{the creation of the}} Amazon River, which separated the monkeys in the Amazon north of the Amazon River, which evolved into the gracile <b>capuchins,</b> from those in the Atlantic Forest south of the river, which evolved into the robust <b>capuchins.</b> Gracile <b>capuchins</b> have longer limbs relative to their body size than robust <b>capuchins.</b> Gracile <b>capuchins</b> have rounder skulls, whereas robust <b>capuchins</b> have jaws better adapted for opening hard nuts. Robust <b>capuchins</b> have crests and the males have beards.|$|R
5000|$|Robust <b>capuchins</b> {{differ in}} {{morphology}} from gracile <b>capuchins</b> {{in a number}} of respects. [...] Some of these are related to behavioral differences between the two genera. [...] Robust <b>capuchins</b> have shorter limbs relative to body size than gracile <b>capuchins.</b> [...] There are significant differences between the skulls of robust and gracile <b>capuchins,</b> particularly among males. [...] These differences include the shape of the nasal aperture and the shape of the mandible. [...] The canine teeth are also different; robust capuchins' canines are shorter and more robust than those of gracile <b>capuchins.</b> [...] Male robust <b>capuchins</b> also have a sagittal crest, which is lacking in gracile <b>capuchins,</b> and larger, thicker mandibles than gracile <b>capuchins.</b> [...] Some of these differences, such as the sagittal crest, the mandibles and teeth reflect robust capuchins' diet, which includes hard nuts and palm fruits that are difficult for gracile <b>capuchins</b> to consume.|$|R
5|$|In this episode, Veronica is {{hired by}} {{researchers}} in the disappearance of a <b>Capuchin</b> monkey being used for animal testing on non-human primates. However, she has {{a change of heart}} after infiltrating an animal rights group as part of the case. Meanwhile, Piz (Chris Lowell) becomes increasingly friendly and gives her advice, but after a heartfelt talk about love, Veronica decides to start dating Logan again. In addition, Keith (Enrico Colantoni) starts investigating Dean O'Dell's (Ed Begley, Jr.) mysterious death.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} then {{arranged for}} the body to be hidden at a <b>Capuchin</b> monastery {{in the small town}} of Cerro Maggiore where it remained for the next eleven years. The whereabouts of the body was kept a secret, even from Mussolini's family. This remained the position until May 1957, when the newly appointed Prime Minister, Adone Zoli, agreed to Mussolini's re-interment at his place of birth in Predappio in Romagna. Zoli was reliant on the far right (including Leccisi himself, who was now a neo-fascist party deputy) to support him in Parliament. He also came from Predappio and knew Mussolini's widow, Rachele, well.|$|E
5|$|In May 1840, Etty {{finally made}} the trip to Brussels and Antwerp {{which he had been}} forced by {{revolution}} to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited Ostend, Bruges, Antwerp, Brussels, Aachen, Cologne, Bonn and Rotterdam in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and Mechelen for a longer visit to visit St. Rumbold's Cathedral and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a Trappist monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist habit; he also bought a <b>Capuchin</b> habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.|$|E
5000|$|Robust <b>capuchins</b> {{also have}} some uniformly {{consistent}} features of their fur. All robust <b>capuchins</b> have a tuft of fur on their head, {{at least to some}} extent, while no male gracile <b>capuchins</b> have such a tuft. [...] They also all have a beard to some degree, which gracile <b>capuchins</b> lack. [...] All robust <b>capuchins</b> have dark fur along their [...] "sideburns" [...] and above their eyes.|$|R

5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the <b>Capuchin</b> Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5|$|The stolen <b>capuchin</b> monkey named Oscar {{is played}} by live animal actor Katie, best known for playing Marcel, Ross Geller's pet monkey, on the sitcom Friends. Near {{the time of the}} episode's airing, she had also {{appeared}} in Bruce Almighty and an episode of 30 Rock. When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing a poor job on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature. They immediately included the take in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
25|$|White-fronted <b>capuchin</b> {{populations are}} declining. The decline is {{believed}} to be caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation, and hunting. In 2008 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classified the Ecuadorian white-fronted <b>capuchin</b> (ssp. aequatorialis) and the Trinidad white-fronted <b>capuchin</b> (ssp. trinitatis) as critically endangered, and the varied white-fronted <b>capuchin</b> (ssp. versicolor) in Colombia is classified as endangered.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Systematic {{studies on}} facial {{displays}} in <b>capuchins</b> are limited and based mainly on studies of tufted <b>capuchins</b> (Cebus apella). Despite the great socialmorphological variability within Cebus suggesting possible morphological and functional {{variations in the}} facial displays of different species, no study has considered thoroughly visual communication in the genus. Our aim was to describe the facial displays of white-faced <b>capuchins</b> and to assess their distribution and communicative function. We observed 15 captive white-faced <b>capuchins</b> in the Primate Centre of the Louis Pasteur University of Strasbourg, {{for a total of}} 198 h. We described the following facial displays: relaxed open-mouth, lip-smacking, open-mouth threat-face, silent baredteeth, open-mouth silent bared-teeth, protruded-lip face, and tongue-out. We never observed the scalp-lifting display, {{one of the most common}} displays characterizing tufted <b>capuchins.</b> White-faced <b>capuchins</b> use the majority of facial displays in an affiliative or playful context; only the open-mouth threat-face display is associated with aggressive behaviors. White-faced <b>capuchins</b> lack ritualized signals of submission. The fact that in white-faced <b>capuchins</b> the silent bared-teeth display conveys only a positive message, while in tufted <b>capuchins</b> it signals submission as well as affiliation, supports the covariation hypothesis (Thierry 2004 Social epigenesis.

50|$|After {{the first}} two decades of the 18th century, fewer <b>Capuchins</b> came to Kongo, and Portuguese policies, which {{restricted}} the ability of <b>Capuchins</b> to enter Angola and Kongo, hampered the 18th century mission as well. For most of the mid-18th century {{there was only one}} missionary in the country, {{and by the end of}} the century, there were many years with no <b>Capuchins.</b> The <b>Capuchins</b> finally left Central Africa altogether in 1835, and by then they had not had a missionary in Kongo since 1814.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} as International Journal of Primatology, Vol. 12, No. 3, June 1991, pp. 277 - 286. It is available from: [URL] only entryThe {{responses to a}} model snake in captive crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) and captive tufted <b>capuchins</b> (Cebus apella) were investigated. In both species the amount of fear behavior was higher {{in the presence of}} the model than during baseline conditions. Unlike the macaques, in the <b>capuchins</b> the frequency of these behaviors decreased across trials. In the two species the amount of explorative and manipulative behaviors and the use of space were also different. Unlike macaques, all <b>capuchins</b> manipulated the objects available in the testing room, and three subjects contacted the apparatus by using objects. Macaques did not show significant preferences for any particular part of the testing room. In both conditions, <b>capuchins</b> used the floor more than macaques did. Further, <b>capuchins</b> increased the use of the floor across experimental trials. Latency to reach the floor was higher in macaques than in <b>capuchins.</b> When on the floor, <b>capuchins</b> spent most of the time close to the snake apparatus. It is proposed that the behavioral differences between <b>capuchins</b> and macaques in the responses to a potential predator indicate that <b>capuchins</b> have a greater propensity to explore and to contact the novel stimulus directly, or by means of objects, than macaques do. These tendencies may lead to the exploitation of novel features in the environment...|$|R
25|$|The {{church of}} <b>Capuchin</b> Fathers, {{is a single}} nave {{building}} with three lateral chapels on each side. Corso Umberto I, ideally equivalent to the Royal street of Copenhagen, is a straight street connecting Piazza Europa to the church of <b>Capuchin</b> Fathers. The church was completed in 1784, and dedicated to a <b>Capuchin</b> friar, Saint Seraphim of Montegranaro. The interiors were finely decorated by the Sicilian <b>Capuchin</b> friar, painter and littérateur, Fidelis of San Biagio (1717–1801). He painted: Immaculate Conception with Saint Seraphim of Montegranaro, Saint Francis receiving stigmata, martyrdom of Saint Fidelis of Sigmaringen, ecstasy of Saint Lawrence of Brindisi, Sacred Family with Saint Felix of Cantalice, martyrdom of Saint Joseph of Leonessa. The painting representing the blessed Bernard of Corleone was lost during World War II. At present, the church {{is dedicated to the}} Assumption of Mary.

50|$|The Jesuits were {{followed}} in 1645 by the <b>Capuchins.</b> <b>Capuchins</b> came to Kongo largely because Kongo kings, beginning with Álvaro II of Kongo, were {{dissatisfied with the}} failure of the bishops to ordain sufficient clergy and the Portuguese crown's opposition to the ordination of Kongolese. Kongo demanded that its church be separated from that of Portugal and that Angolan interests from the rival and increasingly enemy colony that often controlled the episcopal office. As a compromise, the Papacy decided to send Italian <b>Capuchins</b> from areas that were not objectionable to Portugal to Kongo. Although officially missionaries, the <b>Capuchins</b> were as much like parish priests as missionaries to the unconverted. In fact, this parish priest role put them frequently at odds with the secular clergy, who <b>Capuchins</b> charged were lax in their duties and too tolerant of traditional Kongolese religion.|$|R
