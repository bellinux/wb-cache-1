Tanagers are often brightly colored, but some species are black and white. Birds in their first year are often duller or a different color altogether.

50|$|The related giant <b>conebill</b> is more distinct: {{it belongs}} to the {{monotypic}} genus Oreomanes. The record of an apparent intergeneric hybrid with white-browed <b>conebill</b> (Oreomanes fraseri x Conirostrum ferrugineiventre) suggests the giant <b>conebill</b> may belong in Conirostrum possibly in the nominate subgenus.|$|E
50|$|The New World warblers {{are closely}} related to the tanagers, and some species like the <b>conebills</b> Conirostrum and the {{bananaquit}} have been placed into either group by different authorities.

40|$|Abstract: Eight nests of the Giant <b>Conebill</b> (Oreomanes fraseri, Family Thraupidae) {{were found}} in Polylepis forest {{fragments}} in Cochabamba Department (Sacha Loma and Cuturi) of Bolivia during 2002 - 2004. The breeding period of the Giant <b>Conebill</b> extended from September to December {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. The nests were open CLIPS With all average outside width of 20 cm and a thick rim of 5. 5 cm the average clutch size was 1. 86. Nests were constructed mostly with parts of Polylepis trees and a variety of mosses. All nests located were in the interior of forests. Well camouflaged, and in trees with in average height of 3. 16 In. Control of human disturbance, especially burning, is needed for protection of the habitat of the Giant <b>Conebill...</b>|$|E
40|$|Blood parasites exert {{significant}} selective pressure, {{which can}} alter population dynamics, {{and the introduction}} of new parasite lineages in a region could lead to the extinction of endemic avian species that have not coevolved with them. The avifauna of the Pampa del Tamarugal in the desert of Atacama, Chile, is highly depauperate, with two species accounting for the greatest numbers: the widespread Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis) and the endemic Tamarugo <b>Conebill</b> (Conirostrum tamarugense). We used molecular and microscopic methods to estimate the prevalence of haemoparasites in birds inhabiting the Pampa del Tamarugal. The molecular screening of the samples from the most common species indicated that the Tamarugo <b>Conebill</b> was only infected by parasites of the genus Leucocytozoon (prevalence 3. 5 %) and the Rufous-collared Sparrow was uninfected. Only two other bird species (of a total of seven) were infected, the House Sparrow (Passer domesticus), by Plasmodium relictum (prevalence 30 %), and the Eared Dove (Zenaida auriculata), by Haemoproteus multipigmentatus (prevalence 100 %). The occurrence of House Sparrows infected with the Plasmodium haplotype GRW 4 (involved in Hawaiian bird extinctions) may entail the risk of potential host-switching, something particularly relevant for the conservation of the endemic and vulnerable Tamarugo <b>Conebill.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The Giant <b>Conebill</b> Oreomanes fraseri is a {{specialist}} of high Andean Polylepis forest remnants. With {{the aid of}} radio-tracking and visual observations, the average 100 % minimum convex polygon home range size of seven adult individuals was 7. 15 ha. Range size decreased with increasing tree density, and for equal tree densities, it was larger in the Study site with larger Polylepis fragments. Home ranges often comprised areas that were largely or entirely devoid of trees. Within home ranges, space use significantly varied with time of day, and this pattern tended to be largely consistent among days. Given the large extent of variation in size and structure already observed in this small sample of home ranges, we suggest that apart from the size, shape, structure and degree of isolation of the remaining forest patches, also their topographic location, and hence sun exposure, {{may be an important}} consideration when designing conservation strategies for Giant <b>Conebill...</b>|$|E

The single bird was seen on 26 September 1997 in the steep-sided quebrada of the rio Peña Negra, about 10 km west of Rodeo Pampa, Salta at ca. 3150 m. Based on colour pattern we assume it was an immature. We found the bird in a partially logged Polylepis (Rosaceae) woodland. This habitat is being generally c 1 eared all over its range, giving a strong cause {{of concern for the}} conservation of this near-threatened species, and several others that share this habitat...|$|E
