40|$|Abstract—Many {{algorithm}} {{exist for}} <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> certain data. But less research is {{been done on}} algorithms {{which can be used}} for <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Random data. Data which lack predictability is known as Random data. <b>Clustering</b> <b>of</b> such data is difficult task. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm called as Hybrid Hierarchical algorithm. This algorithm will be used for <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Random data. It will perform <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> data which are similar to each other as well as it will also form a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> data which are dissimilar. It will be applicable for both text and graphical data. It will simplify data complexity...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of development program formation for territorial community {{based on the}} cluster approach has been offered. The mechanism {{is based on a}} conceptual <b>cluster</b> model <b>of</b> programs. This model includes four clusters: <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> objects that form the capability <b>of</b> territorial community, <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> objects that form "overcapability" <b>of</b> the community; <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> objects that define the focus area of the territorial community; and a <b>cluster</b> <b>of</b> objects that do not meet the overall focus area of local community, but generate some profit.

40|$|Abstract. The {{observed}} <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> Lyman-α {{lines is}} reviewed and {{compared with the}} <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> CIV systems. We argue that a continuity of properties exists between Lyman-α and metal systems and show that the small-scale <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> the absorbers {{is consistent with a}} scenario of gravitationally induced correlations.

5|$|As {{the more}} massive stars appear, they {{transform}} the cloud into an H II region (ionized atomic hydrogen) of glowing gas and plasma. The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind {{one or more}} young open <b>clusters</b> <b>of</b> stars. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join {{the population of the}} Milky Way.|$|E

40|$|A {{clustering}} {{method that}} combined density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise with mathematical morphology clustering is proposed {{to adapt to}} the features of driver’s fixation such as points’ dispersion and fixation regions’ irregularity and solve the problems of conventional density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise method’s large influence by parameters and mathematical morphology clustering’s needs of much manual intervention. Drivers’ fixation data were collected by Smart Eye Pro 5. 7 eye tracking system, and the data were processed and clustered using conventional clustering methods and density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method. The results show that the method proposed in this article takes into account the advantages <b>of</b> density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise and mathematical morphology clustering to cluster irregular regions and makes up for defects <b>of</b> conventional <b>clustering</b> methods. It is verified that density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise–mathematical morphology clustering method is better than the conventional hierarchical clustering method and density-based spatial <b>clustering</b> <b>of</b> applications with noise method in driver’s fixation points clustering and can improve the quality of driver’s fixation region division...|$|R
