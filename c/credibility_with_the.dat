The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing <b>credibility</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful toward them.|$|E
25|$|Colby's time as DCI {{was also}} eventful {{on the world}} stage. Shortly after he assumed leadership, the Yom Kippur War broke out, an event that {{surprised}} not only the American intelligence agencies but also the Israelis. This intelligence surprise reportedly affected Colby's <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Nixon administration. Colby participated in the National Security Council meetings that responded to apparent Soviet intentions {{to intervene in the}} war by raising the alert level of U.S. forces to DEFCON 3 and defusing the crisis. In 1975, after many years of involvement, South Vietnam fell to Communist forces in April 1975, a particularly difficult blow for Colby, who had dedicated so much of his life and career to the American effort there. Events in the arms-control field, Angola, Australia, the Middle East, and elsewhere also demanded attention.|$|E

40|$|In this paper. the won-lost {{record of}} {{baseball}} {{teams will be}} used to examine and illustrate credibility concepts. This illustrative example is analogous to the use of experience rating in insurance. It provides supplementary reading ma-terial for students who are studying credibility theory. This example illustrates a situation where the phenomenon of shifring parameters over time has a very significant impact. The effects of this phenomenon are examined. Three different criteria {{that can be used to}} select the #primal credibility are examined: least squares, limited jluc-tuation and MeyersJDorweiler. In applications, one or more of these three criteria should be useful. it is shown that the mean squared error can be written as a second order polynomial in <b>the</b> <b>credibilities</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coef-jicients of this polynomial written in terms of the covariance structure of the data. It is then shown that linear equation(s) can be solved for the least squares credibiliries in terms of the covariance structure.

500|$|After {{two more}} EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now {{composed}} of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material {{in addition to}} tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, [...] "inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less [...] "goofy" [...] than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it [...] "difficult to say where [...] is in the picture".

Lauren Summerford of Jesus Freak Hideout stated that [...] "Lead single 'So Long Self' is one the best tracks Coming Up To Breathe has to offer.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the profound difficulties of maintaining fixed exchange rates {{in a world}} of expanding global capital markets. Contrary to popular wisdom, industrialized-country monetary authorities easily have the resources to defend exchange parities against virtually any private speculative attack. But if their commitment to use those resources lacks <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> markets, <b>the</b> costs to the broader economy of defending an exchange-rate peg can be very high. The dynamic interplay between credibility and commitment is illustrated by the 1992 Swedish and British crises and the 1994 - 95 Mexican collapse. The authors also discuss the small number of successful fixers. ...|$|R

2500|$|The battalion's first target, as {{proposed}} by both Farran and Lees, was {{the headquarters of the}} German 51 Mountain Corps (LI Gebirgs Korps) of General Valentin Feurstein and then leaded from General Friedrich-Wilhelm Hauck, stationed in the area of Albinea, 20 miles from where they landed. Army Group Headquarters initially agreed with the proposal and supplied aerial photography of the headquarters. At the same time, it was discovered that local German forces were beginning an anti-partisan drive into the mountains where the battalion was stationed. Despite this however, Farran decided to continue with the attack, and was en route to the headquarters with the battalion when he was contacted by Army Group Headquarters, who withdrew permission for the attack to take place. Farran took the decision to ignore the injunction and continue on towards the target, on the grounds that he might lose all <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> partisans if their first operation was cancelled. Farran had conducted a personal reconnaissance of the headquarters on 23 March, and the battalion arrived in three columns at a farm about [...] from the target on 26 March.

2500|$|Gabriel Rotello blogged about McAlary in The Huffington Post {{after hearing}} about the play. He noted that McAlary {{represented}} {{a lot of things}} to a lot of people, but as the first openly gay columnist, Rotello viewed McAlary unfavorably. According to Rotello, McAlary was an aggressive journalist who had a reputation for reporting on corrupt cops and miscreants in New York City's crack era. He relied heavily on police sources, hanging out with then-New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and his mouthpiece, John Miller. His career was built on high-level access rather than using street sources and fact-corroboration. He became prominent in the public eye in Spring 1994 when a black lesbian reported that she had been raped in broad daylight in Brooklyn's Prospect Park. The headline on McAlary's story read [...] "Rape Hoax the Real Crime", with a story alleging that the woman had concocted the story for political purposes such as speaking at lesbian rallies. At the time, New York had recently endured the Tawana Brawley rape allegations, and gaybashing was at its apex. The police then revealed substantial evidence in support of the story and began investigating McAlary's source. Two weeks later McAlary affirmed his story, and the police backed off the investigation. Rotello, who was then with New York Newsday, got Miller on tape confirming that McAlary was begging his police contacts to back him up. McAlary lost <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> police and the gay community. Rotello concedes, however, that McAlary later had major success.|$|E

Findings – The paper finds that with an understanding of interest-based negotiation, the public relations counselor can introduce clients to a highly valuable approach for managing differences or overcoming obstacles. Using carefully articulated principles, steps, and techniques, interest-based negotiation can improve client 2 ̆ 7 s ability to establish trust and <b>credibility</b> <b>with</b> stakeholders. <b>The</b> approach also can play a significant role in helping strengthen rapport in the public relations consultant-client relationship...|$|R
