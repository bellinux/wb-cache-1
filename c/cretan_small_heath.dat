5000|$|On a {{slippery}} pitch in [...] "a perfect deluge", <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> held hosts Sunderland Albion to a one-all draw at half-time, {{but in the}} second half, Sunderland scored five goals without reply; Charsley [...] "was indifferently supported, and the visitors seemed to fall all to pieces". At home to The Wednesday in similar conditions, Devey gave <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> a two-goal lead, but although Speller was able to frustrate many of Wednesday's left-wing attacks, {{they were able to}} score twice to draw the game. The Birmingham Daily Post thought <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> had done well to secure a draw, because their forwards passed wildly and lacked any effective combination, while Wednesday's forwards had been profligate in front of goal. The Sheffield Independent concurred that <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> were [...] "somewhat lucky" [...] to draw, as [...] "in every part of the game Wednesday surpassed their opponents", and <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> only managed to keep them out by defending in numbers. The result left them seventh in the table, having spent September in the top three.

After Wanderers equalised, Tommy Hands received a kick on the temple– the player habitually stooped low to head the ball– and the ten men of <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> settled for a draw. The draw cost <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> £20, to be paid to Lincoln City, their scheduled opponents for the following Saturday, in compensation for their match being postponed to accommodate the Cup replay. Wanderers put up a better show in the replay, and <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> half backs were [...] "unaccountably insecure", but strong defensive play by goalkeeper Chris Charsley and full backs Tom Bayley and Fred Speller allowed Heath to cling on to a 2–1 win.|$|R

5000|$|The players {{underwent}} [...] "special preparation" [...] for the first-round FA Cup-tie {{at home to}} Manchester City. According to the Sheffield Independent, [...] "probably the visitors, Manchester City, are {{the more}} skilful team, but <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> are gluttons for goals at Coventry road, and there {{is likely to be}} a very lively hour and half's play". A crowd estimated at between 15,000 and 18,000 attended to witness that prediction prove accurate. Early goals from Abbott and City's George Dougal preceded <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> taking a half-time lead via [...] "a very clever piece of work" [...] by McRoberts. City were [...] "showing perhaps the greater skill, but <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> working most pluckily". After an equaliser from Billie Gillespie, <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> [...] "had more than one easy chance of scoring, the men missing opportunities which should have been utilised", until five minutes from time, McRoberts gave them the victory. Cab-drivers who regularly transported football followers from Aston Villa's ground back to the city centre were hopeful of taking advantage of the large attendance to do the same from <b>Small</b> <b>Heath.</b> However, they had few takers, [...] "quite half the brakes returned to the centre of the city empty", and the Owl wondered if one might infer that [...] "those who go to Aston can afford to ride, whereas those who patronise <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> find it cheaper to walk". Without Pratt, Leake and Inglis, <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> lost the Birmingham Cup replay 5-2.|$|R

A one-nil friendly win against West Bromwich Albion preceded the return fixture with Gainsborough, won by <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> by a single goal in a match where the visitors [...] "rarely crossed the centre line" [...] {{in the second half}} and the home side missed numerous chances.

500|$|In {{the second}} half, <b>Small</b> <b>Heath's</b> {{forwards}} took control, and repeated attacks resulted in goals from Hallam and from Hands after Hallam had struck the bar.

The game was begun by <b>Small</b> <b>Heath,</b> who were for the moment pressed by their opponents. When near the <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> goal Speller and Campbell came into contact with each other, and Speller fell to the ground with a broken leg. A policeman, a member of the St. John's Ambulance Corps, attended to the limb, and the injured man was removed from the field on a plank. [...] He was taken to the Queen's Hospital for treatment. The following April, <b>Small</b> <b>Heath</b> and Darwen played a benefit match for Speller; unfortunately for the beneficiary, the attendance was adversely affected by the Birmingham Charity Cup match between Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion on the same day.
