Comparisons of the parameterization scheme with a well-established three-dimensional <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> model, and also with the <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> module of a regional model have been used to formulate and test this parameterization scheme.

Comparisons of results for a variety of initial conditions show that wet-deposition of sulphate, nitrate and ammonium ions tend to be underpredicted by the cloud module and that the pH of the rain is overpredicted.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of iron dissolution from aerosol particles on <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> and presents improvements in modeling of the associated multiphase processes. Iron redox species are important pollutants; they are very reactive in clouds especially through their interactions with HXOy compounds. Solid phase iron is transferred into the aqueous-phase by dissolution. The rate of dissolution of iron drives its concentration in the solid and aqueous-phases and has been determined in laboratory based on dissolution experiments using an urban particles standard. The parameterization of the iron dissolution rate and iron redox speciation {{as a function of}} time, stemming from the experimental data, was implemented in the <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> model M 2 C 2 (Model of Multiphase <b>Cloud</b> <b>Chemistry).</b> A continental cloud event with simplified microphysical properties was simulated. Two simulations were performed: (1) using a predefined fixed iron content, and (2) using iron content values evolving temporally resulting from the dissolution parameterization. Numerical results show that the iron speciation (i. e. the partitioning between iron oxidation states) is driven by the chemical reactivity and not by dissolution. The oxidative capacity of the atmospheric cloud water decreases when dissolution is included in the model. The flux of OH radicals produced is positively correlated to the concentration of iron present that continuously increases with time throughout the simulation. Thus, ignoring the iron dissolution kinetics results in overestimations of net OH production, by factors of 1. 7 and 1. 2 after 5 minutes and 2 hours of the simulation, respectively. This study concludes that the consideration of the dissolution process is potentially important in estimating radical concentrations and hence cloud oxidative capacity...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of an extendable aqueous-phase chemistry option (AQCHEM − KMT(I)) for the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system, version 5. 1. Here, the Kinetic PreProcessor (KPP), version 2. 2. 3, is used to generate a Rosenbrock solver (Rodas 3) to integrate the stiff system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the mass transfer, chemical kinetics, and scavenging processes of CMAQ clouds. CMAQ's standard <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> module (AQCHEM) is structurally limited to the treatment of a simple chemical mechanism. This work advances our ability to test and implement more sophisticated aqueous chemical mechanisms in CMAQ and further investigate the impacts of microphysical parameters on <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Box model <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> simulations were performed to choose efficient solver and tolerance settings, evaluate the implementation of the KPP solver, and assess the direct impacts of alternative solver and kinetic mass transfer on predicted concentrations for a range of scenarios. Month-long CMAQ simulations for winter and summer periods over the US reveal the changes in model predictions due to these cloud module updates within the full chemical transport model. While monthly average CMAQ predictions are not drastically altered between AQCHEM and AQCHEM − KMT, hourly concentration differences can be significant.

40|$|Aerosol-cloud {{interactions}} (aerosol indirect effects) play {{an important}} role in regional meteorological variations, which could further induce feedback on regional air quality. While the impact of aerosol-cloud interactions on meteorology and climate has been extensively studied, their feedback on air quality remains unclear. Using a fully coupled meteorology-chemistry model, we find that increased aerosol loading due to anthropogenic activities in China substantially increases column cloud droplet number concentration and liquid water path (LWP), which further leads to a reduction in the downward shortwave radiation at surface, surface air temperature and planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. The shallower PBL and accelerated <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> due to larger LWP in turn enhance the concentrations of particulate matter with diameter less than 2. 5 [*]μm (PM 2. 5) by up to 33. 2 [*]μg m− 3 (25. 1 %) and 11. 0 [*]μg m− 3 (12. 5 %) in January and July, respectively. Such a positive feedback amplifies the changes in PM 2. 5 concentrations, indicating an additional air quality benefit under effective pollution control policies but a penalty for a region with a deterioration in PM 2. 5 pollution. Additionally, we show that the cloud processing of aerosols, including wet scavenging and <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry,</b> could also have substantial effects on PM 2. 5 concentrations...|$|E

However, these models are still subject to many uncertainties {{related to the}} aqueous chemical mechanism they used. Particularly, the role of oxidants such as iron and hydrogen peroxide in the oxidative capacity of the cloud aqueous phase has typically never been validated against laboratory experimental data. To fill this gap, we adapted the M 2 C 2 model (Model of Multiphase <b>Cloud</b> <b>Chemistry)</b> to simulate irradiation experiments on synthetic aqueous solutions under controlled conditions (e. g., pH, temperature, light intensity) and for actual cloud water samples. Various chemical compounds that purportedly contribute to the oxidative budget in cloud water (i. e., iron, oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide: H 2 O 2) were considered. Organic compounds (oxalic, formic and acetic acids) were taken into account as target species {{because they have the}} potential to form iron complexes and are good indicators of the oxidative capacity of the cloud aqueous phase via their oxidation in this medium. The range of concentrations for all of the chemical compounds evaluated was representative of in situ measurements. Numerical outputs were compared with experimental data that consisted of a time evolution of the concentrations of the target species. The chemical mechanism in the model describing the "oxidative engine" of the HxOy/iron (HxOy = H 2 O 2, HO 2 radical dot/O 2 radical dot− and HOradical dot) chemical system was consistent with laboratory measurements. Thus, the degradation of the carboxylic acids evaluated was closely reproduced by the model. However, photolysis of the Fe(C 2 O 4) + complex needs to be considered in <b>cloud</b> <b>chemistry</b> models for polluted conditions (i. e., acidic pH) to correctly reproduce oxalic acid degradation. We also show that iron and formic acid lead to a stable complex whose photoreactivity has currently not been investigated.

Nitric oxide was observed by means of its two 2 Pi 1 / 2, J = 3 / 2 - 1 / 2, rotational transitions at 150. 2 and 150. 5 GHz, which occur because of Lambda-doubling. The inferred column density for L 134 N is about 5 x 10 to the 14 th/sq cm toward the SO peak in that cloud. This value corresponds to a fractional abundance relative to molecular hydrogen of about 6 x 10 to the - 8 th and is in good agreement with predictions of quiescent <b>cloud</b> ion-molecule <b>chemistry.</b> NO was not detected toward the dark cloud TMC- 1 at an upper limit of 3 x 10 to the - 8 th or less...|$|R
