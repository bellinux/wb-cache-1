5000|$|When the warlike mixed group {{conventionally}} {{referred to}} as Dorians arrived on Crete from the Peloponnese after ca 1100 BCE, archaeological reconstructions suggest {{that they would have}} found the Minoan people living along with the Mycenaeans, surviving as an underclass. No doubt the Minoan language continued to be spoken by the peasants, though inscriptions, now in Linear B, were all in a form of Greek associated with a Mycenaean upper class (BBC). The Dorians seem to have driven the local people up into the hills; the latest towns with Minoan material culture are in more and more inaccessible places, {{one of the largest and}} most extensive settlements being at Karfi, high in the Dikti Mountains. At this high, remote, ancient, and sacred site a fragment of Minoan civilization survived intact for about 400 years after the occupation of Knossos. Archaeological remains include house complexes, some of which resemble the megaron-type building with central hearth, and a [...] "Temple" [...] or sanctuary, where votive figures were found.

The oil platform at the Gullfaks C field was equipped with 22 m long skirts. The Troll A platform is founded in 330 m depth with 30 m long skirts and is the world’s biggest gravity platform.|$|R

40|$|Large {{elevated}} steel silos for {{the storage}} of bulk solids generally consist of a cylindrical vessel above a conical discharge hopper supported on a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>skirt.</b> The cone-cylinder-skirt transition junction is subject to a large circumferential compressive force which {{is derived from the}} horizontal component of the meridional tension in the conical hopper, so either a ring is provided or the shell walls are locally thickened to strengthen the junction. Extensive theoretical studies have examined the buckling and collapse strengths of these junctions, leading to theoretically based design proposals. However, no previous experimental study on steel silo transition junctions has been reported due to the considerable difficulties associated with testing these thin-shell junctions at model scale. This paper presents the results of a series of tests on cone-cylinder-skirt-ring junctions in steel silos under simulated bulk solid loading. In addition to the presentation of test results including geometric imperfections and failure behavior, the determination of buckling modes and loads based on displacement measurements is examined in detail.

40|$|We use time-domain {{electromagnetic}} simulations {{to determine}} the spectral characteristics of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) antenna. These simulations {{are part of a}} multi-faceted campaign {{to determine the}} effectiveness of the dish's design for obtaining a detection of redshifted 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization. Our simulations show the existence of reflections between HERA's suspended feed and its parabolic dish reflector that fall below − 40 dB at 150 ns and, for reasonable impedance matches, have a negligible impact on HERA's ability to constrain EoR parameters. It follows that despite the reflections they introduce, dishes are effective for increasing the sensitivity of EoR experiments at a relatively low cost. We find that electromagnetic resonances in the HERA feed's <b>cylindrical</b> <b>skirt,</b> which is intended to reduce cross coupling and beam ellipticity, introduces significant power at large delays (− 40 dB at 200 ns), which can lead to some loss of measurable Fourier modes and a modest reduction in sensitivity. Even in the presence of this structure, we find that the spectral response of the antenna is sufficiently smooth for delay filtering to contain foreground emission at line-of-sight wave numbers below k ∥ ≲ 0. 2 h Mpc⁻¹, in the region where the current PAPER experiment operates. Incorporating these results into a Fisher Matrix analysis, we find that the spectral structure observed in our simulations has only a small effect on the tight constraints HERA can achieve on parameters associated with the astrophysics of reionization.

40|$|Ship-ice {{interaction}} scenarios {{have been}} investigated for possible operation routes in Arctic areas and six scenarios were selected to study the structural response of Cargo Containment Systems (CCS) in both membrane and spherical types of LNG ships. For selected ship-ice interaction scenarios, ice loads and loading areas in the hull structure were determined based on the energy theory. For membrane-type LNG carriers, CCS is made of very different materials such as plywood, foam and mastic. A local FE model including the partial hull structure with one panel of individual CCS has been developed for analysis purposes. For Moss-type LNG carriers, the tank system consists of a spherical tank and a <b>cylindrical</b> supporting <b>skirt</b> structure.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the use of}} the Finite Element Method (a {{numerical}} modelling technique), for the studying steelpan acoustics is demonstrated. The steelpan is characterized as a three-dimensional compound shell, in which notes are founded on a concave ellipsoidal surface attached to a <b>cylindrical</b> body (<b>skirt).</b> In this phase of model development, the linear transverse vibratory modes of two members of the steelpan family are studied (Basses and Tenor Basses). Modes shapes and frequencies of the composite structure are computed for typical configurations of note and skirt geometry. The model demonstrates that there exist many composite natural modes of a playing surface involving the interaction between two or more notes. In addition, it is found that the frequency range of mode shapes associated primarily within skirt vibration overlaps with the musical range of the notes underscoring the potential for “skirt-note ” coupling. The degree of frequency overlap was found to be largely dependent on skirt length and configuration. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLarge flat land surfaces, where direct normal {{irradiance}} (DNI) is {{high enough}} for {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP), are scarce in Europe. Floating offshore solar power plants in the Mediterranean Sea could increase the European solar power resources significantly. In this paper a solar collector platform design is investigated, where individual platform segments are supported by several air chambers, which are formed by <b>cylindrical</b> flexible membrane <b>skirts.</b> This paper {{is focused on the}} optical performance of the collector platform which is simulated in a dynamic model. Two types of concentrators are considered: (1) Parabolic Trough Collectors and (2) Pneumatic Pre-Stressed Solar Concentrators. From experimental data gained from a 4 x 4 m physical model, we have obtained the general characteristics of the platform. Using wave data of the Mediterranean Sea, the motion of the platform in different sea states is calculated. The dependency of the concentrator system on the angle of incident, which is in this case also a function of the platform motion due to ocean waves, is obtained from ray tracing. Solar irradiance is derived from satellite data and also included in the model. Combining all these data in one dynamic model, the achievable optical performance of a floating offshore solar power plant is calculated as a function of time and location...|$|R
40|$|The {{cold flow}} {{verification}} test facility {{consists of a}} 15 -foot high, 3 -foot diameter, domed vessel made of clear acrylic in two flanged sections. The unit can operate up to pressures of 14 psig. The internals include a 10 -foot high jetting fluidized bed, a cylindrical baffle that hangs from the dome, and a rotating grate for control of continuous solids removal. The fluid bed is continuously fed solids (20 to 150 lb/hr) through a central nozzle made up of concentric pipes. It can either be configured as a half or full cylinder of various dimensions. The fluid bed has flow loops for separate air flow control for conveying solids (inner jet, 500 to 100000 scfh), make-up into the jet (outer jet, 500 to 8000 scfh), spargers in the solids removal annulus (100 to 2000 scfh), and 6 air jets (20 to 200 scfh) on the sloping conical grid. Additional air (500 to 10000 scfh) {{can be added to}} the top of the dome and under the rotating grate.
