40|$|<b>Block</b> <b>assembly</b> consumes the {{majority}} of processing time and resources in shipbuilding, and the block spatial scheduling (BSS) related to <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> has been widely studied {{as the key to}} improve shipbuilding efficiency. BSS is a complicated NP-hard problem that aims to minimize the makespan. Since each block has specific building time and space constraints, the BSS problem can be hardly found with an acceptable solution by using constant scheduling rules. Thus, in this study, we considered the BSS problem as a time-constrained 3 D bin packing mathematical model and proposed an allocation algorithm, best contact algorithm (BCA), that is more suitable for dynamic processes. Then, for global optimization of the BSS problem, we regarded the starting time of each block as a variable and used the genetic algorithm (GA) to operate and optimize the <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> sequence. Finally, we tested the BCA + GA scheduling system with real data from a shipyard and thereby determined the block scheduling status and the daily utilization rate of the work plate. Comparison shows that the proposed algorithm is able to get shorter makespan and better block scheduling effect; it realized the optimization of the block spatial scheduling dynamically...|$|R

40|$|We develop {{advanced}} Monte Carlo sampling {{schemes and}} {{new methods of}} calculating thermodynamic partition functions {{that are used to}} study the self-assembly of complicated ``patchy '' particles. Patchy particles are characterized by their strong anisotropic interactions, which can cause critical slowing down in Monte Carlo simulations of their self-assembly. We prove that detailed balance is maintained for our implementation of Monte Carlo cluster moves that ameliorate critical slowing down and use these simulations to predict the structures self-assembled by patchy tetrominoes. We compare structures predicted from our simulations with those generated by an alternative learning-augmented Monte Carlo approach and show that the learning-augmented approach fails to sample thermodynamic ensembles. We prove one way to maintain detailed balance when parallelizing Monte Carlo using the checkerboard domain decomposition scheme by enumerating the state-to-state transitions for a simple model with general applicability. Our implementation of checkerboard Monte Carlo on graphics processing units enables accelerated sampling of thermodynamic properties and we use it to confirm the fluid-hexatic transition observed at high packing fractions of hard disks. We develop a new method, bottom-up building <b>block</b> <b>assembly,</b> which generates partition functions hierarchically. Bottom-up building <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> provides a means to answer the question of which structures are favored at a given temperature and allows accelerated prediction of potential energy minimizing structures, which are difficult to determine with Monte Carlo methods. We show how the sequences of clusters generated by bottom-up building <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> can be used to inform ``assembly pathway engineering'', the design of patchy particles whose assembly propensity is optimized for a target structure. The utility of bottom-up building <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> is demonstrated for systems of CdTe/CdS tetrahedra, DNA-tethered nanospheres, colloidal analogues of patchy tetrominoes and shape-shifting particles...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the limit {{analysis}} of discrete systems formed by dry rigid blocks with Coulomb-type (non-associative) contact interface laws is here exposed. The method resorts to a fictitious system whose cohesive-type contact interface laws {{depend on the}} axial forces of the real block system. Two theorems establish {{the connection between the}} collapse state of the frictional <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> and that of the fictitious one. Based on this result, an original problem of mathematical programming is formulated to determine the minimum collapse load multiplier for <b>block</b> <b>assemblies</b> interacting through frictional interfaces. In the proposed formulation the complementarity condition is not introduced as constraint but is obtained as Karush-Khun-Tucker condition. Numerical applications demonstrate the potential of this approach for assessing the collapse load of masonry-like structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

FtsZ (filamentation temperature-sensitive Z) is the bacterial homolog of tubulin that polymerizes into rings localized to cell-division sites, and the constriction of these rings drives cytokinesis. Here we investigate the mechanism by which the Bacillus subtilis cell-division inhibitor, MciZ (mother cell inhibitor of FtsZ), <b>blocks</b> <b>assembly</b> of FtsZ. The X-ray crystal structure reveals that MciZ binds to the C-terminal polymerization interface of FtsZ, the equivalent of the minus end of tubulin. Using in vivo and in vitro assays and microscopy, we show that MciZ, at substoichiometric levels to FtsZ, causes shortening of protofilaments and <b>blocks</b> the <b>assembly</b> of higher-order FtsZ structures.

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner <b>block</b> <b>assembly.</b> The outer plates are press fitted with pins after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner <b>block</b> <b>assembly.</b> Inner <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution. A Simple photoelastic analysis of this has revealed a wealth of information to take suitable decision on the design of such plates taking into account the constraints in manufacturing...|$|R

This design was made of steel stampings, copper-brazed {{together to form a}} strong and light <b>block</b> <b>assembly.</b> It was known as the CoBra engine ("COpper BRAzed") and generated [...] in automotive form. The overhead camshaft was driven by a tower shaft and gears. [...] The bi-metallic construction of the CoBra engine and the salt-based antifreeze then in common use led to electrolysis and corrosion problems. A more traditional design with a cast iron <b>block</b> <b>assembly</b> (CIBA) was introduced in 1949; the components and dimensions were otherwise the same as the CoBra. Used in Crosley's Hot Shot sports car, this small OHC engine won the first race at Sebring in 1950. The Crosley OHC was popular in H-modified racing for its high-RPM performance. After Crosley ceased automotive production, the engine was produced by several other companies for many years, its last application being the Bearcat 55 outboard motor manufactured by Fisher Pierce, builders of the Boston Whaler boats.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} survive and persist in an immunocompetent human host, Borrelia burgdorferi {{controls}} the human im-mune attack and blocks the damaging effects of the activated complement system. These Gram-negative spirochetes use CspA (CRASP- 1) and four additional immune evasion proteins to bind combinations of human plasma regulators, including factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL- 1), complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR 1), CFHR 2, CFHR 5, and plasminogen. As many microbial immune evasion proteins have multiple functions, we hypothesized that CspA has additional roles in complement or immune control. Here, we identify CspA as a terminal complement inhibitor. Borrelial CspA binds the human terminal comple-ment components C 7 and C 9 and <b>blocks</b> <b>assembly</b> andmembrane insertion of the terminal complement complex (TCC). CspA inhibits TCC assembly {{at the level of}} C 7, as revealed by hemolytic assays, and inhibits polymerization of C 9. CspA, when ectopi-cally expressed on the surface of serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii, <b>blocks</b> TCC <b>assembly</b> on the level of C 7 and induces serum resistance in the transformed bacteria. This CspA-mediated serum resistance and terminal complement pathway inhibition al-low B. burgdorferi to survive in the hostile environment of human plasma.
