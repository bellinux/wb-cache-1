These herbicides are carcinogenic in rats: acetochlor and alachlor cause tumors in the nasal turbinates, butachlor causes stomach tumors, and metolachlor causes liver tumors. It has been suggested that the carcinogenicity of these compounds involves a complex metabolic activation pathway leading to a DNA-reactive dialkylbenzoquinone imine. Important intermediates in this pathway are 2 -chloro-N-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl) acetamide (CDEPA) produced from alachlor and butachlor and 2 -chloro-N-(2 -methyl- 6 -ethylphenyl) acetamide (CMEPA) produced from acetochlor and metolachlor.

In this study, we describe the development and application of a rapid (1) H-NMR-based analysis of cereal flour, that is, suitable for quantifying asparagine levels, and hence acrylamide-forming potential, across large numbers of samples. The screen was applied to flour samples from 150 bread wheats grown at a single site in 2005, providing the largest sample set to date. Additionally, screening of 26 selected cultivars grown for two further years in the same location and in three additional European locations in the third year (2007) provided six widely different environments to allow estimation of the environmental (E) and G x E effects on asparagine levels. Asparagine concentrations in the 150 genotypes ranged from 0. 32 to 1. 56 mg/g dry matter in wholemeal wheat flours. Asparagine levels were correlated with plant height and therefore, due to recent breeding activities to produce semi-dwarf varieties, a negative relationship with the year of registration of the cultivar was also observed. The multisite study indicated that only 13 % of the observed variation in asparagine levels was heritable, whilst the environmental contribution was 36 % and the GxE component was 43 %.

Candida albicans strains were isolated from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (nÂ =Â  5), autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) patients with chronic oral candidosis (nÂ =Â  5), and control patients (nÂ =Â  5). The acetaldehyde and ethanol production by these isolates grown under low oxygen tension in the presence of glucose was determined, and the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH 1 and ADH 2), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC 11), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALD 6) and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS 1 and ACS 2) and Adh enzyme activity were analysed. The C. Â albicans isolates produced high levels of acetaldehyde from glucose under low oxygen tension. The acetaldehyde levels did not correlate with the expression of ADH 1, ADH 2 or PDC 11 but correlated with the expression of down-stream genes ALD 6 and ACS 1. Significant differences in the gene expressions were measured between strains isolated from different patient groups.

Mutations in the TP 53 tumour suppressor gene are associated with half of all cancers. This research applied a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the toxic effects of MDA on the human lung fibroblasts MRC 5, which have an intact p 53 response, and their SV 40 transformed counterpart, MRC 5 SV 2, which have a sequestered p 53 response. Both cell lines were treated with MDA (0 - 1000 ÂµM) for 24 and 48 h and subjected to a variety of analyses to examine cell proliferation, cell viability, cellular and nuclear morphology, apoptosis, p 53 protein expression, DNA topography and M 1 dG adduct detection. For the first time, mutation sequencing of the 5 â untranslated region (UTR) of the TP 53 gene in response to MDA treatment was carried out. The main findings were that both cell lines showed reduced proliferation and viability with increasing concentrations of MDA, the cell surface and nuclear morphology were altered, and levels of apoptosis and p 53 protein expression appeared to increase. A LC MS-MS method for detection of M 1 dG adducts was developed and adducts were detected in CT-DNA treated with MDA in a dose-dependent manner. DNA appeared to become more fragmented with increasing MDA concentration, and the number of mutations in the 5 â UTR region of the TP 53 gene also increased. The majority of mutations observed were insertions, compared to lung cancer mutation data where the majority were G to T transversions.

First pass drug metabolism studies represent mainly liver and small intestine elimination, and are viewed as the standard to predict therapeutic outcome. However, drug plasma levels determined after administration do not always correlate with therapeutic efficacy of the drug. Therefore, a possible explanation may come by understanding drug metabolism in extrahepatic tissues and/or at the site of drug action. Identification and characterization of novel tissue specific isoforms of P 450 generated by alternative splicing of known P 450 genes or as yet unidentified genes is essential to predict pharmacological outcome of drugs or the fate of a carcinogen that act at sites remote from liver. ^ Using RT-PCR, brain-specific cytochrome P 450 s were detected in samples of human autopsy brain. So far, we have identified two human brain variants including P 450 2 D 7 and P 450 1 A 1. We have shown the presence of the P 450 1 A 1 brain specific splice variant in African Americans, Caucasians and Indians albeit different patterns of liver to brain variant ratio were seen distributed throughout each population. Interestingly, the splice variant was detected only in the brain but not in any other tissues from the same individual. Homology modeling was used to compare the variant 3 D structure to the liver form structure and differences in the substrate access channels and substrate binding sites were noticed. Automated computational docking was used to predict the metabolic fate of the potent carcinogenic substrate, benzo[a]pyrene. P 450 1 A 1 brain variant showed no binding orientations that could produce the active metabolite, whereas P 450 1 A 1 liver form did reveal orientations capable of generating active <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>product.</b> In vitro P 32 labeling studies verified the docking predictions.

(some col.) According to the American Cancer Society, {{cancer is the}} second leading cause of mortality in the United States, accounting {{for more than half}} a million deaths per year. Cancer is a complex disease with multiple factors influencing its genesis, maintenance, growth, and invasion which makes the treatment and prevention of the disease challenging. Despite the high mortality and morbidity associated with cancer, it is a disease of the old, with the median age for cancer incidence being 66 years old according to the National Cancer Institute. Therefore, the human body is remarkably adept at protecting itself from malignant transformation. In my thesis, I explore the oncogene Ras which is represented in approximately 30 % of all human cancers, making Ras one of the most commonly activated oncogenes. I analyzed the innate barriers to oncogenic Ras (RasV 12) induced transformation in the cell in an attempt to better understand tumor defense systems which can be mimicked for novel cancer therapy. My results confirmed one putative barrier which had good experimental grounding and identified a completely new barrier. One putative barrier to RasV 12 oncogenesis was the existence of a translational control check point in tumor defense. Activation of translation initiation has been shown to be on the causal pathway to cancer and is activated by Ras via two different pathways. The rate limiting translation initiation factor 4 E (eIF 4 E) is up regulated in many cancers and over expression of eIF 4 E confers cells with transformed phenotypes. Therefore, if activation of translation is oncogenic, then it is reasonable to posit the existence of a translational control checkpoint in tumor defense. The logical guardians of this checkpoint would be the primary negative regulators of translational initiation, the eIF 4 E binding protein (4 E-BP) family of proteins. I show that translational control checkpoint does indeed exist in tumor defense and that the 4 E-BPs are the guardians of this checkpoint. Mice lacking two of the three 4 E-BPs (4 ebp 1 -/-/ 4 ebp 2 -/-) were more sensitive to tobacco carcinogen NNK induced lung tumors and showed tumors with increased vascularity. Also, 4 ebp 1 -/-/ 4 ebp 2 -/- genotype was associated with a skewing of the genome wide translational profile towards growth and proliferation even before NNK treatment indicating a cancer primed state. Lastly, I showed that the cytochrome P 450 2 A 5, the protein that metabolizes NNK to its <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>product,</b> was translationally up regulated increasing the carcinogenic potency of NNK. The second barrier to RasV 12 oncogenesis was an unexpected discovery. In an effort to determine the mechanism of RasV 12 oncogenesis and its defense, I discovered that RasV 12 triggered proliferative block even in cells which have bypassed the senescence barriers. This was unexpected since previous reports had shown that in this setting, RasV 12 actually caused anchorage independent growth and invasion in vitro. The nature of the proliferative block was not senescence although it has many of the characters of senescence. Due to a striking phenotypical change where large vacuoles accumulate, I explored the possibility that autophagy was playing a role in the proliferative block. I show that RasV 12 expressing cells displayed hallmarks of autophagy such as double membraned vacuoles with pieces of organelles, acidic nature of the vacuoles, and positivity for early and late markers of autophagy. My study validates the current efforts to develop targeted therapy against the translation initiation complex and provides autophagy as a new potential target for caner therapy. By learning from the cell's innate cancer barriers, I hope that we will be able to develop more effect therapies for cancer...|$|E

Because HR and NHEJ differ with respect to error susceptibility, generation of chromosome rearrangements, which are potentially <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>products</b> of DSB repair, may depend on the pathway choice. To investigate this hypothesis, the influence of HR and NHEJ inhibition on the frequencies of chromosome aberrations in G 2 phase cells was investigated. SW- 1573 and RKO cells were treated with mild (41 Â°C) hyperthermia in order to disable HR and/or NU 7441 /cisplatin to inactivate NHEJ and frequencies of chromosomal fragments (resulting from unrepaired DSBs) and translocations (products of erroneous DSB rejoining) were studied using premature chromosome condensation (PCC) combined with {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). It is shown here that temporary inhibition of HR by hyperthermia results in increased frequency of ionizing-radiation (IR) -induced chromosomal translocations and that this effect is abrogated by NU 7441 - or cisplatin-mediated inhibition of NHEJ. The results suggest that in the absence of HR, DSB repair is shifted to the error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in increased frequencies of chromosomal rearrangements. These results might be of consequence for clinical cancer treatment approaches that aim at inhibition of one or more DSB repair pathway...|$|R

The first PAH {{to be identified as}} a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell. Similarly, acrolein, which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic.|$|R
40|$|Oil {{refinery}} {{contaminated soils}} usually contain <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>products,</b> including {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), and therefore require treatment for environmental and human protection. Biostimulation is the modification of external factors affecting the performance of indigenous bacteria {{and it may be}} employed to enhance natural attenuation at contaminated sites. Contaminated soil samples, provided by Imperial Oil (Sarnia, Ontario), were analyzed using pyrosequencing to sequence DNA strains in order to identify types of bacterial genus found in the samples. Flavobactericeae and Marinobacter were the two most dominant genus found in the sample, both recorded with the ability to degrade PAHs. Favourable conditions and governing parameters such as water holding capacity, moisture content, pH, total organic carbon, phosphorous, nitrogen, and potentially toxic environments, including sulfate and metal concentrations, were quantified in two experiments. The first experiment was batch studies containing a water: soil ratio of 10 : 1 (100 mL water: 10 g of contaminated soil sample). A second batch study, containing 50 g of contaminated sample with 60 % saturation, was employed to determine effects of temperature. Plasma optical emission spectroscopy, Kjeldahl Method (for nitrogen), Olsen method (for phosphorous), gas chromatograph (GC), GC/MS, and HPLC were used for the analysis of samples. Urea was added to the sample as the nitrogen source and di-ammonium phosphate was added as the source of phosphorous. A target organic carbon: nitrogen: phosphorous (C:N:P) ratio of 100 : 10 : 1 was maintained for bacterial health. The pH was observed to be in the range of 6 - 8 throughout both experiments, and the water holding capacity of the samples was 22. 7 wt%. Metal concentrations were found to be too low to cause toxic conditions for bacteria growth. Results suggest that the bacteria may have been using PAHs as a carbon source...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} N-acetyltransferases (NAT) in prostate cancer (PCa) susceptibility. NAT are polymorphic in the population and metabolize important <b>carcinogenic</b> <b>products</b> {{directly involved in the}} tumor initiation process. This prospective case-control study utilized the polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism method and comprised a cohort of consecutive 478 individuals: 126 men with prostate cancer; 101 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); and a control health population of 177 female and 74 male blood donors from the same region. NAT 2 slow or fast acetylators genotypes were determined by the combination of four variant alleles. Lifetime occupational history, dietary patterns, cigarette smoking and other anamnestic data were obtained by interviews. We were not able to find any correlation among smoking, dietary patterns, parameters of tumor aggressiveness or patient outcome and any NAT 2 genotypes or phenotypes considered in separate or in different combinations. However, there was an association between NAT 2 T 481 C (OR = 0. 47; 95 % CI = 0. 26 - 0. 84; P = 0. 01) and NAT 2 A 803 G (OR = 0. 57; 95 % CI = 0. 33 - 0. 97; P = 0. 04) polymorphisms and PCa protection. Conversely, the presence of NAT 2 G 857 A genotype increased the risk of PCa more than 3 times (OR = 3. 57; 95 % CI = 1. 39 - 9. 15; P = 0. 005). Slow acetylator NAT 2 * 7 A and NAT 2 * 6 B genotypes occurred in 10. 31 % of PCa but in none of BPH patients (P = 0. 0007). The control health population confirmed the results and allowed the exclusion of possible biases caused by gender influence on genotype inheritance and by the inclusion of not diagnosed prostate diseases patients among the control individuals. We suggest that the investigation of germline polymorphisms of NAT 2 gene may be useful in the assessment of Latin American patients at risk of BPH and PCa...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{effects of}} {{carcinogenic}} heterocyclic amines and-carbolines on 5 -hydroxytryptamine-induced human platelet aggregation,-on the uptake of 5 -hydroxytryptamine by platelets, and on human monoamine oxidase activity were investigated. Of the dietary carcinogens and-carbolines studied, <b>carcinogenic</b> tryptophan pyrolysis <b>products</b> had greater pharmacological activities than other heterocyclic amines. The <b>carcinogenic</b> tryptophan pyrolysis <b>products,</b> 3 -amino-l, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole and 3 -amino-l-methyl- 5 H-pyr-ido[4, 3 -b]indole, {{which have been}} identified in the dialysis fluid of uraemic patients, were the most potent inhibitors of the aggregation response to 5 -hydroxytryptamine, with IC 50 (the concentrations causing 50 % inhibition) values of 10 Î¼Î¹Î·Î¿Î/Î and 50 Î¼Î¹Î·Î¿Î/Î, respectively. 3 -Amino-l, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 -b]indoleand 3 -amino-l-methyl- 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole by themselves did not induce platelet aggregation, although these dietary carcinogens structurally resemble 54 iydroxytryptamine. Kinetic analyses showed that 3 -amino-l, 4 -dimethyl- 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 ^b]indole and 3 *amino-l-methyl- 5 H-pyrido[4, 3 -b]indole were potent competitive inhib-itors of 5 -hydroxytryptamine uptake by platelets with /Î¶ 18 Î¼ÏÎ¹Î¿Î/Î and 42 Î¼Î¹Î·Î¿Î/Î, respectively. Furthermore, carcinogenic tryptophan pyrolysates as well as-carbolines were found to be competitive selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase 'type A'.

40|$|Organic matter (OM) in {{drinking}} water treatment is a common impediment responsible for increased coagulant and disinfectant dosages, formation of <b>carcinogenic</b> disinfection-by <b>products,</b> and microbial re-growth in distribution system. The inherent heterogeneity of OM implies the utilization of advanced analytical techniques for its characterization and assessment of removal efficiency. Here, the application of simple fluorescence excitation-emission technique to OM characterization {{in drinking}} water treatment is presented. The fluorescence data of raw and clarified water was obtained from 16 drinking water treatment works. The reduction in fulvic-like fluorescence was found to significantly correlate with OM removal measured with total organic carbon (TOC). Fluorescence properties, fulvic- and tryptophan-like regions, were found to discriminate OM fractions of different removal efficiencies. The results obtained in the study show that fluorescence spectroscopy provides a rapid and accurate characterization and quantification of OM fractions and indication of their treatability in conventional water treatment...|$|R
50|$|Chemicals used in {{processed}} and cured meat such as some brands of bacon, sausages and ham {{may or may}} not produce carcinogens. For example, nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon have also been noted as being carcinogenic with demographic links, but not causation, to colon cancer. Cooking food at high temperatures, for example grilling or barbecuing meats, can, or can not, also lead to the formation of minute quantities of many potent carcinogens that are comparable to those found in cigarette smoke (i.e., benzoapyrene). Charring of food looks like coking and tobacco pyrolysis, and produces carcinogens. There are several <b>carcinogenic</b> pyrolysis <b>products,</b> such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are converted by human enzymes into epoxides, which attach permanently to DNA. Pre-cooking meats in a microwave oven for 2-3 minutes before grilling shortens the time on the hot pan, and removes heterocyclic amine (HCA) precursors, which can help minimize the formation of these carcinogens.|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PAHs), mainly formed by anthropogenic activities, are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. Due to environmental contamination and their chemical properties they migrate through the human food chain. Aim {{of this study}} was the evaluation of PAHs in ricotta and mozzarella di bufala cheese, produced by milk of buffalo collected in three farms, located in a high contaminated area in Campania because of a waste treatment plant and illegal waste incineration. 11 PAHs were identified both in milk and dairy <b>products.</b> <b>Carcinogenic</b> hydrocarbon benzo(a) pyrene were found in a range including 0. 42 - 12. 96 Î¼g/kg and dibenzo(ah) anthracene 0. 21 - 10. 08 Î¼g/kg.

40|$|Organic matter (OM) in {{drinking}} water treatment is a common impediment responsible for increased coagulant and disinfectant dosages, formation of <b>carcinogenic</b> disinfection-by <b>products</b> (DBPs), and microbial re-growth in distribution system. The inherent heterogeneity of OM implies the utilization of advanced analytical techniques for its characterisation and assessment of removal efficiency. Here, the application of simple fluorescence excitation-emission (EEM) spectroscopy to OM characterisation {{in drinking}} water treatment was presented. Monthly raw and clarified water samples were obtained for 16 UK surface water treatment works. Fluorescence EEM spectroscopy {{was used for the}} assessment of total organic carbon (TOC) removal and OM characterisation. Fluorescence peak C intensity was found to be a sensitive and reliable measure of OM content and hence an indicator of DBPs presence. Fluorescence peak C emission wavelength and peak T intensity (reflecting the degree of hydrophobicity and the microbial fraction respectively) were found to characterise the OM; the impact of both on TOC removal efficiency was apparent. OM fluorescence properties were shown to predict TOC removal, and identify spatial and temporal variations. The simplicity, sensitivity, speed of analysis and low cost, combined with potential for incorporation into on-line monitoring systems, mean that fluorescence spectroscopy offers distinct advantages over other THM precursors characterisation techniques.
