40|$|This report {{presents}} {{three studies}} concerned with {{learning how to}} operate a simple <b>control</b> <b>panel</b> <b>device,</b> and how this learning is affected by understanding a device model that describes the internal mechanism of the device. The first experiment compared two groups, one of which learned a set of operating procedures for the device by rote, and the other learned the device model before receiving the identical procedure training. The model group learned the procedures faster, retained them more accurately, executed them faster, and simplified inefficient procedures far more often, than the rote group. The second study demonstrated that the model group is able to infer the procedures much more easily than the rote group, which would lead to more rapid learning and better recall performance. The third study showed that the important content of the device model was the specific configuration of components and controls, and not the motivational aspects, component descriptions, or general principles. This specific information is what is logically required to infer the procedures. Thus, the benefits of having a device model depend on whether it supports direct and simple inference of the exact steps required to operate the device...|$|R

40|$|To {{economically}} {{enhance the}} performance of active/passive <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> for seismic response reduction of tall buildings, this paper investigates the optimal placement and optimal parameter of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> using the linear quadratic performance index as an objective function. The linear relation between the increment of performance index and the change of the position matrix of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is first established {{based on the assumption}} that the control gain remains unchanged. The optimal placement of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> is then determined in terms of the sequence of the calculated performance index increments and the number of <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> to be used. With the <b>control</b> <b>devices</b> at their optimal places, the seismic response of the building is finally computed using the suboptimal control gain derived using the minimum error principle, from which the equivalent optimal parameters of passive devices can be also determined.

However, subjects tended to take longer than predicted to find a fault the second time they completed a task. To examine this effect, we compared the model's sequential predictions [...] the order and relative speed that it examined interface objects [...] with a subject's performance. We found that (a) the model's operators and subject's actions were applied in basically the same order; (b) during the initial learning phase there was greater variation in the time taken to apply operators than the model predicted; (c) the subject appeared to spend time checking their work after completing the task (which the model did not). The failure to match times on the second time seeing a fault may {{be accounted for by}} the subject spent checking their work whilst they learn to solve the fault-finding problems.
