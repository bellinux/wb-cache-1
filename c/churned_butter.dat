25|$|Paratha - A flat, layered bread {{made with}} ghee and {{generally}} cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor' based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas {{are very similar}} to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy breakfast of parathas with freshly <b>churned</b> <b>butter</b> and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as 'Aloo ka Paratha' (Potato stuffed paratha), 'Mooli ka Paratha' (Radish stuffed paratha), and 'Qeemah ka Paratha' (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular.|$|E

50|$|Thomson, {{his mother}} and his four younger sisters {{returned}} to the United States following his father's death. The family settled in his parents' native Nebraska, where his mother set up a medical practice. Thomson raised chickens, <b>churned</b> <b>butter</b> and grew potatoes during the Great Depression to earn money for his family.

He also worked as a wheat and turkey farmer for a short period of time.|$|E

40|$|Milk fat {{products}} (MFP), including {{butter and}} low-fat dairy spreads, are {{a specific type}} of ready-to-eat food known as water-in-fat emulsions, in which the behavior of microbial foodborne pathogens such as Listeria onocytogenes is not clearly known. This study investigated the growth and survival of L. monocytogenes, and of Listeria innocua as a surrogate for L. monocytogenes, in these foods using challenge testing. Three commercial MFPs with various fat contents (butter, half butter and low-fat dairy spread) and two samples of traditional <b>churned</b> <b>butter</b> with various water droplet sizes were artificially contaminated with Listeria. Total mesophilic microflora including lactic acid bacteria, pH and Listeria were monitored throughout the shelf life. The growth potential of Listeria was calculated {{in the course of the}} shelf life and remains below the limit value of 0. 5 log cfu/g during the whole shelf life in any of thebutter. However, the concentration of Listeria remained stable during the shelf life in the tested MFPs (commercial and churned) except in the commercial low-fat dairy spread in which Listeria decreased gradually...|$|E

40|$|The Stirling {{cycle engine}} was invented almost 190 years ago. In this study, the reverse Stirling cycle is {{investigated}} {{for use in}} refrigeration. This type of cycle {{is referred to as}} Stirling cooling or cooler. An experimental free-piston Stirling cooler (FPSC) was constructed and the effects of the device parameters in relation to the performance of the cooler were studied; the equipment was then experimentally applied to <b>churning</b> <b>butter.</b> Two effect parameters, namely, the size of the displacer involving heat regeneration and the volume of the working fluid (air) were studied. The results indicated that a larger displacer resulted in a lower temperature in the cooler. When the working fluid volume was large or the compression ratio was high, the cooling effect was enhanced. It was concluded that by <b>churning</b> <b>butter</b> using the Stirling cooler, coagulation of the butter occurred more rapidly than when the contral was used in the process; the water content of the butter obtained was lower and the fat content was higher using the Stirling cooler. This implies that the feasibility of using the Stirling cooler for <b>churning</b> <b>butter</b> is high...|$|R

50|$|Many power {{requirements}} {{were less than}} that of a horse. Shop machines, such as woodworking lathes, were often powered with a one- or two-man crank. Household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle; however, factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a line shaft. Dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill, which could be adapted to <b>churn</b> <b>butter.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>butter</b> <b>churn</b> {{gave its}} name to the milk churn, early {{examples}} of which were based on <b>butter</b> <b>churns.</b> The milk churn is not, however, used for the act of churning, but rather to transport milk.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{buttermilk}} {{referred to}} the liquid left over from <b>churning</b> <b>butter</b> from cultured or fermented cream. Traditionally, before cream could be skimmed from whole milk, the milk was left to sit {{for a period of}} time to allow the cream and milk to separate. During this time, naturally occurring lactic acid-producing bacteria in the milk fermented it. This facilitates the <b>butter</b> <b>churning</b> process, since fat from cream with a lower pH coalesces more readily than that of fresh cream. The acidic environment also helps prevent potentially harmful microorganisms from growing, increasing shelf-life. However, in establishments that used cream separators, the cream was hardly acidic at all.|$|R
