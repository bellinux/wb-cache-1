5|$|The {{graphics}} {{themselves were}} considered to be three-dimensional given the constraints of the technology at the time. All the players are Caucasian and each one's batting stance is exactly the same. The game view is always top down; when batting or pitching, it is centered above the catcher, behind the batter and with an overhead look of the pitcher. In the outfield, there is an aerial view of a portion of the field, with the team members represented by tiny sprites and an inset with red dots representing where the players are on base. Although the official colors are intact, the actual symbols on their uniforms are absent. The <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> represented by a series of colored dots, while the dugouts are represented by plain white parallelograms.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{have also}} found that <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> not simply {{collections}} of amateurs or hobbyists. Rather, <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> often professionally trained in a discipline relevant to a given crowdsourcing task and sometimes hold advanced degrees and many {{years of experience in}} the profession. Claiming that <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> amateurs, rather than professionals, is both factually untrue and may lead to marginalization of crowd labor rights.|$|R

5|$|Arya, who {{has been}} living as a beggar {{in the streets of}} King's Landing since her escape from the Lannisters, learns a <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> {{gathering}} at the Great Sept of Baelor, where her father will be judged before the gods, and in order to see over the crowd, climbs onto the statue of Baelor the Blessed. As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution. When he sees that Arya has been rescued, Ned accepts his fate and is beheaded by Ser Ilyn Payne.|$|E
5|$|The <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It {{has twice}} held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E

25|$|In {{association}} football, the <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> {{very passionate}} and often sing {{throughout the whole}} match.

25|$|The word koladera {{initially}} {{referred to}} the act of going out and singing the colá. According to the oral tradition, a new musical genre appeared in the 1930s when the composer Anton’ Tchitch’ intentionally speeded up the tempo of a morna. Someone in the <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> said to have shouted “já Bocê v’rá-’l n’um coladêra” (you have transformed it in a coladeira), i.e., a morna performed with the tempo and liveliness of a koladera. Technically, the coladeira appeared as a division in half {{of the length of}} the notes of the morna, through the acceleration of the tempo.|$|E
25|$|The Brumbies {{play all}} their home {{fixtures}} at GIO Stadium, located {{adjacent to the}} Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.

Also, the Canberra Vikings, the Brumbies' affiliate in the short-lived Australian Rugby Championship, played one of their four regular-season home matches there. In 2003 matches from the 2003 Rugby World Cup were played at the stadium. Capacity is a nominal all-seated 25,011, however the largest <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> actually 28,753, which was for the 2004 Super 12 Final.

25|$|The {{people are}} {{gathered}} at the square to watch the executions. The <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> restless. Koroghlu's struggle for freedom has infused people with courage. People are protesting and loudly curse the khan. They receive the convicted persons with empathy; beautiful Nigar stands motionless on the scaffold {{with the support of}} her friends. She is the first to be executed. Hassan khan appears and orders the execution to begin. There is no fear in the courageous heart of Nigar. She angrily blames the khan. At that moment when the executioner' readies his axe Koroghlu's soldiers burst into the square and set the convicted free. It is the men who ordered the executions who receive the punishment. The people greet Koroghlu with delight..|$|E
25|$|Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium locally {{known as}} Kaloor Stadium is a {{multi-purpose}} international stadium situated in Kochi, Kerala. The stadium is used mostly for association football and cricket matches. With a maximum capacity of 75,000, {{it is one}} of the largest stadiums in India and the third largest cricket stadium in the world. The stadium was built in 1996 by the Government of Kerala with Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA). The stadium is widely touted to be one of the noisiest football stadiums in the world due to its distinctive architecture. In fact, the Kochi <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> so vociferous that during international cricket matches, it is very difficult for the umpires to hear minor edges off the bat by the ball for catches by the wicketkeeper. It is to be noted here that the stadium was originally built as a football stadium.|$|E
25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The people are so curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E

[...] Some of the soldiers initially shot into the air, at which General Dyer shouted: [...] "Fire low. What have you been brought here for?" [...] Later, Dyer's own testimony revealed that the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> not given any warning to disperse and he was not remorseful for having ordered his troops to shoot.|$|R

25|$|History was {{repeated}} on 4 October 2015 when {{for only the}} second time in the NRL's history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into Golden Point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying moments to level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered for Ben Hunt's dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston's field goal that gave North Queensland their first ever premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, the <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte Corday {{arrives in}} Paris at dawn. In a square she meets Camille, her {{childhood}} friend, now a deputy to the National Convention. He is disappointed, defeated, and fears for his life. Amongst the <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> Gaston, who tells Charlotte {{that he is}} the bodyguard and faithful friend of Marat. Their conversation is interrupted by a commotion which arises around a bakery. In play, a group of children act out the events of the Revolution. The square slowly empties out, except for a child who is left behind by his playmates, tied up as a victim. Charlotte releases and comforts him, thereby building up courage herself, then she buys a long-bladed knife and a shawl from a pedlar. Marat arrives surrounded by an adulating crowd which, at the same time, notices his fatigue and ill-health. Charlotte attracts his attention for a moment, then he continues on to the hall of the Convention. She does not know how {{to take advantage of the}} situation to kill him. Marat, received by the deputies with a mixture of hostility and respect, addresses the assembly.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} as runners-up in {{the previous}} season's London War Cup final, attentions turned to the 1941–42 edition of the competition when the group stage kicked off on 21 March 1942. Aided by goals from all across the forward line, Brentford finished the group stage unbeaten as leaders. The Bees faced Arsenal in the semi-final at Stamford Bridge, drawing 0–0. The two sides met again for the replay White Hart Lane a fortnight later, with goals from George Wilkins, Douglas Hunt and a late penalty save from John Jackson ensuring Brentford's passage through to the final versus Portsmouth, who had beaten Charlton Athletic in the other semi-final on 26 April. Brentford and Portsmouth faced off at Wembley Stadium on 30 May and two goals from Les Smith saw the Bees run out 2–0 winners, in what is still the Bees' only victory at Wembley Stadium. The 69,792 <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> still the largest attendance at any Brentford match.
