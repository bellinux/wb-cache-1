5|$|N2K {{deliberately}} biased {{its search}} towards closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets (Hot Jupiters) in {{the orbit of}} metal-rich stars, as the consortium hoped to discover how the mass of a planet relates to its host star's metal content. Initially, HD 154672 was noted as a host to a short-orbit Hot Jupiter, although additional observations revealed that the prospective planetary body had a longer orbit than previously expected, as revealed by the Magellan Telescopes at Chile's Las <b>Campanas</b> Observatory.|$|E
5|$|HD 154672 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 210 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Ara, orbiting the metal-rich and aged star HD 154672. This planet has a minimum mass five times that of Jupiter and orbits at about 60% {{the distance between the}} Earth to the Sun. Its orbit is very elliptical, which causes temperatures on the planet to vary significantly as it proceeds along its orbit. This planet was discovered in Las <b>Campanas</b> Observatory on September 5, 2008 using the radial velocity method (Doppler spectroscopy). Along with HD 205739 b, the planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K Consortium using the Magellan Telescopes.|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 b is an {{extrasolar planet}} located {{approximately}} 350 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Piscis Austrinus, orbiting the star HD 205739. This planet has a minimum mass 37% more than Jupiter and orbits 90% of {{the distance between the}} Earth and the Sun. The planet has a very elliptical orbit, which has led its discoverers to postulate that the planet's surface temperature varies by about 100 K along the entire orbit. This planet was reported on September 5, 2008 after its discovery at Las <b>Campanas</b> Observatory, where the planet was observed for years by the N2K Consortium while using the Magellan Telescopes. Follow-up observations collected the radial velocity measurements necessary to confirm the candidate as a planet.|$|E

5|$|HD 205739's {{designation}} is {{from the}} Henry Draper catalogue. The star was also observed by Hipparcos, which released its catalogue in 1997. The observations {{that led to the}} discovery of the planet HD 205739 b started when the N2K Consortium started an extended search for planets around 300 stars not usually targeted by Doppler spectroscopy surveys. In the case of HD 205739, the star was observed using the Magellan Telescopes at Las <b>Campanas</b> Observatory in Chile. HD 205739 was selected primarily because it was a metal-rich star; the N2K collaboration biased their search towards metal-rich stars with closely orbiting Jupiter-size planets, hoping to find a connection between a star's metallicity and its planets' masses.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} observations {{had been}} taken by the N2K program using the Magellan Telescopes' Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle spectrograph (MIKE) at Las <b>Campanas</b> Observatory in Chile since 2004. Based on these observations, the stars HD 154672 and HD 205739 were among those flagged as potential planetary host stars. The two stars were identified originally as having short-orbit hot Jupiter planets, but 3.5 years of additional observations revealed that the planetary candidates' orbits were far longer than initially anticipated. HD 154672 b's discovery {{was reported in the}} Astronomical Journal by the American Astronomical Society, appearing in the journal on October 7, 2008 alongside the planet HD 205739 b. The two planets were the first to be discovered by the N2K program that worked out of the Magellan telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though his}} father {{was a member of the}} Conservative Party, Muñoz Rivera decided to follow his uncle, Vicente Muñoz Barrios ideals and in 1883 joined the Liberal Party.

In 1885, Muñoz Rivera ran for a position in the Juana Diaz district's representation in the Provincial Assembly, but he was not elected. That same year, he began publishing his writings in newspapers and magazines, including El Clamor del Pueblo, La Revista de Puerto Rico and El Pueblo.

5|$|Benito Juárez, {{elected as}} President of Mexico on 19 January 1858, {{suspended}} all repayments on Mexico's foreign debts (save those {{owed to the}} United States), leading France, the United Kingdom, and Spain to send a joint expeditionary force that took Veracruz in December 1861. Juárez then repaid the debts, after which British and Spanish troops withdrew, but Emperor Napoleon III of France used the situation as a pretext to overthrow the republic and install a monarch friendly {{to the interests of}} France. Archduke Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of Austria, was elevated as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, thereby re-establishing the Mexican monarchy, but the new emperor ultimately did not bow to Napoleon's wishes, leading the latter to withdraw the majority of his influence from Mexico. Regardless, Maximilian was still viewed as a French puppet, and an illegitimate leader of the country. As well, {{at the end of the}} American Civil War, US troops moved to the Mexico-US border as part of a planned invasion, seeing the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire as an infringement on their Monroe Doctrine. Backed by the Americans, ex-president Juárez mobilised to retake power, and defeated Maximilian at Querétaro on 15 May 1867. The Emperor was arraigned before a military tribunal, sentenced to death, and executed at the Cerro de las <b>Campanas</b> on 19 June 1867.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{reflector}} at the DDO remained a major instrument into the 1960s, {{but in the}} end even the [...] "remote" [...] location Chant had selected was being encroached on by urban sprawl.
