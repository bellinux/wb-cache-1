2500|$|The Automatic <b>Coil</b> <b>Winder</b> and Electrical Equipment Company (ACWEECO), {{founded in}} 1923, [...] {{was set up}} to {{manufacture}} the Avometer and a coil winding machine also designed and patented by MacAdie. Although a shareholder of ACWEECO, Mr MacAdie continued to work for the Post Office until his retirement in 1933. His son, Hugh S. MacAdie, joined ACWEECO in 1927 and became Technical Director. The first AVO was put on sale in 1923, and many of its features remained almost unaltered through to the last Model 8.|$|E

[...] She joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) and gradually rose through the ranks, becoming a shop steward in 1941, then branch chair, chair of the women's works committee, and district representative.|$|E
5000|$|Avometer is a British {{trademark}} for {{a line of}} multimeters {{and electrical}} measuring instruments; the brand is now owned by the Megger Group Limited. The first Avometer {{was made by the}} Automatic <b>Coil</b> <b>Winder</b> and Electrical Equipment Co. in 1923, and measured direct voltage, direct current and resistance. [...] Possibly the best known multimeter of the range was the Model 8, which was produced in various versions from the May 1951 until 2008; the last version was the Mark 7.|$|E

40|$|This work is on {{design and}} {{construction}} of automated precision <b>coil</b> <b>winder</b> aided with computer inter phase. The essence is to overcome the challenges inherent in analogue winding machines such as over winding, misalignment, non-uniform windings, inaccuracy and slowness in windings among others. The design is an electromechanical system (consist of both electric and mechanical section) and were analyzed accordingly. Performance assessment was then carried out and found the machine to be satisfactory in overcoming these peculiar challenges of analogue machines...|$|E
40|$|This work {{is about}} {{designing}} a small coil winding machine {{for the school}} workshop. The first part consists of market research, a comparison of winders, and an explanation {{as to how they}} work. It is followed by short chapter about the inspiration for the design and construction. It also includes the parts that were used as well as peripheries. These include the most important component; stepper motors. In the next part, the prototype and subsequent revisions are described, as well as the most important parts of the code and construction of the <b>coil</b> <b>winder</b> itself and it's parts. In the end, there is chapter about it's operation...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{into the}} {{possibility}} of a plasmonic medium of a coiled conductor array in air have shown promise. This work serves to evaluate {{the possibility of}} creating a mechanically-tunable composite filter at low frequencies. Copper springs were created with varying starting pitches using a <b>coil</b> <b>winder.</b> These springs were then embedded into a flexible host polymer. The mechanical and electromagnetic properties of each spring design were predicted and tested. Two horn antennas were used to characterize the overall electromagnetic (EM) properties of the composite. The pitch of each spring was increased mechanically through application of force to the entire polymer-metal composite at equal intervals, with an EM test completed at each step. Using an Agilent 8510 C Vector Network Analyzer (VNA), the frequency spectrum within the microwave range was scanned. Relative amplitude and phase measurements were taken at equal frequency and pitch steps. With no polymer surrounding the springs, plasmon turn-on frequencies were observed to span the microwave bands as the pitch of the springs were increased. Similar results are expected with the springs embedded in a polymeric matrix. These results suggest a method of creating a mechanically-tunable composite filter for use at low frequencies...|$|E
