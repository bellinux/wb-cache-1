5000|$|Criminal organisations may {{generate}} significant income {{through the}} manufacture and trafficking of illicit drugs and their precursor chemicals. Increased involvement {{has resulted in}} larger and more sophisticated clandestine laboratories being detected in Australia. In 2008-09, a record 449 clandestine laboratories were detected in Australia (a 26 per cent increase from 2007-08). 67.7 per cent of clandestine laboratories continue to be detected in residential locations. Over two tonnes of precursor chemicals {{for the production of}} meth/amphetamines were detected at the Australian border in 2008-09, nearly double the weight detected in 2007-08. In 2008-09, <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> detections increased across most jurisdictions, the largest occurring in Western Australia, which increased from 30 laboratories in 2007-08 to 78 in 2008-09, an increase of 160 per cent. In the context of the Australian Illicit Drug Report, a <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> is any concealed place where chemicals are used to produce illicit drugs. [...] Such laboratories range from crude, makeshift operations using simple processes to highly sophisticated operations using technically advanced facilities. They can be located virtually anywhere—in private residences, motel and hotel rooms, apartments, horse trailers, houseboats, boats, vehicles, buses, trucks, campgrounds and commercial establishments—and are usually very portable. Some clandestine laboratories use very simple processes such as extracting cannabis oil from plants using solvents; others use complex processes involving a number of chemicals and a range of equipment to manufacture drugs such as methylamphetamine and ecstasy. Clan labs are usually discovered after they have exploded.|$|E
50|$|Ergocristine is an ergopeptine {{and one of}} the ergot alkaloids. As of February 24, 2010 Ergocrisine {{has been}} federally scheduled. Because of the {{existing}} Controlled Substance Act regulatory controls on the LSD precursors lysergic acid, lysergic acid amide, ergotamine, and ergonovine, <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratory</b> operators have sought uncontrolled sources of precursor material for the production of LSD. This has led to the illicit utilization of the precursor chemical ergocristine as a direct substitute for ergotamine and ergonovine for the illicit production of LSD. In fact, the largest clandestine LSD laboratory ever, William Leonard Pickard and Clyde Apperson, that was seized by the DEA utilized ergocristine as the LSD precursor.

40|$|The {{emphasis}} in the literature regarding illicit drugs has been overwhelmingly {{on the subject of}} harm caused by their ingestion. Little has been reported on the potential and real harm associated with the illicit manufacture of drugs. This paper describes the increasing prevalence of <b>clandestine</b> drug <b>laboratories</b> in Australia, overwhelmingly devoted to the manufacture of methamphetamine. The nature of the illicit synthetic process is reviewed together with its inherent dangers for the 'cook', first responders and bystanders including children, and the environment. We have analysed the emerging trends in manufacture and seizure in Australia, and offer suggestions to remedy significant deficiencies in knowledge and policy in the management of <b>clandestine</b> drug <b>laboratories,</b> especially with reference to clinical management issues, data collection, environmental contaminants and remediation, legislation and research. In particular, we conclude that: The problem of <b>clandestine</b> drug <b>laboratories</b> is growing in Australia, reflecting patterns world-wide. There are significant health and environmental implications of this growth. First responders should ensure that specialised expertise is available when decommissioning detected laboratories. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with the types of injuries associated with clandestine drug manufacture. Legislatures without a <b>clandestine</b> drug <b>laboratory</b> registry should establish one. Where it doesn't exist, legislation should be sought to curb the spread of this unwanted phenomenon. Significant opportunities exist for further research into the harm caused to first responders, the community, and the environment by <b>clandestine</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Caldicott, DG; Pigou, PE; Beattie, R. and Edwards, JW.
