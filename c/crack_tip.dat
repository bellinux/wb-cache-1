25|$|Rupture {{propagation}} {{is generally}} modeled using a fracture mechanics approach, likening the rupture to a propagating mixed mode shear crack. The rupture velocity {{is a function}} of the fracture energy in the volume around the <b>crack</b> <b>tip,</b> increasing with decreasing fracture energy. The velocity of rupture propagation is orders of magnitude faster than the displacement velocity across the fault. Earthquake ruptures typically propagate at velocities that are in the range 70–90% of the S-wave velocity, and this is independent of earthquake size. A small subset of earthquake ruptures appear to have propagated at speeds greater than the S-wave velocity. These supershear earthquakes have all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of coseismic damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Some earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities and are referred to as slow earthquakes. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.|$|E

The precracks in 20 and 20 MnMo steel can mostly be healed under the conditions of hot plastic deformation in which the reduction of hot pressing were 35. 6 % and 44. 9 % respectively, and the healing area is a ferrite band.

The reason why ferrite aggregated in healing area is that large deformation and high strain energy at high temperature and low strain rate around crack produce pro-eutectoid ferrite grain precipitating in hypo-eutectoid steels. Due to numerous voids restraining the migration of grain boundaries, the grain growth in a healing area becomes a slow process in the <b>crack</b> <b>tips</b> in 45 steel.

40|$|International audienceCeramic Matrix Composites {{reinforced}} with long fibers are potential candidates for high-temperature structural applications. Their lifetime is mainly {{controlled by the}} fibers. The rupture mechanism of fibers under environmental conditions and mechanical stress is the environmentally assisted propagation of their surface defects toward their core. The analysis of cracks subcritical propagation is called static fatigue, because most works use a Paris-like law relating the crack's velocity to the crack's stress intensity factor. This law, depending on temperature, agrees fairly well with experimental results for constant environmental conditions. However, is not directly suitable to varying ones, {{as it is the}} case in real composites. The approach to subcritical propagation introduced here relies on classical fracture mechanics, in which the environment only modifies the damage zone at the <b>crack's</b> <b>tip.</b> The model does not explicitly depend on temperature, but only on the total oxygen flux reacting at the <b>crack's</b> <b>tip.</b> Consequently, this model is valid for any temperature and oxygen pressure, which can vary along time, as long as the environment is modelled properly.
