However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite the fact that no author had ever argued that there is a <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> these two groups.|$|E

Additionally, Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen, daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III; her betrothal to Llewellyn (negotiated prior to de Montfort's death); and the <b>conflict</b> <b>between</b> Ellen and her cousin Edward, soon to become King Edward, who opposes the betrothal.|$|E

40|$|Extract][10. 05] Dispute {{resolution}} in the workplace covers a range of conflicts, processes and regulatory frameworks. Broadly speaking, {{there are two main}} categories of conflicts affecting organisations: internal <b>conflicts,</b> <b>between</b> employees and between employees and management; and external <b>conflicts,</b> <b>between</b> the organisation and/or its representatives and outsiders such as clients, customers, contractors or regulatory bodies. This chapter will focus on the first category, conflict within the workplace. Conflict is prevalent within workplaces, and recent research has demonstrated that managing conflict is a time-consuming and costly exercise for organisations and their managers. The types of conflicts that might arise within an organisation include: <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> employees (based on differences in personality, work styles, goals, etc); <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> an employee and a manager about performance issues; and <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> groups of employees (perhaps represented by a union) and management about working conditions and pay. Particular types of workplace conflict might include issues of bullying and harassment, discrimination, and unfair dismissal, as well as more minor <b>conflicts</b> <b>between</b> employees around day-to-day workplace activities and personality differences...|$|R
