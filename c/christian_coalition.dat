25|$|By now Thomas {{suspected}} that Mehmed intended on conquering his kingdom too. He therefore started taking {{more interest in}} <b>Christian</b> <b>coalition</b> against the Turks and cooperating more closely with his father-in-law. The lack of a firmer action against the Ottomans was blamed on Bosnian Christians, whom he described as being more inclined towards the Muslims than towards other Christians. The heavy Ottoman defeat by Hungarians at the Battle of Belgrade in July 1456 did nothing to alleviate Thomas' situation, as Mehmed started exerting an even greater pressure on Bosnia. In addition to financial extortion, Thomas was now forbidden to export silver, which Mehmed claimed for himself. This severe crippling of Bosnian economy suffocated the kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Hungary took {{a sharp turn}} for the worse immediately after the celebrated victory over the Turks. The victorious commanders, including János Hunyadi, died of plague, Ulrich of Celje was murdered, and even the young King Ladislaus died suddenly the following year. The aged Đurađ Branković also died, his despotate passing to his son Lazar. Realizing that Hungary was drastically weakened and that he had crossed {{the point of no return}} by refusing the Sultan's demands, Thomas decided to step forward to head the <b>Christian</b> <b>coalition.</b> In August 1456, Ragusa received an information from the King in the utmost secrecy: he was intent on declaring war on the Turks. He was far from capable of succeeding, and even suffered a Turkish raid in the beginning of 1457.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman raids renewed in {{the early}} 1380s, {{culminating}} {{in the fall of}} Sofia. Simultaneously, Ivan Shishman had been engaged in war against Wallachia since 1384. According to the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle, he killed the Wallachian voivode Dan I of Wallachia in September 1386. He also maintained uneasy relations with Ivan Sratsimir, who had broken his last ties with Tarnovo in 1371 and had separated the dioceses of Vidin from the Tarnovo Patriarchate. The two brothers did not cooperate to repel the Ottoman invasion. According to historian Konstantin Jireček, the brothers were engaged in a bitter conflict over Sofia. Ivan Shshman reneged on his vassal obligation to support the Ottomans with troops during their campaigns. Instead, he used every opportunity to participate in <b>Christian</b> <b>coalitions</b> with the Serbs and the Hungarians, provoking massive Ottoman invasions in 1388 and 1393.|$|R

25|$|Australians {{reacted to}} the event with {{widespread}} shock and horror, and the political effects were significant and long-lasting. The federal government led state governments, some of which (notably Tasmania itself and Queensland) were opposed to new gun laws, to severely restrict the availability of firearms. While surveys showed up to 85% of Australians 'supported gun control', many people opposed the new laws. Concern was raised within the Coalition Government that fringe {{groups such as the}} 'Ausi Freedom Scouts', the Australian League of Rights and the Citizen Initiated Referendum Party, were exploiting voter anger to gain support. After discovering that the <b>Christian</b> <b>Coalition</b> and US National Rifle Association were supporting the gun lobby, the government and media cited their support, along with the moral outrage of the community to discredit the gun lobby as extremists.|$|E
25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would have been better off if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the <b>Christian</b> <b>coalition</b> was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E
25|$|Thomas waged a war {{throughout}} his reign with the Serbian Despotate over the lucrative mining town of Srebrenica and its surroundings, {{in addition to}} (or in conjunction with) multiple conflicts with his father-in-law. Moreover, he had a tense relationship with the menacing Ottoman Empire. After years of skirmishes and raids, Thomas appeared willing to lead the <b>Christian</b> <b>coalition</b> against the Turks but received no assistance from fellow Christian rulers. Having failed to expand into Croatia proper, Thomas turned again to the east in 1458, arranging a match between his son Stephen and the Serbian heiress Helena. The Bosnian control over {{the remnants of the}} Serbian Despotate lasted merely a month before the Ottoman conquest of the state. King Thomas' failure to defend Serbia permanently damaged his reputation in Europe. Wishing to improve his image among Europe's Catholics, Thomas turned against the Bosnian Church, thus becoming the first ruler of Bosnia to engage in religious persecution.|$|E
