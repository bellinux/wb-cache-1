5|$|Some {{frogs and}} toads inflate {{themselves}} to make themselves look large and fierce, and some spadefoot toads (Pelobates spp) scream and leap towards the attacker. Giant salamanders of the genus Andrias, as well as Ceratophrine and Pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite. The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{two or three times}} its size on the head and often manages to escape.|$|E
5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt {{and the evolution of}} tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake.</b> In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have soft {{bodies with}} thin skins, and lack claws, {{defensive}} armour, or spines. Nevertheless, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive. The {{first line of}} defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce. This keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip. The secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic. Snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis), which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape. Caecilians have been little studied in this respect, but the Cayenne caecilian (Typhlonectes compressicauda) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in Brazil. In some salamanders, the skin is poisonous. The rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa) from North America {{and other members of}} its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin (TTX), the most toxic non-protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish. Handling the newts does not cause harm, but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly. In feeding trials, fish, frogs, reptiles, birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible. The only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis).|$|E

500|$|Some frogs use bluff or deception. The European {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) adopts a {{characteristic}} stance when attacked, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. The bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) crouches down with {{eyes closed and}} head tipped forward when threatened. This places the parotoid glands in the most effective position, the other glands on its back begin to ooze noxious secretions and the most vulnerable parts of its body are protected. Another tactic used by some frogs is to [...] "scream", the sudden loud noise tending to startle the predator. The gray tree frog (Hyla versicolor) makes an explosive sound that sometimes repels the shrew Blarina brevicauda. Although toads are avoided by many predators, the <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis) regularly feeds on them. The strategy employed by juvenile American toads (Bufo americanus) on being approached by a snake is to crouch down and remain immobile. This is usually successful, with the snake passing by and the toad remaining undetected. If it is encountered by the snake's head, however, the toad hops away before crouching defensively.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> go into brumation {{before they}} mate. They stop eating {{for about two}} weeks {{beforehand}} to clear their stomachs of any food that would rot there otherwise. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> begin mating as soon as they emerge from brumation. During the mating season, the males mate with several females. In chillier parts of their range, male <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> awaken from brumation first, giving themselves enough time to prepare to mate with females when they finally appear. Males come out of their dens and, as soon as the females begin coming out, surround them. Female <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> produce a sex-specific pheromone that attracts male snakes in droves, sometimes leading to intense male to male competition and the formation of mating balls of up to 25 males per female. After copulation, a female leaves the den/mating area to find food and a place to give birth. Female <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> are able to store the male's sperm for years before fertilization. The young are incubated in the lower abdomen, at about the midpoint of the length of the female's body. <b>Garter</b> <b>snakes</b> are ovoviviparous, meaning they give birth to live young. However, this is different from being truly viviparous, which is seen in mammals. Gestation is two to three months in most species. As few as three or as many as 80 snakes are born in a single litter. The young are independent upon birth.

2500|$|The San Francisco garter snake, a {{subspecies}} of the <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake,</b> {{is found}} in scattered wetland areas on the San Francisco Peninsula from approximately the northern boundary of San Mateo County south along the eastern and western bases of the Santa Cruz Mountains, {{at least to the}} Upper Crystal Springs Reservoir, and along the Pacific coast south to Año Nuevo Point, and thence to Waddell Creek in Santa Cruz County. It is difficult to obtain reliable distribution information and population statistics for the San Francisco garter snake, because of the elusive nature of this reptile and the fact that much of the remaining suitable habitat is located on private property that has not been surveyed for the presence of the snake. This subspecies is extremely shy, difficult to locate and capture, and quick to flee to water or cover when disturbed. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has stated that many locations that previously had healthy populations of garter snakes are now in decline due to land development pressure and the filling of wetlands in San Mateo County over the last sixty years.

2500|$|While the {{findings}} of the ICZN have given the San Francisco garter snake unique taxonomic standing for now, a molecular study challenges the subspecific status of this population. Janzen [...] analyzed sequences in mitochondrial DNA to determine relationships within the <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snake</b> (T. sirtalis). [...] Janzen found that molecular evidence differed, often sharply, with the territorial boundaries of subspecies named on phenotypic variation. He further deduced that local environmental forces were more significant in shaping the color patterns shown by the garter snakes than shared common ancestry, and concluded all morphologically based subspecies in the western U.S. to be subject to revision. [...] This result strongly suggests that the color traits that are diagnostic for (T.s. tetrataenia) are the result of local selection rather than long-term isolation from other races of (T. sirtalis) in central California. [...] On the other hand, the article places the three nearest populations of T. s. infernalis to T.s. tetrataenia in Sonoma County, Contra Costa County, and Santa Clara County into a separate group that exhibits an [...] "elevated rate of molecular evolution". The authors suggest that sequencing nuclear DNA may provide a more precise analytical tool to crack some of the ultimate taxonomic quandaries of the San Francisco garter snake and its relatives.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Although mercury (Hg) is a well-studied contaminant, {{knowledge}} about Hg accumulation in snakes is limited. The authors evaluated Hg bioaccumulation within and among four snake species (northern watersnakes, Nerodia sipedon; queen <b>snakes,</b> Regina septemvittata; <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes,</b> Thamnophis sirtalis; and rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta [Pantherophis alleghaniensis]) from a contaminated {{site on the}} South River (Waynesboro, VA, USA) and two nearby reference sites. Total Hg (THg) concentrations in northern watersnake tail tissue at the contaminated site ranged from 2. 25 to 13. 84 mg/kg dry weight (mean: 4. 85 0. 29), or 11 to 19 times higher than reference sites. Blood THg concentrations (0. 03 – 7. 04 mg/kg wet wt; mean: 2. 24 0. 42) were strongly correlated with tail concentrations and were the highest yet reported in a snake species. Within watersnakes, nitrogen stable isotope values indicated ontogenetic trophic shifts that correlated with THg bioaccumulation, suggesting that diet plays a substantial role in Hg exposure. Female watersnakes had higher mean THg concentrations (5. 67 0. 46 mg/kg) than males (4. 93 0. 49 mg/kg), but {{no significant differences between}} sexes were observed after correcting for body size. Interspecific comparisons identified differences in THg concentrations among snake species, with more aquatic species (watersnakes and queen snakes) accumulating higher mean concentrations (5. 60 0. 40 and 4. 59 0. 38 mg/kg in tail tissue, respectively) than the more terrestrial species, <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> and rat snakes (1. 28 0. 32 and 0. 26 0. 09 mg/kg, respectively).

40|$|The {{effects of}} ambient {{temperature}} (13. 5 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 30 degrees C) {{and type of}} wound on healing of skin wounds were evaluated in <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis). Linear unsutured incisions and circular excisional wounds were evaluated grossly and microscopically in three snakes held at each temperature at each of two, five and ten days after surgery. Linear sutured and unsutured incisions and circular and square excisional wounds were similarly evaluated three and six weeks after wound production in groups of six snakes held at each temperature. The rates of stabilization of wound margins, scab formation, migration and maturation of the regenerating epithelium, resolution of dermal inflammation, and fibroplasia varied directly with temperature. The inflammatory reaction to wounding was similar in character and intensity in snakes held at all three temperatures two days after surgery. Unsutured linear incisions, compared to sutured incisions, tended to have more rapid epithelial maturation and a less intense inflammatory response. Healing of square and circular excisional wounds was similar; contraction of round wounds was slightly more irregular and, at a few observations, dermal maturation was slower and inflammation more widespread. It was concluded that healing of skin wounds can be accelerated by holding reptiles at {{the upper end of}} their voluntary temperature range.

40|$|Healing of {{cutaneous}} wounds was {{studied in}} groups of <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> (Thamnophis sirtalis) held at 13. 5 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Linear unsutured incisions and circular excisional wounds were evaluated two, five, and ten days after surgery, while linear sutured and unsutured incisions and circular and square excisional wounds were studied three and six weeks after wound production. The sequence of events during healing was {{the same for all}} experimental situations. The epithelial margins of the wounds moved freely over exposed epaxial muscle until an exudate of fibrin and inflammatory cells caused adhesion. Heterophils and macrophages were present two days after wounding. Heterophils were present throughout the wound while macrophages were concentrated in areas containing fibrin and proteinaceous exudate. Fibroblasts moved laterally into the wound from the adjacent dermis producing a flat dermal scar oriented parallel to the wound surface. Epithelial cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia occurred in a zone extending up to 1. 5 mm from the margin of the wound. A tongue of flattened epithelial cells extended across the wound surface, mingling with the superficial crust and migrating over eosinophilic fibrillar material. Maturation of the new epithelium, indicated by formation of a distinct basal layer, rounding of superficial cells and keratin production, began at the wound margins before the epithelial spurs linked. The epithelium over healed wounds appeared normal, but the dermis did not reorganize to form scales.

30|$|Morphological {{characters}} {{can greatly}} influence the locomotor capabilities of animals. In snakes, including sea kraits and other sea snake species, swimming speed increases with an increasing size of individuals (Jayne 1985 Shine and Shetty 2001 Shine et al. 2003). Studies of <b>common</b> <b>garter</b> <b>snakes</b> {{also revealed that}} a higher maximum crawling speed is associated with an increasing body mass (Heckrotte 1967). However, our results revealed that only the residual tail area of L. colubrina was correlated with the absolute sprint and absolute average speeds in the multiple regression models. Sea kraits investigated by Shine et al. (2003) had large ranges of body sizes (35 to 131  cm in L. colubrina and 41 to 115  cm in L. laticaudata). The adult sea kraits collected in our study had comparatively narrower ranges of body sizes (65.5 to 94.5  cm in L. colubrina, 65.5 to 94.0  cm in L. laticaudata, and 79.2 to 101.5  cm in L. semifasciata). Within the rather narrow ranges of body sizes studied, and maybe also because the sample size was not big enough, significant correlations between morphological variables and locomotor performance could not be detected in our study. Swimming speeds (0.35 to 2.04 SVL/s and 23 to 141  cm/s) and crawling speeds (0.02 to 0.63 SVL/s and 2 to 46  cm/s) in other species of sea snakes were reported by Shine et al. (2003); measurements of swimming speeds that we obtained for sea kraits were lower but still within those ranges. Terrestrial speeds that we measured were generally slower than the speeds (1.29 SVL/s and 31.23 to 91.7  cm/s) measured in various terrestrial species of snakes such as Notechis scutatus (Aubret et al. 2007) and T. s. fitchi (Jayne and Bennett 1989, 1990), but comparisons are dependent on the mode of locomotion. Crawling speeds of sea kraits were nearly {{an order of magnitude}} lower than maximum speeds (5  m/s) recorded for rapidly moving terrestrial snakes such as mambas (Goldman and Hu 2010).|$|R
