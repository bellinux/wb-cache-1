5|$|Land {{transport}} remained {{much more}} expensive than river or sea transport during the period. Many towns in this period, including York, Exeter and Lincoln, were linked to the oceans by navigable rivers and could act as seaports, with Bristol's port coming to dominate the lucrative trade in wine with Gascony by the 13th century, but shipbuilding generally remained on a modest scale and economically unimportant to England at this time. Transport remained very costly {{in comparison to the}} overall price of products. By the 13th century, groups of common carriers ran <b>carting</b> businesses, and <b>carting</b> brokers existed in London to link traders and carters. These used the four major land routes crossing England: Ermine Street, the Fosse Way, Icknield Street and Watling Street. A large number of bridges were built during the 12th century to improve the trade network.|$|E

50|$|Studies of <b>CART</b> (54-102) {{action in}} rat lateral {{ventricle}} and amygdala suggest that <b>CART</b> {{play a role}} in anxiety-like behavior, induced by ethanol withdrawal in rats. Studies on <b>CART</b> knock-out mice indicates that <b>CART</b> modulates the locomotor, conditioned place preference and cocaine self-administration effect of psychostimulants. This suggests a positive neuromodulatory action of <b>CART</b> on psychostimulants effect on rat. <b>CART</b> is altered in the ventral tegmental area of cocaine overdose victims, and a mutation in the <b>CART</b> gene associates with alcoholism. <b>CART</b> peptides are inhibitors of food intake (anorexigenic) and closely associated with leptin and neuropeptide Y, two important food intake regulators. <b>CART</b> hypoactivity in the hypothalamus of depressed animals is associated with hyperphagia and weight gain. <b>CART</b> peptides are also involved in fear and startle behavior. <b>CART</b> is thought to {{play a key role in}} the opioid mesolimbic dopamine circuit that modulates natural reward processes. <b>CART</b> also appears to play an important role in higher brain functions like cognition.|$|R

5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for <b>carting.</b> In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{ownership}} {{was widespread}} by the 12th century. Both tenant farmers and landlords {{were involved in}} the harrowing of land for arable crops in the relatively new open field system, and employed horses for this work. Horses and carts were increasingly used for transporting farm goods and implements; peasants were obliged to transport such items in their own carts, though the poorest may have had to rely on one horse for all their farm work. The necessity for <b>carting</b> produce revolutionised communication between villages. Horse-breeding as an enterprise continued; in the 14th century, Hexham Priory had 80broodmares, the Prior of Durham owned two stud farms, Rievaulx Abbey owned one, Gilbert d'Umfraville, Earl of Angus, in Scotland, had significant grazing lands for mares, and horse-breeding was being carried out both east and west of the Pennines.|$|E

5|$|The Prince of Lobkowitz, who in 1854 {{became the}} head of Mezőhegyes, {{stressed}} the importance of fixing the type– that is, making the characteristics of a breed of animal genetically homogenous– of the horses. This goal was achieved by linebreeding, though the one season that Nonius Senior served his own daughters was notably unsuccessful: of the 33 foals, 11 died while only 2 were broodmare-quality and 1 was stallion-quality. However, with more experimentation, the Nonius breed emerged as a uniformly heavy but elegant military driving and <b>carting</b> horse. In 1865, Arabian and Thoroughbred stallions were bred to Nonius Senior's female descendants in the hopes of correcting a lack of balance and elegance among the Nonius horses. Nonius Senior stood at stud for 22 years. By the end of his breeding life, he had served mares of Arabian, Lipizzan, Thoroughbred, Spanish and Norman blood. Fifteen of Nonius's sons in turn stood at stud, and 122 of his daughters were used as broodmares.|$|E

Quéruel's stacks, Monet asked his stepdaughter, Blanche Hoschedé, to bring him two canvases, one for sunny and one for {{overcast}} conditions. But Monet soon found he could not catch the ever-changing light and mood on merely two canvases: as a result, his willing helper was quickly bringing as many canvases as her wheelbarrow could hold. Monet's daily routine therefore came to involve <b>carting</b> paints, easels and many unfinished canvases back and forth, working on whichever canvas most closely resembled {{the scene of the}} moment as the conditions and light fluctuated. Although he began painting the stacks en plein air, Monet later revised his initial impressions in his studio, both to generate contrast and to preserve the harmony within the series.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The peptide <b>CART</b> {{is widely}} {{expressed}} {{in central and}} peripheral neurons, {{as well as in}} endocrine cells. Known peripheral sites of expression include the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the pancreas, and the adrenal glands. In rodent pancreas <b>CART</b> is expressed both in islet endocrine cells and in nerve fibers, some of which innervate the islets. Recent data show that <b>CART</b> is a regulator of islet hormone secretion, and that <b>CART</b> null mutant mice have islet dysfunction. <b>CART</b> also effects GI motility, mainly via central routes. In addition, <b>CART</b> participates in the regulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis. We investigated <b>CART</b> expression in porcine pancreas, GI-tract, adrenal glands, and thyroid gland using immunocytochemistry. Results <b>CART</b> immunoreactive (IR) nerve cell bodies and fibers were numerous in pancreatic and enteric ganglia. The majority of these were also VIP IR. The finding of intrinsic <b>CART</b> containing neurons indicates that pancreatic and GI <b>CART</b> IR nerve fibers have an intrinsic origin. No <b>CART</b> IR endocrine cells were detected in the pancreas or in the GI tract. The adrenal medulla harboured numerous <b>CART</b> IR endocrine cells, most of which were adrenaline producing. In addition <b>CART</b> IR fibers were frequently seen in the adrenal cortex and capsule. The capsule also contained <b>CART</b> IR nerve cell bodies. The majority of the adrenal <b>CART</b> IR neuronal elements were also VIP IR. <b>CART</b> IR was also seen in a substantial proportion of the C-cells in the thyroid gland. The majority of these cells were also somatostatin IR, and/or 5 -HT IR, and/or VIP IR. Conclusion <b>CART</b> is a major neuropeptide in intrinsic neurons of the porcine GI-tract and pancreas, a major constituent of adrenaline producing adrenomedullary cells, and a novel peptide of the thyroid C-cells. <b>CART</b> is suggested to be a regulatory peptide in the porcine pancreas, GI-tract, adrenal gland and thyroid. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: After {{achieving}} undetectable HIV-RNA on <b>cART,</b> on cessation, HIV-RNA rebounds to pre-treatment {{values for}} the majority due {{to the presence of}} an inaccessible viral reservoir. There is some evidence that <b>cART</b> during primary HIV infection (PHI) limits the reservoir size, optimizing the chance of maintaining viral control off <b>cART.</b> Data are required to predict possible viral controllers for treatment interruption following <b>cART.</b> This analysis aims to investigate the effect of <b>cART</b> duration and the rate of viral blips while on <b>cART</b> initiated in PHI, and other factors on maintaining viral control for those stopping <b>cART.</b> Material and Methods: Using CASCADE data on HIV seroconverters, we characterized virologic blip (viral suppression on <b>cART</b> followed by a single HIV-RNA above a blip threshold and a subsequent measure below the threshold without <b>cART</b> change) rates for those starting <b>cART</b> within six months of seroconversion (SC). Using Cox models, we examined the effect of the following factors on time to virologic rebound (HIV-RNA> 1000) after <b>cART</b> stop: <b>cART</b> duration, severity/rate of blips on <b>cART,</b> time from SC to <b>cART</b> start, <b>cART</b> class, SC year, SC age, CD 4 at <b>cART</b> start/stop, sex and HIV risk group. Results: The 660 individuals initiating <b>cART</b> in PHI were mostly male (91 %), seroconverting between 1995 and 2012, with a median (IQR) age of 34 (29, 41) years mostly infected through sex between men (73 %). Median <b>cART</b> duration was 14. 8 (7. 0, 31. 7) months initiated at a median 1. 9 (0. 5, 3. 9) months post SC. 13 (11, 16), 9 (7, 11), 6 (5, 9) and 7 (6, 10) % of individuals experienced blips > 50, 100, 200 and 400 copies/mL, respectively. Of those who experienced blips, most (77 – 90 %, depending on blip threshold) experienced just one. Among 250 individuals with undetectable HIV-RNA at <b>cART</b> stop, median time to rebound was 1. 6 (0. 30, 5. 8) months. Time on <b>cART</b> was the only factor independently associated with control after stopping, HR for rebound= 0. 91 (0. 86, 0. 98) per extra six months spent on <b>cART,</b> HR for ever blipping > 400 copies/mL while on cART= 0. 88 (0. 40, 1. 93). Conclusions: Blips occur in about 10 % of individuals who initiate <b>cART</b> in PHI, most of who experience only one blip, but was not predictive of subsequent virologic rebound. Increasing time spent on <b>cART</b> initiated in PHI could increase time of virological suppression after <b>cART</b> stop...|$|R
