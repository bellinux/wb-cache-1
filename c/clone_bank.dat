We assessed differences in wood cellulose δ 13 C and ring width among Scottish Scots pine populations grown in a <b>clone</b> <b>bank</b> and in natural stands at various locations in northern and central Scotland. Ring width and wood cellulose δ 13 C varied significantly among natural stands. Potential water deficit {{was positively correlated with}} wood cellulose δ 13 C and xylem ring width in the natural stands. Neither wood cellulose δ 13 C nor xylem ring width of <b>clone</b> <b>bank</b> trees correlated with any climate variables at the sites from which the trees originated, indicating little adaptation to climate for these traits. Xylem ring width showed a site × population interaction for the growth sites (i. e., natural stands versus <b>clone</b> <b>bank),</b> but wood cellulose δ 13 C did not.

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains {{isolated}} from patients with cystic fibrosis commonly produce a capsule-like exopolysaccharide called alginate. The alginate-producing (Alg+) phenotype {{results in a}} mucoid colony morphology and is an unstable trait. A mutant of P. aeruginosa FRD (a cystic fibrosis isolate) was obtained which was temperature sensitive for alginate production (Algts). At elevated growth temperatures (41 degrees C), no alginate was detected in culture supernatants of the Algts mutant, but yields of alginate increased as the temperature of incubation was reduced. The mutation responsible for the Algts phenotype, alg- 50 (Ts), has been mapped to a region of the FRD chromosome closely linked to trp- 2. The alg- 50 (Ts) marker did not map near the met-l-linked chromosomal mutations responsible for the instability of the Alg+ phenotype. A broad host range cosmid cloning system based upon derivatives of plasmid RK 2 was used to construct a P. aeruginosa <b>clone</b> <b>bank.</b> After transfer of the <b>clone</b> <b>bank</b> to the Algts mutant, hybrid plasmids were obtained which complemented the Algts defect.

On the basis of Southern and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses, it was demonstrated that, unlike most S. mutans strains, strain UA 101 contained a single copy of a gene coding for IG synthesis. The gene was isolated from a <b>clone</b> <b>bank</b> constructed with the plasmid pTH 10 <b>clone</b> <b>bank</b> in Escherichia coli and had apparently evolved after homologous recombination of the gtfB and gtfC genes present on the chromosome of a recent ancestor of strain UA 101.

A derivative of strain UA 101, UA 101 LBS, containing a chromosomal insertion of the GS 5 gtfC gene was constructed after transformation. UA 101 LBS exhibited high IG synthetic activity and colonized smooth surfaces in vitro. By utilizing a conventional rat model system involving animals fed a high-sucrose diet, strain UA 101 exhibited low levels of smooth surface caries activity relative to Streptococcus sobrinus 6715.

Shoot proliferation over four passages was higher in media containing benzyladenine than in media containing other growth regulators, and optimal proliferation from seed of three different sources was consistently obtained in medium containing 4. 4 μM benzyladenine. Shoots from this medium were converted to plantlets at high frequencies (76 – 90 %) after treatment with 19. 6 μM indole- 3 -butyric acid, and almost all plantlets were successfully acclimatized to nursery conditions.

To prevent suppression of the grafted scion, frequent removal of orthotropic shoots is necessary.

Complementary genetic and biochemical analyses {{have been used}} to study the (dissimilative) iron reduction system of Alteromonas putrefaciens strain 200.

A suite of iron-reduction-deficient mutants was generated via chemical (EMS) and transposon [ [...] . ] mutagenesis procedures. A newly developed screening technique was subsequently used to identify mutants deficient in both high-rate and low-rate iron reduction activity. A conjugal gene transfer system was developed for mobilization of IncP 1 -based cloning vectors to A. putrefaciens 200. The broad host range (IncPl) cosmid cloning vector pVK 100 was used to construct A. putrefaciens 200 gene <b>clone</b> <b>banks</b> in E. coli strains HB 101 and S 17 - 1 (mobilizing strain).

Two iron reduction clones (designated S 4 -E- 2 and S 18 -F- 4) were identified by their ability to restore iron reduction activity to several of the iron-reduction-deficient mutants. Preliminary biochemical characterization of selected mutant strains has indicated that cytochrome content may {{play an important role in}} the iron reduction process.
