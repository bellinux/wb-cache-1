40|$|Gift of Water (GOW, est. 1995) is an Indiana based nonprofit {{organization}} dedicated to providing clean drinking water for communities in Haiti. Their system involves prechlorination, followed by a string filter, granular activated carbon (GAC), and then post-chlorination. The initial design of the GOW system included a polypropylene string filter with a nominal pore size opening of 5 μm, which has been changed to one with a nominal pore size opening of 1 μm. Experiments were conducted to compare the original system with the modified system and to quantify {{the effectiveness of the}} systems to produce clean drinking water, including measurements of volumetric flow rate, E. coli removal efficiency, turbidity, free, total and <b>combined</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> concentrations, volatile disinfection by-products (DBPs), and UV absorbance at 254 nm. The clogging rates for the 1 μm and the 5 μm filters were measured to quantify the sustainability of the two filter types. Inactivation assays for bacteriophage as surrogates for human viruses were also performed on the GOW system with a pure and a natural water source. Finally, source water quality data, including turbidity and viable E. coli concentrations, from communities where GOW systems are used were collected during a trip to Haiti. Little difference was noted in the volumetric flow rates between the two string filters throughout the course of the experiment. Bacterial inactivation was consistently effective; both filter types successfully removed the E. coli from the source water. Both filters were able to remove a large fraction of the colloidal particles from the water. The effluent turbidity values for both filter types fell below 5 NTU when the influent water was {{less than or equal to}} 12 NTU. ^ Free and total chlorine concentrations decreased in the final water samples for both filter types. The activated carbon filters were effective in removing most of the free and total chlorine from the first chlorine dose. The combined chlorine concentration measurements were substantially less than the free chlorine concentration measurements. Chloroform (CHCl 3) was the only DBP observed to be present above the detection limit in the chlorinated water samples. The chloroform concentrations measured in the effluent water samples from the 1 μm and the 5 μm filters were all well below the Maximum Contaminant Level of 80 μg/L for Total Trihalomethanes, as established by the US EPA. The absorbance at 254 nm generally decreased from intermediate to final water samples. The UV-absorbing compounds are successfully removed by the filtration or adsorption in the GAC, or by the reactions in the secondary chlorine dose. ^ The clogging rates between the two filters were nearly identical. The 1 μm filter allowed an average of 4037 liters of water through the filter, and the 5 μm filter allowed an average of 3828 liters of water through the filter before clogging occurred. This corresponds to approximately 202 runs for the 1 μm filters and 191 runs for the 5 μm filters. The GOW system achieved over seven logs of inactivation for the öS 1 phage suspension and over four logs of inactivation for the T 4 phage suspension when used with Milli-Q water. When used with Wabash River water, the GOW system achieved approximately three logs of inactivation for the öS 1 phage suspension and less than one log of inactivation for the T 4 phage suspension. The GOW system was not effective at inactivating human virus surrogates in this natural water source. ^ Water quality data from six water sources were collected in Haiti. The E. colicoli concentrations in the samples ranged from 1. 5 most probable number (MPN) of E. coli per 100 mL of the sample to 48. 3 MPN of E. coli per 100 mL of sample. The turbidity measurements ranged from 0. 19 NTU to 6. 64 NTU. ...|$|E
40|$|Inclui artigo publicado em: Proceedings of the 4 th International Conference of Swimming Pool & SPA(ICOEH), 2011, Porto: 40 - 50 The {{presence}} of water disinfection by-products (DBPs) in swimming pools constitutes today {{a public health}} concern, particularly because swimming is an activity used by {{a high percentage of}} the population, namely elderly and young children. Moreover, several adverse short-term and long-term health effects have been associated with these compounds (Lakind et al., 2010; Zwiener et al., 2007). Water disinfection methods are used in all swimming pools, namely in public pools, to ensure an adequate and effective protection of users against microbiological pathogens. Chlorination is the most common disinfection method used worldwide, because it is low cost, easy to use, efficient against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, and enables the maintenance of a residual protection. The use of chlorine based treatment techniques has one strong drawback, which is the generation of several DBPs, potentially harmful products, that can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation and absorption through the skin (Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2009; Caro and Gallego, 2007). DBPs comprise several compounds that are formed through the reaction of chlorine with organic matter present in water. Amongst DBPs, the most relevant and better characterized are trihalomethanes (THMs) : chloroform (CF), bromoform (BF), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), and chlorodibromomethane (DBCM). These compounds have been associated with health effects such as respiratory, ocular and cutaneous symptoms and also with some long-term health effects such as bladder cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes (Lee et al., 2009; Zwiener et al., 2007). Accurate exposure assessments to THMs in indoor pool environment is particularly difficult because their formation depends on many factors such as water and air temperature (Tw and Tair), humidity (Hu), pH, free residual chlorine (FrCl), total organic content and number of pool users (Lee et al., 2009). In Portugal a specific legislation to assess the quality of swimming pool waters is inexistent. The guideline value used in this study for total THMs (TTHMs) was the one established in the Portuguese Law 306 / 2007, for drinking water quality - 100 μg/L. Some other water parameters determined in swimming pools such as Tw turbidity (Turb), pH, FrCl, total residual chlorine, conductivity (Cond), permanganate index (COD) and isocyanuric acid were assessed by Portuguese Law 5 / 97, regarding technical and safety conditions of closed environments with water diversions. WHO guidelines for safe recreational water environments (2006) were also used to assess some water and air parameters in pools. Standard 62. 1 (2006) from American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASRHAE) was also used to assess pool air parameters. The main goal of this investigation project was to study the occurrence, distribution and determinants of THMs in indoor swimming pools. This will enable an evaluation of swimming pool users’ exposure to THMs. In order to achieve this goal, the characterization of water quality of 30 Lisbon indoor swimming pools, using chorine based treatment techniques, was made during a six month period. Because of laboratory working restrictions, CF concentration in pool air was studied only in 6 swimming pools, at the same period. Several parameters such as TTHMs concentration, CF, BDCM, DBCM, BF concentration in water, FrCl, <b>combined</b> <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> (CrCl), pH, Tw and Tair, Hu, COD, Cond, Turb and chloride (Cl) were determined in each pool, once a month. THMs water sampling was made in duplicates in two pool water spots, physicochemical parameters were determined in one of the THMs water sampling spots and THMs air sampling was made in two pool spots, considered to be representative of the swimming pool air. All sampling procedures were performed by specialized sampling technicians from Lisbon Health Centres Group (ACES). Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 17. 0 software. Descriptive analysis was applied to all variables in order to determine mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Student’s t-test and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare numerical variables and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient were used to examine correlation between all environmental parameters. TTHMs water level ranged from 10 to 160 μg/L, while CF water level typically ranged from 5 to 150 μg/L, with occasional higher levels detected. Regarding other THMs levels in pool water, BDCM ranged from 0. 5 to 15 μg/L, DBCM from 0. 4 to 10 μg/L and BF was obtained in concentrations less than 2 μg/L. Moreover, in some pools, DBCM and BF were not detected. From these results, it can be concluded that there was a large variation in TTHMs and CF water levels between the pools and that CF was the THM obtained in higher concentrations. These results are in agreement with studies presented by other authors (Lee et al., 2009; Chu and Nieuwenhuijsen, 2002). In air, CF level ranged from 40 to 200 μg/m 3, with occasional higher levels detected. Tw presented less variation (27 to 31 ºC) than Tair (21 to 33 ºC), although sporadic higher values were found. FrCl and Cond presented higher values than the guidelines from DR 5 / 97 only in a small number of pools. Turb and COD values were within the guidelines from DR 5 / 97. pH varied from 7 to 8. 5, with {{only a small number of}} pools having values higher than 7. 8. As referred in WHO guidelines, pH should be maintained between 7. 2 and 7. 8 for chlorine disinfectants to ensure efficient disinfection. Using the statistical tests mentioned before, it was possible to obtain some interesting results. There was a clear positive linear correlation between CF water concentration (CFW) and TTHMs water concentration (R> 0. 98, p 0. 78, p 0. 45, p< 0. 05). These results are in agreement with Lee et al. (2009) which obtained positive linear correlations between CFW and COD and with Chu and Nieuwenhuijsen (2002) which also obtained correlations between TTHMs water concentration and Tw. In conclusion, there appears to be good water and air quality in the studied Lisbon swimming pools. Regarding THMs levels in water, some pools presented high TTHMs and CF concentrations. Moreover, CF air concentrations were also high in some swimming pools. These results clearly demonstrate that THMs monitoring is particularly important and that, in a near future, this should be extended to other DBPs. Furthermore, for a correct and conscious use of swimming pools, appropriate and targeted information about safe practices should be provided to pool users.

We investigated whether the N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric method and/or an adapted indophenol method (Hach MonochlorF) are suitable for determining the concentration of monochloramine in drinking water. Membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) {{was used as a}} reference analysis method to determine the different chloramine species in water. All methods measured monochloramine accurately in Nanopure water, but the DPD colorimetric method measured higher residuals (inorganic and organic chloramines) than MonochlorF or MIMS when in the presence of NOM due to organic chloramines. The indophenol method (MonochlorF) accurately detected only monochloramine and not other chloramine forms. Overall, the monochloramine concentration measured by MonochlorF was comparable with the MIMS results. A <b>combined</b> <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> approach by the DPD colorimetric method does not differentiate between monochloramine and organic chloramines. Therefore, DPD colorimetric methods can overestimate disinfection efficacy in chloraminated water systems because of interference from organic chloramines that have no or poor bactericidal ability.

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 200 water samples were collected from surface and depth of four swimming pools of Kashan during 2008 - 9. Physicochemical parameters such as, temperature, pH, <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> and turbidity of the pools were studied. Samples were tested for the presence of parasitic and fungal contamination by specific mediums. Results: The <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in 71 of samples was standard. The average pH level was 7. 7 and 88 of samples were standard. No parasite and free living amoebae were observed. The prevalence of saprophytic and opportunistic fungi was 42 in surface and 12 in depth, which was not significant in different swimming pools (P= 0. 95). Twelve species of saprophytic and opportunistic fungi were isolated the highest and the lowest number of species were aspergillus (50) and fusarium (3. 7), respectively. The <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in fungal contamination between swimming pools was less than standard (P= 0. 014). Conclusion: Although no parasites and free living amoebae were observed in Kashan's swimming pools, the prevalence of saprophytic and opportunistic fungi was relatively high. Such condition may be attributed to low concentration of <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine,</b> inadequate water treatment and water high temperature...|$|R
30|$|Temperature and pH were {{measured}} for surface and treated water using portable HACH multi-parameter. <b>Residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> was measured for treated water by photometric method (S.M. 4500 -Cl G) (APHA, AWWA, WEF, 2005 using HACH colorimetric.|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the villages}} with water supply systems under the {{supervision}} of the Water and Wastewater Company were studied. Turbidity, fecal coliform, Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) and free <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> were analyzed. The measured turbidity and free <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> in many of the villages were less than drinking water guidelines. Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) and fecal coliforms tests in drinking water samples were positive. According to the results, it is found out that the water source used for drinking consumption must be fully treated properly and finally be chlorinated Water and Wastewater Company should have a proper consideration on safe drinking water supply...|$|R
40|$|Water {{used for}} brewing tea {{plays a major}} role in the quality of tea. Water with higher {{hardness}} gives very dark coloured brew. This study was conducted to determine the effect of water hardness and free <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> on the quality of black tea liquor. Theaflavin (TF) and Thearubigin (TR) levels are lower in comparison with the tea brewed in distilled water. At the same time, there is an increase in High Polymerized Substance (HPS) and Total Liquor Colour (TLC). While water with higher hardness has a negative impact on tea brew, water with high concentration of free <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> did not affect the quality of tea brew...|$|R
40|$|Ultra violet (UV) {{dechlorination}} {{was performed}} to eliminate <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> as the byproducts of chlorination process. UV dechlorination utilizes photon energy generated by medium pressure (MP) UV lamp to produce powerful hydroxyls which in return break down chemical bond of the <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine.</b> This study was undertaken to investigate the removal of <b>residual</b> <b>chlorine</b> under a medium pressure UV radiation and evaluate the influence of UV fluence on chlorine removal efficiency based on both laboratory and plant scale experiments. In laboratory experiments, water samples were exposed to a UV collimated beam apparatus equipped with a medium pressure (MP) UV lamp over a specified exposure time. Chlorine concentrations were measured before and after UV exposure to calculate its chlorine removal efficiency. Results showed that <b>chlorine</b> <b>residual</b> decreased over time and the removal efficiency increased as the UV fluence increased. The maximum UV fluence applied in the laboratory experiments (513 mJ/cm 2) resulted in less than 25 % of total chlorine reduction. The field experiments were conducted at a waterworks in Singapore with total capacity of 22 l/s using an existing UV system. The plant scale studies supported laboratory findings with about 9 % of chlorine removal efficiency. The chlorine decay rates (fluence-based first order constant) were also calculated...|$|R
