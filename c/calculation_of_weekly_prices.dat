These studies used low-frequency data in an environment of high rates of inflation. This paper investigates staggering and synchronisation <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> for ten food products in 131 grocery stores in Germany over the period from May 1995 to December 2000 (296 weeks). Different forms of staggering and synchronisation (across-store synchronisation, within type-of-store synchronisation, within retailer synchronisation or across-product synchronisation) have been analysed. None of these forms of synchronisation is supported empirically however. In contrast, perfect staggering can only be rejected in very few cases...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{degree of}} price rigidity {{has been reported}} for branded foods in various studies with scanner data. One possible explanation for price rigidity is the existence of psychological pricing points. The authors analyze to what extent psychological pricing {{plays a role in}} grocery retailing and whether it contributes to the price rigidity of branded foods in Germany. Psychological pricing-defined here as just-below-the-round-figure-pricing-is empirically analyzed with scanner data <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> for 20 food brands in 38 retail outlets from September 1996 to June 1999. Psychological pricing turned out to be extremely important in German food retailing. Branded food prices are remarkably sticky and psychological pricing points contribute strongly to price rigidity. Other factors like the sales phenomenon and firm-specific effects are additionally important. [EconLit Classifications: Q 110, Q 130 ]. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{forecast}} prices of arbitrary agricultural commodity in different wholesale markets in one city, this paper proposes a mixed model, which combines ARIMA model and PLS regression method based {{on time and}} space factors. This mixed model is able to obtain the forecasting results <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> agricultural commodities in different markets. Meanwhile, this paper sets up variables to measure the price changing trend based on the change of exogenous variables and prices, thus achieves the warning of daily price changes using neural networks. The model is tested with the data of several types of agricultural commodities and error analysis is made. The result shows that the mixed model is more accurate in forecasting agricultural commodity prices than each single model does, and has better accuracy in warning values. The mixed model, to some extent, forecasts the daily price changes of agricultural commodities.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies nominal rigidities using a novel scanner {{data set}} {{consisting}} <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>prices,</b> costs and quantities sold for {{a cross-section of}} retailers in Chile. Nominal rigidities are found to {{take the form of}} reference price inertia. While posted prices change every 5 weeks (on average), reference prices change every two quarters (29 weeks), on average. Frequencies of reference price adjustment are found to be systematically related to cost volatility and expenditure shares. In addition, the probability of a reference price adjustment is increasing in the markup gap. While frequencies of reference price adjustment vary systematically across chains, markups vary within narrow bounds and pass-through coe ¢ cients conditional on a reference price change are high (on the order of 0. 86 - 0. 93) suggesting that movements in reference prices are closely related to movements in prices at the previous stage of the distribution chain. Synchronization of price changes across stores appears to be particularly strong across stores belonging to a given chain. Evidence on within-stores and categories synchronization is consistent with a price adjustment technology featuring economies of scope...|$|R

The central research questions to be examined include the following: What was the impact of the major structural change resulting from the takeover of Safeway by Morrison on pricing behaviour and outcomes in the GB food retail market? Is there evidence of prices having a leader-follower pattern amongst GB supermarkets? If so, what are its causes and likely consequences? Finally, and more broadly, how if at all do price movements in times when cost pressures are inflationary differ from those when cost pressures are relatively relaxed? If so, what are the implications? The approach used will involve model building followed by econometric (statistical) analysis of five years' worth <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>pricing</b> data across four major supermarket chains for a significant number of products, alongside other information on the products and the firms involved...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to discuss the design of futures hedging {{strategies}} in European natural gas markets (NBP, TTF and Zeebrugge). A common feature of energy prices is that conditional mean and volatility are driven by seasonal trends due to weather, demand, and storage level seasonalities. This paper follows and extends the Ederington and Salas (2008) framework and considers seasonalities in mean and volatility when minimum variance hedge ratios are computed. Our results show that hedging effectiveness is much higher when the seasonal pattern in spot price changes is approximated with lagged values of the basis (futures price minus spot price). This fact remain true for short (a week) and long (one, three and six months) hedging periods. Furthermore, volatility <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>price</b> changes also has a seasonal pattern and is higher in winter than in summer. A simple volatility seasonal model that is based on sinusoidal functions on the basis improves the risk reduction obtained by strategies in which hedging ratios are estimated with linear regressions. Seasonal hedging strategies, linear regression based strategies, or even a na position, perform better than more sophisticated statistical methods...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence from scanner data that branded foods {{in the grocery}} retailing sector contain {{a substantial amount of}} price rigidity (HERRMANN/MÖSER 2003). One of the many alternative explanations for price rigidity is the existence of psychological pricing points. The economic literature has been most hesitant against this theory and, in a survey, BLINDER et al. (1998) found no confirmation at all based on the views of business managers. In that study, however, retail trade is underrepresented. The theory of psychological pricing points continues to be an important concept for pricing in firms which directly sell to consumers. Empirical findings in various studies, e. g. in the early work by FRIEDMAN (1967) for food retailing, suggest that psychological prices are widely used in the retailing sector. Hence, it is the objective of this paper to elaborate to which extent psychological pricing plays a role in grocery retailing and whether it contributes to price rigidity of branded foods in Germany. The empirical analysis will be based on scanner data <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>prices</b> for 20 branded foods in Germany in the period 1996 - 99...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the response}} of producer, wholesale, retail, and international trade prices to shocks in prices in upstream or downstream stages in the Dutch onion and red pepper supply chains. The analysis allows for asymmetric adjustment among food prices when the wholesale or retail stages exert oligopoly power. The study provides a theoretical underpinning {{of the relationship between}} domestic and international prices. Asymmetries in price transmission are examined using the Houck as well as the error-correction approaches. The impulse response analyses show that red pepper prices return to their long-term equilibria relatively quickly, whereas onion prices settle at a new equilibrium after a price shock. Market power in the wholesale sector affects the responses of onion prices but has little or no effect on the responses of red pepper prices. Market power in the retail sector does not affect the onion prices or the red pepper <b>prices.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> <b>weekly</b> <b>price</b> data over the period from 2005 to 2008 suggests asymmetric adjustment in producer-wholesale and international-producer prices in the Dutch onion supply chain.

Consumption of rice contaminated with heavy metals can pre-dispose individuals to serious health complications. This study determined the levels of some heavy metals (Cd, Cr, As, Pb and Hg) in locally produced rice samples from the northern region of Nigeria.
