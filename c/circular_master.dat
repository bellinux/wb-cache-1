40|$|The plant {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is characterized}} by a complex, multipartite structure. In cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) common bean, the sterility-inducing mitochondrial configuration maps as three autonomous DNA molecules, one containing the sterility-associated sequence pvs-or f 239. We constructed a physical map of the mitochondrial genome from the direct progenitors to the CMS cytoplasm and have shown that it maps as a single, <b>circular</b> <b>master</b> configuration. With long-exposure autoradiography of DNA gel blots and polymerase chain reaction analysis, we demonstrate that the three-molecule CMS-associated configuration was present at unusually low copy number within the progenitor genome and that the progenitor form was present substoichiometrically within the genome of the CMS line. Furthermore, upon spontaneous reversion to fertility, the progenitor genomic configuration as well as the molecule containing the pvs-or f 239 sterility-associated sequence were both maintained at substoichiometric levels within the revertant genome. In vitro mitochondrial incubation results demonstrated that the genomic shift of the pvs-or f 239 -containing molecule to substoichiometric levels upon spontaneous reversion was a reversible phenomenon. Moreover, we demonstrate that substoichiometric forms, apparently silent with regard to gene expression, are transcriptionally and translationally active once amplified. Thus, copy number suppression may serve as an effective means of regulating gene expression in plant mitochondria...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{the reverse}} {{replication}} of circular micro grating structures on glass substrates is implemented using an ultra-violet curable resin and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold {{which has the}} same structure as the original <b>circular</b> grating <b>master.</b> Two different techniques ("double PDMS replication" and "polymer-PDMS replication") are employed to fabricate those reversed circular micro grating structures. Surface profiling measurements show that in case of the polymer-PDMS replication {{the dimensions of the}} resulting circular grating structures closely approximate those of the master, while the grating height is slightly decreased in case of the double PDMS replication technique, mainly due {{to the use of the}} releasing agent. For both methods, the grating slopes of the circular gratings are almost unchanged, leading to the desired optical performance. The two techniques are quite useful for more accurate reverse replications of micro optical and photonic structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} plant {{mitochondrial}} genomes sequenced exceeds two dozen. However, {{for a detailed}} comparative study of different phylogenetic branches more plant mitochondrial genomes should be sequenced. This article presents sequencing data and comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the legume Vicia faba. The size of the V. faba <b>circular</b> mitochondrial <b>master</b> chromosome of cultivar Broad Windsor was estimated as 588, 000 bp with a genome complexity of 387, 745 bp and 52 conservative mitochondrial genes; 32 of them encoding proteins, 3 rRNA, and 17 tRNA genes. Six tRNA genes were highly homologous to chloroplast genome sequences. In addition to the 52 conservative genes, 114 unique open reading frames (ORFs) were found, 36 without significant homol-ogy to any known proteins and 29 with homology to the Medicago truncatula nuclear genome and to other plant mitochondrial ORFs, 49 ORFs were not homologous to M. truncatula but possessed sequences with significant homology to other plant mitochon-drial or nuclear ORFs. In general, the unique ORFs revealed very low homology to known closely related legumes, but several sequence homologies were found between V. faba, Beta vulgaris, Nicotiana tabacum, Vitis vinifera, and even the monocots Oryza sativa an...|$|R
40|$|In {{cantilevered}} implant-supported complete prosthesis, the abutments` different heights represent different lever arms {{to which}} the abutments are subjected resulting in deformation of the components, which in turn transmit the load to the adjacent bone. The purpose of this in vitro study was to quantitatively assess the deformation of abutments of different heights in mandibular cantilevered implant-supported complete prosthesis. A <b>circular</b> steel <b>master</b> cast with five perforations containing implant replicas (O 3. 75 mm) was used. Two groups were formed according to the types of alloy of the framework (CoCr or PdAg). Three frameworks were made for each group to be tested with 4, 5. 5 and 7 mm abutments. A 100 N load was applied at a point 15 mm distal {{to the center of}} the terminal implant. Readings of the deformations generated on the mesial and distal aspects of the abutments were obtained with the use of strain gauges. Deformation caused by tension and compression was observed in all specimens with the terminal abutment taking most of the load. An increase in deformation was observed in the terminal abutment as the height was increased. The use of an alloy of higher elastic modulus (CoCr) also caused the abutment deformation to increase. Abutment`s height and framework alloy influence the deformation of abutments of mandibular cantilevered implant-supported prosthesis.

30|$|The main {{mitochondrial}} and chloroplast chromosomes are <b>circular</b> (also called <b>master</b> circles) and do {{not have}} arms. Locus IDs for genes found on organellar chromosomes will use the symbols ‘Mt’ for mitochondrion and ‘Pt’ for plastid (chloroplast), respectively, instead of the chromosome number designations used for nuclear genes. These letters will be followed by a letter “g” indicating that the locus corresponds to a gene, followed by a seven-digit number (assuming there will be fewer than 10, 000 genes per chromosome) indicating the sequential order of genes along an organellar chromosome, independent of the polarity of the strand, in ascending order from the first base pair of the completely sequenced molecule to the last base pair in the linearized molecule (as submitted by the author of the sequence to any of the reference sequence databases, namely NCBI-GenBank, DDBJ, or EMBL). For example, OsPtg 0000100 indicates the first gene on the rice plastid genome. Looking at the GenBank entries for plastid genomes sequenced from O. sativa cv. Nipponbare, this would refer to the gene, PSBA (82 – 1, 143  bp), as referenced by GenBank entry NC_ 001320.|$|R
40|$|Despite intense {{investigation}} for over 25 years, the in vivo structure of plant mitochondrial genomes remains uncertain. Mapping studies and genome sequencing generally produce large circular chromosomes, whereas electrophoretic and microscopic studies typically reveal linear and multibranched molecules. To more fully assess {{the structure of}} plant mitochondrial genomes, the complete sequence of the monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus DC. line IM 62) mitochondrial DNA was constructed from a large (35 kb) paired-end shotgun sequencing library to a high depth of coverage (∼ 30 ×). The complete genome maps as a 525, 671 bp circular molecule and exhibits a fairly conventional set of features including 62 genes (encoding 35 proteins, 24 transfer RNAs, and 3 ribosomal RNAs), 22 introns, 3 large repeats (2. 7, 9. 6, and 29 kb), and 96 small repeats (40 – 293 bp). Most paired-end reads (71 %) mapped to the consensus sequence at the expected distance and orientation across the entire genome, validating the accuracy of assembly. Another 10 % of reads provided clear evidence of alternative genomic conformations due to apparent rearrangements across large repeats. Quantitative assessment of these repeat-spanning read pairs revealed that all large repeat arrangements are present at appreciable frequencies in vivo, although not always in equimolar amounts. The observed stoichiometric differences for some arrangements are inconsistent with a predominant <b>master</b> <b>circular</b> structure for the mitochondrial genome of M. guttatus IM 62. Finally, because IM 62 contains a cryptic cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system, an in silico search for potential CMS genes was undertaken. The three chimeric open reading frames (ORFs) identified in this study, {{in addition to the}} previously identified ORFs upstream of the nad 6 gene, are the most likely CMS candidate genes in this line...|$|R
40|$|Circular Economy {{can provide}} support and is {{significance}} to {{society for the}} direction towards a more sustainable economical and ecological environment. In contradiction to use a product and then discarding it is reuse, remanufacturing and recycling important pieces in recourse optimized process where materials are not systematically leaving the loop. But what should these actions and business models be for a company in the manufacturing industry that focuses on <b>Circular</b> Economy. This <b>master</b> thesis will present a case study for the manufacturing industry, GKN Aerospace Sweden. The study argues for a combination of multiple business models, evaluating and finding critical metal alloys and investigates manufacturing technologies for Circular Economy. The data was collected from conducted interviews with managers at different departments ranging from treasury, product development, production, after market, quality and material-handling. Rare and expensive metal alloys, long lead times for productions and long lifecycles for the produces components are the purpose {{for the implementation of}} solutions for how to reach a Circular Economy within the aerospace industry. These challenges are not only a financial risk but also make a company vulnerable for external threats. There is a need for more knowledge about sustainable development and material handling for product development to avoid dependence on rare, expensive core materials. We found, during the benchmarking of GKN Aerospace Sweden current business models, that the solution to reach Circular Economy must include a combination of sustainable awareness, technical innovation platform and a value proposition to customers, which consist more than physical products. Our suggestions to the company for them to implement Circular Economy are the following; i) actively try to get an overview and own a larger part of the products lifecycle, from development, production and maintenance; ii) continue the development of additive manufacturing because of its cost efficient potential and its efficient use of metal powders; iii) use recycled metal chips from manufacturing as input material to new production and maintenance. These changes together are a solution for GKN Aerospace Sweden to contribute to a financial as well as ecological sustainable development...|$|R
