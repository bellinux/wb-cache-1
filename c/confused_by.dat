5|$|During {{its final}} flight, the {{aircraft}} was carrying 144 passengers, two pilots, and four {{cabin crew members}} from at least 18 countries—mostly Germany and Spain. The count was <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the multiple citizenship status of some people on board.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. <b>Confused</b> <b>by</b> the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Norman {{met with}} each of her followers; she died on July12, 1993, and was cremated. In her will, she promised to return to Earth, {{accompanied}} by the Space Brothers, in eight years. Students, {{some of whom were}} surprised and <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> her death, were instructed by leaders not to grieve because she was in a celestial state. Some of them privately mourned, and a few left the group. Items of Norman's were distributed to students, some of whom wore them at later events.|$|E

5|$|De Candolle, in {{the first}} {{systematic}} taxonomy of Narcissus, arranged the species into named groups, and those names have largely endured for the various subdivisions since and bear his name as their authority.

Eventually, after being disowned by his family and seemingly abandoned by his friends, Hasan is shot and subsequently tortured to death by Japanese police.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the situation was further <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae).

5|$|The album's working {{title was}} {{originally}} announced as Magic's in the Makeup in May 1998 {{and later as}} Saturn Returns in November 1999. Stefani was <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> her feelings of depression and interest in Sylvia Plath while recording the album. Her boyfriend Gavin Rossdale {{told her that she}} was going through her Saturn return. Saturn's orbit takes 29.4 Earth years and, in astrology, the time when Saturn returns to its position during a person's birth is believed to be a period of self-evaluation. Stefani was born October 3, 1969, and many of the songs were written during her Saturn return.|$|E
5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in years past. In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the legal position. Disturbing a grave {{was a criminal}} offence, as was the taking of property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E
5000|$|At one point, {{there was}} a G-Rapid that stopped at the most {{stations}} out of all rapid trains, but was considered too <b>confusing</b> <b>by</b> passengers and soon put out of service.

5|$|After Katja is shot, Sarah flees in Beth's car and {{receives}} {{a call from}} a woman on Beth's phone. The woman, after hearing that Katja is dead, instructs Sarah to dispose of the body and retrieve Katja's briefcase. While burying Katja's body, Sarah finds a hotel key in her pocket and keeps it. She visits her foster brother Felix's apartment and discovers that the $75,000 she stole from Beth's bank account has been taken by Beth's detective partner Art. When she returns to Beth's apartment she is surprised to find Beth's boyfriend, Paul, who seems <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> Sarah's demeanour but does not realise that she is not Beth. The next day, Sarah prepares to meet Art, and lies that the $75,000 belongs to Paul, but Art says he will return the money only after the hearing Beth must attend about a suspicious shooting in which she was involved.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Great Awakening, {{the region}} was a hotbed of {{religious}} enthusiasm. Between 1817 and 1825, there were several camp meetings and revivals in the Palmyra area. Although Smith's parents disagreed about religion, the family {{was caught up in}} this excitement. Smith later said he became interested in religion by about the age of twelve. As a teenager, he may have been sympathetic to Methodism. With other family members, Smith also engaged in religious folk magic, which was a relatively common practice in that time and place. Both his parents and his maternal grandfather reportedly had visions or dreams that they believed communicated messages from God. Smith said that, although he had become concerned about the welfare of his soul, he was <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the claims of competing religious denominations.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra {{has been suggested}} by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover no one on the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} ported to the PC by Tim Ansell of Creative Assembly, and to Atari ST by Jones' friend Wayne Smithson, while Dailly began porting {{the game to}} the Commodore 64 {{following}} the Personal Computer World Show in September 1989. Dailly used the code from the Talisman demo, and wrote a new sprite system. He also re-worked the multi-directional scrolling, and wrote his own tape loading routines, wanting one that allowed players to play a simple game while Blood Money loaded. Smith designed the graphics for the port, and became <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> {{the limitations of the}} hardware: he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint, and was limited to sixteen colours. Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of Blood Money on 12 March 1990.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{platform}} format was {{a departure}} from the original ToeJam & Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game {{due to a lack of}} support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and <b>confused</b> <b>by</b> the radical change in direction.|$|E

This multi-disciplinary workshop will seek to construct a fundamental {{understanding of the nature of}} physicality: how humans experience, manipulate, react and reason about 'real' physical things and how this may inform the design process and the design of future innovative products...|$|R
