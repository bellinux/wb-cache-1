5|$|After the <b>Columbine</b> High School {{massacre}} on April 20, 1999, {{gun shows}} and background checks became {{a focus of}} national debate in the United States. Weeks after the <b>Columbine</b> shooting, Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.|$|E
5|$|Ledonne {{produced}} a documentary film {{based on his}} experiences {{after the release of}} Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre. Titled Playing <b>Columbine,</b> the documentary uses the controversy surrounding the game to investigate the large issues facing video games as a medium for artistic expression. The film premiered at AFI Fest in Los Angeles, California on November 7, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Ledonne {{had spent}} many years conceptualizing games, but never created one due to his lack of game design and {{programming}} knowledge. He was inspired to create a video game about <b>Columbine</b> by his own experience being bullied and the effect the shooting had on his life. The game represents a critique of how traditional media sensationalized the shooting (in particular the role of video games), as well as parodying video games themselves. Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre was created with ASCII's game development program RPG Maker 2000 and took approximately six months to complete. Ledonne initially published the game anonymously, releasing an artist's statement about the work after his identity was revealed. Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre was released for free online and attracted little attention until 2006, when widespread media coverage fueled {{hundreds of thousands of}} downloads.|$|E

Motionless they lifted their faces to the light. Out in the aspen groves, where the grass was turning gold, the <b>columbines</b> blew gracefully in the wind, nodding and swaying. The most exquisite and finest of these <b>columbines</b> hid in the shaded nooks, star-sweet in the silent gloom of the woods.|$|R

5|$|Reaction to Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre was {{enormously}} negative; {{the title was}} criticized as trivializing the actions of two murderers {{and the lives of}} the innocent. The game's cartoon presentation and the side-plot into hell were considered by critics as obscuring the game's message, but it received minor note as a game that transcended the stereotypical associations of the medium as entertainment for children. Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacres themes and content led to it being included in discussions as to whether video games cause violence; the title was later listed as one of the possible motivating factors of the shooter after the 2006 Dawson College shootings. The game has been described as an art game, and Ledonne has become a spokesperson for video games as an emerging art form, producing a documentary in 2008 called Playing <b>Columbine</b> about his game and its impact.|$|E
5|$|Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's <b>Columbine</b> High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E
5|$|Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre RPG!, {{abbreviated}} SCMRPG!, is a role-playing {{video game}} created by Danny Ledonne and released in April 2005. The game recreates the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> High School shootings near Littleton, Colorado. Players assume {{the roles of}} gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold and act out the massacre, with flashbacks relating parts of Harris and Klebold's past experiences. The game begins {{on the day of}} the shootings and follows Harris and Klebold after their suicides to fictional adventures in perdition.|$|E

5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the <b>Columbine</b> RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|Prior to release, Blow withdrew Braid {{from the}} 2007 Slamdance Guerrilla Games Competition in protest after the {{controversial}} Super <b>Columbine</b> Massacre RPG! was {{dropped from the}} competition despite being one of six finalists.

5|$|Before the <b>Columbine</b> High School massacre, {{perpetrator}} Dylan Klebold referenced lyrics from Nine Inch Nails songs {{multiple times}} in his journal. Klebold heavily identified with the protagonist of The Downward Spiral {{as a symbol of}} his own depression. On May 4, 1999, a hearing on the marketing and distribution practices of violent content to minors by the television, music, film, and video game industries was conducted before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. The committee heard testimony from cultural observers, professors, and mental health professionals, that included conservative William Bennett and the Archbishop of Denver, Reverend Charles J. Chaput. Participants criticized the album, Nine Inch Nails' label-mate Marilyn Manson, and the 1999 film The Matrix for their alleged contribution to the environment that made tragedies like <b>Columbine</b> possible. The committee requested that the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.|$|E
5|$|Florida's {{involvement}} in the U.S. Civil War was limited compared to other Confederate states because it had {{a fraction of the}} populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the USS <b>Columbine,</b> a Union paddle steamer used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. John Jackson Dickison captured, burned, and sank the USS <b>Columbine,</b> making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the Maple Leaf, which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near Julington Creek, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including daguerreotypes and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.|$|E
5|$|In 1998–99, {{with the}} {{addition}} of the Nashville Predators to the league, the NHL realigned their divisions and the Colorado Avalanche were put in the new Northwest Division. Despite a slow 2–6–1 start, Colorado finished with a 44–28–10 record for 98 points, won the Northwest Division and finished second in the Western Conference. Between January 10 and February 7, the Avalanche had their longest winning streak ever with 12 games. Following the <b>Columbine</b> High School massacre, Colorado postponed their first two playoff games to a later date; they would wear patches in honor of the <b>Columbine</b> victims on their jerseys during the playoffs. After defeating both the San Jose Sharks and the Detroit Red Wings in six games in the first two rounds, Colorado met the Presidents' Trophy-winning Dallas Stars in the Western Conference Finals, where they lost in seven games. Peter Forsberg, the playoffs leading scorer with 24 points (8 goals and 16 assists), was again elected to the league's first All-Star team and Chris Drury won the Calder Memorial Trophy for the best rookie of the season. Together with Milan Hejduk, both were elected for the NHL All-Rookie Team {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 <b>Columbine</b> High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys by painting them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 1999, {{following}} the <b>Columbine</b> High School massacre and increasing news media {{reports on the}} effects on violent films, games, and other media on society, the United States Senate Commerce committee held a hearing about Hollywood's marketing of films to youths. The committee focused specifically on horror films.

This symbolic use of flowers is again a van Eyckian motif. While they may appear incongruous with the architectural setting, this was probably the effect that van der Weyden was seeking.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically.

Ledonne decided to make a game that would explore why the <b>Columbine</b> shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E

40|$|Southern European <b>columbines</b> (genus Aquilegia) are {{involved}} in active processes of diversification, and the Iberian Peninsula offers a privileged observatory to witness the process. Studies on Iberian <b>columbines</b> have provided significant advances on species diversification, but we still lack a complete perspective of the genetic diversification in the Iberian scenario. This work explores how genetic diversity of the genus Aquilegia is geographically structured across the Iberian Peninsula. We used Bayesian clustering methods, principal coordinates analyses, and NJ phenograms to assess the genetic relationships among 285 individuals from 62 locations and detect the main lineages. Genetic diversity of Iberian <b>columbines</b> consists of five geographically structured lineages, corresponding to different Iberian taxa. Differentiation among lineages shows particularly complex admixture patterns at Northeast and highly homogeneous toward Northwest and Southeast. This geographic genetic structure suggests the existence of incomplete lineage sorting and interspecific hybridization as could be expected in recent processes of diversification {{under the influence of}} quaternary postglacial migrations. This scenario is consistent with what is proposed by the most recent studies on European and Iberian <b>columbines,</b> which point to geographic isolation and divergent selection by habitat specialization as the main diversification drivers of the Iberian Aquilegia complex.
