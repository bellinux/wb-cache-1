60|$|NUTHATCH (Sitta europaea).--This pretty {{creature}} {{will come}} and be fed on nuts at windows in the winter. These nuts he thrusts into crevices of bark to hold them fast while he hammers the shell. The remains may often be found. For many years a pair built in a hole half-way down an old apple-tree covered with ivy at Otterbourne House, and the exertions of the magpie with <b>clipped</b> <b>wing</b> to swing himself on a trail of ivy into the hole were comical, {{as well as his}} wrath when he fell off, as he uniformly did.|$|E

The nature of a ship is motion, and the merit of a seaman is judicious and lively handling;--but of what use is complaining, since it will neither lift an anchor nor fill a sail? What is your opinion, Captain Ludlow, {{concerning}} an after life, and of all those matters one occasionally hears of it he happens to drift {{in the way of}} a church?" ...|$|E

60|$|It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was {{now going}} head out, and sending his spout before {{him in a}} continual tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the sea, or {{sideways}} rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I seen a bird with <b>clipped</b> <b>wing,</b> making affrighted broken circles in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle, and this made {{the sight of him}} unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.|$|E

The first, <b>Clipped</b> <b>Wings,</b> which has never been published, was written during a three-week {{vacation}} from Western Union in March 1922. Only fragments of his first effort remain, although parts of it were recycled in other works, such as Tropic of Capricorn. A study of twelve Western Union messengers, Miller called <b>Clipped</b> <b>Wings</b> [...] "a long book and probably a very bad one." ...|$|R

50|$|The CR-3 was a mid-wing radial engined taildragger racer with manual {{retractable}} {{landing gear}} and a tail skid. The propeller was from a <b>clipped</b> <b>wing</b> Monocoupe racer #14.

50|$|On 29 October 1910, Brookins {{flew the}} new Wright Baby Grand, a <b>clipped</b> <b>wing</b> V-8 powered flyer {{to compete in}} the Gordon Bennett Trophy {{competition}} at Belmont, New York.

5000|$|The male's mating {{display is}} a ritual flight, which, {{as with many}} other pigeons, {{consists}} of a rapid, near-vertical climb to height followed by a long glide downward in a circle, with the wings held below the body in an inverted [...] "V" [...] shape. At all other times, flight is typically direct using fast and <b>clipped</b> <b>wing</b> beats and without use of gliding.|$|E
