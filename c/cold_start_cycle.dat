The emission cycle was performed both for cold and hot engine start up conditions. Modal analysis of emission compounds {{was carried out}} with the focus on nitro-gen oxides (NOx) emission. The scope of the work {{was to assess the}} influence of cold start effect on selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system operation efficiency. Due {{to the fact that the}} urea injection strategy in SCR system can by activated only after certain exhaust gas temperature threshold is achieved, the NOx emission on WHTC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>cycle</b> is significantly greater than for the hot start one. Result analysis included also determination of time period needed for achieving the readiness of SCR system to work efficiently.

30|$|Some {{works have}} {{promoted}} {{the adoption of}} new technologies for wayfinding aids. Chumkamon (Chumkamon et al. 2008) proposed a navigation method using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) triggers that activate an audio message when a user walks past an RFID tag embedded in a footpath block, and argued its potential to support blind people and tourists under normal conditions, and firefighters in a smoke-filled building. However, delay problems exist due to the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>cycle</b> of GPRS (General packet radio service) modems. Willis (2005) designed an RFID tag grid with spatial coordinates and information describing the pre-defined surroundings, thus being independent of server-based databases and wireless connections. Long (1996) uses an infrared (IR) system for the indoor version positioning system in the Cyberguide project. He uses TV remote control units as active beacons, and a special IR receiver tuned to the carrier frequency of those beacons. However, the location awareness of this IR system is based on users’ explicit behavior, {{and it is also}} very expensive in a large-scale setting. Fingerprinting techniques are also combined with wireless local area networks to calculate the location information (Bahl 2000). Krishnan (Krishnan 2004) used a small number of stationary emitters and sniffers employed in a novel way to locate standard wireless clients in an enterprise. All these technologies are not commonly used because of high costs or specific requirements for hardware. Additionally, the technologies lack a user-friendly display of routing information, which would massively reduce users’ cognitive workloads in wayfinding tasks.|$|E
40|$|Two Euro 3 {{commercial}} trucks fuelled with a 30 % v/v biodiesel/diesel {{fuel blend}} (B 30) and pure diesel fuel {{were tested in}} laboratory under the standard driving conditions (UDC and EUDC driving cycles) and the CADC ‘‘URBAN’’ test cycle, in order to evaluate the fuel consumption, regulated (CO, HC, NOx, PM) and unregulated emissions (aldehydes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). After substitution of diesel fuel with B 30 the following results were observed. The fuel economy increased proportionally to the deficit of the fuel heating value; so the average efficiency of the engine can be considered almost unchanged. In partial disagreement with the literature data, CO and HC emissions showed a slight increase, whereas NOx emissions did not vary. It {{must be noted that}} these variations did not pass the statistical significance test. On the contrary, PM, soot fraction and particle number showed a significant reduction; furthermore, nearly 90 % of the emitted particles had an aerodynamic diameter less than 0. 1 lm. The formaldehyde emission markedly increased for both vehicles, whereas acetaldehyde emissions showed ambiguous trends. Since the remaining aldehydes were under the instrumental detection limit, the ozone formation potential analysis with B 30 showed a raise almost proportional to the formaldehyde emission increase. Moreover the lightest and most abundant PAHs species (3 – 4 benzene rings) showed high increases even if to different extent for the two vehicles. The species with 4 – 5 rings (such as benzo(a) pyrene) showed a net reduction, often under the instrumental limit. Finally, the carcinogenic risk evaluation of PAHs exhibited a clear toxicity reduction, specially in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>cycle,</b> when the catalytic converter’s efficiency was not fully reached...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a novel {{strategy}} {{is reported to}} improve the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> performance of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells at subzero temperatures. Hydrophilic nano-oxide such as SiO(2) is added into the catalyst layer (CL) of the cathode to increase its water storing capacity. To investigate the effect of nanosized SiO(2) addition, the catalyst coated membranes (CCMs) with 5 wt. % and without nanosized SiO(2) are fabricated. Although at normal operation conditions the cell performance with nanosized SiO(2) was not so good as that without SiO(2), <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> experiments at - 8 degrees C showed that the former could start and run even at 100 mA cm(- 2) for about 25 min and latter failed very shortly. Even at - 10 degrees C, the addition of SiO(2) dramatically increased the running time before the cell voltage dropped to zero. These results further experimentally proved the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> process was strongly related with the cathode water storage capacity. Also, the performance degradation during 8 <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>cycles</b> was evaluated through polarization curves, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spetra (EIS). Compared with the cell without SiO(2) addition, the cell with 5 wt. % SiO(2) indicated no obvious degradation on cell performance, electrochemical active surface area and charge transfer resistance after experiencing <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> <b>cycles</b> at - 8 degrees C.

40|$|A well-designed engine {{encapsulation}} {{can extend}} engine cool-down time significantly - {{on the order}} of 500 - 700 %. This is expected to have a sensitive influence on the fuel consumption due to the increased probability for high oil temperatures at the following engine start, reduced length of the initial warm-up period and consequently, reduced friction losses. This work aims to set up and develop a simulation platform for investigations of the potential effect of thermal engine encapsulation on fuel consumption of commercial and passenger vehicles. It documents the development and validation of the methods and tools used for this purpose, and apply them to estimate the effect of various initial oil temperatures on the fuel consumption of a commercial vehicle during a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> drive <b>cycle.</b> Presented is a comprehensive 1 D unsteady model verified against experimental data and supported with parallel 3 D simulations. The model contains predictive representations of engine, cooling system, oil circuit and utilizes a temperature dependent model of engine friction losses. A number of steady-state and transient simulations are performed for a 13 L Volvo FM commercial vehicle and results are compared with physical measurements. The developed 1 D and 3 D methodologies were validated and achieved satisfactory accuracy both in steady and unsteady mode of operation. Predictions of oil sump temperature development were compared to measured values to conclude that the model is fit for further use in a temperature dependent friction model. As a last step all models were unified to perform a complete vehicle simulation of a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> drive <b>cycle</b> at different initial oil temperatures in order to evaluate the influence of reduced warm-up phase on fuel consumption. The simulations indicated that there is a potential of up to approx. 3 % decrease of fuel consumption as a result of increased initial engine temperatures...|$|R

Here, we propose a novel integrated WHRS using the internal combustion engine (ICE) coolant passages and an exchanger on the exhaust working as pre-heater / boiler / super-heater of a Rankine cycle. The expander is connected to an electric generator unit (GU), and the pump is connected to an electric motor unit (MU). The vehicle is also fitted with an electric, kinetic energy recovery system (KERS). The expander and condenser are bypassed during {{the first part of the}} NEDC when the vehicle covers the four ECE- 15 (Economic Commission for Europe - 15) - UDC (Urban Drive Cycle) segments where the engine warms-up.   Only after the engine is fully warmed up, during the last part of the NEDC, the extra urban driving cycle (EUDC) segment, the expander and condenser are activated to recover part of the coolant and exhaust energy. </p...|$|R
40|$|A more {{sustainable}} transportation {{calls for the}} use of alternative and renewable fuels, a further increase of the fuel energy conversion efficiency of internal combustion engines as well as the reduction of the thermal engine energy supply by recovering the braking energy. The paper presents two concepts being developed to improve the fuel conversion efficiency of internal combustion engines for transport applications. The first concept works on the combustion evolution {{to increase the amount of}} fuel energy transformed in piston work within the cylinder. The second concept works on the waste exhaust and coolant energies to be recovered through a power turbine downstream of the turbocharger turbine on the exhaust line and a steam turbine feed with the steam produced by a boiler/super heater made of the coolant passages and a heat exchanger on the exhaust line. The concepts work with hydrogen (and in this case a water injector is also necessary) as well as lower alkanes (methane, propane, butane). Preliminary simulations show improvement of top fuel conversion efficiencies to above 50 % in the high power density operation. The waste heat recovery system also permits faster warm-up during <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> driving <b>cycles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Turbochargers are key {{components}} of engine air-paths that must be carefully considered during the development process. The combination of fluid, mechanical, and thermal phenomenon make the turbocharger a highly dynamic and nonlinear modeling challenge. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the dynamic response of the turbocharger system across a frequency spectrum from 0. 003 Hz to 500 Hz, i. e., for exhaust gas pulsation in steady state, load steps, and <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> drive <b>cycles,</b> to validate the assumption of quasi-steady assumptions for particular modeling problems. A waste-gated turbine was modeled using the dual orifice approach, a lumped capacitance heat transfer model, and novel, physics-based pneumatic actuator mechanism model. Each submodel has been validated individually against the experimental measurements. The turbine inlet pressure and temperature and the waste-gate actuator pressure were perturbed across the full frequency range both individually and simultaneously in separate numerical investigations. The dynamic responses of turbine housing temperature, turbocharger rotor speed, waste-gate opening, mass flow, and gas temperatures/pressures were all investigated. The mass flow parameter exhibits significant dynamic behavior above 100 Hz, illustrating that the quasi-steady assumption is invalid in this frequency range. The waste-gate actuator system showed quasi-steady behavior below 10 Hz, while the mechanical inertia of the turbine attenuated fluctuations in shaft speed for frequencies between 0. 1 and 10 Hz. The thermal inertia of the turbocharger housing meant that housing temperature variations were supressed at frequencies above 0. 01 Hz. The results have been used to illustrate the importance of model parameters for three transient simulation scenarios (<b>cold</b> <b>start,</b> load step, and pulsating exhaust flow) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Cold</b> <b>start</b> driving <b>cycles</b> exhibit an {{increase}} in friction losses due to the low temperatures of metal and media compared to normal operating engine conditions. These friction losses are responsible for up to 10 % penalty in fuel economy over the official drive cycles like the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC), where {{the temperature of the}} oil even {{at the end of the}} 1180 s of the drive cycle is below the fully warmed up values of between 100 °C and 120 °C. At engine oil temperatures below 100 °C the water from the blow by condensates and dilutes the engine oil in the oil pan which negatively affects engine wear. Therefore engine oil temperatures above 100 °C are desirable to minimize engine wear through blow by condensate. The paper presents a new technique to warm up the engine oil that significantly reduces the friction losses and therefore also reduces the fuel economy penalty during a 22 °C <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> NEDC. Chassis dynamometer experiments demonstrated fuel economy improvements of over 7 % as well as significant emission reductions by rapidly increasing the oil temperature. Oil temperatures were increased by up to 60 °C during certain parts of the NEDC. It is shown how a very simple sensitivity analysis can be used to assess the relative size or efficiency of different heat transfer passes and the resulting fuel economy improvement potential of different heat recovery systems system. Due to its simplicity the method is very fast to use and therefore also very cost effective. The method demonstrated a very good correlation for the fuel consumption within ± 1 % compared to measurements on a vehicle chassis roll...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{papers have}} shown the {{potentials}} of gasoline-like internal combustion engines fitted with Rankine cycle systems to deliver Diesel-like steady state fuel conversion efficiencies recovering the exhaust and the coolant waste heat with off-the-shelf components. In addition to the pros of the technology significantly increasing steady state efficiencies - up to 5 % in absolute values and much more in relative values - these papers also mentioned the cons of the technology, increased backpressures, increased weight, more complex packaging, more complex control, troublesome transient operation, and finally the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> issues that prevent the uptake of the technology. This paper further explores the option to use Rankine cycle systems to improve the fuel economy of vehicles under normal driving conditions. A single Rankine cycle system is integrated here with the engine design. A latest turbocharged 1. 6 L direct injection engine has the coolant circuit modified to serve as pre-heater for the Rankine cycle fluid. This fluid is then vaporised and superheated in the boiler/superheater coaxial to the exhaust pipe located downstream of the turbocharger turbine and the closed coupled catalytic converter. The exhaust ports are insulated to reduce the heat losses. The pump of the Rankine cycle system is electrically operated. The expander of the Rankine cycle system drives a generator to recharge the traction battery pack. The thermal engine {{is connected to the}} transmission through an electric clutch and a motor/generator that permits to supplement/replace the thermal engine energy supply, recover the braking energy and start/stop the thermal engine. The integrated Rankine cycle system is intended to permit short warming-up profiles, reduced heat losses and reduced weight and packaging issues, delivering significant benefits during <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> driving <b>cycles</b> as the NEDC in addition to the long term, constant load and speed extra urban driving...|$|R

This leads {{to the development of}} a methodology which enables more scientific measurements to be performed on such a catalyst when it is connected to a live diesel engine. During hot and <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> NEDC drive <b>cycles,</b> measurements were performed on a Pt on alumina DOC connected to a Ford 2. 0 litre diesel engine. Under these transient conditions, emission data was gathered (pre- and post-DOC), and this was also translated into cumulative emissions over the drive cycles. In addition, valuable data was gathered on the spatial temperature variations in the DOC during such a drive cycle and it is shown how, under certain conditions, the temperatures start to increase at the back-end of the catalyst and then move towards the front. This data, in combination with other measurements, helps to understand the performance of the DOC and can also be used to test the robustness of mathematical models of such systems...|$|R
40|$|One {{adult male}} inhales about 10. 8 m 3 of air per day. Therefore, {{achieving}} good air quality {{is a global}} concern from a health point of view. As {{one of the most}} prevalent toxic pollution sources are emissions from diesel fleets, researchers have been introducing various approaches to reduce the exhaust emission, such as introducing new fuels and engine modifications (Ristovski, 2012). Most of the current research has focused on emission reduction methods in steady-state operating modes; however, the daily driving schedule of automotive and truck vehicles is inherently unsteady. Moreover, the most critical conditions encountered by engines are met during transient operations. Despite the increased complexity, results from tests involving transient operation are more closely related to reality than steady-state testing, in most cases (Giakoumis, 2012). Generally, transient operation could refer to operating conditions that are not steady-state, such as: free acceleration, load changes, <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> and driving <b>cycles.</b> For example, <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions from a heavy duty vehicle reported to be 15 times higher than their steady-state values (Giakoumis, 2012). This study intends to show the effect of transient operation on exhaust particulate emission by adapting the stall test, as outlined in MDG 29, Guideline for the management of diesel engine pollutants in underground environments in New South Wales-Australia (MDG 29, 2008), to a repeatable engine testbed drive cycle. For this implementation, the stall test is designed to be performed on three speeds, (1500, 2000 and 2400) with a similar pattern. At each speed the engine is on idle for 20 s, then accelerated from idle to full load (100...|$|R

40|$|European {{regulations}} set {{the emissions}} requirements for new vehicles at 130 g CO 2 /km, {{with an additional}} 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures, including gear shift indicators. However, there is presently little knowledge of how much fuel or CO 2 could actually be saved {{by the introduction of}} gear shift indicators, and there is no consensus on how these savings should be quantified. This study presents a procedure which allows these savings to be quantified over a New European Driving Cycle, and explores the trade-off between fuel savings and drivability. A vehicle model was established and calibrated using data obtained from pedal ramp tests conducted at steady speed using a chassis dynamometer, significantly reducing the time required to generate a calibration data set when compared with a steady-state mapping approach. This model was used for the optimisation of gear shift points on the New European Driving Cycle for reduced fuel consumption subject to drivability constraints. During model validation the greatest fuel saving achieved experimentally for a warm engine was 3. 6 % over the New European Driving Cycle, within the constraints imposed using subjective driver appraisal of vehicle drivability. The same shift strategy for a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> driving <b>cycle</b> showed a fuel saving of 4. 3 % over the baseline, with corresponding savings in CO 2 of 4. 5 % or 6. 4 g CO 2 /km. For both hot and cold tests the savings were made entirely in the urban phase of the New European Driving Cycle; {{there were no significant differences}} in fuel consumption in the extra-urban phase. These results suggest that the introduction of gear shift indicators could have a substantial impact, contributing significantly towards the 10 g CO 2 /km to be achieved by additional complementary measures when assessed in this way. It is not clear whether these savings would translate into real world driving conditions, but for legislative purposes an assessment procedure based on the New European Driving Cycle remains a logical choice for simplicity and continuity...|$|R

Due to the insufficiency of user feedbacks, sequential prediction usually suffers from the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. There {{are two kinds of}} popular approaches based on matrix factorization (MF) and Markov chains (MC) for item prediction. MF methods factorize the user-item matrix to learn general tastes of users. MC methods predict the next behavior based on recent behaviors. However, they have limitations.

40|$|Proton {{exchange}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising energy conversion devices for the future in automotive applications. One of the major technical challenges for the commercialization of PEMFC is the effective start-up from subzero temperatures, often referred to as “cold start”. The major problem of PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> is that the product water freezes when the temperature inside the PEMFC is lower than the freezing point. If the catalyst layer (CL) is fully occupied by ice before the cell temperature rises above the freezing point, the electrochemical reaction may stop due to the blockage of the reaction sites. However, only a few of the previous PEMFC studies paid attention to <b>cold</b> <b>start.</b> Hence, understanding the ice formation mechanisms and optimizing the design and operational strategies for PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> are critically important. In this research, an experimental setup for the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> testing with simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions is designed and built; a one-dimensional (1 D) analytical model for quick estimate of purging durations before the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes is formulated; and a comprehensive three-dimensional (3 D) PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> model is developed. The unique feature of the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> experiment is the inclusion of the simultaneous measurement of current and temperature distributions. Since most of the previous numerical models are limited to either 1 D or two-dimensional (2 D) or 3 D but only considering a section of the entire cell due to computational requirement, the measured distribution data are critically important to better understand the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> characteristics. With a full set of conservation equations, the 3 D model comprehensively accounts for the various transport phenomena during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes. The unique feature of this model is the inclusion of: (i) the water freezing in the membrane electrolyte and its effects on the membrane conductivity; (ii) the non-equilibrium mass transfer between the water in the ionomer and the water (vapour, liquid and ice) in the pore region of the CL; and (iii) both the water freezing and melting in the CL and gas diffusion layer (GDL). This model therefore provides the fundamental framework for the future top-down multi-dimensional multiphase modelling of PEMFC. The experimental and numerical results elaborate the ice formation mechanisms and other important transport phenomena during the PEMFC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> processes. The effects of the various cell designs, operating conditions and external heating methods on the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> performance are studied.

There are many adaptive learning systems that adapt learning materials to student properties, preferences, and activities. Adaptive learning environments mostly support only traditional concepts of learning. There is a need to design and develop an e-learning system that embodies principles of constructivist learning approach. The solution is in recommenders systems, which suggest items of interest to users based on their preferences (i. e. previous ratings). If there are no ratings for a certain user or item/object, there is a situation called a <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem, which leads to unreliable recommendations. Researchers mostly avoid tackling the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> in recommender systems. The topic of presented dissertation is designing a recommender system with a novel approach to avoid <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. Approaches for solving the new user <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem can be divided into two main groups: the first group performs additional inquiries to gather more information about the users; and the second group uses dedicated algorithms for users in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. The first group of approaches aims at performing additional inquiries about the user. According to this approach, we relate combinations of different learning styles (taking into account four different learning styles models) to preferred multimedia types. We explore a decision model aimed at proposing learning material of an appropriate multimedia type. The study includes 272 student participants. The resulting decision model shows that students prefer well-structured learning texts with colour discrimination, and that the hemispheric learning style model is the most important criterion in deciding student preferences for different multimedia learning materials. To provide a more accurate and reliable model for recommending different multimedia types more learning style models must be combined. Kolb’s classification and the VAK classification allow us to learn if students prefer {{an active role in the}} learning process, and what multimedia type they prefer. The results also shows that there is an obvious need to combine learning styles model in order to get a wider view of the student’s characteristics: an approach to problem solving problems, cognitive modes, way of thinking, and a dominant mode of perceiving information. On another hand, model recommends same multimedia material regardless of the learning topic. In the second part of our research, we have designed and developed a novel approach for alleviating the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem by imputing missing values into the input matrix, thereby improving recommendation performance. Our approach has three steps: 1) finding similar users to given user in <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state; 2) selecting relevant attributes for the imputation process; 3) aggregate ratings to input matrix for a user in the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. We separate our approach for solving <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem into solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem and solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem. According to the results of our experiments (solving absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem), the results indicate that all our proposed methods improve recommending for non-negative matrix factorization with stochastic gradient descent (NG). For semi-non-negative matrix factorization with missing data (SN), combinations FR-ME (imputing attribute's mean value into the attributes that have the highest frequency of the most frequent values) and SD-MF (imputing attribute’s most frequent value into attributes that have the lowest standard deviation) improve recommendations for users in the absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. For non-negative matrix factorization with alternating least squares (NS) and matrix factorization by data fusion (DF), none of variations of proposed parameters (methods) improves recommending in absolute <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> state. In the next stage of our research, we evaluated our approach for solving partial <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> problem.

Collaborative filtering (CF) is the most popular approaches used for recommender systems, but it suffers from complete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (CCS) problem where no rating record are available and incomplete <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> (ICS) problem where only a small number of rating records are available for some new items or users in the system. In this paper, we propose two recommendation models to solve the CCS and ICS problems for new items, which are based on a framework of tightly coupled CF approach and deep learning neural network. A specific deep neural network SADE is used to extract the content features of the items. The state of the art CF model, timeSVD++, which models and utilizes temporal dynamics of user preferences and item features, is modified to take the content features into prediction of ratings for <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. Extensive experiments on a large Netflix rating dataset of movies are performed, which show that our proposed recommendation models largely outperform the baseline models for rating prediction of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items. The two proposed recommendation models are also evaluated and compared on ICS items, and a flexible scheme of model retraining and switching is proposed to deal with the transition of items from <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> to non-cold start status. The experiment results on Netflix movie recommendation show the tight coupling of CF approach and deep learning neural network is feasible and very effective for <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> item recommendation. The design is general and can be applied to many other recommender systems for online shopping and social networking applications. The solution of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> item problem can largely improve user experience and trust of recommender systems, and effectively promote <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> items...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{and rapid}} startup of proton {{exchange}} membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) at subfreezing temperatures (also called <b>cold</b> <b>start)</b> {{is of great}} importance for their commercialization in automotive and portable devices. In order to maintain good proton conductivity, the water content in the membrane must be kept at a certain level {{to ensure that the}} membrane remains fully hydrated. However, the water in the pores of the catalyst layer (CL), gas diffusion layer (GDL) and the membrane may freeze once the cell temperature decreases below the freezing point (Tf). Thus, methods which could enable the fuel cell startup without or with slight performance degradation at subfreezing temperature need to be studied. This paper presents an extensive review on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> of PEMFCs, including the state and phase changes of water in PEMFCs, impacts of water freezing on PEMFCs, numerical and experimental studies on PEMFCs, and <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> strategies. The impacts on each component of the fuel cell are discussed in detail. Related numerical and experimental work is also discussed. It should be mentioned that the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> strategies, especially the enumerated patents, are of great reference value on the practical <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> process...|$|R

40|$|One {{aspect of}} {{research}} in the area of bootstrapping of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> users in trust-aware recommender systems is on guiding new users find trusted users in the trust network. In this paper we examine the question “Which type of users do <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> users actually trust? ” We analyze the users trusted by <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> users in the Epinions dataset (Massa & Avesani, 2006 a). We examine the set of trusted users on the basis of four critical parameters: number of outgoing links, number of incoming links, number of items rated and a hybrid parameter defined as preference score. We also experimentally evaluate the impact of the four parameters on prediction accuracy. Our analysis shows that <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> users will more likely trust a user with higher number of incoming links as a trusted user even though trusting users with high preference score would result in better prediction accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Diesel engine {{performance}} during <b>cold</b> <b>starting</b> is very crucial for smooth engine start at undesirable emission level. The development of <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> strategies that improve combustion stability relies {{mainly on the}} understanding of the combustion process during the <b>cold</b> <b>starting.</b> Even for modern diesel engines, the conditions during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> is far from normal operation characterized by large amount of unburned hydrocarbon emissions and long start to idling time. Thus, the use of an in-cylinder combustion sensor to measure the combustion quality during engine starting can significantly improve engine <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> control strategies. The ion current sensor {{has the potential to be}} used as onboard sensor to measure the combustion process during engine operation and can be used as feedback to the engine control unit. The aim of this research is to study and determine the combustion instability and its impact on various combustion and ionization characteristics by performing cycle analysis for a comparison between {{engine performance}} using ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and aviation jet propulsion (JP 8) fuels during <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> at 25 ˚C. It also shows a comparison between two ion current sensors during low load idling using the same fuels. For this purpose, the glow plug and fuel injector of VW 2. 0 L turbocharged diesel engine were modified and electrically insulated to be used as ion current sensors. The experimental test was conducted to study the combustion process and emission product produced during low load idling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{object of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of ethanol–gasoline blends on CO and HC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions from a four- stroke motorcycle. Nowadays, due to catalyst improvements and efficient electronic mixture control, a significant part of the total emissions during a trip takes place during the cold phase. The employ of alternative fuels could be one of means to lessen the cold-start emissions from two-wheeler engines: ethanol is known as potential alcohol alternative fuel for spark ignition engines, which can be blended with gasoline to increase oxygen content and then to decrease CO and HC emissions. From this considerations, an experimental-analytical investigation was performed on the exhaust cold extra emissions of one motorcycle belonging to the Euro- 3 legislative category. The study explains a calculation procedure to model the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> transient behavior of motorcycles in order to evaluate the impact of ethanol addition (10, 20 and 30 vol. %) on <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> emissions compared with a reference commercial gasoline. Results of the tests indicate that CO and HC <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> extra emissions by using ethanol–gasoline blended fuels decrease compared to the use of unleaded gasoline. Emission factors during the <b>cold</b> <b>start</b> transient were quantized as a function of the ethanol percentage in the blended fuels...|$|R
