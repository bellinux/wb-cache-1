40|$|International audienceDiscrete {{position}} sensors are undesirable in our automotive applications. We {{are looking}} for a sensitive,simple, robust and low cost sensing method for the positioning of a rotor in a doubly salient motor. This paper describes an experimental modeling of the stator phase with regards to the frequency and amplitude of a sinusoidal carrier and an original method based on the principle of inductance measurement in the unenergized phase. A series resonant <b>circuit</b> <b>R</b> L(Theta) C is used. L(Theta) is the phase inductance varying with the rotor position. The capacitor value is determined by Lo. C. omega²= 1 (Lo is the minimum phase inductance). The resonant circuit is supplied by a high frequency sinusoidal current generator. A synchronous demodulation technique, based on the extraction of the maximal amplitude, gives us a voltage signal. This component is a direct measure of the angle linked to the phase inductance. The advantages of this method are its simplicity, low cost and robustness. But above all it {{is the fact that it}} amplifies the phenomenon of inductance variation, thereby enhancing the accuracy in the measurement of the position angles...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{piezoelectric}} {{materials for}} the development of electromechanical devices for the harvesting or scavenging of ambient vibrations has been extensively studied over the last decade. The energy conversion from mechanical (vibratory) to electrical energy is provided by the electromechanical coupling between mechanical strains/stresses and electric charges/voltages in the piezoelectric material. The majority of the studies found in the open literature present a tip-mass cantilever piezoelectric device tuned on the operating frequency. Although recent results show that these devices can be quite effective for harvesting small amounts of electrical energy, little has been published on the robustness of these devices or on the effect of parametric uncertainties on the energy harvested. This work focuses on a cantilever plate with bonded piezoelectric patches and a tip-mass serving as an energy harvesting device. The rectifier and storage electric circuit was replaced by a resistive <b>circuit</b> (<b>R).</b> In addition, an alternative to improve the harvesting performance by adding an inductance in series to the harvesting circuit, thus leading to a resonant circuit (RL), is considered. A coupled finite element model leading to mechanical (displacements) and electrical (charges at electrodes) degrees of freedom is considered. An analysis of the effect of parametric uncertainties of the device on the electric output is performed. Piezoelectric and dielectric constants of the piezoelectric active layers and electric circuit equivalent inductance are considered as stochastic parameters. Mean and confidence intervals of the electric output are evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Hardness {{amplification}} {{results show}} that for every Boolean function f there exists a Boolean function Amp(f) such that the following holds: if every circuit of size s computes f correctly on at most a 1 − δ fraction of inputs, then every circuit of size s ′ computes Amp(f) correctly on at most a 1 / 2 +ϵ fraction of inputs. All hardness amplification results in the literature suffer from “size loss ” meaning that s ′ ≤ ϵ · s. In this paper we show that proofs using “non-uniform reductions ” must suffer from such size loss. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, all proofs in the literature are by non-uniform reductions. Our result is the first lower bound that applies to non-uniform reductions that are adaptive. A reduction is an oracle <b>circuit</b> <b>R</b> (·) such that when given oracle access to any function D that computes Amp(f) correctly on a 1 / 2 + ϵ fraction of inputs, R D computes f correctly on a 1 − δ fraction of inputs. A non-uniform reduction is allowed to also receive a short advice string that may depend on both f and D in an arbitrary way. The well known connection between hardness amplification and list-decodable error-correcting codes implies that reductions showing hardness amplification cannot be uniform for δ, ϵ < 1 / 4. A reduction is non-adaptive if it makes non-adaptive queries to its oracle. Shaltiel and Viola (SICOMP 2010) showed lower bounds on the number of queries made by nonunifor...|$|E

Data were also collected on galvanized steel for comparison purposes. A library of Bode magnitude plots was generated for each coating including curves for the initial time and after each week of atmospheric exposure at the Beach Corrosion Test site near the Space Shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center for up to four weeks. Subsequent measurements were collected after 8 weeks and after one year of atmospheric exposure. Analysis of the impedance data was performed {{with the purpose of}} identifying parameters {{that could be used to}} predict the long-term performance of zinc-rich primers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this problem set is to {{familiarize}} yourself with Kirchoff's voltage and current laws, and the operation of simple op-amp circuits. To accomplish this, {{you will need to}} use the following: Standard Circuit Nomenclature: Discrete components, named node voltages and input/output signals are in upper case. For example Vin, the voltage into a <b>circuit,</b> <b>R</b> 3 is resistor number 3, V 1 is the voltage a node 1. Properties of named components, such as resistors, are in lower case. For example, a resistor R 3 would have a voltage of v 3 across it, and a current of i 3 through it. The standard convention is to always have positive current flow from the positive voltage terminal to the negative voltage terminal. The current through a circuit may be represented by an arrow above, or an arrow on the symbol. They are used interchangeably for clarity. Figure 1 : Equivalent circuit element representations. Figure 2 : Voltage and Current circuit source symbols, which supply power to circuits. The +,-, and arrow denote voltage polarity and current direction. The ground symbols are defined at the point in the circuit where there is 0 V. 1 Ohm’s Law: The voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current flowing through it and is modeled by “Ohm’s Law. ” v 1 = i 1 · R 1 (1) i 1 + v 1 − Figure 3 : Resistor notation showing v 1, the voltage across the resistor, and i 1, the current through the resistor. For example, if 5 mA of current is flowing through a resistor of 10 k�, then the voltage drop across the resistor will be 5 mA· 10 k � = 50 V olts. It is very important to remember that the voltage drops {{in the direction of the}} current flow, as the electrons move from a higher potential to a lower potential. To ensure that you do not get your voltages and currents backwards, you should always label them before performing any calculations.
