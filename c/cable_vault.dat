50|$|The {{origin of}} the fire was sparks from {{equipment}} in the basement <b>cable</b> <b>vault</b> igniting the plastic insulation on nearby cables that ran {{to all of the}} floors above. The combination of the flammable insulation and the method of penetrating each floor allowed the fire to spread rapidly and emit toxic fumes that are alleged to have caused later deaths of over a dozen fire fighters.|$|E

5000|$|The {{expense of}} {{creating}} conduit lines in New York was reduced {{where it was}} possible to convert the <b>cable</b> <b>vaults</b> from discontinued <b>cable</b> car lines. The huge cost of building new conduits gave New York the distinction of having one of the last horsecar lines (the Bleecker Street Line) in the U.S., not closing until 1917. (Pittsburgh ran the last U.S. horsecar, in 1923.) ...|$|R
50|$|New York City {{developed}} {{at least seven}} cable car lines. A line in Washington DC ran to Georgetown (where some of the underground <b>cable</b> <b>vaults</b> can still be seen today). Los Angeles also had several cable car lines, including the Second Street Cable Railroad, which operated from 1885 to 1889, and the Temple Street Cable Railway, which operated from 1886 to 1898. The most extensive cable system in the US was in Chicago between 1882 and 1906.|$|R
50|$|A utility tunnel, utility corridor, or utilidor is {{a passage}} built {{underground}} or above ground to carry utility lines such as electricity, steam, water supply pipes, and sewer pipes. Communications utilities like fiber optics, cable television, and telephone cables are also sometimes carried. One {{may also be}} referred to as a services tunnel, services trench, services vault, or <b>cable</b> <b>vault.</b> Smaller cable containment {{is often referred to as}} a cable duct or underground conduit. Direct-buried cable is a major alternative to ducts or tunnels.|$|E
5000|$|Supposedly, the 1.544 Mbit/s {{rate was}} chosen because tests done by AT&T Long Lines in Chicago were {{conducted}} underground. The test site was typical of Bell System outside plant {{of the time in}} that, to accommodate loading coils, <b>cable</b> <b>vault</b> manholes were physically 2000 m apart, which determined the repeater spacing. The optimum bit rate was chosen empirically—the capacity was increased until the failure rate was unacceptable, then reduced to leave a margin. Companding allowed acceptable audio performance with only seven bits per PCM sample in this original T1/D1 system. The later D3 and D4 channel banks had an extended frame format, allowing eight bits per sample, reduced to seven every sixth sample or frame when one bit was [...] "robbed" [...] for signaling the state of the channel. The standard does not allow an all zero sample which would produce a long string of binary zeros and cause the repeaters to lose bit sync. However, when carrying data (Switched 56) there could be long strings of zeros, so one bit per sample is set to [...] "1" [...] (jam bit 7) leaving 7 bits × 8,000 frames per second for data.|$|E
5000|$|The building's older design {{utilizes}} thick masonry {{and gives}} the building added strength, which helped the building withstand the attacks and remain structurally sound. The building has thick, heavy masonry in the exterior infill walls, which encloses the building's steel frame. Brick, cinder, concrete and other masonry materials encase interior steel columns, beams, girders and other structural elements. The masonry allowed the structure to absorb much of the energy from debris hitting the building. [...] Nonetheless, the building had extensive damage to its east and south facades. Underground <b>cable</b> <b>vaults</b> belonging to Verizon, along with other underground utility infrastructure were also heavily damaged from water and debris.|$|R

50|$|When built, the {{building}} had its business office on the first floor, with space for customers to transact business with the phone company, public telephone booths, and rooms for long distance calls. The next 12 floors contained telephone equipment, such as long distance switchboards, other special switchboards, and dial central office equipment for the MAin, ATlantic, and BRidgeport central offices. There were also breakroom facilities and a lunch room for telephone operators who were off duty. The 14th, 25th, and 26th floors were mechanical floors. Finally, a tower on the 15th through 24th floors housed administrative offices of the telephone company. There were also three basement floors with power and heating equipment, along with <b>cable</b> <b>vaults.</b> The building measured 346 ft above street level, 42 ft in the basements, and had 26 stories. Many of these stories were somewhat taller than those in office buildings due {{to the size of}} central office equipment. The building had 24000 sq ft of floor space, and housed about 1,000 employees.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for detailed geometrical representation of the existing cultural heritage, in particular to improve the comprehension of interactions between different phenomena and to allow a better decisional and planning process. The LiDAR technology (Light Detection and Ranging) can be adopted in different fields, ranging from aerial applications to mobile and terrestrial mapping systems. One of the main target {{of this study is}} to propose an integration of innovative and settled inquiring techniques, ranging from the reading of the technological system, to non-destructive tools for diagnosis and 3 D metric modeling of buildings heritage. Many inquiring techniques, including Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) method, have been exploited to study the main room of the Valentino Castle in Torino. The so-called "Salone delle Feste" (Hall of Honor), conceived in the XVIIth century under the guidance of Carlo di Castellamonte, has been selected as a test area. The beautiful frescos and stuccoes of the domical vault are sustained by a typical Delorme carpentry, whose span is among the largest of their kind. The dome suffered from degradation during the years, and a series of interventions were put into place. A survey has revealed that the suspender <b>cables</b> above the <b>vault</b> in the region close to the abutments have lost their tension. This may indicate an increase of the vault deformation; therefore a structural assessment of the dome is mandatory. The high detailed metric survey, carried out with integrated laser scanning and digital close range photogrammetry, reinforced the structural hypothesis of damages and revealed the deformation effects. In addition, the correlation between the survey-model of the intrados and of the extrados allowed a non-destructive and extensive determination of the dome thickness. The photogram-metrical survey of frescos, with the re-projection of images on vault surface model (texture mapping), is purposed to exactly localize former restorations and their signs on fresco continuity. The present paper illustrates the generation of the 3 D high-resolution model and its relations with the results of the structural survey; both of them support the Finite Element numerical simulation of the dom...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{system of the}} future is going to be as much of a revolution to the electric energy industry as the wireless telephone has been to consumer communications. An electricity market transformation must occur before the changes can take place, but this evolution is already starting to occur {{in many parts of the}} country. In this paper, we discuss a vision for a future {{distribution system}}, areas that will be key for technology development, and the advantages of the new electricity market. Present day distribution systems are in a sense, unintelligent. Distribution systems respond to faults, or short circuits, by sensing the very high fault current and then opening circuit breakers to isolate the fault. Some newer automated systems determine fault location and then close other circuit breakers to provide an alternate path for power after the fault so that the number of customers left without power is minimized, but the extent of the reconfiguration is limited. Distribution systems also have some methods to regulate voltage, but there is little real time local response to contingencies such as loss of a transmission line or a generator. In present day distribution systems, there is very little control of load, or demand response, and Distributed Energy Resources (DER, distributed generation, storage, and responsive load) located in the distribution system are prohibited from even regulating voltage. In fact, industry standards and utility interconnection agreements typically require that when a contingency occurs on a distribution or transmission system that results in a voltage or frequency excursion, the DER is to disconnect rather than help. There is a pressing need to evolve the distribution system model to one that can respond to contingencies sensed locally, and has the local intelligence and autonomy to deal with contingencies such as unusual loading, transmission congestion, and line outages. Markets must be simple for customers to participate in the energy and reliability services transactions. In the future, distribution systems will have local monitors for current, voltage, and temperature at many locations such as substations, underground <b>cable</b> and transformer <b>vaults,</b> feeders and laterals. These monitors will input data to local agents. The local agents will be computers scattered throughout the distribution system constantly assessing system condition. The local agents will communicate quickly with their local sensors and with each other, and more slowly with status reports they send to the central control authority. The local agents will review temperature, current and voltage data and diagnose problems such as overloads, over/under voltages, and voltage presence on circuits that are supposed to be deenergized. They will also sense contingencies such as equipment outage due to faults. The local agents will be partially independent from central control and authorized to take corrective action when they diagnose problems. Some of the actions that will be taken will be local dispatch of DER, local capacitor connection, voltage regulator control, local circuit switching, and provision of local reliability services, such as load response. The local agents will report up to a central agent on a periodic basis. There will be several different types of local agents that will function together. One of the most important capabilities will be for the customers to participate in the energy and reliability services markets. With only a few exceptions, these markets are now only open to large generators and a few large loads. Reliability services, such as voltage regulation or reserve power, are much more effective when supplied locally at the load. In addition, local participation in these markets will provide demand elasticity in the load [...] something that is lacking now. At present, when power is scarce due to a contingency or severe weather, there is no customer response; customers continue to use the same amount because they do not see the market price. An elastic demand means that some customers would cut back during periods of shortage and high price. Elasticity in demand is essential for a healthy market system...|$|R
