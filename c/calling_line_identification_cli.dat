50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for outgoing calls from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> (<b>CLI)</b> or caller-id of extensions for outgoing calls is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R
50|$|Call centers use IVR {{systems to}} {{identify}} and segment callers. The ability to identify customers allows services to be tailored according to the customer profile. The caller can be given the option {{to wait in the}} queue, choose an automated service, or request a callback. The system may obtain caller <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> (<b>CLI)</b> data from the network to help identify or authenticate the caller. Additional caller authentication data could include account number, personal information, password and biometrics (such as voice print). IVR also enables customer prioritization. In a system wherein individual customers may have a different status, the service will automatically prioritize the individual's call and move customers to the front of a specific queue.|$|R
50|$|Caller ID (caller identification, CID), also <b>called</b> <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> (CLID), <b>calling</b> number {{delivery}} (CND), {{calling number}} <b>identification</b> (CNID), <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> presentation (CLIP), or call display, is a telephone service, available in analog and digital telephone systems, including VoIP, that transmits a caller's telephone number to the called party's telephone equipment {{when the call}} is being set up. The caller ID service may include the transmission of a name associated with the calling telephone number. This service is called CNAM.|$|R
40|$|Traditional "traceability" (the flipside idea to "anonymity") on the Internet {{attempts}} {{to identify the}} IP address that caused an action to occur. This is sufficient for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) {{to take action against}} the authorized user of that IP address. Law enforcement agencies usually need to go beyond this in order to identify the individual concerned. However, shared accounts, unavailable Caller <b>Line</b> <b>Identification</b> (<b>CLI),</b> and spoofing on Ethernets, mean that in the real world there is poor traceability for the "last hop". This means that {{it is not possible to}} consider the information gathered as "conclusive evidence" suitable for a Court, but just as "intelligence"; an investigative tool, albeit a valuable one. Law enforcement officers should be especially wary that a sophisticated opponent might be able to frame an innocent bystander...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, some {{countries}} offer anonymous caller rejection, which rejects all calls when the subscriber's name, number (or both) is blocked. Some telephone companies protect their clients from receiving blocked information by routing anonymous calls to a service (such as AT&T Privacy Manager), where {{the caller is}} required to announce himself or herself. The service then asks the called party {{if they want to}} accept or reject the call. Other telephone companies play a recording to the caller advising them of the called party's rejection configuration, and often offer advice (such as prefixing their dialing with *82) on how to get their call to the intended called party. Blocking the number is referred to as <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> restriction (CLIR). Emergency services will most likely be able to show the restricted number using a service <b>called</b> <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> restriction override (CLIRO), or by using general ANI services.|$|R
5000|$|In some countries, {{the terms}} caller display, <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> {{presentation}} (CLIP), <b>call</b> capture, or just <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> identity are used; call display is the predominant marketing name used in Canada (although some customers still {{refer to it}} colloquially as [...] "caller ID"). The idea of CNID as a service for POTS subscribers originated from automatic number identification (ANI) {{as a part of}} toll free number service in the United States.|$|R
50|$|This Vertical Service Code, *82, enables <b>calling</b> <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> {{regardless}} of subscriber preference, dialed to unblock withheld numbers (private callers) in the U.S. on a per-call basis. If Caller ID is subscribed to or enabled on the <b>line</b> receiving the <b>call,</b> the unblocked {{phone number and}} registered name is displayed - unable to determine that the caller subscribes to outgoing callerID blocking or that *82 has been dialed to temporarily override that subscription. *82 can be dialed from U.S. land-line house phones and business lines, {{as well as most}} cell phones and mobile devices. Some mobile devices may alternatively offer or require a menu selection to override Caller ID blocking per call.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a text <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> {{method is}} proposed. The text lines of printed {{document}} {{are easy to}} segment due to uniform straightness of the lines and sufficient gap between the lines. But in handwritten documents, the line is non-uniform and interline gaps are variable. We take Rabindranath Tagore's manuscript as {{it is one of}} the most difficult manuscripts that contain doodles. Our method consists of a pre-processing stage to clean the document image. Then we separate doodles from the manuscript to get the textual region. After that we identify the text lines on the manuscript.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} re-evaluate {{the fine}} structure of Sn 11 +-Sn 14 + ions. These ions are essential in bright extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) plasma-light sources for next-generation nanolithography, but their complex electronic structure {{is an open}} challenge for both theory and experiment. We combine optical spectroscopy of magnetic dipole M 1 transitions, in a wavelength range covering 260 to 780 nm, with charge-state selective ionization in an electron beam ion trap. Our measurements confirm the predictive power of ab initio calculations based on Fock space coupled cluster theory. We validate our <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> using semiempirical cowan calculations with adjustable wave-function parameters. Available Ritz combinations further strengthen our analysis.

40|$|The <b>identification</b> of {{spectral}} <b>lines</b> {{can be a}} tedious process {{requiring the}} interrogation of large spectroscopic databases, but it does lend itself to software algorithms that can determine the characteristics of candidate <b>line</b> <b>identifications.</b> We present here criteria used for the <b>identification</b> of <b>lines</b> and a logic developed for a <b>line</b> <b>identification</b> software package <b>called</b> EMILI, which uses the v 2. 04 Atomic Line List as the basic line database. EMILI considers all possible database transitions within the wavelength uncertainties for observed optical emission lines and computes an approximate intensity for each candidate line. It searches for other multiplet members {{that are expected to}} be seen with each candidate line, and rank orders all of the tentative <b>line</b> <b>identifications</b> for each observed line based on a set of criteria. When applied to the spectra of the Orion Nebula and the planetary nebula IC 418, EMILI's recommended line ID's agree well with those of previous traditional manual line assignments. The existence of a semi-automated procedure should give impetus to the study of very high signal-to-noise spectra, enabling the identification of previously unidentified spectral lines to be handled with ease and consistency.
