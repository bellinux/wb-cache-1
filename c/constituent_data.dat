Cyberspace includes: a) physical infrastructures and telecommunications devices that allow for theconnection of technological and communication system networks, understood inthe broadest sense (SCADA devices, smartphones/tablets, computers, servers,etc.); b) computer systems (see point a) and the related (sometimes embedded) softwarethat guarantee the domain's basic operational functioning and connectivity; c) networks between computer systems; d) networks of networks that connect computer systems (the distinction between networks and networks of networks is mainly organizational); e) the access nodes of users and intermediaries routing nodes; f) <b>constituent</b> <b>data</b> (or resident data). Often, in common parlance (and sometimes in commercial language), networks ofnetworks are called Internet (with a lowercase i), while networks between computers arecalled intranet. Internet (with a capital I, in journalistic language sometimes called the Net)can be considered {{a part of the}} system a). A distinctive and constitutive feature ofcyberspace is that no central entity exercises control over all the networks that make upthis new domain. Just as in the real world there is no world government, cyberspace lacks an institutionally predefined hierarchical center. To cyberspace, a domain without a hierarchical orderingprinciple, we can therefore extend the definition of international politics coined byKenneth Waltz: as being [...] "with no system of law enforceable." [...] This {{does not mean that the}} dimension of power in cyberspace is absent, nor that poweris dispersed and scattered into a thousand invisible streams, nor that it is evenly spreadacross myriad people and organizations, as some scholars had predicted. On the contrary, cyberspace is characterized by a precise structuring of hierarchies of power.|$|E

Many of these processes affecting the atmosphere are subject to various interactions and can be highly nonlinear. This complexity makes it necessary to apply computer models {{in order to understand}} the natural behavior of the atmosphere.

The increased complexity of models together with the different types of information about pollutants have the potential of contributing to a better understanding of chemical processes.

40|$|Intergroup {{conflicts}} are ubiquitous—they occur, for instance, between (work) groups, departments, organizations, political parties, or nations. Such {{conflicts are}} commonly addressed through negotiations, in which representatives negotiate {{on behalf of}} their constituency. Intergroup negotiations are complex, as representatives need to navigate between the interests of their own constituency and the other party. This implies that negotiation success requires careful processing of information about both parties' interests. Here, we examine how representative negotiators' motivation to engage in such thorough information processing is influenced by their position in the group. Whereas prototypical representatives feel secure about their membership, peripheral representatives have a less certain position. We propose that peripheral representatives are therefore more attentive and responsive to information that may be relevant to the negotiation than prototypical representatives, but only when they are accountable to their <b>constituents.</b> <b>Data</b> from 4 experiments showed that peripheral representatives reported higher information-processing motivation (Experiment 1), bought and recalled more information (Experiment 2), exhibited greater sensitivity to emotional expressions of the outgroup representative (Experiment 3), and attained more integrative ("win-win") agreements (Experiment 4) than prototypical representatives, but only when they were accountable.

Because PM 2. 5 may be related to both constituent concentration and health out-comes, constituents that are more strongly correlated with PM 2. 5 may appear more closely related to adverse health outcomes than other constituents even if they are not inherently more toxic. Therefore, it is important to properly account for potential confounding by PM 2. 5 in these analyses. Usually, confounding is due to a factor that is distinct from the exposure and outcome. However, because constituents are a component of PM 2. 5, stan-dard covariate adjustment is not appropriate. Similar considerations apply to source-apportioned concentrations and studies assessing either short-term or long-term impacts of <b>constituents.</b> Using <b>data</b> on 18 <b>constituents</b> and <b>data</b> from 1, 060 patients admitted to a Boston medical center with ischemic stroke in 2003 – 2008, the authors illustrate several options for modeling the association between constituents and health outcomes that account for the impact of PM 2. 5.
