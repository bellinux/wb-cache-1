He also designed the Museum of Islamic Art in Doha, Qatar at the request of the Al-Thani Family. Although it was originally planned for the <b>corniche</b> road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo.|$|E
5|$|Portions of {{the film}} were shot {{on a beach in}} Qantab, on the <b>corniche</b> in Qurum, and at the Shangri-La's Barr Al Jissah Resort & Spa in Muscat. When {{director}} Milan Luthria became ill with a virus, shooting was postponed for three days. To make up the lost time Luthria persuaded Kumar to work on two consecutive Sundays, {{the first time he had}} worked on a Sunday since Priyadarshan's 2006 Bhagam Bhag. The remainder {{of the film}} was shot on location in Khala, on the Sassoon Docks and at Mukesh Mills in Mumbai. The shoot was wrapped up by January 2013.|$|E
25|$|Due to this {{planning}} a modern city with tall offices, apartment buildings, broad boulevards and busy shops is present. Principal thoroughfares are the <b>Corniche,</b> Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Abu Dhabi {{is known in}} the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. The design {{of the inner city}} roads and main roads are quite organised. Starting from the <b>Corniche,</b> all horizontal streets are oddly numbered, while all vertical streets are evenly numbered. Thus, the <b>Corniche</b> is Street #1, Khalifa is Street #3, Hamdan is Street #5, Electra street is Street #7 and so on. Conversely, Salam Street is St #8.|$|E
25|$|Football and cricket {{are very}} popular in the city. Many youth play {{football}} in parking lots nearby <b>corniche</b> because of the pleasant environment and enough space. Cricket is also popular because of South Asian expats. There have been many small competitions conducted between small-time football and cricket teams.|$|E
25|$|An {{auction of}} Savile's {{possessions}} {{was conducted at}} the Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds, on 30 July 2012, with the proceeds going to charity. His silver Rolls-Royce <b>Corniche</b> convertible was sold for £130,000 to an Internet bidder. The vehicle's number plate, JS 247, featured the original medium wave wavelength used by BBC Radio 1 (247 metres).|$|E
25|$|The {{battle was}} {{fought for the}} {{possession}} of a small hotel complex adjacent to the gilded <b>Corniche</b> seafront area on the Mediterranean, in the north-western corner of the downtown district of Beirut. It quickly spread {{to other areas of}} central Beirut. The often fierce battles that ensued were fought with heavy exchanges of rocket and artillery fire from the various hotel rooftops and rooms. Sniper fire was commonly utilized.|$|E
25|$|The rocky Western Al Hajar Mountains {{dominate}} {{the landscape of}} Muscat. The city lies on the Arabian Sea along the Gulf of Oman {{and is in the}} proximity of the strategic Straits of Hormuz. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the port-district of Muttrah, with its <b>corniche</b> and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum and porting.|$|E
25|$|The clashes {{began on}} the evening of Sunday 18 May, {{beginning}} first at the GNC building, before then spreading to Hay Al-Akwakh, particularly {{in the area of the}} steel bridge on the Airport road. Missiles were also reported to have fallen close to the TV station on Ennasr Street. Heavy firing was also heard in the <b>Corniche</b> area on the way to Mitiga airbase. The clashes however died down by the late evening.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise {{a fine example of}} the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped <b>corniche,</b> doorway or moulded window frame. Among the finest is the madrassa al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.|$|E
25|$|The Al Sultan Qaboos Street {{forms the}} main artery of Muscat, running west-to-east through the city. The street {{eventually}} becomes Al Nahdah Street near Al Wattayah. Several inter-city roads such as Nizwa Road and Al Amrat Road, intersect with Al Sultan Qaboos Road (in Rusail and Ruwi, respectively). Muttrah, with the Muscat Harbour, <b>Corniche,</b> and Mina Qaboos {{is located in}} the north-eastern coastline of the city, adjacent to the Gulf of Oman. Other coastal districts of Muscat include Darsait, Mina Al Fahal, Ras Al Hamar, Al Qurum Heights, Al Khuwair and Al Seeb. Residential and commercial districts further inland include Al Hamriyah, Al Wadi Al Kabir, Ruwi, Al Wattayah, Madinat Qaboos, Al Azaiba and Al Ghubra.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} devastated during the 1952 riots {{known as the}} Cairo Fire or Black Saturday, which saw the {{destruction}} of nearly 700 shops, movie theatres, casinos and hotels in Downtown Cairo. The British departed Cairo following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, but the city's rapid growth {{showed no signs of}} abating. Seeking to accommodate the increasing population, President Gamal Abdel Nasser redeveloped Maidan Tahrir and the Nile <b>Corniche,</b> and improved the city's network of bridges and highways. Meanwhile, additional controls of the Nile fostered development within Gezira Island and along the city's waterfront. The metropolis began to encroach on the fertile Nile Delta, prompting the government to build desert satellite towns and devise incentives for city-dwellers to move to them.|$|E
25|$|The Muscat area is well {{serviced}} by paved roads and dual-carriageway connects most major {{cities and towns}} in the country. Since November 2015, Public transportation in Muscat has been revamped with a bus network connecting most important {{parts of the city}} with a modern Mwasalat (earlier Oman National Transport Company (ONTC) buses. Mwasalat buses were procured from VDL Company of The Netherlands and they have several hi-tech features. Route 1 (Ruwi-Mabela) serves people travelling major shopping destinations (Oman Avenues Mall, Muscat Grand Mall, Qurum City Centre, Muscat City Centre, Markaz al Bhaja) and Muscat Airport. Route 2 (Ruwi-Wadi Kabir) serves the residential and industrial district of Wadi Kabir. Route 3 (Ruwi-Wadi Adei) serves the downmarket residential belt of Wadi Adei. Route 4 (Ruwi-Mattrah) serves the tourist destination of Muttrah <b>Corniche,</b> Al Alam Palace, National Museum and Port Sultan Qaboos. Route 5 (Ruwi-Amerat) serves the rapidly developing Amerat suburb. Route 6 (Ruwi-SQU) serves the student community of Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and the office commuters of Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM).|$|E

To the right of the scene depicting Jesus carrying the cross is the [...] "mise au tombeau"; Jesus being prepared for burial. On the lower <b>corniche</b> of the north west facing side, we commence with Jesus in discussion with the lawyers, John the Baptist baptizing [...] Jesus (he wears an animal skin) whilst an angel holds Jesus' robe, Satan presenting bread to Jesus in the [...] "temptation" [...] scene and finally Jesus praying in Gethsemane with John the Evangelist asleep at his side.|$|E
2500|$|Some Republic of Ireland number plates {{have been}} {{registered}} in various motor tax {{offices in the}} UK.

2500|$|The 80 riders {{remaining}} in the race took off at 1:07 PM to the Doha <b>Corniche</b> where {{they would have to}} cover five laps of the traditional final circuit. Facing the wind, the pack remained bunched until the first intermediate sprint in Al Wakra (km 38.5) won by Kirsten Wild ahead of Chloe Hosking and Ellen van Dijk. Just after the sprint, nine ladies managed to break away: MacLean, Rowney, Small, Guderzo, Brand, Longo Borghini, Valsecchi, Cordon, Olds and Glaesser. Their lead grew to 1’10" [...] at km 55 before dropping down once on the final circuit. The second bonus sprint at the 2nd crossing of the line (km 62.5) was claimed by Glaesser ahead of Cordon and Olds, while the pack remained 48” adrift.

2500|$|At {{the foot}} of Jesus' cross there is a statue {{depicting}} a kneeling Mary Magdalene. In front of her is the Resurrection scene with Jesus emerging from his Sarcophagus, his right hand raised and giving a blessing and a [...] "Resurrection cross" [...] or [...] "Triumphal cross" [...] in his left hand. A kneeling soldier sleeps on the right hand side of the tomb and another soldier, also sleeping, sits to the right, holding on to a musket, an anachronism {{explained by the fact}} that this part of the scene was by Larhantec. Behind him two other soldiers look on. On the right of the resurrection scene we see Jesus being mocked and ridiculed by four soldiers ("Christ aux outrages") and then a scene showing Jesus being flogged. Next to the depiction of Mary Magdalene at {{the foot of}} the cross is a pietà and around this are the figure of a standing man and John the Evangelist. On the other side of the cross from the pietả, there is an [...] "Ecce Homo". To the right of the pietả there is a depiction of the open mouth of Hell Harrowing of Hell. [...] Adam has already emerged but a demon is stopping Eve from joining him. [...] On the lower <b>corniche</b> the depiction of Jesus' arrest includes Judas Iscariot shown holding a purse, St Peter asleep by the side of a colleague then Peter drawing his sword, Malchus struck and falling to the ground and Judas embracing Jesus.

60|$|The path {{across the}} Col has been already described. It winds along {{the margin of}} the little lake, passing the site of the ancient temple of Jupiter at the {{distance}} of a few hundred yards from the convent. Sweeping past the northern extremity of the little basin, where it crosses the frontiers of Piedmont, it cuts the ragged wall of rock, and, after winding en <b>corniche</b> for a short distance by the edge of a fearful ravine, it plunges at once towards the plains of Italy.|$|E
60|$|The {{seafaring}} settlements {{are connected}} with the interior by breakneck paths and by rude steps, slippery with green moss. The people seem to delight in standing, like wild goats, upon the dizziest of 'jumpy' peaks; we see boys perched like birds upon impossible places, and men walking along precipice-faces apparently pathless. The villages are joined to one another by roads which attempt to follow the sea-line; the chasms are spanned by the flimsiest wooden bridges, and the cliff is tunnelled or cut into a <b>corniche.</b>|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{she could}} be moved, they took her to Genoa, where she revived enough {{to believe that she}} should be well if she were at home again, and to win from her parents a promise to take her to Hillside as soon as the spring winds were over. So anxious was she that, as soon as there was any safety in travelling, the party began moving northwards, going by sea to Marseilles to avoid the <b>Corniche,</b> so early in the year. There were many fluctuations, and it was only her earnest yearning for home and strong {{resolution}} that could have made her parents persevere; but at last they were at Hillside, just after Whitsuntide, in the last week of May.|$|E
60|$|Then {{comes the}} old Gurgulho Fort--a dwarf square, partly {{thatched}} and {{converted into a}} private dwelling. It lies below Signal Hill, with its dwarf ruined tower, a lumpy parasitic crater whose western slopes have been ruined by disforesting. Between the two runs the New Road, which owes its being to the grape-famine of 1852. It is the 'Rotten Row' of Funchal, where horses tread the earth instead of skating and sliding over the greased pebbles; and where fair amazons charge upon you like Indian irregular cavalry. Five miles long, {{it is the only}} level line of any extent in Madeira, and it wants but one thing--prolongation.

6000|$|If {{the little}} {{embankments}} above the <b>Corniche</b> road, which Dr. King {{saw in the}} act of formation by the accumulation of disintegrated and rolled worm-castings, were to become confluent along horizontal lines, ledges would be formed. Each embankment would tend to extend laterally by the lateral extension of the arrested castings; and animals grazing on a steep slope would almost certainly make use of every prominence at nearly the same level, and would indent the turf between them; and such intermediate indentations would again arrest the castings. An irregular ledge when once formed would also tend to become more regular and horizontal by some of the castings rolling laterally from the higher to the lower parts, which would thus be raised. Any projection beneath a ledge would not afterwards receive disintegrated matter from above, and would tend to be obliterated by rain and other atmospheric agencies. [...] There is some analogy between the formation, as here supposed, of these ledges, and that of the ripples of wind-drifted sand as described by Lyell. {78} ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{never knew}} any man so {{superior}} {{to himself as}} poor James Walter. [...] The best of him only came as a vision, like Corsica from the <b>Corniche.</b> He never gave his measure either morally or intellectually. The curse was on him. Even his friends did not know him but by fits. I have passed hours {{with him when he}} was so wise, good, and sweet, that I never knew the like of it in any other. And for a beautiful good humour he had no match. I remember breaking in upon him once with a whole red-hot story (in my worst manner), pouring words upon him by the hour about some truck not worth an egg that had befallen me; and suddenly, some half hour after, finding that the sweet fellow had some concern of his own of infinitely greater import, that he was patiently and smilingly waiting to consult me on. It sounds nothing; but the courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect. It makes me rage to think how few knew him, and how many had the chance to sneer at their better.|$|E
60|$|Passing {{from the}} frontier, we still {{followed}} {{the margin of}} the lake, until we reached a spot where its waters trickled, by a low passage, southward. The path took the same direction, pierced the barrier of low rocks, and came out on the verge of the southern declivity, which was still more precipitous than that on the other side. For a short distance the path ran en <b>corniche</b> along {{the margin of the}} descent, until it reached the remotest point {{of what might be called}} the col, whose southern edge is irregular, and then it plunged, by the most practicable descent which could be found, towards its Italian destination. When at this precise point our distance from the convent may have been half a mile, which, of course, is the breadth of the col. We could see more than half a league down the brown gulf below, but no sign of vegetation was visible. Above, around, beneath, wherever the eye rested--the void of the heavens, the distant peaks of snow, the lake, the convent and its accessories excepted--was dark, frowning rock, of the colour of iron rust. As all the buildings, even to the roofs, were composed of this material, they produced little to relieve the dreary monotony.|$|E
6000|$|... § 6. It is {{therefore}} with peculiar interest, as bearing {{on our own}} proper subject, that we must examine Dante's conception of the rocks of the eighth circle. And first, as to general tone of color: from {{what we have seen}} of the love of the mediæval for bright and variegated color, we might guess that his chief cause of dislike to rocks would be, in Italy, their comparative colorlessness. With hardly an exception, the range of the Apennines is composed of a stone of which some special account is given hereafter in the chapters on Materials of Mountains, and of which one peculiarity, there noticed, is its monotony of hue. Our slates and granites are often of very lovely colors; but the Apennine limestone is so grey and toneless, that I know not any mountain district so utterly melancholy as those which are composed of this rock, when unwooded. Now, as far as I can discover from the internal evidence in his poem, nearly all Dante's mountain wanderings had been upon this ground. He had journeyed once or twice among the Alps, indeed, but seems to have been impressed chiefly by the road from Garda to Trent, and that along the <b>Corniche,</b> both of which are either upon those limestones, or a dark serpentine, which shows hardly any color till it is polished. It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen rocky scenery of the finely colored kind, aided by the Alpine mosses: I do not know the fall at Forli (Inferno, xvi. 99.), but every other scene to which he alludes is among these Apennine limestones; and when he wishes to give the idea of enormous mountain size, he names Tabernicch and Pietra-pana,--the one clearly chosen only {{for the sake of the}} last syllable of its name, in order to make a sound as of cracking ice, with the two sequent rhymes of the stanza,--and the other is an Apennine near Lucca.|$|E
