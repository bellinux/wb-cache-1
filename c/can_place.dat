5|$|Catastrophic injuries—defined {{as serious}} {{injury to the}} spine, spinal cord, or brain—and {{fatalities}} are uncommon in football; both have become less common since the 1970s, although {{a small number of}} them still occur each year.

Despite the decrease in catastrophic injuries, a greater number of NFL players have reported major injuries and shortened careers since the 1970s, in part due to the increasing size and speed of players and the use of artificial turf.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion {{is not only the}} archetypal cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity <b>can</b> <b>place</b> its trust. However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and books written by skeptics.|$|E
