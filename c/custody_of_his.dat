5|$|Louis XVIII {{had been}} {{vying for the}} <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> niece Marie-Thérèse since her release from the Temple Tower in December 1795. He succeeded when Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to {{relinquish}} his custody of her in 1796. She had been staying in Vienna with her Habsburg relatives since January 1796. Louis XVIII moved to Blankenburg in the Duchy of Brunswick after his departure from Verona. He lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment over a shop.

5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Brock's {{successor}} at Detroit, however, fared much worse. Colonel Henry Procter {{faced an}} attack from a resurrected American Army of the Northwest under future President William Henry Harrison. Harrison {{set out to}} retake Detroit, but a detachment of his army was defeated at Frenchtown on 22 January 1813. Procter, displaying poor judgement, left the prisoners in the <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> First Nations allies, who proceeded to execute an indeterminate number of them. Subsequent American victories allowed Harrison to attempt another invasion of Canada, {{which led to the}} Battle of the Thames on 5 October 1813. After a successful American charge, Procter's forces turned and fled, leaving Tecumseh and his American Indian troops to fight alone. They fought on, eventually being defeated. Perhaps of more importance to the British, at this battle Tecumseh died, and their alliance with the American Indians effectively ended.|$|E

5|$|Charles {{perceived}} the unrest in Scotland as a rebellion against his authority, precipitating the First Bishops' War in 1639. Charles {{did not seek}} subsidies from the English Parliament to wage war, but instead raised an army without parliamentary aid and marched to Berwick-upon-Tweed, {{on the border of}} Scotland. Charles's army did not engage the Covenanters as the king feared the defeat of his forces, whom he believed to be significantly outnumbered by the Scots. In the Treaty of Berwick, Charles regained <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Scottish fortresses and secured the dissolution of the Covenanters' interim government, albeit at the decisive concession that both the Scottish Parliament and General Assembly of the Scottish Church were called.|$|E
5|$|In August 1956, Paul Mansfield sought <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter, {{alleging that}} Jayne was an unfit mother because she {{appeared}} nude in Playboy.

5|$|In June 1139 {{a knight}} was killed during {{a fight in}} Oxford between a party of Roger of Salisbury's men {{and a group of}} noblemen. The king ordered Roger to attend his court to explain the {{circumstances}} of the incident and to surrender <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> castles, which Roger refused to do, resulting in his and Alexander's arrest; Roger's other nephew, Nigel, evaded capture. Another possible explanation for the arrests is offered by the Gesta Stephani, a contemporary chronicle, which reported the king's fear that Roger and his nephews were plotting to hand their castles to the Empress Matilda. Stephen may alternatively have been attempting to assert his rights over the castles, and demonstrate his authority over powerful subjects. Alexander was imprisoned in Oxford, in conditions described by some medieval chroniclers as bad.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided with a lawyer and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. <b>Custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{married his}} high school girlfriend Siohvaughn Funches in 2002. He filed for a divorce in 2007, which was granted in 2010 after a lengthy and acrimonious court battle.

Wade also raises a nephew, Dahveon (born 2002), who {{is the son of}} Wade's sister Deanna. Wade began dating actress Gabrielle Union in 2009. According to Wade, he and Union briefly split up at some point early in 2013 due to career demands. During that time, Wade and {{longtime}} friend Aja Metoyer conceived a son, Xavier Zechariah Wade (born November 10, 2013). Wade and Union became engaged in December 2013, and married on August 30, 2014, in Miami.|$|E
50|$|Gibson {{was born}} in Simla, British India, the son of Alexander James Gibson and his wife Leonora ("Nora") Mary Gibson. At the time <b>of</b> <b>his</b> birth, his father was {{an officer in the}} Imperial Indian Forestry Service, {{becoming}} the Chief Conservator of Forests for the Simla Hill States in 1922. In 1924, when he was six, his parents separated.

5|$|When the Prince of Wales {{applied to}} Parliament for an {{increase}} in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness, offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, but George reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole. Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the birth of his daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off {{in the middle of the}} night. George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> children.|$|E
5|$|William Rufus {{crossed into}} Normandy {{to take the}} war to Robert in 1094, and when {{progress}} stalled, called upon Henry for assistance. Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly {{at the request of}} the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England. Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court. In 1095 Pope Urban II called the First Crusade, encouraging knights from across Europe to join. Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> part of the Duchy in exchange. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death in}} 1164, Hugh passed into royal service, while also serving as seneschal {{to the new}} Earl of Surrey, Hamelin, the illegitimate {{half-brother}} of King Henry II. On the Cartae Baronum in 1166 he held one knight's fee in the barony of Giffard. In 1167 Hugh paid a fine that is recorded in the pipe rolls for the <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> nephew's lands at Tickhill. In 1170, he {{was present at the}} coronation of Henry the Young King in June at Westminster Abbey, when Henry II had his heir crowned as a king during the elder Henry's lifetime. During the Revolt of 1173–74 by King Henry's sons, Hugh was a partisan of the king. The revolt was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons to gain some power during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 the revolt had been defeated by the king. During the Revolt, Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces, but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression.|$|E
50|$|When King John {{came to the}} throne, he gave Ros the barony <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great-grandmother's father, Walter d'Espec. Soon {{afterwards}} he was deputed one {{of those}} to escort William the Lion, his father-in-law, into England, to swear fealty to King John. Some years later, Robert de Ros assumed the habit of a monk, whereupon the <b>custody</b> <b>of</b> all <b>his</b> lands and Castle Werke (Wark), in Northumberland, were committed to Philip d'Ulcote, but he soon returned and {{about a year later}} he was High Sheriff of Cumberland.|$|R
50|$|Pavlović {{was born}} in Einsiedeln, Switzerland, where her father worked.
