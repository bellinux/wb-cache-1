5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in <b>children</b> <b>has</b> been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends <b>children</b> <b>had,</b> and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age had more friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends and relatively old <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted <b>children</b> also <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively old friends and low-accepted <b>children</b> <b>had</b> more relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if <b>children</b> <b>had</b> at least one friend, they had more positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores.

5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency {{to the search}} for Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven <b>children,</b> <b>has</b> rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E
