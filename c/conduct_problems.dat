These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD.

50|$|Scoring for the NCBRF-TIQ {{is similar}} to the NCBRF. However, given that the NCBRF was {{developed}} for youth with developmental disabilities and the NCBRF-TIQ was designed for typically developing children, {{it is not surprising that}} factor analysis derived somewhat different behavioral constructs. Section II (Positive/Social behaviors) is not broken up into subscales; its items resolve onto one subscale that reflects “Social Competence.” Higher scores in Section II would indicate greater social competence. Section III of the NCBRF-TIQ has six subscales: an Overly Sensitive subscale, an Oppositional subscale, a <b>Conduct</b> <b>Problem</b> subscale, a Hyperactive subscale, an Inattentive subscale and a Withdrawn/Dysphoric subscale. Higher subscale scores indicate greater expression of these behavioral traits. Section III of the NCBRF-TIQ allows two superordinate domains to be computed: one for Disruptive Behavior and one for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Scores from the Oppositional subscale and the <b>Conduct</b> <b>Problem</b> subscale are summed to produce a total score for Disruptive Behavior (D-Total). Scores from the Hyperactive subscale and the Inattentive subscale are summed to produce a total score for ADHD (ADHD-Total). High scores within these subscales could suggest a potential for diagnosing these disorders.|$|R
5000|$|There {{may also}} be a subtype of bully that is high in callous and unemotional traits (CU). CU traits include some of the {{discussed}} deficits in EI such as lack of empathy, as well as other traits such as a lack of guilt, shallow capacity for emotion and poor behavioral modulation when faced with punishment. [...] Given that children who bully often have <b>conduct</b> <b>problems,</b> and CU traits are often co-occurring with <b>conduct</b> <b>problems,</b> Viding et al., (2009) investigated the relationship between CU and bullying behavior. Given that previous research suggests children with <b>conduct</b> <b>problems</b> fall into subtypes of those with high CU traits and those without, it was possible that this creates a distinction among bullies. [...] Higher CU was independently correlated to direct bullying, which is associated with lack of empathy, while indirect bullying is not. [...] When combined with <b>conduct</b> <b>problems,</b> CU increased the risk of direct and indirect bullying behaviors. Bullies high in CU traits will probably be resistant to many of the interventions successful with bullies who are not. Although a defining characteristic of CU is a lack of empathy, which overlaps with bullies deficits in empathy as highlighted above, the other characteristics of the concept would make bullies high in CU less malleable than those who simply have lower EI.|$|E
