6000|$|... § XVI. We {{have much}} studied and much perfected, of late, the great civilized {{invention}} {{of the division of}} labor; only we give it a false name. It is not, truly speaking, the labor that is divided; but the men:--Divided into mere segments of men--broken into small fragments and crumbs of life; so that all the little piece of intelligence that is left in a man is not enough to make a pin, or a nail, but exhausts itself in making the point of a pin, or the head of a nail. Now it is a good and desirable thing, truly, to make many pins in a day; but if we could only see with what <b>crystal</b> <b>sand</b> their points were polished,--sand of human soul, much to be magnified before it can be discerned for what it is,--we should think there might be some loss in it also. And the great cry that rises from all our manufacturing cities, louder than their furnace blast, is all in very deed for this,--that we manufacture everything there except men; we blanch cotton, and strengthen steel, and refine sugar, and shape pottery; but to brighten, to strengthen, to refine, or to form a single living spirit, never enters into our estimate of advantages. And all the evil to which that cry is urging our myriads can be met only in one way: not by teaching nor preaching, for to teach them is but to show them their misery, and to preach to them, if we do nothing more than preach, is to mock at it. It can be met only by a right understanding, on the part of all classes, of what kinds of labor are good for men, raising them, and making them happy; by a determined sacrifice of such convenience, or beauty, or cheapness as is to be got only by the degradation of the workman; and by equally determined demand for the products and results of healthy and ennobling labor.|$|E

30|$|Three {{types of}} crystals: druses, {{prismatic}} <b>crystals</b> and <b>crystal</b> <b>sands</b> were observed. Druses {{were identified in}} the leaves and stems of six species of studied plants. In contrast to druses, <b>crystal</b> <b>sands</b> and prismatic <b>crystals</b> were rare. Prismatic crystals were observed in the leaf mesophlly cells of both Nerium oleander and Cynanchum acutum. However, <b>crystal</b> <b>sands</b> were observed only in the pith tissue of Humulus lupulus. On the other hand, leaves and stems of Chelidonium majus, Aristolochia clematitis and Hypericum perforatum were devoid of crystals.|$|R

Calcium carbonate is found originally in cell walls and as cellular mineral as well, although in smaller amounts than the oxalates [10]. The calcium oxalates have recurrent shapes, the most common being equant to short prismatic crystals, round polycrystalline druses, elongated fibrous crystals known as raphides and styloids, and aggregates of submicrometric crystallites, called <b>crystal</b> <b>sand</b> [10, 19].|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, Humulus lupulus which was {{reported}} as non-toxic (Baytop 1999) examined {{as a reference}} and {{it was found that}} it contains druse crystals in the mesophyll cells of its leaves and druses and <b>crystal</b> <b>sands</b> in the pith cells of its stem. Wu and Kuo-Huang (1997) have studied calcium crystals in the leaves of Humulus scandens and they have reported only calcium carbonate crystals in its leaves. The differences in the types of calcium crystals between these two different species of the genus Humulus is not surprising. Because, although crystal formation in plants is mostly under genetic control (Ilarslan et al. 2001), the location, size and other properties of crystals may be effected by physical, chemical and biological conditions such as light, temperature, pH, ion concentration and herbivory (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Molano-Flores 2001; Kuo-Huang et al. 2007). Moreover, features of calcium crystals in the leaves of Humulu s may be useful in intra genus classification.|$|R

40|$|Studies on tannins, starch {{grains and}} crystal {{types in the}} {{vegetative}} organs of eight species of Indigofera were carried out using a microscope.

The wood is ring porous, with moderately wide vessels bearing simple perforation plates and alternate pits with some grooves interconnecting slitlike pit apertures. Imperforate tracheary elements are fiber-tracheids with vestigial borders on pits or libriform fibers; vasicentric tracheids (reported for Nolanaceae for the first time) are present in varying numbers. Axial parenchyma is vasicentric scanty (sometimes absent), sometimes with tangential bands that may be terminal in part. Rays are both multiseriate and uniseriate; ray cells are mostly erect. <b>Crystal</b> <b>sand</b> occurs in some ray cells and some axial parenchyma. The sum of features mark Nolanaceae as very close to Solanaceae. Wood of Nolana varies in xeromorphy; lower degrees of xeromorphy {{may be explained by}} succulence related to maritime habitat or to ephemeral nature of stems. The erect nature of ray cells and a decrease in vessel element length are indicators of paedomorphosis and thereby herbaceous ness of Nolanaceae...|$|E

40|$|Ectomycorrhizal fungi are {{ubiquitous}} in forest ecosystems, benefitting plants principally {{by increasing the}} uptake of water and nutrients such as calcium from the soil. Previous work has demonstrated accumulation of crystallites in eucalypt ectomycorrhizas, but detailed morphological and chemical characterization of these crystals has not been performed. In this work, cross sections of acetic acid-treated and cleared ectomycorrhizal fragments were visualized by polarized light microscopy to evaluate the location of crystals within cortical root cells. Ectomycorrhizal sections were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive x-ray (EDS) microprobe analysis. The predominant forms of crystals were <b>crystal</b> <b>sand</b> (granules) and concretions. Calcium, carbon and oxygen were detected by EDS as constituent elements and similar elemental profiles were observed between both crystal morphologies. All analyzed crystalline structures were characterized as calcium oxalate crystals.

30|$|Although the shape, {{size and}} number of {{crystals}} show variations among taxa, they have been classified into five main groups based on their morphology: as prism, druses, styloids, raphides and <b>crystal</b> <b>sand</b> (Webb 1999). Various physical, chemical and biological parameters such as light, temperature, pH, ion concentration and herbivory may affect the location, size and other properties of crystals in plants (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Molano-Flores 2001; Kuo-Huang et al. 2007; Meriç 2009). However, many authors have stated that crystal formation within the cell is under genetic control (Ilarslan et al. 2001). Thus the shape and location of the crystals within a taxon are often very specific and may be represented as a taxonomic character (Genua and Hillson 1985; Prychid and Rudall 1999; Lersten and Horner 2000). Furthermore, {{the presence or absence}} of crystals may represent useful taxonomic characters and also be used for understanding the evolutionary relationships of plant species (Franceschi and Horner 1980; Prychid and Rudall 1999). For example, by considering both morphological and molecular characteristics and the distribution of calcium oxalate crystals in some taxa, Rudall and Chase (1996) have shown that the genera formerly included in Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu lato may belong to three different families: Xanthorrhoeaceae sensu stricto, Lomandraceae and Dasypogonaceae (Prychid and Rudall 1999).|$|E

To {{contribute}} to the knowledge about medicinal plants, a microscopic analysis was accomplished to describe the main anatomical characters of root, stem, petiole and leaf blade of D. ambrosioides and histochemical tests were performed on the leaf blade. Cross-sections were obtained, by hand, for microscopic analysis of root, stem, petiole and leaf blade; to the leaf blade were still made paradermal sections, scanning electron microscopy analysis, maceration and histochemical tests. The main characters useful in the identification of the plant were: anomalous secondary thickening in the root and stem; presence of idioblasts containing <b>crystal</b> <b>sand</b> in the root, stem, petiole and leaf blade; in these there are also idioblasts with druses; presence of non-glandular and glandular trichomes in the stem, petiole and leaf blade; stomata on the stem, petiole and leaf blade, identified in these as anomocytic and anisocytic; dorsiventral mesophyll and collateral vascular bundles. Maceration revealed that the vessel elements are helical type.

The biominerals were identified either as CaC 2 O 4. 2 H 2 O (weddellite) or as CaC 2 O 4. H 2 O (whewellite).

The chemical nature of these deposits was assessed by infrared spectroscopy. The crystal morphology of the crystals was visualized by both conventional light and scanning electron microscopy. Weddellite druses were made up of tetragonal crystallites, whereas those from whewellite were most often recognized by their acute points and general star-like shape. These studies clearly demonstrated that members from the main traditional subfamilies of the Cactaceae family could synthesize different chemical forms of calcium oxalate, suggesting a definite but different genetic control.
