25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the <b>city.</b> <b>I</b> am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
500|$|... "Under the Bridge" [...] {{has been}} covered several times since its release in 1992. The song was first {{transcribed}} in 1994 by the a cappella group The Flying Pickets from their album The Original Flying Pickets: Volume 1. Notable jazz musician Frank Bennett covered the song by fusing elements of big bands and bebop in his 1996 album Five O'Clock Shadow. Hip hop artist Mos Def included the beginning verse of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] {{in the song}} [...] "Brooklyn," [...] from his 1999 record Black on Both Sides. He, however, changed the line [...] "the <b>city</b> <b>I</b> live in, the City of Angels", which refers to Los Angeles, to [...] "the <b>city</b> <b>I</b> live in is beautiful Brooklyn," [...] to match his song's premise. Tony Hadley covered the song on his 1995 album Obsession. Britain's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra has modified [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] at several concerts—they perform various rock pieces combined into a single orchestral ensemble, often including the Chili Peppers' hit.|$|E

500|$|The above opening {{sentence}} {{of the novel}} has a symbolic function: Russian critic Vadim K.

Dostoyevsky {{was among the first}} to recognize the symbolic possibilities of city life and imagery drawn from the <b>city.</b> <b>I.</b> F. I.

500|$|... the {{overcrowding}} of {{the city}} is caused, first by the natural increase in the population and area of the surrounding district; secondly, by the influx of provincial passengers by the great railways North of London, and the obstruction experienced in the streets by omnibuses and cabs coming from their distant stations, to bring the provincial travellers to and from the heart of the <b>city.</b> <b>I</b> point next to the vast increase of what I may term the migratory population, the population {{of the city}} who now oscillate between the country and the city, who leave the City of London every afternoon and return every morning.|$|E

500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, but hopefully I can prove them wrong.

[...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E

A writer in the Oregonian said the fountain [...] "is an abstraction of a mountain waterfall". Local architect Marcy McInelly said [...] "they were the first full realization of a theory about reflecting forces of nature but not mimicking natural forms. People came {{from all over the}} world to see them". Bob Gerding, who turned the First Regiment Armory Annex into the LEED Platinum-rated performing arts center, said that in 25 years, [...] "I hope [...] loved by the <b>city.</b> <b>I</b> hope people love to see plays there or have a meeting there or whatever, that it becomes just a cool thing in the city, like the Keller Fountain".|$|E
500|$|Homer's chants and his {{nickname}} [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] is {{a reference to}} American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy, who earned the nickname [...] "The Roar from Thirty-Four" [...] for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his arms. A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" [...] written by Henry Mancini. Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26-minute-long performance of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the game where Homer performs his first dance. Homer's line, [...] "Today, as I leave for Capital <b>City,</b> <b>I</b> consider myself the luckiest mascot {{on the face of}} the earth" [...] that he says in his farewell speech to the Springfield fans, is a reference to Lou Gehrig's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees. The song [...] "Capital City" [...] that Bennett sings over the closing credits is a parody of the 1980 song [...] "New York, New York".|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, {{playing at}} the Roseland Ballroom was always a dream of hers. She {{explained}} to John Seabrook of The New Yorker that [...] "It's basically the only room in the <b>city</b> <b>I</b> haven't played." [...] As a young girl, she could not afford tickets, but she did manage to win free tickets to a Franz Ferdinand show during her {{senior year of high}} school. Gaga recalled that she fell down during the show and got her nose broken, making her parents forbid her from visiting Roseland. After the singer's career took off with the release of debut album, The Fame (2008), she bypassed {{playing at the}} venue until its closure. Gaga revealed the official poster for the residency on March 18, 2014. The poster features an image of Gaga that was taken by a stranger in 2008 at the Lower East Side of New York City. According to Gaga: [...] "We found him and used that same photo for my Roseland poster." [...] The poster also includes a quote from Gaga taken when the photograph was taken, that reads: [...] "I'm Lady Gaga. A singer/songwriter. You're going to know me one day." ...|$|E

500|$|Over {{the night}} of September 9–10, the city {{witnessed}} an outbreak of hooliganism and looting. Some was rowdy behavior that scared respectable citizens, such as youths throwing rocks at streetcars and overturning the carts of street vendors. More overtly criminal activity included the smashing of store windows and looting their displays or setting off false fire alarms. Such activity was restricted to {{certain parts of the}} city and, according to the New York Times, [...] "throughout the greater part of the city the usual peace and quiet prevailed." [...] In the morning the mayor asked the governor to furnish a force of State Guards; Coolidge promptly agreed and eventually provided almost 5,000 men. Commissioner Curtis later praised the State Guards' performance in his Annual Report: [...] "The whole community is now aware of the effectiveness with which the Massachusetts State Guard worked when it came into the <b>city.</b> <b>I</b> cannot add anything to the universal chorus of commendation that has greeted their work." [...] The morning papers following the first night's violence were full of loud complaints and derogatory terms for the police: [...] "deserters", [...] "agents of Lenin." ...|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the <b>city</b> <b>I</b> live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to the place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E
500|$|Holby City {{has also}} been accused of medical inaccuracies. The British Medical Association denounced a January 2004 episode of the serial which portrayed organ {{donation}} being carried out despite withdrawal of consent by the patient's relatives. Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the Medical Ethics Committee stated: [...] "This simply would not happen, but its portrayal, even in a drama, is totally irresponsible and risks causing huge damage to the already struggling transplant programme." [...] The British Medical Association later opined that the show was giving viewers an unrealistic impression of resuscitation by typically presenting only two outcomes, death or total recovery. Andrew Thomson, a Dundee GP, deemed this [...] "a terrible distortion of the truth." [...] In a follow-up story for The Times, Vivienne Parry highlighted {{the fact that in}} reality, less than half of patients who require resuscitation survive the initial catastrophe and only a third of those live to leave hospital. At the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) conference in Bournemouth in April 2010, Holby City was accused of fostering unrealistic expectations of the NHS, encouraging patients to believe in miracles and fuelling compensation culture. Accident and Emergency nurse John Hill stated: [...] "In A it is sometimes a fact that sadly we cannot get people through the trauma they have received. Unfortunately, unlike in Holby <b>City,</b> <b>I</b> am a mere mortal and cannot perform miracles. But many relatives believe because of that, you can. And the injury lawyers assure them that if you don't they will get recompense for it." ...|$|E
