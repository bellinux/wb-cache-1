The receivers Sept. 27, 2011 report to the Nova Scotia Supreme Court stated there was little prospect of a significant return to creditors by pursuing a sale of the ship, which had $2.51 million in <b>charges</b> and <b>liens</b> against it by that time. The court-appointed receiver, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), concluded that Polar Star should be abandoned to Astican Shipyard, which was expected to pursue a sale through the Spanish courts. Martin Karlsen objected to abandoning the vessel, which was appraised at $8 million according to the receivers report and had insurance coverage for the damage repairs. However, any sale by the receiver was {{complicated by the fact}} that there was a hefty Spanish lien on the ship, which would also require costly sea trials before it could be recertified to sail. Two months later in November 2011, a potential buyer said the vessel had deteriorated to the point it could only be sold for scrap. This was disputed by the receiver who noted the vessel was still in dry-dock.|$|R
