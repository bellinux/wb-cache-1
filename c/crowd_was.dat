5|$|Following Spies' speech, the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born {{editor of the}} radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> so calm that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke {{for almost an hour}} before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Attendances at {{the ground}} have fluctuated over its hundred-year history. Its largest-ever <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> 24,424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City. In 2010, an average of 5,000 fans {{attended}} each home game. It is currently the biggest stadium in non-league football.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} about 1,500 men began marching towards the {{electric}} distribution center used to power the entire streetcar system, several blocks away from the terminal building. The police had maintained a heavy guard around the building during the ongoing strike and Sheriff Porttens had given orders to use firearms to disperse any attempt by the strikers to take the building. As the crowd neared the building, the police opened fire. Several were injured and the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> driven away.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> {{tearing down}} the fences (a <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> doing {{something}} as a unit), but the <b>crowd</b> <b>are</b> cheering wildly (many {{individual members of}} the <b>crowd</b> <b>are</b> {{doing the same thing}} independently of each other).|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have also}} found that <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> not simply {{collections}} of amateurs or hobbyists. Rather, <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> often professionally trained in a discipline relevant to a given crowdsourcing task and sometimes hold advanced degrees and many {{years of experience in}} the profession. Claiming that <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> amateurs, rather than professionals, is both factually untrue and may lead to marginalization of crowd labor rights.|$|R
2500|$|At the University of Chicago, Robert Park and Herbert Blumer {{agreed with}} the speculations of LeBon and other that <b>crowds</b> <b>are</b> indeed emotional. [...] But to them a <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> capable of any emotion, not only the {{negative}} ones of anger and fear.|$|R
5|$|Crowd {{effects for}} the gaming arena were {{recorded}} at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. During {{one of the}} Tron: Legacy panels, the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> given instruction via a large video screen while techs from Skywalker Sound recorded the performance. The audience performed chants and stomping effects similar to what is heard in modern sports arenas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hour}} before kick-off, the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> entertained by the bands of the Royal Engineers and the Chatham Naval Dockyard. Following the National Anthem, the players, match {{officials}} and club chairmen {{were introduced to}} King George V. The toss was then won by the Bolton captain Joe Smith. In contrast to the lengthy delays which marred Bolton's previous visit to Wembley, the match kicked off three minutes earlier than scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's 1937 British Home Championship {{match against}} England {{set a new}} world record for a {{football}} attendance. The Hampden Park <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> officially recorded as 149,415, though the true figure is unknown as {{a large number of}} additional fans gained unauthorised entry. This attendance was surpassed 13 years later by the decisive match of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, but remains a European record.|$|E
50|$|Far {{from the}} Madding <b>Crowd</b> <b>is</b> a 1915 British silent drama film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Laurence Trimble and starring Florence Turner, Henry Edwards and Malcolm Cherry. Trimble also adapted Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel for the screen. Far from the Madding <b>Crowd</b> <b>is</b> a lost film.|$|R
3000|$|The local crowd density {{alone does}} not allow for a {{complete}} assessment of the criticality of a situation. In addition to crowd density, the intention or behavior of a <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> required for a correct situational understanding. As an example, a high crowd density in a static <b>crowd</b> <b>is</b> less critical than a high crowd density exhibiting counter flow. This distinction is also evident in Table  1.

5|$|The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, {{the first}} unit {{to arrive in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north of the Capitol. Among the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> Clara Barton who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers had {{proposed}} playing Game 2 {{at night to}} allow a longer rest period following the travel from Milwaukee to Los Angeles. The Braves took issue with this {{prior to the start}} of the series, however, and NL president Warren Giles insisted the game be played during the day. The afternoon <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> 36,528, short of the over-90,000 seating capacity of the Coliseum.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo {{was the number of}} women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many of the women were dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E

5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired {{over the heads of the}} <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E
5|$|Coffin died on September 16, 1877 {{at around}} 2:30p.m. {{at his home}} in Avondale, Ohio. His funeral was held at the Friends Meeting House of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Daily Gazette {{reported}} that the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> too large to be accommodated indoors; hundreds had to remain outside. Four of Coffin's eight pallbearers were free blacks who had worked with him on the Underground Railroad. Coffin was interred in Cincinnati's Spring Grove Cemetery in an unmarked grave. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who died four years later on May 22, 1881, is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery as well.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{conditions}} in 1817 {{led to a}} group who became known as Blanketeers to organise a march from Manchester to London so they could petition the Prince Regent for parliamentary reform. A crowd of 25,000 including 5,000 men who intended to march gathered in St Peter's Fields. After the magistrates read the Riot Act, the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> dispersed by the King's Dragoon Guards. The ringleaders were arrested and subsequently released when serious charges against them were not forthcoming. In April 1819 three leading Blanketeers were convicted of sedition and conspiracy when witnesses alleged they had advocated the principal towns of the kingdom should elect representatives to a National Convention to demand their rights and if refused enforce them 'sword in hand' during a meeting in Stockport in September 1818.|$|E

5|$|George and {{his father}} sailed for England from The Hague on 16/27 September 1714 and arrived at Greenwich two days later. The {{following}} day, they formally entered London in a ceremonial procession. George was given the title of Prince of Wales. Caroline followed her husband to Britain in October with their daughters, while Frederick remained in Hanover to be brought up by private tutors. London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions of praise for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E

Kinsler said: The <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> full; I had the {{butterflies}} going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To {{go out there and}} face one of the best pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E
5|$|In early December 2014 it was {{announced}} that the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai would host the final of the Indian Super League. It was also announced that tickets for the final would be available online from 8 December 2014. On 18 December 2014, one day after the semi-finals had concluded, it was reported that a packed <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> expected for the final. According to the owner of the DY Patil Stadium, Vijay Patil, the stands during the Indian Super League final will be just as full as they were during the 2008 Indian Premier League Final.|$|E

This changed again when the parade continued south down Fifth and reached the entertainment district below 14 Street, where the <b>crowds</b> <b>were</b> once again hostile. The parade then continued across town to Cooper Union, where the paraders dispersed.|$|R
5|$|On 16 May, Morgan {{was in a}} {{position}} to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications between the various elements of the insurgency. The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical <b>crowd,</b> <b>was</b> hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} debates on the actual taking of the Bastille in 1789 has been {{the nature of the}} crowds that stormed the building. Hippolyte Taine argued in the late 19th century that the crowd {{consisted}} of unemployed vagrants, who acted without real thought; by contrast, the post-war left-wing intellectual George Rudé argued that the <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> dominated by relatively prosperous artisan workers. The matter was reexamined by Jacques Godechot in the post-war years; Godechot showing convincingly that, in addition to some local artisans and traders, at least half the crowd that gathered that day were, like the inhabitants of the surrounding faubourg, recent immigrants to Paris from the provinces. Godechot used this to characterise the taking of the Bastille as a genuinely national event of wider importance to French society.|$|E
5|$|Scotland {{have played}} five full {{international}} matches at Easter Road. These have been friendly matches against less attractive opposition where {{a relatively small}} <b>crowd</b> <b>was</b> expected, and it has therefore been unnecessary to play the match at Hampden Park. The Scotland under-21 team has also sometimes played matches at Easter Road, such as when Scotland played Iceland in the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship qualification play-offs. The most recent full international played at the stadium was a friendly match between Scotland and Qatar in June 2015. One full international was played at Easter Road that did not involve Scotland, a friendly match between South Korea and Ghana that was played {{in advance of the}} 2006 World Cup.|$|E
