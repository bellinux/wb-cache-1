5|$|An {{anthropomorphic}} cougar named Ozzie was the team's mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie {{came from}} the Class A Kane County Cougars minor league team, which had an extra mascot costume. The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during Ozzie's first season, team management decided to make him the permanent mascot. The original Ozzie costume was brown, but a new yellow costume was introduced in 1998. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. Ozzie was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> appearances during the 2014 to 2015 off-season.|$|E
